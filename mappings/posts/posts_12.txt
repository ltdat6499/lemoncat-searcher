There’s also new roles for Tom Cruise and Will Smith.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJ.J. ABRAMS AND LAWRENCE KASDAN CONFIRMED TO BE WRITING STAR WARS: EPISODE VII\n\nNormally, a screenwriter announcement would not be a week’s top story. But normally, movie news stories aren’t about Star Wars Episode VII. What we previously thought we knew about the Episode VII script was that it was being worked on by screenwriter Michael Arndt, whose filmography includes Toy Story 3 and Little Miss Sunshine. This week, Disney and Lucasfilm officially announced that director J.J. Abrams is also stepping in to work on the script with Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark, and cowrote The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Abrams has become a household name as director and producer of TV shows like LOST and Fringe, and movies like the two recent Star Trek films. However, Abrams’s career as screenwriter (which is more immediately relevant to this story) is mostly comprised of older, more obscure movies like Regarding Henry, Forever Young, Joy Ride, and Gone Fishin’.  So, if one truly wants to brush up on their Star Wars fan credentials, it looks like it’s time revisit wacky Joe Pesci buddy fishermen comedies (all one of them).  Have fun with that.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 DIRECTOR ROBERT ZEMECKIS TO ADAPT TOY SOLDIER DOCUMENTARY MARWENCOL\n\nThere are obviously bumpy spots in the filmography of Robert Zemeckis (they weren’t all Back to the Future, let’s just say), but to his credit, he’s always remained unpredictable.  And when those gambles pay off, we get movies like Contact, Cast Away and Beowulf.   Robert Zemeckis and Universal Pictures are teaming up to start development of a live action adaptation of the award-winning 2010 documentary Marwencol. That film told the story of Mark Hogancamp, who, following a brutal beating in 2000, constructed in his back yard a 1/6-scale toy soldier version of a Belgian town during World War II, populated by dolls representing himself, his family and friends, and the five men who attacked him. Zemeckis came to Universal Pictures with a screenplay already adapted by Caroline Thompson, whose past films include Edward Scissorhands, The Secret Garden, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Since there’s already a screenplay, there’s speculation that Robert Zemeckis might actually be planning on making Marwencol his next film. Unlike many other directors of his class (who are attached to multiple films for years, many of which never get made), it’s happened a few times in the past (like with Flight) that Zemeckis has begun filming movies people barely knew were even in development, only to find said movies in theaters just a year later. If Marwencol is indeed that close to happening, we should start hearing casting news in the next couple of months.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE AVATAR SEQUEL TRILOGY FINDS ITS “DARTH VADER” AND IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU…\n\nThis story may be surprising for anyone who saw Avatar (and if you haven’t yet, why are you reading this story?  It’s got spoilers!). Anyway, Avatar pretty much seemed to put the nails in the coffin, let’s say, for Stephen Lang’s antagonist character of Colonel Miles Quaritch, who was pierced repeatedly in the chest by the pointy ends of multiple N’avi arrows. Avatar is also, of course, a science fiction about people taking on alien forms using advanced technology, so maybe that leads us to the following news. Stephen Lang will be returning for the three Avatar sequels as what is being described as the “Darth Vader” of the franchise. James Cameron is deep in pre-production for the sequel trilogy, with filming not expected to start this time in October. 20th Century Fox is expected to release the first Avatar sequel sometime in December, 2016, with the third and fourth films following in the same month in 2017 ad 2018.\n\n\n\t\n#3 TIM BURTON! TIM BURTON! TIM BURTON! TO FINALLY DIRECT THE LONG AWAITED BEETLEJUICE SEQUEL\n\nThis year marked the 25th anniversary of the release of the 1988 supernatural comedy Beetlejuice, and it can feel to movie news writers like the last two decades have seen annual or bi-annual news stories about a Beetlejuice sequel happening… someday.  Sometimes, for these sort of things to turn around, certain types of events need to happen. For a studio like Warner Bros, the recent departure of prolific movie generator Legendary Pictures (to Universal) certainly could be seen as an impetus for revisiting long-lingering projects like Beetlejuice 2. And so, we can finally report that director Tim Burton is officially in talks with Warner Bros and The Geffen Company to direct a sequel to Beetlejuice.  Michael Keaton is also expected to reprise his performance as the title character. This development came after recent changes at 20th Century Fox concerning the adaptation of the book Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, which had been expected to be Tim Burton’s next film as director (after recently wrapping the biopic Big Eyes). There’s also speculation that Warner Bros was able to get Tim Burton to rethink Beetlejuice 2 at least partly as payback to the studio for the financial hit they took when Burton’s dream project Dark Shadows failed to do much for Warner Bros. There’s no word yet as to whether any other Beetlejuice costars (like Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, or Winona Ryder) might also return.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HELLRAISER TO BE RAISED FROM DEVELOPMENT HELL BY… NEARLY THE SAME PEOPLE?\n\nIt happens sometimes that a foreign film will be remade in English just a few years later by the film’s original director. It’s far less common for this to happen with films that are decades old, but British author-turned-director Clive Barker is not, in fact, a common filmmaker. And so, when Dimension Films starts filming of the long-in-development remake of the 1987 S&amp;M-influenced supernatural horror film Hellraiser, the movie will be directed by Clive Barker. In addition to making his directorial debut with that film, Clive Barker also wrote the original novella The Hellbound Heart that the movie adapted. Clive Barker won’t be alone in this revisit, however, as actor Doug Bradley will also be returning to Hellraiser in the remake, once again reprising his demonic character known as Pinhead. The world has changed a lot since 1987, and one would have to guess that the remake will reflect that. Back then, Hellraiser shocked audiences with its depictions of S&amp;M sex scenes, while next year, the world’s going to get a mom-friendly S&amp;M movie in Fifty Shades of Grey. There’s no production start date for the new Hellraiser yet. This one of the Fresh Developments because a) Clive Barker’s filmography is quite “Fresh,” and b) this is sort of an extreme example of how remakes of beloved genre classics should happen.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 ETHAN HAWKE RETEAMS WITH GATTACA DIRECTOR FOR A MOVIE ABOUT DRONES\n\nHollywood publicists are very much in the business of putting the best possible image on things (that is literally their job). And so, the headlines for stories in the Weekly Ketchup may sometimes seem to conflict with what we call “Rotten Ideas.” Take, for example, the news that Ethan Hawke is reuniting with director Andrew Niccol, with whom he made the 1997 sci-fi movie Gattaca. That movie has a “Fresh” rating of 82% on the RT Tomatometer, so what’s Rotten here? Well, it’s more understandable when we factor in the other four movies that Andrew Niccol has directed, only one of which in the last 15 years has been “Fresh” (Lord of War), versus three “Rotten” movies (S1m0ne, In Time, and this year’s The Host). Anyway, in the untitled thriller, Ethan Hawke will star as a fighter pilot who “becomes a Las Vegas-based drone pilot. He fights the Taliban by remote control for twelve hours a day, then goes home to the suburbs and feuds with his wife and kids for the other twelve. He starts to question his mission, and asking himself if he is creating more terrorists than he is killing in a war seemingly without end.” There’s a lot of meaty ripped-from-the-headlines material there, but mostly?  They lost this writer at “Ethan Hawke will star as a fighter pilot.”\n\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN WILL SMITH: SELLING TIME, AND THE TWO DIFFERENT INDEPENDENCE DAY SEQUEL SCRIPTS\n\nPeople get dazzled by big box office numbers, but this column is concerned with very different numbers. Will Smith, for example, is one of the most successful movie stars of all time. His RT Tomatometer, however, tells a different story. Did you know, for example, that of all the movies Will Smith has been credited with appearing in since 2007’s I Am Legend, only one (Men in Black III) is “Fresh” on the Tomatometer. Well, maybe things will turn around for Mr. Smith who is attached to star in the 20th Century Fox supernatural thriller called Selling Time. Smith will play “a man who is given a chance to relive the worst day of his life in exchange for seven years off his life expectancy.” The script comes from newcomer Dan McDermott, who is a former DreamWorks Television president who one day apparently decided, “what I really want to do is write movies.” That’s the new movie project that got Will Smith into the news this week, but the story that most people heard about was the one about how Roland Emmerich is developing two different scripts for the Independence Day sequel, depending upon whether or not they can get Will Smith to sign on to star. That one is also from 20th Century Fox, and ID Forever Part I is currently scheduled for release on July 3, 2015, where it’s expected to do crazy numbers because what else will moviegoers have going on by the middle of summer, 2015?  Oh wait…\n\n\n\n#3 TOM CRUISE MIGHT GO LIKE HELL IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS\n\nWe sort of went to town on Will Smith’s filmography in that last story, so we’re going to let Tom Cruise sit this one out while discussing why it’s a “Rotten Idea.” First, the story itself: Tom Cruise is attached to produce, and possibly costar in the 20th Century Fox drama Go Like Hell, a movie which will examine the true stories surrounding the automobile industry in the early 1960s. The movie will be based on the book by A.J. Baime called Go Like Hell: Ford, Ferrari, and Their Battle for Speed and Glory at Le Mans. Early reports mistakenly said Tom Cruise might play Henry Ford II, but the role he’s instead interested in is car engineer Carroll Shelby, who most people know as the guy behind the famous Shelby Mustang muscle cars. Nicolas Cage drove a Shelby Mustang in Gone in 60 Seconds, to pull out a hip, with-it reference from the early Oughts. So far, so good, right?  Well, the reason this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas is that the director Tom Cruise is looking to reteam with is one Joseph Kosinski, whose first two movies were TRON: Legacy and this year’s Oblivion, both of which earned “Rotten” scores in the low 50% range.  Of course, maybe science fiction just isn’t his thing, and Go Like Hell will be the movie to turn things around for Kosinski.\n\n\n\t\n#2 20TH CENTURY FOX TO DEVELOP TRILOGY OF MOVIES INSPIRED BY WEBSITES — CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE\n\nThe Weekly Ketchup has seen some pretty “out there” ideas and trends come and go. Often, the problem with the movies are that the things they are attempting to “adapt” are inherently non-narrative. File this story in that category: there is a movie studio that wants to develop an entire trilogy of movies based upon… websites. No, not the content on the websites, but just their names and the very loose premises. 20th Century Fox has acquired the film rights to the websites The Knot, The Bump, and The Nest, for a trilogy of comedies that follow an ensemble cast through three stages of life (marriage, pregancy, and parenthood). So, yes, we’re talking about three more movies that fall into that same “loosely thematic ensemble comedy” mix like Valentine’s Day and What to Expect When You’re Expecting. Of course, there may be a bright side to this story, if The Knot, and its two sequels are huge blockbuster successes (they probably won’t be, but roll with us here).  I’m imagining a real four-quadrant CGI comedy hit here.  It’ll be about a bunch of vegetables attending a movie marathon, who are challenged to finish all the movies before they’re too ripe to be harvested.  We’ll call it (wait for it)… Rotten Tomatoes! Or maybe if studios are in the mood for something more dramatic, there’s always the harrowing true story of the creator of Upcomingmovies.com, one of the world’s first “movie websites.” Say, whatever happened to that guy…\n\n\n\t\n#1 JAMIE DORNAN LANDS ROLE OF CHRISTIAN GREY IN FIFTY SHADES OF GREY\n\nLast week’s big news was that Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy, Pacific Rim) had dropped out of playing Christian Grey in next summer’s adaptation of the E.L. James novel Fifty Shades of Grey. Filming was scheduled to start on November 1, so it seemed likely that Hunnam’s replacement would be cast quickly, and sure enough, Universal Pictures and Focus Features have found their man. Again. This time around, it’s Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan, who is known more for his TV work (as the Huntsman in ABC’s Once Upon a Time) than his movie work (his highest profile film was 2006’s Marie Antoinette, in which he had a small role). Dakota Johnson is still attached to star as Anastasia Steele, and the movie will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy). The other interesting news that came out this week (but was overlooked by most) is that Universal and Focus approached Juno Temple (The Dark Knight Rises) and Frank Grillo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) to play, respectively, Steele’s best friend and Grey’s bodyguard. “Both actors passed on the roles, according to sources.”\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"worst, HBO, aapi, 2020, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-JJ-Abrams-and-Lawrence-Kasdan-to-Finish-Star-Wars-7-Script"},{"id":"47509209392710","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Is X-Force Fox’s New Franchise?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Is X-Force Fox's New Franchise?\n                        Plus, new roles for Johnny Depp, Ben Affleck, and Kevin Costner, and Legendary Pictures leaves WB,\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 12, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis was another slow week in Hollywood movie development news for two reasons.  Many people are still on summer vacation the week after Independence Day, and we’re still before next week’s San Diego Comic Con, which is usually a huge “news dump” each year.  Marvel got several stories ahead of the pack (including news of an X-Force movie), and there are also new projects for Ben Affleck and Johnny Depp.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHIS WEEK IN MARVEL MOVIES NEWS PART 1: X-FORCE TO BE NEXT FOR FOX’S MUTANT MOVIE SERIES?\n\nIt’s difficult to guage exactly why it felt like there was so much Marvel news this week.  Was it just another typical week (ie, there’s always tons of Marvel news nowadays), or was it because San Diego Comic Con is next week?  Anyway, there was enough that the several stories will be bundled together as just two headlines in the Weekly Ketchup, starting with what’s going on at 20th Century Fox.  To recap, the Marvel comic book adaptations these days are basically at three studios:  Sony has Spider-Man (and related characters like Venom), Fox has Fantastic Four and X-Men, and Marvel and Disney themselves have The Avengers and any other character not included within the rights of Fox or Sony.   The big Marvel news came out in drips and dribbles this week, but we might as well skip to the punchline which just came out this afternoon.  Kick-Ass 2 screenwriter and director Jeff Wadlow has been assigned by 20th Century Fox to start work on an X-Force script.  For the unfamiliar, an explanation of X-Force is definitely a good idea, except they’re not really that easy to explain.  Simply put, X-Force is a team that has existed in various forms since 1991, and they represent a more “extreme” approach to fighting threats to mutant peace and livelihood.  There have been three major versions of X-Force in the comics: 1) the original version that featured young mutant heroes led by Cable (who was from the future); 2) a satirical early 2000s version that was a commentary on reality TV and pop culture; and 3) the team since 2008 which is a “black ops” team that does the dirty work that the X-Men can’t (and shouldn’t).  The smart money would probably be on the X-Force movie being more like the modern comics, but with some of the characters from the 1990s like Cable, and maybe Deadpool.  Ryan Reynolds had some things to say this week about the still-in-the-works Deadpool movie. Finally, Hugh Jackman got quite a bit of news exposure this week for his comments about wishing that Fox, Sony and Marvel could come together and make deals that would allow all of the Marvel characters to be in the same movies together.  Not that it’s ever going to happen, but it’s nice to hear someone like Jackman say it.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 BEN AFFLECK TO STAR IN GONE GIRL FOR DIRECTOR DAVID FINCHER\n\nWhen Ben Affleck appeared recently in the trailer for Runner Runner (with Justin Timberlake), a natural reaction might have been, “Oh yeah, I guess he does still star in movies as well as direct.”  That’s just how positive the reaction has been to Ben Affleck’s films as director, the most recent being of course last year’s big Oscar winner Argo.  But yes, Affleck is still an actor too.  This week, he started negotiations with 20th Century Fox to star in the drama Gone Girl, which will be directed by David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac).  Gone Girl will be an adaptation of a novel by Gillian Flynn about a man who is suspected of murder after the disappearance of his wife of five years.  The deal for Ben Affleck to appear in Gone Girl is being timed around Affleck’s next gig as director, which will be the adaptation of the novel Live by Night by Dennis Lehane, whose novel Gone Baby Gone was Affleck’s directorial debut.\n\n\n\t\n#2 LEGENDARY PICTURES LEAVES WARNER BROS FOR NBC-UNIVERSAL\n\nThis news story can perhaps read a bit like “inside baseball” because it seems like it’s mostly about business deals and such, but as much as it impacts what movies will get produced in the coming years, this might be one of the bigger recent stories (even if it lacks big stars or titles in the headline).  After a few weeks of negotiations, the Legendary Pictures production company has made a deal that moves it from Warner Bros to NBC-Universal.  It’s important to note that the deal is with NBC-Universal, and not just Universal Pictures, because the allure of all that is under the umbrella of NBC-Universal was reportedly quite important to the deal (theme park, TV and cable production and distribution, notably).   Legendary Pictures had a pretty great run at Warner Bros (which will continue until 2014), which included several movies with Christopher Nolan (including the Batman movies and Inception), Zack Snyder (including 300, Watchmen, and Man of Steel), and Todd Phillips (The Hangover trilogy).  This weekend also sees the release of Legendary and WB’s Pacific Rim, and their upcoming slate also includes The Seventh Son, 300: Rise of an Empire, the Godzilla reboot, and the Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie All You Need is Kill.  What is less clear is what projects Legendary Pictures will be bringing with them to Universal, and which ones will stay at Warner Bros.  The DC Comics adaptations will surely stay at Warner Bros, but one that might go with Legendary to Universal is the Warcraft video game adaptation to be directed by Duncan Jones (Moon).\n\n\n\t\n#3 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS PART 2:  VIN DIESEL, AGENT CARTER, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nFollowing up on something that made the news last month, Vin Diesel finally had that meeting with Marvel Studios.  And after, he posted on his Facebook an image of himself standing next to a poster of the classic comic book #2 of The Avengers.  The cover includes an arrow pointing at Giant-Man (AKA Ant-Man), but Vin Diesel also uses the word “vision” in his post.  So, we still don’t really know what the talks were about.  Could Vin Diesel star in the 2015 movie Ant-Man (probably the furthest stretch), join the Avengers as the android Vision, or play the villain Thanos (what’s always seemed most likely, given Diesel’s resemblance to Thanos)?   Speaking of Thanos, there was also a report online this week that purported to tell us all what villains will be played in Guardians of the Galaxy by Benicio Del Toro, Lee Pace, and Karen Gillan.  If it’s true, those three will be playing, respectively, the Collector, Ronan the Accuser, and Nebula.  Those three characters are either unrelated or related to various other cosmic Marvel characters depending upon which comics you’re reading (or as Iron Man 3 showed us, the movie might just be its own beast entirely).  And finally, this week, we got our first images of the next Marvel One Shot short film, Agent Carter, which will premiere next week at Comic Con in San Diego, and then appear on the Iron Man 3 Blu Ray.  Hayley Atwell will reprise her character from Captain America: The First Avenger, one year later, as she’s on the trail of “Zodiac” (which likewise, in the comics, has meant different things at different times).\n\n\n\t\n#4 KEVIN COSTNER TO STAR IN (ANOTHER) SPORTS MOVIE, MCFARLAND\n\nKevin Costner has made quite a career out of sports movies (American Flyers, Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, For Love of the Game).  Now 58, Kevin Costner’s career in sports movies is continuing, but this time, he will play a coach in Disney’s drama McFarland.  Directed by Niki Caro (Whale Rider, North Country), McFarland will tell the true story of a track and field team in a small mostly-Latino town in California in the 1980s that must overcome social and physical “hurdles.”  See what they (Variety, probably) did there?\n\n\t\n#5 JOHNNY DEPP VEERS SMALLER WITH THE CHARACTER COMEDY MORTDECAI\n\nBesides being pre-Comic-Con, this week was also notable for following the disappointing box office of The Lone Ranger.  Johnny Depp’s response appears to have been a decision to sign on for a smaller “character study” comedy called Mortedecai.  The project is a long-in-development adaptation of the comedic crime novel The Great Mortdecai Moustache Mystery by author Kyril Bonfiglioli. Mortdecai was previously in development at Warner Bros (where Johnny Depp was also attached to star in the project), and now it’s at Lionsgate.  Mortdecai will be directed by David Koepp, who previously worked with Depp on the Stephen King adaptation Secret Window.  Koepp’s other films as director include The Trigger Effect, Stir of Echoes, Ghost Town, and Premium Rush.\n\n\n\t\n#6 X-MEN WRITER DAVID HAYTER TO ADAPT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT COMIC BOOK THE SWORD\n\nThis story is a pretty great example of exactly how slow of a week this was.  It’s also a story that was probably announced this week to get ahead of Comic Con, because once that news cycle really kicks in, a project like The Sword would truly get completely buried.  Anyway, the gist is this:  Lakeshore Entertainment (Aeon Flux, Crank, Underworld) has hired screenwriter David Hayter to adapt the comic book title The Sword for a project which they hope will start filming in early 2014.  David Hayter is best known for two things:  as one of the writers of the first two X-Men movies, and (less relevantly here) for being the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games.  Anyway, The Sword is about a paraplegic young woman who discovers an ancient sword that allows her to walk, and perform amazing swordplay feats, allowing her to wreak vengeance on those responsible for the slaughter of her family.  Lakeshore Entertainment is hoping The Sword might be successful enough to lead to a franchise of at least four movies.\n\n\n\n#7 CHLOE MORETZ TO STAR IN TEEN COMA DRAMA IF I STAY\n\nAfter starring in the upcoming remake of Carrie for MGM, Chloe Moretz signed a deal recently to stick with the studio for another movie.  Chloe Moretz will star in If I Stay, as a teenage girl who has an out-of-body experience after a disastrous car accident, then tries to decide whether to continue what will be a difficult life or just give up on life altogether.  If I Stay will be directed by TV series producer R.J. Cutler, whose series include Flip That House, Greatest American Dog, and ABC’s Nashville.  If I Stay lands just on this side of “Fresh” because it’s a new Chloe Moretz movie, honestly.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 AFTER THE LONE RANGER, DISNEY NEXT TARGETS REMAKE OF THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nAfter a big movie like The Lone Ranger lands with a thud both critically and commercially, it’s fairly common for a studio to next announce movie projects that can be seen as “corrections” and acknowledgements of what went wrong. That, at least, is one way to interpret the news this week that Walt Disney Pictures is developing a new live action remake of Rudyard Kipling’s short story anthology The Jungle Book.  Disney’s 1967 animated film The Jungle Book remains the most famous movie based on Kipling’s stories, but there were also live action adaptations in 1942 and 1994.  That more recent version was also from Disney, and was an early film from director Stephen Sommers, five years before his first major hit with The Mummy.  This second attempt by Disney at a live action The Jungle Book has competition in the form of another adaptation by Harry Potter screenwriter Steve Kloves (because the rights to The Jungle Book are now in the public domain).  As for why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas? The screenwriter that Disney has hired for this project, Justin Marks, currently has one feature film to his credit:  2009’s Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\n\n\n\t\n#1 TEXAS CHAINSAW 3D PRODUCERS TARGET ZOMBIES NEXT WITH DAY OF THE DEAD REMAKE\n\nIt was only six months ago, but it already feels like years since the January rerelease of Texas Chainsaw 3D.  Like many January releases, the movie came out in that dead zone between Oscar season and the better promoted movies of the spring season.  We’re right in the middle of summer blockbuster season now, so it might be difficult to imagine the reasoning, but times of the year like January can actually be fairly profitable for less ambitiously budgeted genre projects.  Anyway, the next horror remake for the producing team behind Texas Chainsaw 3D appears likely to be a remake of George A. Romero’s Day of the Dead. That 1985 release was the finishing film of Romero’s original zombie trilogy (before he returned to them starting with Land of the Dead in 2005).  Night of the Living Dead itself has been remade a few times now, and the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead was the movie that launched the directing career of Zack Snyder, who most recently gave us this summer’s Man of Steel. We don’t yet know how faithful the remake will be to Romero’s tale of soldiers and scientists hiding out in the days following a zombie apocalypse, but the producers do promise to stick with “slow” zombies rather than the more recently popular “fast” zombies… like those in, say, 2004’s Dawn of the Dead (or last month’s World War Z).  This is the week’s Most Rotten Idea based on the RT Tomatometer score for Texas Chainsaw 3D.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Marvel, elm, Geo, school, Election, Adventures, PBS, Shondaland, Pictures, TV, Toys, zombies, robots, DC, dramedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Is-XForce-Foxs-New-Franchise"},{"id":"47509209399880","title":"Weekly Ketchup: World War Z and This Is the End Getting Sequels?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: World War Z and This Is the End Getting Sequels?\n                        \n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 28, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes sequel news for Taken 3, the fifth Terminator, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1; movies based on Captain Planet, Encyclopedia Brown, and Knight Rider; and new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Foxx, and (maybe) Vin Diesel.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nSEQUELS POSSIBLE FOR APOCALYPTIC HITS WORLD WAR Z AND THIS IS THE END\n\nDestruction is a big thing this summer. Man of Steel is the most obvious, and where most of the press goes, but it’s not the only movie to score well at the box office in June with calamitous events, and it’s not the only such movie with sequel buzz either. After months of pre-release bad buzz about reshoots (and a six month release delay), World War Z opened this past weekend to $66 million in North America, and $111.8 million worldwide.  Paramount Pictures is claiming it as “the best opening for an original live-action tentpole since Avatar,” which is a bit weird because it was based on a bestselling novel.  Anyway, there’s been talk for a while of a possible World War Z trilogy, and those numbers were enough for Paramount and Brad Pitt’s Plan B to officially start development on a sequel.   All of this is arguably at least partly due to the surprisingly positive reviews for World War Z, and they were possibly due to the drastic changes to the film’s plot.  This link tells you about added scenes in the first hour of the film, and this detailed article describes the completely different third act.  It also explains why that one guy looked like Matthew Fox.  The quasi-reality-based apocalyptic comedy This is the End has also been quietly doing well (opening to over $20 million against Man of Steel), and Seth Rogen’s codirector Evan Goldberg is already talking up his idea for what a sequel could be like, which sounds like it veers crazily off into movie-within-a-movie territory.  Which is not to say that a sequel has actually been greenlit, of course (but it’s at least being talked about).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 DJANGO UNCHAINED STARS TO REUNITE FOR MEAN BUSINESS ON NORTH GANSON STREET\n\nAfter playing opposing roles in Django Unchained, Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are now attached to costar in a new project for Warner Bros called Mean Business on North Ganson Street.  The movie will be an adaptation of an upcoming crime novel by S. Craig Zahler about two disgraced and/or demoted detectives who are reassigned to a crime-riddled town in Missouri.  The title of the movie bears some noting as Leonardo DiCaprio’s next movie is called The Wolf of Wall Street, with director Martin Scorsese, who himself had early success with Mean Streets, which is one letter off from being the first and second word of this movie.  When you add it all together, what you get is… yeah, it’s a complete coincidence.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JULIANNE MOORE MIGHT LEAD THE REBELLION IN THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY PART 1\n\nWe might still be almost five months away from the November 22, 2013 release of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, but that’s probably not really a reason for Lionsgate not to proceed with plans for the final two movies adapting The Hunger Games: Mockingjay (ie, few people are really expecting the audience for the first movie to stop showing up for the three sequels).  And so, we learned this week that negotiations have begun with Julianne Moore for her to play Alma Coin, who is an important figure in the growing rebellion against the evil President Donald Sutherland Coriolanus Snow.  If she signs, Moore will appear in both parts of Mockingjay, which are scheduled for release on November 21, 2014 and November 20, 2015, respectively.\n\n\n\t\n#3 VIN DIESEL HEADLINES THIS WEEK IN MARVEL NEWS… BUT WHY?\n\nThe biggest news this week involving Marvel Studios is that Vin Diesel revealed that he will be meeting soon with them. That, however, is basically where the story begins and ends.  Why does Marvel want to talk to Vin Diesel?  Is it for Thanos, the expected big bad in The Avengers 2, or perhaps for an entirely different superhero project?  At one point years ago, his name came up concerning a possible Sub-Mariner movie, but as far as we know right now, Marvel’s not actively pursuing that (though he could certainly appear in another character’s film).  This writer thinks it’s probably Thanos, but for the most shallow of reasons (Vin Diesel’s jawline sort of resembles the way Thanos is often drawn).   In a similarly mysterious vein, we also learned this week that Australian actor Josh Helman has been cast for several weeks of work on X-Men: Days of Future Past, but that’s again, about all we know.  He might be playing any one of dozens of Marvel’s mutants, or he might be playing “Sentinel Technician #2.”  You say you just absolutely love Marvel news stories with very few details to go on, and just two such stories aren’t enough?  Alright then: Also this week, Marvel announced another mystery movie for the release date of July 8, 2016.  What movie that might be, in between mystery movies on May 6, 2016 and May 5, 2017, is anyone’s guess.  And finally, here’s another release date which is only sort of Marvel-related.  Focus Features and Universal Pictures have announced a release date of August 1, 2014 for their adaptation of the “Mommie Porn” novel Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James.  And the reason that’s relevant here?  That’s the same release date as Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n\n\t\n#4 WARNER BROS DEVELOPING LEGO SPINOFF NINJAGO\n\nThis past weekend saw the debut of the trailer for The LEGO Movie in theaters with Monsters University, preparing audiences for the film’s release on February 7, 2014.  Warner Bros is apparently happy with the big screen prospects for all things LEGO, as the studio has hired two of the writers of The LEGO Movie to work on an adaptation of the LEGO toy line Ninjago.  As you can guess from the title, the Ninjago line revolves around ninjas and other types of warriors and monsters inspired by both Japanese and Chinese mythology.  Ninjago was also the inspiration for the Cartoon Network animated series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu which has aired on the network since January, 2011.  Warner Bros is reportedly close to finding a director for Ninjago, who will be someone other than Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the directors of The LEGO Movie, who also directed Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs.  With little more to base an opinion on, consider this Ninjago story a true borderline “???” this week.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN AND THE CASE OF THE UNREQUESTED MOVIE DEVELOPMENT\n\nIt’s been an ongoing theme in Hollywood since the 1990s that studios love going to the material of their own childhood for material for movies for tomorrow’s kids.  Listing all of the examples would take too much space, but since this entry is mostly about Warner Bros, let’s use Yogi Bear and Where the Wild Things Are as examples (Garfield and The Smurfs are good examples at other studios).  The latest example of this strategy is Encyclopedia Brown, the 28 volume series of boy detective books by Donald J. Sobol which were first published in 1963 (until his death in 2012).  Warner Bros is now developing an Encyclopedia Brown movie, which is the latest effort in a franchise history of film attempts that goes back to the early 1980s and Chevy Chase.  This story comes just two weeks after a similar announcement at 20th Century Fox for plans for the Choose Your Own Adventure franchise.  Encyclopedia Brown is a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because as noted before, do kids today even know who he is?\n\n\n\t\n#4 LIVE ACTION CAPTAIN PLANET BACK IN DEVELOPMENT AGAIN\n\nMy, how time flies when you’re not really paying much attention.  As this writer prepared to report this week on the idea of a live action Captain Planet movie, it was with some surprise that I realized that it was actually almost two years ago now that we last reported on it.  Anyway, now it’s Sony Pictures that is picking up the rights to a movie based upon the early 1990s kids cartoon Captain Planet and the Planeteers about a blue skinned superhero with green hair who fights crime… as long as it’s environmental crime.  Let that contradiction sink in a bit.  Captain Planet was aided by five teenagers, four of whom wore rings representing the elements of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind, and the fifth was stuck with… Heart.   Don Cheadle has also starred in a series of Captain Planet short films for FunnyorDie.   Attempts at a live action Captain Planet movie date back to the 1990s.\n\n\n\n#3 PARAMOUNT ANNOUNCES NEW TERMINATOR TRILOGY (AND LEAVES SOMEONE OUT)\n\nIn advance, every upcoming year has lots of big movies tentatively scheduled, but 2015 is some sort of crazy special example. It might be easier to list franchises that don’t have entries planned for 2015 than those that do.  The list of possible/likely “big movies” for 2015 got even longer this week with the official announcement by Paramount Pictures of a June 26, 2015 release date for the next Terminator movie.  What’s especially curious about the news is that the film is being described as “the first in a stand-alone trilogy,” and nowhere in the announcement is there any mention of Arnold Schwarzenegger starring in this new film, which will be the fifth entry in the franchise (#4 was 2009’s Terminator: Salvation).  This movie, whatever it ends up being called, has made the news in recent weeks amidst talk of both Schwarzenegger and Dwayne Johnson appearing in it, but officially, Paramount Pictures isn’t mentioning any of that just yet.  The 33% Rotten score on the RT Tomatometer for Terminator: Salvation is why this new movie is still a “Rotten Idea” until we hear reasons to think otherwise.\n\n\n\t\n#2 LIAM NEESON TO RECEIVE NEARLY THE BUDGET OF TAKEN TO STAR IN TAKEN 3\n\nThis story is mostly about math and the Taken franchise, but let’s start with the math.  In 2008, Liam Neeson starred in a little movie called Taken, which had a reported budget of $25 million.  The movie ended up bringing in over $226 million internationally, so yeah, to little surprise, there was a Taken 2. That movie was released in October, 2012, and for his particular set of skills, Liam Neeson earned $15 million of the film’s $45 million budget that time around. The investment paid off even better for the sequel, which now has an international total of over $376 million.  And so, once again, to little surprise, there will be a Taken 3.  And that finally brings us to this week’s actual news, which is that Liam Neeson’s deal this time is in the $20 million range, or in other words, a number close to the entire budget for the first movie.  Deals will now be sought for Famke Janssen and Maggie Grace, who play his wife and daughter, respectively.  As for why this is one of the week’s most Rotten Ideas, here’s one last bit of math for you: 21% on the RT Tomatometer for Taken 2.\n\n\n\t\n#1 KNIGHT RIDER: THE MOVIE FROM THE WRITER OF… WILD HOGS?\n\nNot every movie based upon an old TV show is inherently a bad idea. We’ve actually gotten several pretty great movies from old TV shows (The Fugitive, The Untouchables, and the Mission: Impossible franchise, for some examples). Any movie needs the right parts, and in the case of this week’s Most Rotten Idea, the part that really makes it rotten involves the 2007 “comedy” Wild Hogs, which has a Tomatometer score of just 14%.  Screenwriter Brad Copeland wrote that movie, and now he’s been hired by the Weinstein Co. to work on their adaptation of the hit 1980s TV science fiction-tinged adventure show Knight Rider.   The motivation behind a Knight Rider movie seems mostly to be based on the success of the Fast and the Furious franchise, but those cars also don’t talk, or require someone to write lines for them to deliver.  And that brings us back to Wild Hogs.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"foreign, Comic, movies, winner, dragons, PBS, Paramount, Animation, thriller, Nickelodeon, and, Hulu, media, cops, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-World-War-Z-and-This-Is-the-End-Getting-Sequels"},{"id":"47509210868303","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Returns For Another Mission: Impossible","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Returns For Another Mission: Impossible\n                        Plus, new films for Michael Shannon, Martin Scorsese, and Owen Wilson, and a Dungeons &amp; Dragons reboot.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 10, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covers movie development news stories that include new entries in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Hot Tub Time Machine, and Mission: Impossible franchises, as well as the next movies from such acclaimed directors as Paul Thomas Anderson and Martin Scorsese.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTOM CRUISE WILL RETURN AS ETHAN HUNT FOR A FIFTH MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE\n\nIt may be difficult to remember this now, but there was a time a few years ago when people in Hollywood were wondering if Tom Cruise was a falling star, so to speak.  This was the time before the release of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, back when there was talk of Cruise handling the franchise over to Jeremy Renner… permanently.  Two years later, with a few more successes under his belt again, and no one’s talking like that anymore.  And so, Paramount Pictures made a big announcement this week that Tom Cruise will be producing, and again starring in a fifth Mission: Impossible movie.  Writer and director announcements are expected to follow later this year.  One of the people that might be a contender in both categories is Christopher McQuarrie, a frequent Cruise collaborator whose second film as director was last year’s Jack Reacher (he also cowrote Valkyrie, and the upcoming Cruise sci-fi war movie All You Need is Kill).  McQuarrie also made the news this week for signing a deal with Warner Bros to write and direct a remake of the 1968 Cold War thriller Ice Station Zebra, which was itself an adaptation of a novel by Alistair MacLean.  The politics may need an update, but the basic premise is about a U.S. submarine crew that is sent to the Arctic under the pretense of a rescue (but it’s really a top secret espionage type mission).  Tom Cruise hasn’t been mentioned specifically for the Ice Station Zebra remake, but yeah, they probably totally want him.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SILENCE MAN, SILENCE MAN, DOES WHATEVER SCORSESE WANTS, IN JAPAN\n\nAfter some twenty years of development and various snags, director Martin Scorsese finally has a budget, a start date, and a star for his suspense film adaptation of the Shusaku Endo novel Silence.  Andrew Garfield, best known for his roles in The Amazing Spider-Man and The Social Network, has landed the role of Father Rodrigues, a 17th century Portuguese Jesuit priest who travels with another priest to Japan to investigate claims of religious persecution (against Catholics).  The role of the older priest is still up for grabs.  Earlier in the development of Silence, the actors that have been mentioned for possible lead roles included Daniel Day-Lewis, Gael Garcia Bernal, and Benicio del Toro (and it’s still possible one of those actors may yet land the other role).  Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins, The Last Samurai) has also been cast as the priests’ interpreter.  Location scouting in Japan is underway on the production which will start filming in the summer of 2014.  Silence will feature a largely Japanese cast, and much of the dialogue will be in Japanese.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MICHAEL SHANNON CHASES THE DIRECTOR OF MUD INTO BIG STUDIO TERRITORY\n\nSometimes, things just come together at the right time.  In this story, we concern ourselves with two movies that might otherwise seem unrelated.  Michael Shannon is costarring in next month’s Superman movie Man of Steel as General Zod, which is, of course, being released by Warner Bros.  Meanwhile, off in indie land, there was the recent, very well received release of Mud, the third film from director Jeff Nichols.  The connection between the two is that Michael Shannon starred in Nichols’ first two films Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter, and had a supporting role in Mud.   Now that all the building blocks have been explained, we get to the actual story this week, which is that director Jeff Nichols will be making his studio debut at Warner Bros with a currently untitled science fiction chase movie (set in the present day).  And, to make their collaborative streak four for four, Michael Shannon will star in the movie.\n\n\n\t\n#3 OWEN WILSON JOINS PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON’S TRIPPY PERIOD PIECE INHERENT VICE\n\nJoaquin Phoenix has been attached for a while to star in director Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel Inherent Vice.  It was this week, however, that the casting of the other roles really started to take off, with three fairly major stars now being mentioned.  It all started with news of Benicio Del Toro being in talks to play an attorney friend of Joaquin Phoenix’s character, a pot-smoking detective who in the spring of 1970 investigates the case of a missing/kidnapped girl.  This was followed by reports that both Owen Wilson and Charlize Theron are also in negotiations for what are being described as “lead roles,” with no other details.  Warner Bros is financing and distributing Inherent Vice, which is a return to the parent studio of some of Anderson’s earlier movies (specifically, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, which were distributed by New Line Cinema).\n\n\n\t\n#4 ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER WEEK OF MARVEL MOVIE MADNESS\n\nMaybe it’s just because Iron Man 3 made a ridiculous amount of money last weekend, but this was another week with multiple news stories concerning Marvel movies.  The biggest of these stories, if not particularly surprising, is that Robert Downey, Jr. has started negotiations for his returns as Tony Stark in the The Avengers 2 and The Avengers 3 (the titles of which will likely change).  What’s not currently in the mix is a fourth Iron Man movie (which if there ever is one, might feature a new actor in the role).  Buried in that story are two more revelations that really should have had their own headlines, which is that Marvel now has scripts in development for a Ms. Marvel solo movie, and a revival of the Blade franchise.  Sort of in the same category is the very brief (and buried) revelation this week from Marvel boss Kevin Feige that there are currently no plans for solo movies for War Machine (from the Iron Man solo movies) or the Falcon (from the upcoming Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Shane Black, who cowrote and directed Iron Man 3, also made a big deal this week, signing with Sony Pictures for his long-planned revival of the pulp hero Doc Savage.  Right here is where fans unpleased with certain story elements of Iron Man 3 can make their obligatory jokes about changes to Doc Savage (or especially his villains).  Back in the 1970s, there were technically Marvel Comics featuring the character of Doc Savage, but as a licensed character only, so that today, Marvel does not own the movie rights.  The other big Marvel story this week that many fans were talking about was the announcement by Walt Disney Pictures that the first animated movie from the studio based on a Marvel Comics property will be Big Hero 6, to be released on November 7, 2014.  What got lost in the mix a little bit, however, is that this wasn’t really that big of a news story, since almost everything we currently know about the Big Hero 6 movie was already written up in this column back in June of 2012 as a Fresh Development #2.\n\n\n\t\n#5 ROBERT DE NIRO TO INVESTIGATE CRIME TRAFFIC IN CANDY STORE\n\nRobert De Niro has joined two of today’s rising stars in the Brooklyn criminal underworld drama Candy Store.  Jason Clarke (Zero Dark Thirty, Guardians of the Galaxy) will play a former “covert ops agent” who discovers that an evil organization has set up shop in his neighborhood, and Robert De Niro will play a former cop who he teams up.  Omar Sy from the French comedy hit The Intouchables is also costarring.  Candy Store was cowritten by, and will be directed by, Stephen Gaghan, who also wrote Traffic, and wrote and directed Syriana.\n\n\t\n#6 PARKS AND RECREATION STAR ADAM SCOTT (SORT OF) REPLACES JOHN CUSACK IN HOT TUB TIME MACHINE 2\n\nGiven that the first movie was all about nostalgia for the 1980s, it was always sort of a presumed “given” that the eventual sequel might do the same thing for the 1990s.  This week’s casting news doesn’t come right out and confirm it, but it sort of gives that collective guess some additional weight.  Adam Scott, best known for his role in NBC’s Parks and Recreation, is in talks with MGM for the lead role (as a new character) in the sequel Hot Tub Time Machine 2.  Scott was born in 1973, which sort of makes him perfect to play someone who was a young man during the Bill Clinton years.  Three of the stars from the first movie will also be returning (Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, and Clark Duke), but John Cusack will not be.  Steve Pink, who directed the first movie, will also be directing Hot Tub Time Machine 2.\n\n\n\n#7 REESE WITHERSPOON TO REUNITE WITH HER WALK THE LINE DIRECTOR FOR THREE LITTLE WORDS\n\nOne way, we’ve learned recently, for a movie star to deal with an embarrassing incident is to make a few casting announcements.  Reese Witherspoon made the Ketchup last week for the movie Passengers, where she will play a woman awakened on a decades-long space voyage by a sad Keanu Reeves.  That story was last week’s “Rotten Idea of the Week,” but this one makes the cut as a (borderline) “Fresh Development” based on other factors. Reese Witherspoon will reunite with director James Mangold (Walk the Line, The Wolverine) for an adaptation of the memoir Three Little Words by Ashley Rhodes-Courter.  Witherspoon will play a volunteer who helps a young girl in Florida reunite with her biological mother, possibly to be played by Amanda Seyfried (in negotiations).  The script has been worked on by Lewis Colick (Ghosts of Mississippi; cowriter of Charlie St. Cloud) and Michael Petroni (The Rite).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 THE LONG WAIT FOR JURASSIC PARK IV… JUST GOT A LITTLE LONGER\n\nSince the 2001 release of Jurassic Park III, one of the most demanded sequels by fans* has been a fourth Jurassic Park (*my old site used to track interest via traffic to preview pages, and Jurassic Park IV was almost always in the top 5).  Those dinosaur enthusiasts seemed to finally be getting what they wanted when Universal Pictures announced plans for Jurassic Park IV to be released on June 13, 2014.  The movie is still in development, but the wait just got a little bit longer this week.  After a few tweets that suggested bad news for the sequel, Universal made an official announcement: “In coordination with filmmakers, Universal has decided to release Jurassic Park 4 at a later date giving the studio and filmmakers adequate time to bring audiences the best possible version of the fourth installment in Universal’s beloved franchise.  We could not be more excited about the vision that Colin Trevorrow has created for this film, and we look forward to watching as he and the producers create another great chapter in this franchise’s storied history.”  Colin Trevorrow previously directed Safety Not Guaranteed.  We also learned this week that two of the actors who had met with Universal about roles in the sequel were Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village) and David Oyelowo (Rise of the Planet of the Apes).   We’re calling this one “Rotten” just because it sucks for fans to have to wait longer, but if the wait proves to have been the right decision, then, yeah, obviously, it should be considered “Fresh.”\n\n\n\t\n#1 WARNER BROS GETS TO ROLL A MULLIGAN ON THE DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS MOVIE FRANCHISE\n\nBack in 2000, Warner Bros attempted to start a new fantasy franchise on the big screen with Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a movie based on the classic pen-and-paper role playing game, which proved to be a critical and box office flop.  It should be remembered that this was before the releases of both the Lord of the Rings movies and the Harry Potter films (both also released by Warner Bros or its cousin New Line Cinema).  The argument could be made that the first Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie is to modern fantasy what any given pre-Blade superhero movie is compared to The Avengers or The Dark Knight.  People just approached these properties differently back then (with less respect, the argument can be made).   The 2005 direct-to-video sequel Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God was (in the opinion of this writer) better made, and a more faithful adaptation of the game, but the previous damage to the brand was already done.  It wasn’t necessarily permanent, however.  And so, Warner Bros announced this week plans for another big screen Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, with a script based upon the Gary Gygax game Chainmail (that was the precursor to Dungeons &amp; Dragons).  That script was written by David Leslie Johnson, whose previous films include Orphan, Red Riding Hood, and cowriting duties on the fantasy sequel Wrath of the Titans.  This new Dungeons &amp; Dragons project joins Warner Bros’ other adaptation of a popular fantasy gaming franchise: World of Warcraft.  Finally, it’s worth mentioning that Hasbro, parent company of Wizards of the Coast, is already disputing whether Warner Bros currently has the rights to a Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie.  And where do those rights partly come from?  Courtney Solomon, the director of that first movie.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Freeform, live, Podcast, war, binge, Mystery, Crackle, Sundance, romantic, period, Golden, aliens, Cartoon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Tom-Cruise-Returns-For-Another-Mission-Impossible"},{"id":"47509210880599","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Veronica Mars Movie Kickstarter Campaign Succeeds","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Veronica Mars Movie Kickstarter Campaign Succeeds\n                        Christian Bale and Melissa McCarthy get roles, Trainspotting and Jurassic Park sequels are in motion.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | March 15, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories involving sequels for Horrible Bosses, Trainspotting and the Jurassic Park franchise, as well as new (or possible new) roles for Christian Bale and Melissa McCarthy.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN FOR THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE MAKES HISTORY\n\nThe idea of the Veronica Mars movie being the top story of any given week might have seemed incredulous (and heck, maybe it still does).  The reason that this movie, based upon the 2004-2007 Kristen Bell series, earned the top spot has more to do with its history-making distinction, and more generally, what precedent this story might set, going forward.   It was this week that Warner Bros. and Veronica Mars producer Rob Thomas started a Kickstarter campaign for the funding of a Veronica Mars movie that raised its $2 million goal within 11 hours.  Initially, it was thought that WB Digital Distribution was going to fund the remainder of the budget, but with almost a month left to go in the campaign, the movie’s entire budget will now come from the Kickstarter donations. The people who ponied up the cash will receive a variety of escalating goodies for their contributions, the breakdown of which you can read about here.   The ramifications of this story have been quick and much discussed, particularly among fans of various other TV shows who would also like to see the objects of their obsessions get Internet-funded movies.  One producer who was quick to quell such speculation was Joss Whedon, who said he has no plans to turn to Kickstarter for a new Firefly/Serenity movie.  One problem keeping many such shows from getting the Kickstarter treatment is that, unlike Veronica Mars, many of these cancelled shows (your Pushing Daisies, your Moonlights) require more special effects and larger budgets.   Veronica Mars, on the other hand, is basically just about a young reporter who does a lot of talking.  And talk, as the saying goes, is cheap.  Technicolor fields of CGI flowers and reanimated corpses, not so much.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ONE OF THE SIGNS LEADING INTO JURASSIC PARK IV READS SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED\n\nLast year, one of the directors to make the Star Wars Episode VII news (the job that eventually went to J.J. Abrams) was Colin Trevorrow, who made his debut with the indie Safety Not Guaranteed.  Eventually, we learned that the genre reboot that Treverrow was actually hinting at was the much lower profile Flight of the Navigator.  This week, Colin Trevorrow really did sign on to direct a high profile genre entry with Roman numerals in the title: Jurassic Park IV.  Universal Pictures has slated Jurassic Park IV for a release date of June 13, 2014, and Treverrow will be working from a script by Rise of the Planet of the Apes cowriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver.\n\n\n\t\n#2 WILL THE GOOD TIMES MOVIE BE DY-NO-MITE?\n\nThere was a time in Hollywood when “TV show adaptations” were one of the hot trends, and nearly every week brought word of a new such project.  Nowadays, not so much.  So, it’s almost refreshing to hear that Sony Pictures and producer Scott Rudin have started development on a movie based upon the 1974-1979 CBS sitcom Good Times.  That show is most remembered now for featuring J.J. Walker and a pre-pop-singer TV career for Janet Jackson.  In its own time, Good Times was one of a few hit shows for TV producer Norman Lear, who specialized in “social commentary” shows like All in the Family and Maude.   Specifically, the title of Good Times was sort of intended to be ironic, as the show was about a working class African American family in Chicago whose struggles suggested they weren’t really having such great times.  Producer Scott Rudin’s other adaptations in the past have included Shaft, Sabrina, and The Manchurian Candidate.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DISNEY’S FANTASY REBOOTS CONTINUE WITH THE BEAST\n\nFollowing the massive box office takes for Alice in the Wonderland and most recently Oz the Great and Powerful, it’s not terribly surprising that Walt Disney Pictures continues to put fantasy reboots into development.  This week’s newest entry in that growing line of projects is called The Beast, and it’s a reinvention of Beauty and the Beast.  For this assignment, Disney has hired screenwriter Joe Ahearne, who recently worked with director Danny Boyle on the upcoming film Trance. The Beast is almost certainly a few years away from being produced, but it joins a burgeoning development line that includes the Sleeping Beauty reboot Maleficent, and the new Cinderella (which we also learned this week will not be featuring Emma Watson, as was recently reported).\n\n\t\n#4 DANNY BOYLE HOPES TO REUNITE TRAINSPOTTING CAST IN 2016 FOR A SEQUEL\n\nIn Austin this week for the SXSW Film Festival (to promote Trance), director Danny Boyle revealed that he hopes to get the cast of Trainspotting (including Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, and Jonny Lee Miller) back together in 2016 for a sequel.  Screenwriter John Hodge is currently working on the script, which is only loosely based upon author Irvine Welsh’s actual sequel called Porno.   One reason that 2016 is the target for the sequel is that it will mark the 20th anniversary of the release of Trainspotting.  One has to imagine that Begbie, Spud, and Sick Boy are probably still cross at Rent Boy.\n\n\n\t\n#5 HOLLYWOOD’S BIG MOSES PLANS: EXODUS VERSUS GODS AND KINGS\n\nWe’re all still waiting on the two “White House attack” movies, but Hollywood is already onto its next pair of dueling movies, as two different studios are racing against each other to produce movies about the Biblical figure of Moses. And this week, both projects got fairly major news developments.  First up, there is the Warner Bros project Gods and Kings, which Steven Spielberg has now officially dropped out of considering.  In Spielberg’s place might be Ang Lee, who recently joined Spielberg as a two-time Best Director Oscar winner (for Life of Pi).  There’s no deal yet for Ang Lee, it’s worth noting, but in situations like this where studios are racing against each other, sometimes just the idea of a deal is enough to make the news.  In this case, the competition is at 20th Century Fox, where a Moses project called Exodus might just be director Ridley Scott’s next film after The Counselor.  An advantage that Exodus might have is that it already has an A list actor interested, in the form of Christian Bale.  However, just like with Ang Lee, there’s no deal in place yet for Bale either.\n\n\n\t\n#6 WWE WRESTLER DAVE BAUTISTA LANDS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY ROLE AS DRAX THE DESTROYER\n\nFollowing a casting call that saw Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) get most of the press, WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has landed the second role in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy as Drax the Destroyer.  Drax’s story stretches back to the 1970s and is correspondingly sort of convoluted, but for the purposes of this movie, let’s just say that he’s a human who is resurrected as a big green muscle bound warrior type (but not that *other* Marvel green-skinned muscle bound guy). Bautista joins the previously cast Chris Pratt (as Star-Lord), which now leaves just one more actor to be cast (Gamora), and two more voice roles (Groot and Rocket Raccoon), to fill out the five main members of the team.\n\n\n#7 HORRIBLE BOSSES TRIO RETEAMS FOR BOTH THE SEQUEL AND ONE NIGHT ON THE HUDSON\n\nThe ramifications of the July, 2011 box office success of Horrible Bosses continued to be felt this week, a year and a half later.   Most obviously, deals were made and in the process of being made for director Seth Gordon and cast members Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jamie Foxx to reunite for Horrible Bosses 2, along with director Seth Gordon.  Three of them (Bateman, Day and Gordon) also are in talks with Universal Pictures to team up for a completely different project called One Night on the Hudson, about a pair of cops who are tasked with escorting a federal witness from New Jersey to Manhattan.  Horrible Bosses 2, which is expected to start filming in the late summer of 2013, is expected to happen first.\n\n\t\n#8 MELISSA MCCARTHY LANDS DRAMATIC ROLE IN WEINSTEIN COMPANY OSCAR BAIT ST. VINCENT DE VAN NUYS\n\nLike so many before her, Melissa McCarthy appears ready to make the transition from comedic to dramatic actress in the Weinstein Company project St. Vincent De Van Nuys.  McCarthy has landed what is being described as a much sought role as a struggling single mother whose 12 year old son is taken care of by a “train wreck” of a neighbor to be played by Bill Murray.  St. Vincent De Van Nuys got its start as an entry on the “Black List of Unproduced Screenplays,” and it will also mark the directorial debut of its screenwriter Ted Melfi.   Filming is expected to start in July while Melissa McCarthy is on hiatus from her CBS sitcom Mike &amp; Molly.\n\n\t\n#9 ROBERT DUVALL AND VINCENT D’ONOFRIO TO PLAY ROBERT DOWNEY JR’S FAMILY IN THE JUDGE\n\nWe’ve known for a while that Robert Downey Jr. was going to star in the Warner Bros dramedy The Judge, but this week was when we finally learned who will play the title character.  Robert Duvall will play Downey’s father, a small town judge who is the main suspect in the murder case of the mother of Downey’s character, who’s a successful attorney himself.   Vincent D’Onofrio (Law and Order: Criminal Intent) has also been cast as Downey’s older brother.  The Judge will be directed by David Dobkin (Fred Claus, The Change Up), whose last three films have all earned “Rotten” scores on the RT Tomatometer, which is why The Judge is the lowest rated of this week’s stories.  However, Downey, Duvall and D’Onofrio — in addition to sharing final initials — are all fine actors, which just barely saved The Judge from being the week’s sole Rotten Idea.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\nNo single movie story seemed “Rotten” enough for this category this week.  Huzzah!  We all got a week off from horrible movie studio ideas.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Signature, language, Adult, dceu, Peek, Geographic, 20th, Mary, Now, deadpool, jurassic, competition, Rocky, versus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Veronica-Mars-Movie-Kickstarter-Campaign-Succeeds"},{"id":"47509210876500","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Third G.I.

JOE TO GET A THIRD MOVIE, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR TOY MOVIES (AND PROBABLY BAD NEWS FOR EVERYONE ELSE)\n\nJust when it seemed like maybe the drive in Hollywood to produce a new wave of movies based on toys might have been prevented, G.I. Joe: Retaliation had a huge weekend, and it looks like those plans are probably right back on again.  Retaliation opened to $132 million globally, and enough domestically to make it the second best Easter weekend opening ever.  And so, Paramount has unsurprisingly started development on a third G.I. Joe movie.  The spin that we can eventually expect from the studio or the involved producers is that this was all part of a plan for a G.I. Joe trilogy, but the lack of such talk when people expected G.I. Joe: Retaliation to be a huge bomb (like when it was bumped back from June, 2012) might suggest otherwise.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 TWELVE YEARS LATER, FINDING NEMO GETS A SEQUEL IN FINDING DORY\n\nPixar Films and Walt Disney Pictures have officially announced that the Finding Nemo sequel will be called ( http://collider.com/finding-nemo-2-finding-dory-release-date/ ) Finding Dory, and will be released on November 25, 2015, over twelve years after the release of the original film (oh how, tempus fugit).  Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (as the title character) are both confirmed to return in this new CGI animated adventure which is set one year after the events of the first film, which effectively makes it a period piece (though it’s unlikely we’ll be getting much circa-2004-nostalgia).  Finding Dory will also be director Andrew Stanton’s next film after the experiment with live action that the world more commonly knows as last year’s John Carter.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ZOE SALDANA’S FRANCHISE COLLECTION EXPANDS WITH GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nIt’s more common with elderly British actors (like Sirs Christopher Lee and Ian McKellen), but Zoe Saldana is another actor that is starting to pile up appearances in genre franchises that would be really handy if people still played Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.  It all started with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and continued with major roles in Avatar and Star Trek. Now, Saldana is expanding her franchise domination by engaging in talks with Marvel Studios to play the green-skinned alien assassin Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy.  With Chris Pratt and Dave Bautista already cast as Star-Lord and Drax the Destroyer, the only remaining team members left to be announced are Rocket Raccoon and Groot, both of whom are likely to be mostly voice cast (since they are, respectively, a genetically manipulated animal and a talking tree).  There was also an online story that (if true) lets us know that one of the villains in Guardians of the Galaxy might be frequent Iron Man enemy The Controller, acting as an agent of Thanos (who’s expected to be the main villain of The Avengers 2).  Finally, ComingSoon.net scored this week a photo gallery of over a dozen concept art images from Marvel’s Phase 2 films, which includes our first glimpses at Falcon and the Winter Soldier from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and a pretty good look at what Rocket Raccoon might look like.\n\n\n\t\n#3 TIM BURTON RETEAMS WITH THE WRITERS OF ED WOOD FOR THE BIOPIC BIG EYES\n\nTim Burton has been making “big movies” for so long that it might be easy to forget that little biopic he directed back in 1994 about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood.  Just in time for that movie’s 20th anniversary next year, Tim Burton has signed with The Weinstein Company to direct another biopic written by Ed Wood cowriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.  The movie in question is called Big Eyes, which will tell the true story of Margaret and Walter Keane, the married couple responsible for a distinct type of kitschy paintings easily recognized for the size of the eyes of the subjects.  The couple’s story includes the twist that it was Walter Keane who took the credit at the time for the paintings, despite his wife Margaret being the one that actually painted them (sometimes locked in a room until she finished). Big Eyes has been in development for a while now, with the two roles previously being discussed as going first to Kate Hudson and Thomas Haden Church, and then to Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds. Well, if all negotiations go well, the final pairing will instead be Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz.  Filming of Big Eyes will start this summer, after which, Tim Burton will probably move onto making a movie with Johnny Depp.\n\n\n\t\n#4 JESSICA CHASTAIN AND BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH JOIN GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S GHOST STORY CRIMSON PEAK\n\nThis week, Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty) and Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek Into Darkness) joined already announced cast members Emma Stone (Easy A) and Charlie Hunnam (Pacific Rim) as the stars of Guillermo Del Toro’s next film, Crimson Peak.  Although specifics aren’t yet known, Crimson Peak is described as a ghost story set during the turn of the 20th Century (from the 19th) which plays around a bit with some of the conventions of the subgenre.  Filming is expected to start on Crimson Peak in January, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#5 CHLOE MORETZ AND NICHOLAS HOULT JOIN CHARLIZE THERON FOR DARK PLACES\n\nDark Places is the title of an adaptation of a mystery novel by Gillian Flynn about a woman who has to revisit the massacre of her family 20 years later when a group called the Kill Club questions whether the right person was convicted for the murders. Charlize Theron has already been cast as the main character (replacing the previously reported Amy Adams).  This week, &lt;Chloe Moretz (Kick-Ass) and Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, About a Boy) were also cast as members of the Kill Club. Dark Places was adapted and will be directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner (2011’s Sarah’s Key).\n\n\t\n#6 WILLIAM H. MACY ATTRACTS AN ALL-STAR CAST FOR HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT RUDDERLESS\n\nActor William H. Macy will be making his directorial debut with a musical drama called Rudderless about a father who forms a band to perform the original music that he discovers was written by his dead son (in other words, the feel good movie of 2014). In addition to starring with his wife Felicity Huffman, Macy has recruited several established actors to join him in the cast. That list will include Billy Crudup, Laurence Fishburne, Selena Gomez (Spring Breakers), and Anton Yelchin (Star Trek Into Darkness).  There’s a very solid chance that Rudderless will make its premiere at a festival like Sundance next year.\n\n\n#7 LIAM HEMSWORTH TO STAR IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIE CALLED THE RAVEN\n\nLiam Hemsworth inevitably still gets confused with his brother Chris (the one who is Thor), who is not the one who was in The Hunger Games.  Well, now, he’s going to star in a movie that itself will be confused with a movie last year starring John Cusack. Liam Hemsworth is in advanced talks to star in The Raven, which has zero to do with Edgar Allen Poe, and is instead based upon a 2010 short film by director Ricardo de Montreuil. The Raven is described as a sci-fi conspiracy thriller set in a future version of Los Angeles.  Universal Pictures is producing and distributing.  Consider this a borderline Fresh/Rotten toss up, because we really don’t have much to go on besides what we can gather from watching the original short film on YouTube.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 AFTER SERVING IN WORLD WAR Z, BRAD PITT ENLISTS FOR THE WORLD WAR II TANK MOVIE FURY\n\nNobody knows anything in Hollywood, so “everybody” could be wrong, but the common perception is that World War Z has a strong chance at being one of the summer’s biggest flops.  As such, Brad Pitt is understandably looking to do something completely different next, even if it’s really easy to draw comparisons, just based on his next film’s title.  Brad Pitt is in talks to star in Fury, a World War II drama about a five man tank team that finds itself facing a massive German army in the final days of the war in 1945. Fury will be directed by David Ayer (Harsh Times, Street Kings, End of Watch), and it’s the amount of green splotches on his RT Tomatometer page that make Fury a Rotten Idea this week.  Filming of Fury is expected to start in September, 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#1 HERCULES 3D CONFIRMS WHAT THE LATEST PAIR OF DUELING MOVIES WILL BE ABOUT\n\nIn the same way that a gas station on a corner means there will be another one across the street within a year, Hollywood loves the concept of “dueling movies,” in which two movies from competing studios have the same basic premise.  Volcanos, manned missions to blow up asteroids, attacks on the White House, Snow White, and Steve Prefontaine biopics are among the subjects this has happened to in the past.  To that list, you can now officially add 2014 movies about the Greek mythological hero Hercules.  Director Renny Harlin expects to start filming in Bulgaria in May on a movie called Hercules 3D which will be directly competing with a movie called Hercules, which will be directed by Brett Ratner and star Dwayne Johnson.  In Renny Harlin’s movie, the Greek hero will be played Kellan Lutz of The Twilight Saga.  Harlin’s movie is budgeted at $70 million, and is expected to be released in March, 2014, several months before MGM and Paramount are releasing Ratner’s movie on August 8, 2014.  While Ratner’s film is expected to be more “fantastic,” Renny Harlin’s film is being compared (by Harlin) to Gladiator, saying that, “It’s not a comic book, cartoony fantasy thing.”  Renny Harlin apparently didn’t get the memo that many people don’t necessarily use “comic book” as an insult anymore.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cancelled, Set, Poppins, Animation, Pop, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Third-GI-Joe-Movie-Now-In-Development"},{"id":"47509212334687","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Jurassic Park Set to Reopen in Summer of 2014","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Jurassic Park Set to Reopen in Summer of 2014\n                        Plus, a Hot Tub Time Machine sequel and new roles for Emma Stone, Bradley Cooper, and Anne Hathaway.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 18, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covered a seven day period in which Hollywood recovered from weeks of almost zero activity with enough newsworthy movie development announcements for two of these columns.  Indeed, this writer expects some omissions to be pointed out by commenters, but hey, there’s only ten slots available each week.  The stories that did make the cut include high profile sequels (Jurassic Park IV, Pirates of the Caribbean 5), a much lower profile sequel (Hot Tub Time Machine 2), remakes (Ben-Hur and possibly Gremlins), and the inevitable Lance Armstrong biopic.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nJURASSIC PARK IV FINALLY GETS A RELEASE DATE\n\nThere were arguably a handful of movies this week that could have received the distinction as the week’s “top story.”  The idea of a fourth Jurassic Park however has been lingering around for so long (Jurassic Park III came out in 2001), that it won out, even though this is the third time in two years that Jurassic Park IV got the headline (previously, here and here).  And now, to the actual news, which is admittedly pretty skimpy on details:  Universal Pictures has scheduled Jurassic Park IV for June 13, 2014, and it will be released in 3D (like the original movie will be for its rerelease in April).  Whether or not the title will use Roman numerals appears up for debate.   This news comes not long after Steven Spielberg delayed filming of Robopocalypse, which begs the question of whether he will, in fact, be directing Jurassic Park IV, or merely producing it (as it currently, officially stands).   This caps a week full of release dates (mostly because studios announce their yearly plans at the beginning of the year; see how that works?):   The newly revived Picturehouse will release the drama/concert movie mashup Metallica Through the Never, starring Dane DeHaan, on August 9, 2013; Machete Kills, at one time thought to be going direct to video, will “hit” theaters on September 13, 2013;  Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity comes out October 4, 2013; and MGM and Paramount will release Brett Ratner’s Hercules comic book adaptation, starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, on August 8, 2014.   See the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 news down below for more release dates (from Disney).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MUST BE SOME KIND OF HOT TUB TIME MACHINE… SEQUEL\n\nHigh concept comedies sometimes succeed by a different barometer than most other genres.  Movies like Zoolander and Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery can open to “okay” box office domestically, but then do much, much better after their theatrical release.  So much so that they eventually get sequels (it may not have happened yet, but Zoolander 2 is still in development).  And that brings us to Hot Tub Time Machine, which only made $50 million domestically in 2010 on a production budget of $36 million.  Thanks, however, to such vehicles as Comedy Central, Hot Tub Time Machine now has a growing audience that belies the realities of that original theatrical release.  And so, MGM, that studio so known today for remaking its old hits, is in early negotiations to instead make a sequel to Hot Tub Time Machine.  These preliminary discussions include director Steve Pink, and stars Rob Corddry, Clark Duke, and Craig Robinson.  John Cusack is notably not in discussion for the sequel, and now, here’s some speculation as to why (besides possibly more obvious reasons, like he doesn’t want to do it).  Just as Hot Tub Time Machine took the characters back to the 1980s, one would have to speculate that the logical target for the sequel would be the 1990s.  If the sequel does target a different decade, it might make more sense for the “John Cusack slot” (whose casting was an homage to his 1980s movies) might go to an actor who is more associated with 1990s movies.  Teen comedies sort of went out of vogue for most of the 1990s, but one film that did quite well was Clueless, and Paul Rudd seems like someone who might be sort of perfect… if this is the approach that Steve Pink and MGM plan on taking.  Admittedly, there’s more than one “if” within all of that.  Rob Corddry may team up with Steve Pink to work on the screenplay.\n\n\n\t\n#2 WITH THAT NAME, IT WAS INEVITABLE: ANNE HATHAWAY TO DO SHAKESPEARE WITH THE TAMING OF THE SHREW\n\nFirst off, for those wondering what that title implies, here’s a theatrical history lesson (weird, huh?).  And now, the actual story, which is that Anne Hathaway is reportedly attached to star in a new adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play The Taming of the Shrew, about a woman with a fiery personality named Katherina who is courted contentiously by a rapscallion named Petruchio.  The Taming of the Shrew has been adapted many times, including a 1967 dramatic version starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Kiss Me Kate, and even an episode of Moonlighting.  This latest version will be set in Italy (the play was set in Padua) in the mid 20th Century.  It’s not yet known if Hathaway will be playing an Italian herself.  Screenwriter Abi Morgan (The Iron Lady) will adapt the screenplay for a new British production company with a first look deal with Working Title Films, which likewise has a first look deal with Universal Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE LANCE ARMSTRONG BIOPIC IS CALLED CYCLE OF LIES… SEE WHAT THEY DID THERE?\n\nThis story, one has to imagine, probably got started quite a while ago, but was kept hush-hush until after a certain TV interview last night. J.J. Abrams, Bad Robot, Paramount Pictures, and producer Bryan Burk have started development on a Lance Armstrong biopic based upon the upcoming book by Juliet Macur called Cycle of Lies: The Fall of Lance Armstrong.  As the title pretty clearly intimates, the tone here will be negative/damning. Cycle of Lies is announced in pretty stark contrast to the Lance Armstrong movie that Jake Gyllenhaal was attached to star in years ago, which would have been more of a glowing ode to athletic accomplishment, probably even with a certain “USA! USA! USA!” vibe (or maybe even this more NSFW vibe).  There’s no word yet about whether Sheryl Crow might contribute to the soundtrack. Lance Armstrong sort of overshadowed what should have been the big news for Bad Robot this week, which is that Ron Howard is now attached to direct a movie for Bad Robot called All I’ve Got.  Based on a 2003 Israeli TV movie, All I’ve Got tells the story of a woman in the afterlife who is given the chance to go back and relive what her life would have been if her original lover hadn’t died in a horrific car accident.\n\n\n\t\n#4 EMMA STONE TO ENTER THE HAUNTED HOUSE OF GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S CRIMSON PEAK\n\nAlthough much of the press about this week’s new horror release Mama would have you think it’s the new movie from director Guillermo del Toro, as any fan of giant robots knows by now, that distinction actually belongs to Pacific Rim.  Though Pacific Rim is still a few months away, GDT is already casting up his next film as director, which will be called Crimson Peak.  Specific details are being kept hush hush at the moment, but it’s variably described as being either a ghost story, or more precisely, a haunted house movie (which usually also includes ghosts).   The first name to be mentioned this week was Emma Stone, followed by Charlie Hunnam, who is also costarring in Pacific Rim.  Although this casting is being done now, filming isn’t expected to actually start until February, 2014, after Guillermo del Toro wraps filming of the pilot episode for the FX series The Strain, based upon a novel that GDT cowrote.\n\n\n\t\n#5 BRADLEY COOPER TO STAR IN THE SPY MOVIE TO (PROBABLY NOT) END ALL SPY MOVIES: DARK INVASION\n\nIt’s been written about a lot over the years, but the fact still remains: World War II receives a lot more coverage from modern movies than World War I does.  The reason for this is probably because WWII just has better villains.  Hopefully, that’s not too blunt of a way of putting it, but Nazis are pretty evil as far as villains go; anyway, this story isn’t about Nazis.  Warner Bros has acquired the film rights to an upcoming (September 11, 2013) non-fiction book by Harold Blum called Dark Invasion, with an eye towards it being a star vehicle for Bradley Cooper.  Presuming the movie actually gets made someday, Cooper will be playing NYPD Captain Tom Tunney, who is tasked in 1915 with bringing down a ring of German spies intent on preventing the USA from entering the war against Germany.  Harold Blum says in the book that the CIA considers Tunney to be the first head of homeland security, and though there’s nothing like that online anywhere that I could find, maybe that’s just the CIA doing their job.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE WEEK IN NON-STORIES THAT FEEL LIKE REALLY BIG STORIES: ZACK SNYDER’S STAR WARS SPINOFF, AND THE GREMLINS REBOOT\n\nThis first story received a lot of online attention this week for obvious reasons, but what wasn’t as well covered was the fact that it was quickly denied (not that such denunciations are always 100% truthful).  Anyway, the story was that Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, and the upcoming Superman movie Man of Steel) would be developing a Star Wars spinoff movie that would exist outside the new trilogy, with a story that is like Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, except with Jedi Knights.   The idea that there could be Star Wars spinoff movies mostly comes from the idea that Walt Disney Pictures might want to be able to put out more Star Wars movies than just those within the strict limitations of a trilogy (something hinted at by various statements in recent months).  That story came from Vulture, as did this one, which involves another cherished 1980s franchise: Warner Bros is reportedly very interested in rebooting Gremlins.  However, there is almost no “there” there, as any potential movie would require a deal with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, and for various reasons (namely cost and Spielberg’s demand that he be involved), that deal is unlikely to happen.  Both Star Wars and Gremlins get news stories lots of page hits though.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 THE FIFTH PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN GETS A 2015 RELEASE DATE\n\nBesides Jurassic Park IV (and for some people, possibly more so), the announcement this week of a July 10, 2015 release date for the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean was probably the biggest news.  Walt Disney Pictures also announced the signing of screenwriter Jeff Nathanson to work on Pirates of the Caribbean 5.  Nathanson is usually credited as being the screenwriter of Catch Me If You Can, but his other credits also include story work on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and sole screenwriting credits on the sequels Rush Hour 2 and Rush Hour 3.  Along with the release date came reports that Johnny Depp is signed to once again play Captain Jack Sparrow, but the curious thing there is that one would think that would have been the lead story, as opposed to the release date or the screenwriter.  There was news back in 2011 that Depp was in negotiations, so maybe those talks went so well that Disney never thought it necessary to re-publicize his involvement.  That would make sense, of course, except for the fact that a studio keeping quiet about Johnny Depp starring in their hugely expensive tentpole release seems… sort of weird.  Anyway, other Disney release dates announced this week included The Muppets 2 (3/21/14), Maleficent (7/2/14), and Brad Bird’s science fiction drama 1952 (12/19/14), starring George Clooney.\n\n\n\t\n#2 NOW THAT SCHWARZENEGGER IS BACK, SO IS TERMINATOR 5, WITH NEW SCREENWRITERS\n\nA little over a year ago, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s career as a movie star was very much in question.   The question was whether people would spark again to the former Governor of California, or if they would find his custodial transgressions too unlikable.  Well, The Expendables 2 came out, and the movie did well, without much of a peep or complaint about the fact that Schwarzenegger was in it. Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger kept up with a fairly steady work load, including this week’s The Last Stand, The Tomb with Sylvester Stallone, and a commitment to reprise his Cimmerian role in The Legend of Conan.  Of course, all of that being written, it’s worth noting that we don’t actually know to what extent Arnold Schwarzenegger might ever appear in another Terminator movie again.  Regardless, it would also be sort of silly to pretend that the actor and the franchise aren’t pretty well linked.  The slowing down in development of the fifth Terminator did, after all, seem to happen in roughly the same period as the temporary cooling off by Hollywood towards Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Anyway, development is back on for the fifth movie, with screenwriters Laeta Kalogridis (Pathfinder, Shutter Island) and Patrick Lussier (cowriter of Drive Angry, Dracula III: Legacy) now hired to start work.  This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the declining RT scores for the Terminator franchise itself, but also a little bit because of (some of) the RT scores for the screenwriters.\n\n\n\t\n#1 HOW DO YOU FIGHT THE IDEA OF REMAKING BEN-HUR?\n\nObviously, there are some movies that get remade or revisited fairly frequently (Dracula, A Star is Born, and Les Miserables come to mind).  And adaptations of the 1880 Lew Wallace novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ were happening way before that really famous one in 1959 starring Charlton Heston. Having said that, some movies become so successful or cemented within the popular consciousness, that once they happen, they pretty much kill the concept going forward. Titanic is arguably one such movie.  Regardless, MGM, that studio so inseparably in love with remakes, made a lot of money in 2012 (thanks, Skyfall and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey!), and so they’re only more invested in remakes than ever.   Which brings us to Ben-Hur, which they’re planning on remaking again, except this time, they want to spend more screen time on the Jesus Christ part of “A Tale of the Christ.”  They probably won’t be calling Mel Gibson.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"sequel, drama, New, Film, Disney, joker, facebook, Pet, Star, Channel, versus, color","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Jurassic-Park-Set-to-Reopen-in-Summer-of-2014"},{"id":"47509212337761","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2012","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Stories of 2012\n                        Recounting the best movie news announced each month of last year.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | January 4, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe Yearly Ketchup continues on from last week’s review of the 12 most “Rotten Ideas” with twelve of the year’s top stories, most of which were classified under the “Fresh Developments” banner.  There’s a little bit of everything here, as long as your definition of “everything” is limited mostly to superheroes, Star Trek, Tolkien, and Star Wars.\n\n\n\nFRESH DEVELOPMENT OF THE YEAR\n\t\nDISNEY, LUCASFILM, AND STAR WARS EPISODE VII\n\nFor the most part, the compiling of this column entry involved careful skimming of each week’s Ketchup, but October saved this writer a lot of time.  The October 30, 2012 news that the Walt Disney Company had acquired LucasFilm for $4.05 billion was easily the biggest movie development story of the year.  The reason is that this deal also started development on a third trilogy of movies that will begin with Star Wars Episode VII to be released in 2015.  It also started a cascading snowball effect throughout the rest of 2012 as various stories were published online (especially) in November, all about who might or might not be directing, or what characters and actors may or may not be appearing.  We still don’t know yet who that director actually will be, but we will surely know that when the next Yearly Ketchup is written, and there’s actually a good chance that story might take the lead again in early 2014 as well.\n\n\n\n\t\nJANUARY: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH IS THE VILLAIN IN STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (WHOEVER HE TURNS OUT TO BE)\n\nOn one hand, it might seem like movie fans have known for much longer than a year that Benedict Cumberbatch is playing the villain in the sequel Star Trek Into Darkness.  However, another year of that knowledge still hasn’t really changed much in regards to knowing exactly who that villain will be.  The official pre-release line is that Cumberbatch plays a character named John Harrison.  However, in the last year, we’ve also heard about Cumberbatch possibly playing super psychic Gary Mitchell.  And of course, there’s the persisting notion that he’s really Khan under a cover identity (or something like that).  The answer isn’t that far away, as Paramount Pictures is releasing Star Trek Into Darkness on May 17, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nFEBRUARY: EDGAR WRIGHT TO DIRECT JOHNNY DEPP IN THE NIGHT STALKER\n\nThis story made the annual list for two reasons:  February had a pretty high “Rotten Idea” ratio, and this writer had forgotten that this story had ever happened in the first place.  Therefore, it’s probably a good nominee to be revisited by other movie fans eleven months later, as well.  Basically, Johnny Depp is producing and is likely to star in a Walt Disney Pictures adaptation of the 1970s ABC TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker.  Director Edgar Wright was also hired for The Night Stalker right at the start of development.  Wright’s involvement on this project has probably been so quickly forgotten because most attention has been given to either this year’s The World’s End (Wright’s thematic follow up to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), or his Ant-Man movie for Marvel Studios, to be released on November 6, 2015. As for what The Night Stalker itself is actually about, it’s pretty easy to synopsize: Kolchak is a newspaper reporter who has a knack for repeatedly investigating stories involving supernatural creatures (vampires, zombies, werewolves, etc).  Of course, all of this presumes that Johnny Depp still wants to star in a movie adapting a 1970s TV show involving vampires after the “meh” box office performance this year of Dark Shadows.\n\n\n\t\nMARCH: AFTER YEARS OF BAD NEWS, ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND CONTINUES… WILL ACTUALLY CONTINUE\n\nThis might be another story that seems like we’ve known about much longer than we actually have.  But nope, it was only back on March 28, 2012 that Will Ferrell dressed up like Ron Burgundy and went on the Conan show to announce that Paramount had given a greenlight to the sequel Anchorman: The Legend Continues.  Since then, we’ve seen a teaser trailer in theaters, much of the original cast has been confirmed as returning, and a release date of December 20, 2013 has been set by Paramount.  Director Adam McKay is also returning, and cowrote the script with Will Ferrell.  Filming of Anchorman: The Legend Continues is scheduled to start next month in February, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nAPRIL: SIR BEN KINGSLEY CAST AS THE BIG BAD IN IRON MAN 3 (WHO IS TOTALLY WHO EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WOULD BE)\n\nSome of the skepticism over the character misdirect concerning the villain in Star Trek Into Darkness is that the movie fan community has experienced this sort of thing before (and frequently).  Heck, it even happened this year, with a completely different sequel and villain.  It all started when Sir Ben Kingsley was cast as “the villain” in Iron Man 3 (scheduled for release on May 3, 2013).  The writing of the casting announcement nearly stumbled over itself trying to establish that Kingsley would not be playing The Mandarin, Iron Man’s comic book archnemesis (whose existence was also teased in the first movie).  This wouldn’t be quite as hilarious if we didn’t all know that, yeah, he totally is playing The Mandarin.\n\n\n\t\nMAY: KICK-ASS 2 IS ANOTHER 2013 SEQUEL THAT, BEFORE 2012, SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN\n\nContinuing the trend from our March story, this year also saw the sudden rejuvenation of the sequel Kick-Ass 2 after a (albeit shorter) period in which it seemed likely to end up being scrapped.  In the case of Kick-Ass 2, the reason why things changed so suddenly seemed to be most obviously linked to the “super” over-performance of The Avengers, the results of which emerged just two days before the greenlight for Kick-Ass 2 was announced.  Right around here, however, it should be noted that, except for the colorful outfits, The Avengers and Kick-Ass really don’t have much in common at all.  Indeed, Kick-Ass is nearly the opposite of The Avengers in many ways.  Regardless, Universal Pictures now has Kick-Ass 2 scheduled for release on June 28, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nJUNE: WARNER BROS AND DC COMICS RAMP UP THEIR BIG PUSH TOWARDS JUSTICE LEAGUE IN 2015\n\nThis story was actually part of a bigger arc (if you will) that stretched throughout the year, but the gist of it all started in early June, after it was clear that The Avengers would go down as the #3 box office success of all time.  That’s around the time that Warner Bros and DC Comics started getting really serious about jumpstarting a Justice League movie sooner rather than later (the summer of 2015, specifically).  Not really enough is known about the Justice League movie at this point to say with full confidence that it will end up being a “Fresh Development” for movie fans, but it’s certainly one for DC fans who want to see characters like the Flash, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman get the same sort of big screen attention that The Avengers received in 2012.  “Justice League in 2015″ might not end up being the “Freshest” story of the year, but it certainly was one of the biggest.  All we really know at this point, still, is that Justice League is being adapted by Gangster Squad screenwriter Will Beall (he also does a lot of work on the Castle TV show), and that the villain might be Darkseid.  The Justice League plan is also opposite that of Marvel’s: rather than following several movies featuring its heroes, the Justice League movie will come first (or second, if Man of Steel counts), and then some of the heroes might then get their own movies later on.\n\n\n\nJULY: COMIC-CON BRINGS THE NEWS FROM PETER JACKSON OF THE THIRD HOBBIT MOVIE\n\nThere were definitely a lot of big movie stories that came out of this year’s San Diego Comic-Con.  The single biggest movie that was hinted at there will probably end up being the 2015 release The Hobbit: There and Back Again.  Until that point, aside from some rumors pointing at the possibility, the world was under the impression that Peter Jackson’s adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit would be released as two (albeit very long) movies.  The idea had been around for a while that Jackson was supplementing the story of The Hobbit with both world-building back story and Lord of the Rings foreshadowing.  That included the addition to the films of characters that weren’t even mentioned in the actual book (like Legolas), or the expansion of other characters from just a teensy mention (like Radagast the Brown). Just six months later, we probably have a much better understanding of why the third film was added to Jackson’s adaptation, since most people who care about any of this have probably seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey at least once. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug will be released on December 13, 2013, and The Hobbit: There and Back Again will be released on July 18, 2014.\n\n\n\t\nAUGUST: THE NEXT X-MEN MOVIE (NOT COUNTING THE WOLVERINE) CONFIRMED TO ADAPT DAYS OF FUTURE PAST\n\nThe significance of this particular story might depend upon how much one is into the 1970s-1980s Uncanny X-Men comics written by Chris Claremont, which basically took one of Marvel’s worst selling titles and made it the cultural behemoth that it is today.  It was in August that we found out that the movie previously thought of as the “sequel to X-Men: First Class” would also tie in the first three X-Men movies as part of an adaptation of the classic 1981 time travel storyline Days of Future Past.  It won’t be anything close to an exact adaptation for obvious reasons (Kitty Pryde not being a 1960s X-Men member, for example).  However, the involvement of Bryan Singer as director for the first time on an X-Men movie since X2 is promising.  Filming is expected to start on X-Men: Days of Future Past soon in 2013, with 20th Century Fox having already scheduled this seventh* movie featuring Marvel’s mutants for release on July 18, 2014.  *The Wolverine comes out this year on July 26, 2013.\n\n\n\t\nSEPTEMBER: DREAMWORKS ANIMATION ANNOUNCES AMBITIOUS TWELVE FILM SLATE FOR 2013-2016\n\nThe challenge for this particular column entry is the balance between it being a list of the “freshest” movie development stories, or the “biggest” stories.  In the end, it basically has to be more of the latter than the former, because, frankly, we’re talking about movies that haven’t been released yet, and “big” is much easier to quantify than “good.”  As “big” as some of these stories have been this year, in sheer volume, few can add up to the numbers demonstrated in this September story.  It was then that DreamWorks Animation confirmed a four year release schedule for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 that included twelve new animated films.  DreamWorks Animation may not be the critical darling that Pixar is, but they’ve had a number of really big hits, and some of those were indeed beloved by critics and moviegoers alike, as well. DreamWorks’ 2013-2016 schedule includes sequels (How to Train Your Dragon 2, How to Train Your Dragon 3, and Kung Fu Panda 3), a spinoff (The Penguins of Madagascar), and a retro TV show adaptation (Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman).  The various movies that don’t fall into any of those three categories are The Croods, Turbo, Me and My Shadow, Happy Smekday!, Trolls, B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations, and Mumbai Musical (which is probably a working title).\n\n\n\t\nNOVEMBER: THE DIRECTOR OF FOUR HARRY POTTER FILMS WILL NEXT TAKE A (VINE) SWING AT TARZAN\n\nMaybe the movie industry spent the month in shock following the Star Wars Episode VII news, or maybe it was just a slow month because of those long holidays Hollywood likes to take.  Whatever the reason, November lacked a truly obvious “big story.” It could also have to do with how “awards season” makes the industry think more about attracting future nominations, and less about the sort of big, flashy movies that attract interest here.  Warner Bros may have a little bit of both, however, depending upon how the studio’s long-planned revival of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan ends up being realized.  Tarzan won the distinction of being the film that director David Yates finally said “yes” to after a year of trying to find his next post-Harry Potter “go project.”  This story also came in the same year that Edgar Rice Burroughs’ other most famous hero, John Carter, landed with something of a thud in (American) theaters. Warner Bros obviously thinks Tarzan, with decades of movie history under his loincloth, has a better chance of connecting.\n\n\n\t\nDECEMBER: A SEQUEL TO WRECK-IT RALPH WILL HAPPEN, AND MARIO WILL HAVE A LARGE ROLE IN IT, TOO\n\nWhatever was written about November being a slow-ish news month goes double for December, for two obvious Holiday-related reasons (one was on the 25th, the other had 8 crazy nights).  A fairly big story that did emerge, however, is probably in the “well, yeah, duh” category (especially fun if you imagine Sarah Silverman saying that).  That’s because a sequel to Wreck-It Ralph is now pretty much a certainty, as the first film is on its way to possibly earning over $300 million worldwide (as of this writing, it’s at $277 million).  Disney’s homage to the era of classic arcade video games has a lot of potential material for the sequel (and maybe even “sequels”), as there’s more to video games than just the arcade era, and more to be nostalgic about than just the 1980s, or even, for that matter, the 1990s.  Already included in the public discussions about the sequel is Nintendo’s Mario, who nearly was featured in the first film.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Winners, Sundance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Yearly-Ketchup-The-Freshest-Stories-of-2012"},{"id":"47509213408874","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Disney Buys Lucasfilm, Schedules Star Wars: Episode VII for 2015","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Disney Buys Lucasfilm, Schedules Star Wars: Episode VII for 2015\n                        Plus, new roles for Jamie Foxx, Michael Fassbender, Colin Firth, Paul Giamatti, and more.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 2, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week in movie development news pretty much seemed to begin and end with Star Wars: Episode VII.  There was, however, actually other stuff going on, including Jamie Foxx in talks to play an Amazing Spider-Man 2 villain, and new roles for Zac Efron, Michael Fassbender, Colin Firth, Paul Giamatti, and Kurt Russell.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWALT DISNEY PICTURES BUYS LUCASFILM AND PROMISES STAR WARS: EPISODE VII FOR 2015\n\nMost weeks, this writer has to take some time to decide what the “Top Story” is for that week’s Ketchup.  This week, not so much.  This may just be the top movie development story of the year, much less the month or week.  And, if you’re reading this column, you probably already know about it, but play along as if it’s news, and maybe one of these details will be new to you.  Walt Disney Pictures has purchased LucasFilm from its sole owner, a Mr. George Lucas of Marin County, for the amount of $4.05 billion.  Although LucasFilm is the company behind lots of other things too (like say, the Indiana Jones franchise), Disney’s acquisition is almost entirely for the rights of the Star Wars franchise, including all the various media (movies, TV, games, toys, etc) that it encompasses.  Specifically, more immediately — and for the fans, most intriguingly — is the big announcement that Walt Disney Pictures will be releasing Star Wars: Episode VII in theaters sometime (almost certainly in the summer) in 2015.  Star Wars: Episode VIII and Star Wars: Episode IX will follow in 2017 and 2019, respectively.  As part of the deal, George Lucas will continue to serve as an advisor for the franchise, but he will not be writing or directing any of the films in the new trilogy.   Well, that’s only slightly true, as Lucas has indeed written story treatments for episodes 7-9, but he won’t be the writer of the actual scripts.  We don’t know for sure what the story will entail, except that it won’t be based on any of the various Star Wars novels which have already covered in detail the events of (much of) the rest of the lives of characters like Luke, Leia, Han Solo, and their kids (and are usually considered to be “canon”).  The search for the writer of Episode 7 is currently ongoing. We know that people have been talking behind closed doors about this new trilogy of sequels because Mark Hamill revealed as much this week, saying that he and Carrie Fisher met with George Lucas this past summer; what’s unclear is whether they would actually appear in them.  The sticking point could be that Star Wars: Episode VII will be set about 20 years after Return of the Jedi, when Luke Skywalker is in his late 30s or early 40s, and Mark Hamill is already 61.  Instead, it seems likely that younger actors will be cast as the older versions of the series’ characters.  The move to Disney has got to be a blow for 20th Century Fox, the studio that released the first six Star Wars movies.  The situation also represents a quandary for future boxed sets, as 20th Century Fox retains rights to Star Wars in perpetuity, and the other five movies until 2020.  There’s still some money left for 20th Century Fox theatrically, however, as the studio’s deal to release 3D versions of Episode II and Episode III in 2013 and 2014 remains. As for that $4.05 billion that George Lucas is receiving, it’s not just going in his bank account.  Instead, George Lucas is expected to donate most of that money to the various education-related charities that he supports.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SHOCKING NEWS: JAMIE FOXX TO PLAY ELECTRO IN THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2\n\nMany of the most popular comic book superheroes were created in a time (1940s to 1960s) when (for whatever reasons) “caucasian” was the default race for most characters.  In the 21st century, much has been done to balance this issue out, which has included such changes of race as Pete Jones on Smallville (possibly the first of this trend), Kingpin in Daredevil, Heimdall in Thor, and Nick Fury in the Marvel Studios movies (a change that actually happened first in the “Ultimate” line of comics).  This week, Jamie Foxx was announced as being in negotiations to play the villain Electro in the sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man.   In addition to being caucasian, Max “Electro” Dillon is also skinny/lanky, sports a bright green costume with yellow lightning bolts coming off his head, and in the Ultimate version, he’s completely bald because his electric power effectively removed his hair via electrolysis.  It’s also worth noting that there has already been a long-running African American superhero with almost exactly the same powers as Electro, which is Black Lightning, who dates back to the 1970s when African-American characters frequently had the word “Black” in their name. It’s currently unknown whether Jamie Foxx’s Electro costume will feature those awesome yellow lightning bolts.  Perhaps the film can spend half its running time explaining exactly what keeps those things from flopping over.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MICHAEL FASSENDER AND COLIN FIRTH TO SQUARE OFF OVER WHO’S MORE OF A GENIUS\n\nColin Firth and Michael Fassbender have signed on to star in the literary biopic Genius about publishing editor Max Perkins (Firth), and his relationships with various early 20th century authors, including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe (Fassbender).  Filming will start in early 2014, around the time that Fassbender will turn 37, which was the age that Thomas Wolfe was when he died of tuberculosis, soon after he had reconciled differences with Perkins.  British actor Michael Grandage will make his directorial debut with Genius, working from a script by screenwriter John Logan, whose other upcoming films include Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, Jon Favreau’s Jersey Boys, and the next three James Bond movies (including Skyfall).  Logan’s script is an adaptation of the biography Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, by A. Scott Berg, who also wrote biographies of Samuel Goldwin, Katherine Hepburn, and Charles Lindbergh.\n\n\n\t\n#3 GUILLERMO DEL TORO RUMOR OF THE WEEK:  A SUPERNATURAL SUPER TEAM MOVIE CALLED HEAVEN SENT?\n\nThe movie websites of today are admittedly a lot slicker than our collective roots, but there are still sites out there like Ain’t It Cool News and Latino Review that harken back to that earlier, more rambunctious time.  This story does indeed come from Latino Review, and it’s also completely unconfirmed at this point, but it’s also such a cool story, that we had to include it.  Latino Review is claiming that Guillermo Del Toro so impressed Warner Bros with Pacific Rim that they have been trying to get him interested in other projects (like a V movie or a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory sequel).  What Guillermo Del Toro really wants to do instead is supposedly called Heaven Sent.  If it’s real, Heaven Sent would be a sort of super team movie featuring various “supernatural” heroes from DC Comics, which has way more such characters than Marvel does.  The list of potential characters includes The Spectre, Deadman, Swamp Thing, Phantom Stranger, Zatanna, John Constanine: Hellblazer, and Etrigan the Demon.  Of course, the down side to all of this is… this story could be completely bogus.  But if it’s real… the idea of Guillermo Del Toro being allowed to play with the very big toy box of the DC Comics magical characters is sort of a fanboy’s dream.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HORROR/WESTERN HYBRID BONE TOMAHAWK ATTRACTS KURT RUSSELL AND OTHERS\n\nThere is a certain casting technique, arguably perfected by Quentin Tarantino, in which a young director shows off his influences via the actor that he casts in his first film(s).  That appears to be what’s going on with the horror/western hybrid Bone Tomahawk from first time director S. Craig Zahler.  If that’s true, then it’s possible that Zahler is a fan of the 1980s films of John Carpenter (Kurt Russell), The Cabin in the Woods (Richard Jenkins), Boys Don’t Cry (Peter Sarsgaard), and the Showtime series Dexter (Jennifer Carpenter).  Or… all of those connections might just be coincidental.  Bone Tomahawk will be about four men who team up to rescue people being held captive by a group of cannibal troglodytes (aka cavemen).\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE JFK ASSASSINATION DRAMA PARKLAND ATTRACTS THREE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEES\n\nParkland is the title of a drama that Tom Hanks is producing about the Dallas hospital where President John F. Kennedy, his (presumed) assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and his assassin Jack Ruby all died in November, 1963.  Filming is going to start soon so that the movie can be in theaters just in time for the 50th anniversary on November 22, 2013.  As part of that, casting is well underway, with awards-friendly actors Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, and Jacki Weaver all now cast in Parkland.  The film will mark the directorial debut of Peter Landesman, who also wrote the script, based on material in the book Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, by Vincent Bugliosi, author of Helter Skelter (and yes, I got that right off the book’s cover).\n\n\n\t\n#6 THE (SECOND) BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL\n\nAlthough far more time was spent discussing the success of The Avengers, or the disappointment of John Carter, an underreported yet surprising story was exactly how popular The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was internationally.  Produced for the equivalent of $10 million, that British comedy has taken in over $134 million worldwide.  As such, it shouldn’t be surprising at all to discover that the film’s writer Ol Parker is now working on a sequel.  All of the cast members reportedly want to return, although that’s probably not possible for at least one of them (for obvious reasons).  It’s unknown what the sequel might be about, except that it will probably continue the stories of a bunch of elderly Brits living in a hotel in India, and might possibly add some new residents/cast members (as sequels usually do).  This is one of the Fresh Developments of the week due to the 77% “Fresh” rating on the RT Tomatometer (although this particular writer disagrees with that positive rating… just to get that out there).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 JASON STATHAM SEQUELS THE EXPENDABLES 3 AND THE MECHANIC 2 CONFIRMED AT AFM\n\nSome stories require a lot of explanation, but this one really doesn’t.  The American Film Market is an annual event in Santa Monica, California, where independent film producers hawk their movies to the distributors who actually get the movies in theaters around the world.  AFM took place this week, and two of the movies that are being sold there are the Jason Statham sequels The Expendables 3 and The Mechanic 2 (which is a sequel to a movie which was itself a remake).  Not much else is really known. As for why this is a Rotten Idea, well, it’s mostly because of the 53% Rotten RT Tomatometer score for The Mechanic.  As for The Expendables 3, well, maybe a third one is Rotten because eventually they will run out of aging action stars (though the eventual scraping of the bottom of the barrel could lead to some truly so-bad-they’re-great choices, so there is that).\n\n\n\t\n#2 ZAC EFRON SAYS TO HARRISON FORD, YOU BELONG TO ME\n\nHarrison Ford and Zac Efron are in talks to star in You Belong to Me, a psychological thriller which will be the next film from director Rob Reiner (Misery, Stand by Me).  Harrison Ford would play a psychiatrist who bonds with the brother (Efron) of one of his female patients who recently committed suicide, only to find that the brother starts seducing the doctor’s wife and daughter.  The tone of You Belong to Me is described as being like Cape Fear (because Cape Fear is a movie people generally like).   Although Reiner had a string of excellent films from 1984 to 1994, the last 18 years have seen mostly “Rotten” RT Tomatometer scores for the director, and that’s why this is a Rotten Idea this week.\n\n\t\n#1 THREE STORIES IN ONE: CASTLE WOLFENSTEIN TO AIRSPACE TO CELL\n\nSome weeks, the stories form Seven-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon style chains.  This story connects four movies, starting with the long-in-development notion of a movie based upon the long running Castle Wolfenstein video game series, a shooter series set during World War II that involves battling Nazis and the supernatural monsters they’ve created.  Or, as the independent producers described it, it’s sort of a cross between Captain America: The First Avengers and Inglourious Basterds, because those are movies people know and like (versus, say, comparing it to The Keep, Dead Snow, or Ilsa: She Wolf of the S.S.).   Anyway, at least one of those comparisons is probably because Roger Avary used to collaborate with Quentin Tarantino, and now Avary is the guy they’ve hired to write and direct the Castle Wolfenstein movie.  Roger Avary’s agent was quite busy this week, because he’s also been signed to direct the John Cusack airplane thriller Airspace, about a pilot who is chased mid-air by a “heavily armed MiG fighter pilot.” And that leads us to two more movies, in which John Cusack is also going to star, in a series of castings Nicolas Cage would envy.  Cell is the title of a Stephen King adaptation (Cusack also starred in the King adaptation 1408) about cellphone signals that turn people into massacre machines.  Cusack also signed on for Due Process, which is set in the exciting arena of world… (zzzz…) finances.  Here, Cusack will play a farmer who has to face off against two big city bankers who want to foreclose on his farm.  As for why all of this is Rotten?  Well, the two first two are because of Roger Avary’s RT Tomatometer scores.  As for all the John Cusack movies, well, it can be said at least that he’s only had one “Fresh” movie (Hot Tub Time Machine) in the last five years (since 1408 in 2007).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Fox, Plus, social","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Disney-Buys-Lucasfilm-Schedules-Star-Wars-Episode-VII-for-2015"},{"id":"47509212348003","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Vin Diesel to Star in Big Screen Version of Kojak","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Vin Diesel to Star in Big Screen Version of Kojak\n                        Plus, updates on the Muppets sequel and casting news for Tom Hardy and Samuel L.

Things, however, will really slow down to a crawl until January (and indeed, the next two Fridays will see this column become the “Yearly Ketchup”).  The last news items of 2012 included two movies based on 1970s TV shows (Kojak and Gaiking), two sequels (the next Muppets, and The Expendables 3), a spinoff of Cars called Planes, and a biopic about the early career of Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWHO LOVES YA, BABY?  VIN DIESEL TO BE THE MOVIE VERSION OF KOJAK\n\nSome actors just perfectly age into a movie role, and when one hears of such a casting choice, one might think, “Well, yeah… duh.” The news this week that Vin Diesel is producing and will star in a feature film movie adaptation of Kojak is definitely an example of that.  This is especially for older fans who actually remember what Kojak was (but are also young enough to know who Vin Diesel is).  Telly Savalas starred as Greek-American (and follicly challenged) NYPD detective Theo Kojak in the gritty CBS drama that aired from 1973 to 1978.  Savalas’s Kojak was cocky, had a swagger about him, and could frequently be spotted sucking a lollipop; in the 30 years since, it’s become a cultural stereotype that has sort of overshadowed the original show (and its much less comedic tone) itself.  There was also an attempted Kojak reboot on the USA Network in 2005 that ran for one season, with Ving Rhames in the lead role (sans the Greek American background, which basically just made him a bald cop who likes lollipops).  Finally, in case anyone thinks Kojak is destined to be a joke project, the screenwriters have a fairly impressive claim to fame that may indicate otherwise.  Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are the British screenwriting team who were involved with five consecutive James Bond scripts in a row, starting with The World is Not Enough, right on through this year’s Skyfall.  And… here’s a a bit of last minute news:  Vin Diesel also said today that a studio wants to make a trilogy out of his long-standing interest in a movie based on the life of Hannibal the Conqueror.  Why is this not its own story?  That’s the price movie stars and filmmakers “get” for breaking big news at 3:48 PM on the Friday afternoon before Christmas.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 RICKY GERVAIS REPLACES JASON SEGEL AS THE HUMAN LEAD IN THE MUPPETS SEQUEL\n\nBasically all of the press to date about the casting of the sequel to The Muppets has been on the role of an Interpol agent, initially announced as being Christoph Waltz, who was then replaced by Ty Burrell of TV’s Modern Family.  This week, it was clarified that Burrell’s role is actually that of the sequel’s antagonist, and not the human lead protagonist, who would be essentially replacing Jason Segel (sort of).  Instead, that actor will be Ricky Gervais, who filmed a cameo appearance for the first film that was ultimately cut from the theatrical version.  The details of Gervais’ character aren’t yet known.  There’s also still a third main human character yet to be cast, who is most likely a female character (since Amy Adams is also unlikely to return).\n\n\n\t\n#2 THIS YEAR’S BLACK LIST OF UNPRODUCED SCREENPLAYS INCLUDES BIOPICS OF DR. SEUSS AND HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON IN THE TOP 10\n\nAnother year is coming to a close soon, and so we’re in that pre-Christmas week when the news cycle is slower than usual.  That’s also the cue for the online publication of the “Black List of Unproduced Screenplays,” which is the result of polling of hundreds of studio executives and producers who each year read all the scripts the rest of us don’t have access to as readily.  The Black List has in recent years become a common publicity tool, but one has to be a little wary; a script merely being “on the list” doesn’t necessarily mean much when the list itself includes almost 100 titles.  Instead, it might help more to pay attention to which scripts gained the most votes.  This year’s top choice was Draft Day, a sort of professional football version of Moneyball that has Kevin Costner and Ivan Reitman attached to star and direct, respectively (obviously).  Two newsworthy scripts that are also in the top five (#3 and #4) are both biopics: Seuss tells the story of how an artist named Theodor Geisel met his future wife who inspired him to write children’s books, starting with The Cat in the Hat. Seuss is in development at Illumination Entertainment, with Johnny Depp attached to star as Theodor “Ted” Geisel. Rodham tells the true story of a young rising star attorney named Hillary Rodham during the years of the Watergate scandal who is forced to choose between a promising political career and her ex-boyfriend from Arkansas.  Rodham was written by a newcomer named Young Il Kim, who is neither the former (and late) leader of North Korea, nor The Notorious K.I.M.\n\n\n\t\n#3 BANE AND (THE ORIGINAL) LISBETH VOLUNTEER FOR ANIMAL RESCUE\n\nQuite a bit of press has been given in recent months to Warner Bros and their two different anti-poaching projects that are being developed as potential vehicles for the triumvirate of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Tom Hardy (who are all also producing).  This week, Fox Searchlight may have succeeded in (sort of) beating WB to the thematic punch, with one of those three, Tom Hardy, now signed to star in Animal Rescue, which also trades upon similar anti-animal-abuse themes.  Noomi Rapace (Prometheus) is also in talks to costar.  Author Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) adapted the script based on a short story that first appeared in the collection Boston Noir.  Director Michael R. Roskam, whose first film Bullhead was Oscar nominated for Best Foreign Langue Film last year, will make his English language debut with Animal Rescue.  Tom Hardy will be playing a man who gets messed up with local gangsters after he finds a puppy in a trashcan.\n\n\n\t\n#4 AUBREY PLAZA AND JOHN C. REILLY TO STAR IN THE INDIE ZOMBIE COMEDY LIFE AFTER BETH\n\nHow familiar one is with Aubrey Plaza might have to do with a) whether you watch Parks and Recreation and/or b) how many recent indie-flavored movies like Mystery Team, Damsels in Distress, and (especially) Safety Not Guaranteed you’ve seen.  Plaza was also fairly prominently featured in the less-indie “comedies” Funny People and Scott Pilgrim vs the World.  Anyway, the deadpan actress’ gradual road to eventual superstardom (and/or hey-whatever-happened-to…) will include the indie zombie romantic comedy Life After Beth.  John C. Reilly is the film’s other star, but there’s no word yet as to whether either one of them will actually play a zombie (or maybe neither, or both… who knows?).  Reilly and Plaza might seem mismatched age-wise, but that might be deceiving as 28 year old Aubrey Plaza often plays characters much younger than her real age (and BTW, John C. Reilly himself is 47).   Life After Beth was written by screenwriter Jeff Baena, who cowrote I Heart Huckabees with director David O. Russell, and who will also be making his directorial debut with this one.\n\n\n\t\n#5 JACKIE CHAN CHECKS INTO THE ACTION STAR RETIREMENT HOME THAT IS THE EXPENDABLES 3\n\nThe action franchise that continues with The Expendables 3 is basically custom made for action stars that are nearing retirement age.  The second film added two notable stars known for their martial arts skills (Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme).  The Expendables 3 continues that theme with the news from Jackie Chan himself that he is now indeed on board for the sequel.  Chan is the first actor to officially join the franchise with The Expendables 3, following quickly debunked rumors earlier this year that Nicolas Cage had signed on (he hadn’t).  There’s no release date yet for The Expendables 3, but it’s looking increasingly likely that it won’t be until sometime in 2014.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 ANGELINA JOLIE TO DIRECT THE LOUIS ZAMPERINI BIOPIC UNBROKEN\n\nAlthough In the Land of Blood and Honey was given a 2011 Oscar season release and the baby steps of an awards season push, the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie was panned by many critics, earning it a “Rotten” rating of 56%.   Such a reception, however, won’t necessarily keep a plucky multi-millionaire, A-list actress, and Hollywood near-royalty from getting a second chance to prove her directorial talents.  And so, Angelina Jolie is in negotiations with Universal Pictures to direct their long-in-development biopic of Olympic athlete and World War II P.O.W. Louis Zamperini.  Unbroken is based upon the best selling non-fiction book by Laura Hilenbrand, who also wrote the book that provided the source material for Seabiscuit.  The latest draft of the Unbroken adaptation was written by screenwriter Richard LaGravenese, whose credits include Water for Elephants and The Bridges of Madison County.\n\n\n\n#3 DISNEY’S DIRECT-TO-VIDEO CARS SPINOFF PLANES IS INSTEAD FLYING DIRECT-TO-THEATERS\n\nIt’s perhaps difficult to imagine this today, considering the success of the film and Toy Story 3, but at one time, Pixar’s Toy Story 2 was supposed to have just been a direct-to-video release.  The connection of that analogy to today’s story, however, mostly ends there.  Planes is the title of a CGI animated movie (that was produced by Disney, not Pixar) that was originally intended as a direct-to-video spinoff of Pixar’s Cars franchise.  The plans changed today, however, as Walt Disney Pictures has now scheduled Planes for a theatrical release on August 9, 2013 (the same date as Neill Blomkamp’s Elysium and the comedy We’re the Millers). As for why Planes is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, it mostly has to do with the 38% “Rotten” score for Cars 2 (and that movie was at least produced by Pixar).  This writer also just has a problem with Pixar movies being sequelized or spun off in general… the Toy Story trilogy notwithstanding.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE GIANT ROBOTS OF PACIFIC RIM ATTRACT ATTENTION FOR MOVIES LIKE GAIKING\n\nIt’s funny how easy it is sometimes to draw a direct line between something that’s awesome and a similar project that gets news a week or two after that.  In this case, the first thing was the online debut on December 13 of the trailer for Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim, with all of the awesome Giant-Robots-vs-Giant-Monsters action that it promises to deliver.  And so, this week, the live action movie based on the 1970s cartoon known in the USA as Gaiking also got some news.  Namely, Valhalla Entertainment, the production company of Gale Anne Hurd, is joining forces with Toei Animation and All Nippon Entertainment Works for the Gaiking movie.  The idea of a Gaiking movie is hardly news, of course, as a test footage clip appeared online earlier this year.  The interest of Gale Anne Hurd, however, may help get things moving, as her past films include action movies like the last two entries in both the Punisher and Hulk franchises, and the first two Terminator movies.  So, we are possibly closer to getting a Gaiking movie, and yet, the world is still deprived of its big budget Voltron movie.  That also includes, for that matter, Shogun Warriors, though Gaiking actually was one of the Shogun Warriors toys back in the day.\n\n\n\t\n#1 SAMUEL L. JACKSON IS SICK OF THESE ***KING KITES IN HIS M*****F***ING MOVIE CALLED KITE\n\nThere’s definitely ways of spinning gold out of stories that a more cynical movie writer can also spin as being completely “Rotten.”  Take, for example, the new live action anime adaptation Kite, which will reunite Samuel L. Jackson with David Ellis, the director of Snakes on a Plane.  That movie has a special little warm and fuzzy place in the hearts and minds of many movie fans.  When one actually looks at Ellis’ RT Tomatometer page for his career as a director, what one finds is that Snakes on a Plane is the one “Fresh” film, and every other movie he’s directed (like Shark Night 3D and two of the Final Destination movies) is “Rotten.”  Anyway, you can read about the original Japanese Kite anime episodes here.  Samuel L. Jackson will likely be playing one of the corrupt detectives that takes in a girl who was orphaned by the double homicide of her parents, and then he and his partner proceed to train her in the ways of an assassin. This probably wasn’t exactly the perfect week, though, to be promoting a movie with that particular story element.  But, you know, this was also the week before the release of Django Unchained, and so, it was Jackson’s chance at free publicity for his next project.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Festival, language","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Vin-Diesel-to-Star-in-Big-Screen-Version-of-Kojak"},{"id":"47509212331613","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Warcraft Movie Finds New Life","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Warcraft Movie Finds New Life\n                        Plus, news for X-Men, Denzel Washington, Tom Hardy, Jessica Chastain, and Paul Giamatti in a good week.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 1, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes new roles for Paul Giamatti, Tom Hardy, Jeremy Renner, and Denzel Washington, and such ambitious “tentpole” type projects as The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Doctor Strange, Warcraft, and X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWARCRAFT MOVIE GETS RESURRECTED WITH A NEW DIRECTOR\n\nRecent weeks and months have brought forth a lot of talk about big movies that are loosely scheduled for release in 2015, including Star Wars Episode VII, The Avengers 2, Justice League, Avatar 2, Pirates of the Caribbean 5, the Fantastic Four reboot, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2.  Obviously, some of those movies will not actually get released in 2015 (it’s just sort of inevitable), but there’s another movie we can add to the realm of possibilities.  Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures have hired director Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) to replace Sam Raimi as the director of their long-planned Warcraft movie adaptation.  And the plan is for the movie to start filming in the fall of 2013, aiming for a release sometime in 2015. Warcraft is of course the very popular fantasy gaming franchise that started as a real time strategy series in the 1990s before becoming the inspiration of one of the most successful MMORPGs in 2004 with the launching of World of Warcraft.   The news of Duncan Jones’ hiring was also soon followed by online rumors that Warner Bros is hoping to get Johnny Depp to star in an unspecified role.  The movie is described by various sites as being a World of Warcraft adaptation, but not enough is known about the premise of the script by Charles Leavitt (K-PAX, Blood Diamond) to say definitively which specific game in the Warcraft franchise it adapts (if any).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 PAUL GIAMATTI CAMPAIGNS FOR AND WINS THE ROLE OF THE RHINO IN THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2\n\nBack in March of 2011, Paul Giamatti went on Conan O’Brien’s show and joked about his love for the classic Spider-Man villain the Rhino, and how much he’d like to play him someday.  As Giamatti explains, the Rhino is a big guy in a rhino suit (complete with a horn on his head) whose super power is the ability to run at stuff really fast and knock it down (or through, or over, you get the point).  Strangely enough, he will actually get his wish, as this week, it was announced that Paul Giamatti is indeed in talks with Sony Pictures to play the Rhino in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Rhino is the second confirmed villain for the sequel, after the previous news that Jamie Foxx will be playing Electro.  Felicity Jones (Like Crazy) was also cast this week in an unspecified role.  Although the Rhino is one of Spider-Man’s classic villains, it’s perhaps a testament to exactly how many rogues are in that gallery that the Rhino has never been considered by most to be a likely movie villain.  Among the Spider-Man villains that are still awaiting their movie debuts are Kraven the Hunter, Morbius, Mysterio, Scorpion, and Vulture.  One has to wonder if the Rhino didn’t get his slot in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 perhaps because of Paul Giamatti’s interest in playing him.  Chin up, Hammerhead, Hypno-Hustler, and the Molten Man, maybe you have movie star fans out there, too.  The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is scheduled for release on May 2, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ICEMAN, ROGUE, AND KITTY PRYDE TO RETURN FOR X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST\n\nSpeaking of superhero sequels scheduled for the summer of 2014, filming is scheduled to start soon on X-Men: Days of Future Past, which will use time travel to connect the first three X-Men movies with the prequel X-Men: First Class.  We already knew of several returning actors, including two Professor Xaviers (James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart), two Magnetos (Michael Fassbender and Sir Ian McKellen), a Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and a Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).  This week, three of the characters from the “future” setting were also confirmed: Shawn Ashmore (Iceman), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page).   The inclusion of Kitty Pryde is no huge surprise, as that character was quite central to the original “Days of Future Past” storyline from the comics.  Her return does however raise the question as to whether we will also see the return of Colossus, since he’s the love of her life and all.  Mark Millar also chimed in this week to confirm that this movie will finally see the mutant hunting robots the Sentinels on the big screen for something other than a cameo (in X-Men: The Last Stand).  And finally, casting calls in Montreal gave us another bit of info this week, as we now know that this sequel/prequel will be set in 1973, eleven years after the setting of X-Men: First Class.   20th Century Fox has scheduled X-Men: Days of Future Past for July 18, 2014, which is currently the same release date as The Hobbit: There and Back Again, the final film in that trilogy.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE DOCTOR STRANGE MOVIE IS CONFIRMED AS PART OF MARVEL: PHASE THREE\n\nThere’s been talk about a Doctor Strange movie since the 1980s, but this week, we got official confirmation that it’s probably just a few years away.  Marvel bigwig Kevin Feige confirmed that when Ant-Man is released on November 6, 2015, that movie will be the start of Marvel’s “Phase 3.”  As a reminder, Marvel refers to their current crops of superhero movies as phases which have thus far ended each time with The Avengers (Phase 1), and in the future with The Avengers 2 (Phase 2).  That second bit of information had been presumed, but Feige’s comments this week confirm it.  But the real headline here is that the Doctor Strange movie will also be one of the Phase 3 movies.  Of course, we still don’t know who will be directing Doctor Strange, who will star as the Sorcerer Supreme, when it will exactly be released, or even a vague idea as to what it might be about.  But, you know… baby steps.\n\n\n\t\n#4 THE NEW TITLE OF DISNEY’S TOMORROWLAND REVEALS A BIT MORE OF THE MYSTERY… MAYBE\n\nWe’ve known for a while that director Brad Bird and screenwriter Damon Lindelof’s big tentpole blockbuster release for Disney next year (December 19, 2014) was purposefully being cloaked in mystery. Basically, all we know was that it was going to star George Clooney, and somehow involve a man who encounters something mysterious (probably in 1952, the movie’s previous title).   This week, Disney gave us a lot more to chew on in deciphering the mystery, as the title has now been changed to Tomorrowland, which is of course the name of one of Disney’s theme park areas.  This follows the revelation last week of images from the “box” that Damon Lindelof claims to have discovered (but he probably really didn’t) that inspired him to write this movie.  Included in the box appear to be images of such historical figures as Walt Disney (the man himself) and Amelia Earhart.  All of this early mystery also reminds us that Damon Lindelof was one of the showrunners of LOST.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE ENTOURAGE MOVIE HAS BEEN GREENLIT\n\nAfter years of producer Mark Wahlberg talking it up, Warner Bros has finally given an official greenlight for the movie version of HBO’s Entourage, which came to an end in 2011.  Not much is really known about the movie yet, except that it will be set six months after the end of the series, and that deals are currently underway for all five of the series’ main stars to reprise their characters.  This news makes Entourage the second HBO series to get its own theatrical movie after Sex and the City.  Other HBO shows that have been mentioned (or rumored) as possibly getting movies in the past (but didn’t) included Rome, Deadwood, and The Sopranos.\n\n\t\n#6 FOR HIS NEXT DIRECTORIAL EFFORT, DENZEL WASHINGTON IS SWINGING FOR THE FENCES\n\nIn addition to his successful career as an actor, Denzel Washington has also directed two movies in the past (Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters).  This week, Denzel Washington revealed that the next movie he hopes to direct will be an adaptation of the August Wilson stage play Fences, for which Washington won a Tony Award in 2010.  Washington will also be reprising his performance as the lead character, a trash collector in the 1950s who is haunted by his missed opportunity earlier in life of becoming a professional baseball player.  It’s not yet known if Viola Davis, who costarred with Washington on stage, will also sign on to play the same character in the movie version.\n\n\n#7 JEREMY RENNER TO STAR IN THE TRUE STORY DRAMA KILL THE MESSENGER\n\nHansel &amp; Gretel: Witch Hunters may have done rather badly with the critics last week, but Hollywood isn’t holding that against Jeremy Renner. This week, Renner became attached to a true story drama called Kill the Messenger, based on the life of journalist Gary Webb.  The film will focus on the “Dark Alliance” stories that Gary Webb wrote in 1996 that claimed to have revealed a conspiracy between the CIA, the Contras in Nicaragua, and the “crack cocaine explosion” of the 1980s. Kill the Messenger will be directed by Michael Cuesta (L.I.E.) who is now probably most well known as the executive producer of the Showtime series Homeland, which paints a very different picture of the C.I.A. than Kill the Messenger is likely to.\n\n\t\n#8 THE JESSICA CHASTAIN OSCAR EXPRESS MIGHT JUST CONTINUE WITH MISS JULIE\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Jessica Chastain was a complete unknown, but the last few years have seen her landing great role after great role.  Recently, Chastain pulled off the rare feat of having the lead role in both the #1 and the #2 movies on the box office chart (Mama and Zero Dark Thirty).  That being true, Jessica Chastain’s next role is unlikely to ever top the box office charts in the USA, although it does seem like it could attract year end award recognition, if it is indeed released later in 2013.  Chastain, Colin Farrell, and Samantha Morton have been cast in Miss Julie, an adaptation of the stage play by August Strindberg. Liv Ullman, director of 2000’s Faithless (and one of Ingmar Bergman’s favorite actresses) will direct the 1874-set story of a woman who starts having a relationship with one of her servants (Farrell).\n\n\n\t\n#9 TOM HARDY AND NOOMI RAPACE SIGN TO APPEAR IN SECOND MOVIE IN A ROW TOGETHER\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that we learned that Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) and Noomi Rapace (Prometheus) are going to star together in an animal rights-centric movie called Animal Rescue.  This week, the two are now in negotiations to star in yet another movie together, in what will end up being a back-to-back series of films.  This time, the movie is Child 44, an adaptation of a novel by Tom Rob Smith about a member of the Soviet police in the 1950s who finds himself under government suspicion following his investigation of a series of child murders.   Child 44 will be directed by Daniel Espinoza (Safe House, Snabba Cash).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\nThis was apparently a good week…  No Rotten Ideas!\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Thanksgiving, tv, Hallmark, all-time, screen, show, Creative, Walt, Black, Competition","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Warcraft-Movie-Finds-New-Life"},{"id":"47509213425266","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Safe House Gets A Sequel","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Safe House Gets A Sequel\n                        Plus, new roles for Renee Zellweger, Michael Fassbender, Zac Efron, and Vin Diesel.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 7, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe week after Labor Day was pretty much as slow for movie development news as the the week before the holiday was, except at least that one had 5 business days.  The articles for this week’s Ketchup had to be picked from a very limited pool, and probably about half of them never would have made the cut in most other weeks.  These ten stories include a sequel to a movie no one expected a sequel to, and new roles for Vin Diesel, Zac Efron, Chris Evans, Michael Fassbender, Bruce Willis, and Renee Zellweger.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWATCH OUT: SAFE HOUSE SURPRISINGLY SECURES A SEQUEL\nSafe House, released this past February by Universal Pictures, was something of a surprise solid hit, especially in the USA, where it earned $126 million of its $202.5 million worldwide gross.  That $202.5 million is a very respectable number, considering the film didn’t have many of the usual traits of a box office hit these days (super heroes, special effects, kid/teen friendly CGI, etc.).  $202.5 million is solid business, even if it’s not as big of a number as the worldwide box office results for say, Battleship, Wrath of the Titans, John Carter, Dark Shadows, or American Reunion (the movies currently at #16-#20 on the 2012 chart, above Safe House at #21).  What Safe House did have going for it was something quite old fashioned called “star power” in the form of Denzel Washington and (to a lesser degree) Ryan Reynolds.  The original Safe House was written by David Guggenheim while he was a staff writer at Us Weekly magazine, and now Guggenheim has been hired to write a sequel (that might actually be a prequel) as well.  Ryan Reynolds and Denzel Washington starred in the original Safe House as a young CIA agent and the rogue agent he has to keep in a Safe House in South Africa, respectively.  As of this week, there’s not yet any sequel/prequel deals for Reynolds or Washington.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ROGER EBERT’S LIFE ITSELF TO INSPIRE A DOCUMENTARY MOVIE, COMPLETING A THEMATIC CIRCLE\n\nAlthough he was at one time considered just one half of a team with Chicago rival-turned-partner Gene Siskel, the last ten years has seen Roger Ebert really emerge as something of an elder spokesman within the film criticism community.  Ebert’s life also took an unexpectedly tragic yet inspiring turn when his battle with esophageal cancer led to the removal of much of his lower jaw.  His autobiography, Life Itself, was published last year, which included many personal memories of his life and career, in addition to such bittersweet remembrances as a chapter about the menu at his favorite fast food franchise Steak ‘n Shake.  It was probably inevitable that Ebert’s life become a movie, either sooner or later, and this week, we learned exactly how that will happen.  Documentary filmmaker Steve James (Hoop Dreams, Stevie), assisted by producers Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian, has optioned the rights to Life Itself as the basis of a documentary about Roger Ebert’s life.  Ebert was contacted by the IndieWire site for comment about the project, and it sounds like he was surprised by the project, and doesn’t know yet what the film will be like.   Meanwhile, in other documentary news, the trailer was debuted this week for A Liar’s Autobiography, an animated film from 17 different animation studios about the life of the late Monty Python member Graham Chapman.  In addition to Chapman’s own voice, the film also includes contributions from every other Python who isn’t Eric Idle.  Pythons who match that description include two Terrys (Jones and Gilliam), John Cleese and Michael Palin.  If a documentary is ever made about Eric Idle’s life, Graham Chapman is not expected to contribute.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRUCE WILLIS MAY MENTOR AN AMERICAN ASSASSIN\n\nBruce Willis is now in talks with CBS Films to costar in American Assassin, an adaptation of one of the novels in the “Mitch Rapp” series by author Vince Flynn.  American Assassin is basically a prequel that explains how the fictional character of Mitch Rapp became one of the world’s most legendary CIA agents, with Bruce Willis in talks to play Rapp’s CIA agent mentor.  Jeffrey Nachmanoff (Traitor) is attached to direct from a script adapted by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, who previously worked together on Love and Other Drugs and The Last Samurai.   Once Bruce Willis is confirmed as the older CIA agent, CBS Films will get started on actually casting the lead actor who will potentially carry the role on through adaptations of other books in the series.\n\n\n\t\n#3 SIMON PEGG GAINS COSTARS IN BOTH THE WORLD’S END AND HECTOR…\n\nA few more actors joined two different movies starring Simon Pegg this week, and one of them will be in both films.  First up chronologically (filming-wise) will be The World’s End, which finishes up the “Three Flavors Cornetto” trilogy that began with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  Paddy Considine (In America, The Bourne Ultimatum), who was also in Hot Fuzz, and Rosamund Pike (Wrath of the Titans, Die Another Day) will join Simon Pegg as 60% of the five friends reuniting for a pub crawl leading to the one called The World’s End.  After that film wraps up, Simon Pegg and Rosamund Pike will both continue on to the independent dramedy Hector and the Search for Happiness.  Simon Pegg will play an eccentric psychiatrist who sets out on a search to determine if happiness actually exists, with Rosamund Pike playing his girlfriend, and Christopher Plummer playing a “Happiness Studies” professor at UCLA.  Hector and the Search for Happiness will be directed by Peter Chelsom, whose previous comedies include Serendipity, Hannah Montana: The Movie, and the English language remake of Shall We Dance?  Normally, Chelsom’s RT Tomatometer scores would have landed that film in the Rotten Ideas, but it was saved by being lumped in with Edgar Wright’s The World’s End.\n\n\n\t\n#4 MICHAEL FASSBENDER AND BILL WEASLEY STAR IN THE PAPIER-MACHE-CENTRIC BIOPIC FRANK\n\nFor as many British musical acts dominated the U.S. charts as well in the 1980s, it might seem surprising to learn of the ones that were only famous in their homeland.  One such (novelty) act was Frank Sidebottom, who was actually a musician and comedian named Chris Sievey under a large papier mache head that vaguely resembled Pee Wee Herman (who debuted a few years before).  Frank Sidebottom went on to host his own TV show in the early 1990s, but eventually he faded from British pop culture significance.  And then, in 2010, Chris Sievey died from cancer at the age of 54, and it was discovered that he was penniless, which led to a large fundraising effort to at least give Frank Sidebottom a funeral.   It’s a sad story, and that’s probably why it’s being turned into a musical comedy biopic called Frank.   Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson, who is most famous for playing Bill Weasley in the last two Harry Potter movies will play Chris Sievey himself, and Michael Fassbender will play the leader of the eccentric rock band Sievey belonged to before becoming Frank Sidebottom.  Frank will be directed by Leonard Abrahamson of Ireland, whose first two films Adam &amp; Paul and Garage didn’t really make much of an impact in the USA.\n\n\n\t\n#5 RENEE ZELLWEGER MAKING HER DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH 4 1/2 MINUTES\n\nActress Renee Zellweger is set to add another hyphenate to her credits with her directorial debut on the independent drama (about comedy) called 4 1/2 Minutes.  Zellweger will also costar as the mother of a genius son for whom she hires a stand up comedian as sort of a male nanny, to be played by Johnny Knoxville.   The script was written by Anthony Tambakis (cowriter of Warrior), and was based at least partly on the life of comedian Dov Davidoff.  The movie will also be a look at the NYC stand up comedy community, and filming is scheduled to start there in February, 2013.\n\n\n\t\n#6 IS CAPTAIN AMERICA IN AN “ANTI-ROMANTIC COMEDY” A MANY SPLINTERED THING?\n\nChris Evans (The Avengers) and Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Source Code) will star in an independent “anti-romantic comedy” called A Many Splintered Thing.  Director Justin Reardon will make his feature film debut working from a “Black List” screenplay by the team of Chris Shafer and Paul Vicknair.  The comedy is described as being in the style of Amelie or (500) Days of Summer, which is fine if one ignores the fact that those films have almost nothing in common, except perhaps for traits that the two leading ladies in those films might share.   Anyway, the story of A Many Splintered Thing involves a guy who starts a platonic relationship with an engaged woman that he met at a charity event while pretending to be a philanthropist.  Consider this one a borderline “Fresh Development” aided mostly by the Black List distinction, and the fact that the director and writers don’t have many other credits to help categorize this one.\n\n\n\t\n#7 ZAC EFRON HAS AN INDIE ROMANTIC COMEDY AS WELL CALLED ARE WE OFFICIALLY DATING?\n\nThis must have just been a good week for young heart throb type actors to sign on for independent romantic comedies, “anti” or no.  Zac Efron also signed on for one this past week called Are We Officially Dating?  The story from debut director Tom Gormican follows three friends in Manhattan who make a pact to remain single just as they each start to fall in love.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 VIN DIESEL WILL BE THE LAST WITCH HUNTER\n\nThis week saw the release of the first trailers for Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, which made it somewhat coincidental and/or timely that this news story also broke this week.  Vin Diesel is in talks with Lionsgate-Summit to star in a supernatural action movie called The Last Witch Hunter.  Breck Eisner (Sahara, The Crazies) is attached to direct The Last WItch Hunter from a script by Priest screenwriter Cory Goodman.   And that last part right there is why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.  Anyway, The Last Witch Hunter is about, well, exactly what it sounds like… and it’s set in modern day New York City, which is the opposite of new and refreshing.\n\n\t\n#1 DISNEY IS JUMPING ON THE DYSTOPIAN BANDWAGON WITH MATCHED\n\nEverything old is new again thanks to the burgeoning YA novel market, and its target audience’s unawareness that much of what they’re reading has already been done before, and often, a lot better.  But alas, The Hunger Games and The Twilight Saga weren’t box office bombs, and so here we are.  Besides vampires and werewolves, these new books also often take place in dystopian futures and feature strong young female heroines.  One such book was 2010’s Matched by Ally Condie, which told the story of a girl in a dystopian future who rejects an arranged romance.  Walt Disney Pictures has the rights to that book, and the trilogy that it will eventually become the first book of.   This week, Disney chose director David Slade to direct Matched.  Slade’s previous two films were 30 Days of Night and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, both of which were rated “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer, and so, here we are.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"HBO, Talk, Larson, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Safe-House-Gets-A-Sequel"},{"id":"47509213419119","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Len Wiseman Will Direct the Mummy Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Len Wiseman Will Direct the Mummy Reboot\n                        Plus, new roles for Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, and Gina Carano.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 28, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup includes movie development news for the video game adaptation Spy Hunter, a sort-of-kind-of prequel for The Passion of the Christ, a new version of The Mummy, and new roles for actresses Gina Carano, Dame Judi Dench, Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, and Hilary Swank.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nNEW GIGS FOR THE DIRECTORS OF ZOMBIELAND, MEN IN BLACK, AND UNDERWORLD\n\nIn picking the top movie development story for the week, it became something of a three way tie.  So we’re just going to cover all three stories in this cover story, under the theme of genre directors taking on big (potential) franchises.  First up is the long-in-development New Line Cinema adaptation of the 1983 arcade video game Spy Hunter, which has in the past been tackled (unsuccessfully) by directors like John Woo and Paul W. S. Anderson.  Spy Hunter is now a project for Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer, whose next film will be the recently delayed Gangster Squad.  Next up is the Warner Bros comic book adaptation Lore, which Dwayne Johnson was cast in a few months ago, at which time it was compared to being like Men in Black, but for mythological creatures.  Well, the comparison was solidified this week as Warner Bros is now in talks with Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of all three Men in Black movies.  Finally, there is the job of directing Universal Pictures’ newest reboot of The Mummy, one of their Universal Classic Monsters, which has gone to Len Wiseman, the man behind some of the Underworld movies, and most recently, the remake of Total Recall.  It should be noted that just because these three movies were collectively the top stories of the week, it doesn’t mean that in any other week they might not be Rotten Ideas.  Because they probably would be.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 ANNE HATHAWAY MIGHT STAR IN STEVEN SPIELBERG’S ROBOPOCALYPSE\n\nWith the ambitious biopic Lincoln still a month away from release, director Steven Spielberg is already casting up his adaptation of the Daniel H. Wilson sci-fi novel Robopocalypse, which looks to take Spielberg back to the eye candy that helped establish his career.  It’s been known for a while that Spielberg had cast Chris Hemsworth (AKA Thor) as the film’s lead, but this week, word of two other actors were added to the mix.  Although she is not yet officially signed, Anne Hathaway appears to be Spielberg’s choice for the female lead.  Another likely chosen actor is Ben Whishaw as a hacker named Lurker,  in a role that will be seen after Whishaw’s appearances in Cloud Atlas and in Skyfall as the new Q.   Finally, there’s a third addition to the film this week, but it’s a newsworthy producer, not a cast member.  Tom Rothman, who just last week announced his stepping down as the head of 20th Century Fox, will be joining Steven Spielberg as one of the producers of Robopocalypse.  Filming is expected to begin in early 2013, aiming for an April 25, 2014 release date via Disney’s Touchstone Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#2 DAME JUDI DENCH AND THE QUEEN DIRECTOR UNITE FOR ADOPTION DRAMA PHILOMENA\n\nStephen Frears may hold the title for directing some of the best known and critically acclaimed movies without actually being known by name (in the USA, anyway) himself.  Frears’ filmography includes Dangeous Liaisons, The Grifters, High Fidelity, My Beautiful Laundrette, and The Queen.  Stephen Frears’ next film will be an adaptation of the non-fiction book by Martin Sixsmith, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, whose title will be shortened to Philomena.  The movie will tell the true story of an Irish teenager who gave birth to a son at a convent in 1952, with the baby eventually being “sold” for adoption to an anonymous family somewhere in the United States.  Dame Judi Dench will play Philomena searching for her son 50 years later, who is now a successful Washington, D.C. lawyer with AIDS, also searching for his mother before he dies.  Steve Coogan will costar as author Martin Sixsmith himself.  Filming will start in November, as a production of Pathe, BBC Films, and Coogan’s production company Baby Cow.\n\n\n\t\n#3 STREEP AND SWANK JOIN TOMMY LEE JONES IN THE HOMESMAN\n\nThe Homesman is the title of a historical drama to be adapted and directed by Tommy Lee Jones, from a novel by Glendon Swarthout.  This week, it was revealed that Meryl Streep and Hilary Swank are also attached to costar along with Tommy Lee Jones.  The 19th century drama tells the story of a pioneer couple (Jones and Swank) escorting three insane women across the American prairie (Streep is expected to play one of those women).   Tommy Lee Jones has directed a few different movies now, with his feature film debut being 2005’s The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada.   The addition of Meryl Streep and Hilary Swank makes this one his highest profile film as director yet. That wasn’t the only Hilary Swank news this week, however. The actress is also set to star in a film called You’re Not You, based on a novel by Michelle Wildgen.  Swank will play a fatally ill woman who befriends her younger female caretaker (not yet cast).  It’s expected that Jeremy Renner will also costar as the older professor lover of the young caretaker.  You’re Not You will be the second feature film for director George C. Wolfe after 2008’s Nights in Rodanthe.\n\n\n\t\n#4 TOM HARDY JOINS THE MOUNTAIN CLIMBING BIOPIC EVEREST\n\nThis is another story of a successful director casting up his next movie before his previous film is released (and in this case, while that film is still filming).  Doug Liman (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Bourne Identity) is currently filming the Tom Cruise sci-fi action movie All You Need is Kill, and his next film will be the mountain climbing biopic Everest, based on the Jeffrey Archer book Paths of Glory.  That book tells the true story of different men’s attempts in the 1920s to be the first to climb to the top of Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain.   Tom Hardy (AKA Bane in The Dark Knight Rises) has signed on to play George Mallory, the British climber that Archer’s book claims was successful before Sir Edmund Hillary (the answer that will actually score you a point on a school exam, especially in New Zealand).\n\n\n\t\n#5 HAYWIRE STAR GINA CARANO IS THE FIRST FEMALE EXPENDABLE (OR WHATEVER THEY’LL EVENTUALLY BE CALLED)\n\nEarlier this summer, one of the headlines involved the plans for a female version of The Expendables (which, to be clear, won’t be called that, because it’s not the same company).  This gave pretty much every movie news writer an opportunity to start listing all the classic female action stars they’d like to see in such a film (which usually started with Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton).  This week we learned that Haywire breakout star Gina Carano is the first actress to actually officially sign on for the movie, in what is probably closer to the Jason Statham-type role.\n\n\t\n#6 MARK MILLAR MAKES HIS MARK MANNING MARVEL (…AT FOX)\n\nOne of the most talked about trends in the last 10 years in comic books is the way that specific writers at both DC and Marvel have made huge creative impacts over each company’s characters.  Specifically, we’re thinking here of Grant Morrison and/or Geoff Johns at DC, and Brian Michael Bendis at Marvel (writer of almost every major Marvel arc from 2004 to 2009).  This idea of handing one man the keys to the kingdom has also started to expand to the movies, with Christopher Nolan acting as a “godfather” to WB’s Man of Steel, and Joss Whedon recently signing on to oversee Marvel Studio’s Phase II movies following the success of The Avengers.   This week, we learned that another major portion of the movie properties based on Marvel Comics, those whose rights belong to 20th Century Fox, are also now going to be similiarly shepherded.  In this case, the job will be going to Mark Millar, the Scottish writer best known for creating the comics that became the feature films Wanted and Kick-Ass.   The movie franchises at issue here are Fantastic Four and X-Men (with Daredevil and Elektra likely to revert back to Marvel soon).  Soon after the announcement, Mark Millar went online to talk (vaguely) about his own plans for these two seminal and popular comic book movie franchises.\n\n\n\t\n#7 IS JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE GOOD TO THE LAST DROP\n\nSinger-turned-actor Justin Timberlake has landed yet another role, this time in a romantic dramedy called The Last Drop.  Timberlake will play “a charming alcoholic working as a restaurant critic for New York Magazine who falls for a young woman and realizes he must overcome his addiction in order to have a relationship with her.”  The Last Drop was formerly listed on the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, and was written by newcomers Brandon and Phil Murphy.  The Last Drop will be an independent production directed by Peter Sollett (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, Raising Victor Vargas).\n\n\n\t\n#8 SIR BEN KINGSLEY MAY PLAY KING HEROD IN THE SORT-OF PREQUEL TO THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST\n\nAlthough Mel Gibson is entirely uninvolved, Gibson’s cowriter on The Passion of the Christ has cowritten a film that is basically a prequel called Mary Mother of Christ, focusing on the time following Christ’s birth.  Benedict Fitzgerald also cowrote the 1979 John Huston film Wise Blood, and was joined as cowriter of Mary Mother of Christ by Barbara Nicolosi, a former nun.  Casting is currently underway, with Sir Ben Kingsley circling the central role of King Herod the Great, the man behind the Massacre of the Innocents that led up to Christ’s birth.  Mary herself will be played by Israeli actress Odeya Rush (The Odd Life of Timothy Green).  Peter O’Toole has been cast as Symeon, and Julia Ormond will play Mary’s cousin Elizabeth.  The producers are reportedly seeking Dame Judi Dench and Hugh Bonneville to play Anna the Prophetess and Satan, respectively. Mary Mother of Christ will be the second film for director Alister Grierson, who made his feature debut in 2011 with Sanctum, executive produced by James Cameron.  Mary Mother of Christ will be executive produced by Pastor Joel Osteen, and distributed by Lionsgate, most likely in 2014.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#1 NICOLAS CAGE TO STAR IN SOUTHLAND TALES DIRECTOR’S AMICUS\n\nThere was a time when writer/director Richard Kelly was considered to be one of the independent scene’s most promising new creatives.  Namely, that period was after Donnie Darko, and before… pretty much everything else (namely Southland Tales and The Box).  People, however, still get warm fuzzies when they hear the words Donnie Darko, and so Richard Kelly continues to be able to get financing for his new films.  The latest such project is called Amicus, and it will star Nicolas Cage as an attorney who helps a family filing a lawsuit against a Motown Records executive who hired a Detroit hitman to murder family members for the inheritance.  So, yeah, this movie has at least two elements that help make it the Rotten Idea in an otherwise inoffensive week.  I pointed out one, I’ll let you, the reader, figure out the other.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2018, Arrangement, Mindy, Trailer, 99%, scary, mission:, and","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Len-Wiseman-Will-Direct-the-Mummy-Reboot"},{"id":"47509213421168","title":"Weekly Ketchup: SNL Alumnus to Write Looney Toons Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: SNL Alumnus to Write Looney Toons Reboot\n                        Also, Damon and Affleck reteam, and Baywatch and Manimal make some noise.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 21, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup is full of news stories concerning TV show adaptations like Looney Tunes (technically a TV show), Baywatch, and yes, Manimal.  There’s also a new movie for director Roman Polanski, new roles for Casey Affleck and Pierce Brosnan, and an unnecessary remake of The Flamingo Kid.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTHUFFERIN’ ****OTASH: SNL CAST MEMBER TO WRITE THE LOONEY TUNES REBOOT \n\nComedienne Jenny Slate is probably best known as the new member of the 2009-2010 season of Saturday Night Live who dropped the F-bomb in her first appearance (and wasn’t renewed for the 2010-2011 season).  Regardless of (and hopefully not because of) her R-rated past, Slate has been handed the reins to one of the most venerable and cherished kid-friendly stables of characters that anyone in Hollywood owns. Warner Bros wants to reboot the Looney Tunes characters as a live action/CGI hybrid film, and Jenny Slate has been hired to adapt the script.  Looney Tunes refers, of course, to the classic WB characters that include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe LePew, Porky Pig, Road Runner (and Wile E. Coyote), Speedy Gonzalez, Sylvester and Tweety, Tasmanian Devil, and Yosemite Sam.  This new attempt at a Looney Tunes reboot comes after another attempt at a reboot in 2003 in the form of Looney Tunes: Back in Action, which followed the 1996 hit Space Jam.  There’s no details yet as to what Jenny Slate’s take on Looney Tunes will actually be.  The reboot’s producers at Warner Bros include Seth Grahame-Smith, the writer of the recent Dark Shadows movie adaptation and author of mashup books like Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 VENUS IN FUR:  ROMAN, ROMAN (POLANSKI), AWAITS YOU THERE\n\nThe subject comes up (nearly) every year with each new film from acclaimed director Roman Polanski, but given the nature of his new film, it might be apropos this time around.  In a nutshell, Roman Polanski was arrested in 1977 for charges involving a 13-year-old girl, but Polanski fled to France before he was sentenced, and has remained in Europe ever since.  This has led to an ongoing polarization among moviegoers in the 35 years ever since.  Polanski’s career before 1977 included classics like Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby, and in the years since, he’s given the world such films as Death and the Maiden, The Pianist, The Ghost Writer, and most recently, Carnage.  Although most of his films have continued to be made in English, for his next project, Roman Polanski will be working in French on an adaptation of the Tony-nominated Broadway play Venus in Fur.  The comedic play is based upon a 1870 novel by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch about an erotic game of cat-and-mouse between a young playwright and one of the actresses auditioning for a role.  Filming will start this November in France, featuring Emannuelle Seigner (AKA Mrs. Roman Polanski since 1989, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) and Louis Garrel (The Dreamers).  Polanski’s next project after Venus in Fur is still expected to be D., the director’s adaptation of The Dreyfus Affair.\n\n\n\t\n#2 PIERCE BROSNAN LEADS THE SUICIDE-CENTRIC ENSEMBLE CAST OF A LONG WAY DOWN\n\nNick Hornby is a successful British author and writer whose books have been adapted as four movies: High Fidelity, About a Boy, and two different (British and American) versions of Fever Pitch.  That’s especially impressive when one considers that Hornby has only written six proper novels.  Hornby is about to hit a 50% adaptation rate (Fever Pitch was non fiction) with a new film based on his novel A Long Way Down, about four strangers who meet on top of a London skyscraper as they’re about to commit suicide, leading them to form a pact to stay alive until at least Valentine’s Day.  Pierce Brosnan, Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense), Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), and Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later) will respectively play a former TV celebrity, a single mother, a failed musician, and a teenager.  Filming has already started in London under the direction of Pascal Chaumeil (2010’s Heartbreaker), who was also Luc Besson’s assistant director on such films as Leon: The Professional, The Fifth Element, and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.  The script was adapted by Jack Thorpe, a British TV writer whose credits include several episodes of Skins (UK) and This is England (’86 and ’88).\n\n\n\t\n#3 AFFLECK AND DAMON, BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, FOR THE RACE TO THE SOUTH POLE\n\nMany movie fans probably still think of Ben Affleck and Matt Damon as the best friend wunderkind duo that won their Oscars for Good Will Hunting.  However, the reality is that Affleck and Damon haven’t produced a movie together since Feast, the 2005 horror film that was the result of the last season of HBO’s Project Greenlight.  Their production company Pearl Street, however, has still been developing movies, such as a planned Whitey Bulger biopic that Affleck would direct and Damon would star in as Bulger.  Another project got added this week to the list of potential Affleck/Damon reunions in the form of Race to the South Pole, about the true story of two early 1900s explorers who competed against each other to reach the world’s last uncharted land territory.  Ben’s brother Casey Affleck is attached to costar as English explorer Robert Falcon Scott, and the other main character is Norwegian Roald Amundsen.   Race to the South Pole was written by Peter Glanz, who made his writing/directing debut with the recent independent film The Longest Week, starring Olivia Wilde, Jason Bateman, Billy Crudup, and Jenny Slate (see above).  There has been speculation that either Ben Affleck or Matt Damon might play Roald Amundsen, but neither possibility has been confirmed as of yet.\n\n\n\t\n#4 SUPER DIRECTOR CONFIRMED FOR MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nAlthough it’s been rumored and almost expected since August, but it was this week that director James Gunn (Super, Slither, The Specials) confirmed that he will indeed be directing Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy.  This film, based on the most recent version of the team (which has led to a lot of confusion from people who just use Wikipedia instead of actual comic book knowledge), is scheduled by Disney and Marvel for August 1, 2014, making it the fourth upcoming Marvel film after Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.  Guardians of the Galaxy is also expected to be the film that really takes the Marvel Universe into space (not counting the Thor movies), and it will  be the last bridge film leading into The Avengers 2.  The Guardians of the Galaxy as they will appear in this film will be Drax the Destroyer (a deceased human turned into a huge green space warrior), Gamora (an alien former agent of the villain Thanos), StarLord (a human intergalactic cop not at all to be confused with Green Lantern), Groot (a tree who just says his own name), and Rocket Raccoon (who is pretty much exactly what his name sounds like).  Although there are a few Rotten films on James Gunn’s RT Tomatometer, the film that reportedly demonstrates what Marvel liked about Gunn for Guardians of the Galaxy was the sci-fi comedy Slither, which earned an 85% Fresh rating.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#5 THE END OF AN ERA: TOM ROTHMAN RESIGNS FROM 20TH CENTURY FOX\n\nUsually, this column addresses specific new movies that have been announced as being in development, mostly at major movie studios.  Sometimes, a news story might include as many as a handful of movie properties.  This story, however, doesn’t do any of that, and yet, it addresses someone whose influence has directly impacted the movies that we all have enjoyed since before this writer got started back in 1997.  Tom Rothman has announced his retirement as CEO and Co-Chairman of 20th Century Fox, effective on January 1, 2013.  During Rothman’s 18 years at Fox, he was responsible for greenlighting and shepherding some of the best popcorn-munching-inducing movies that we have had the pleasure of seeing (Titanic, for example).  There was also a period when Rothman became something of an easy target for resentful fanboys, especially after the failures of such Marvel movie properties as Daredevil and Fantastic Four.  Things had been starting to change for the better in recent years, it seemed, however.  Avatar, X-Men: First Class, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes were all 20th Century Fox films that Rothman surely had a hand in bringing to us. There will probably be much more written, maybe whole books, about Tom Rothman’s years at 20th Century Fox.  For now, let’s just say that it seems like a “Rotten Idea” for Rothman to be stepping down (however that’s happening, for whatever reason), just now that 20th Century Fox seems to be heading in the right direction.\n\n\n\t\n#4 VANESSA HUDGENS AND ASHLEY TISDALE GET ANIMATED FOR THE GREAT MIGRATION\n\nThe Great Migration is the name of an upcoming animated musical that is being cast almost entirely with young stars with roots in kid-friendly cable networks and programs.  Specifically, the cast will include Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale (both from Disney’s High School Musical), Logan Henderson and Kendall Schmidt (both from Nickelodeon’s Big Time Rush), and Ashley Benson (Pretty Little Liars).  What is not so specific is what exactly The Great Migration is about (though one would have to first guess birds based on the title).  The logline that is out there right now just says, that it’s about “a group of characters that encounter a mutated predator threatening to destroy the balance of their environment.”  Of course, that can also describe the premise of LOST. The Great Migration was written by former child star Kevin G. Schmidt (Cheaper by the Dozen, The Butterfly Effect), but it’s unclear based on the initial reports exactly who will be directing.  Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, The Forbidden Kingdom) is one of the producers behind CMI Entertainment, the production company behind this independent animated production.\n\n\n\t\n#3 THE BAYWATCH MOVIE GETS HELP FROM THE RENO 911 POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\nParamount Pictures is still planning on bringing back the red swimsuits of Baywatch through a new theatrical movie, which has been known for a while to be more intentionally comedic than the original 1989-1999 TV series.  It’s been known for a while that the screenwriter working on the Baywatch movie is Peter Tolan (cowriter of Analyze This, Just Like Heaven), with comparisons being made to Stripes.  Baywatch doesn’t seem to have much in common with Stripes, but Stripes is generally considered a great comedy, and savvy Hollywood types know that one of the secrets to success is comparing yourself to good movies.  The comparison might also have come up because Ivan Reitman directed Stripes, and he’s also one of the Baywatch movie’s producers.  Anyway, the news this week is that a) Paramount still wants to make a Baywatch movie, and b) the director that they’ve recruited is Robert Ben Garant, the former member of The State who cocreated Reno 911!, directed Reno 911: Miami, and has with Tom Lennon cowritten the Night at the Museum movies.  What’s “rotten” about this story isn’t so much Mr. Garant’s body of work itself, but just that first part: Paramount still wants to make a Baywatch movie.\n\n\n\t\n#2 MANIMAL IS YET ANOTHER 1980S TV SHOW THAT MIGHT BECOME AN ACTUAL BIG SCREEN MOVIE \n\nNostalgia is a powerful, nigh-unquenchable force.  There was a time when nostalgia for the 1960s was the big thing in Hollywood, but the 1970s got only a portion of that.  When it came time for people to start reflecting all misty-eyed for the 1980s (which was really quite a while ago now), however, Hollywood types latched onto to the Reagan years, and they still haven’t given up.  Nostalgic movie projects can take a few different forms (remakes, reboots, cartoon adaptations, etc), so that means there’s actually way more sources to adapt that there will ever (hopefully) actually be produced movies based on those properties.  That, at least, is probably why it’s taken this long for someone like Sony Pictures Animation to get around to announcing plans for a Manimal movie.   Manimal was of course a short lived NBC detective show starring the late Simon MacCorkindale as a shapeshifter who uses his abilities to solve crimes.  The show wasn’t that great, but even so, it was still ahead of its time.  If Manimal had been made twenty years later, even if it was just “meh,” it probably could have gotten closer to 8 seasons instead of just 8 episodes.  Anyway, the plan is for Sony Pictures Animation to produce Manimal as a live action/CGI combination, which probably just means that the CGI will be used for the various animals, which is probably a lot easier than working with real panthers and such.  To close, this is where this article should point out that Sony Pictures Animation was the studio behind The Smurfs, and they’re also developing a CGI/live action adaptation of another 1980s NBC TV show, ALF.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THIS WEEK IN UNNECESSARY REMAKES: THE FLAMINGO KID\n\nIt’s rather easy and fun to joke about Hollywood’s attempts to remake or adapt corny properties like, say, Baywatch or Manimal.  One of the core rules of remakes and adaptations, however, is that it’s often easier to make a good film from “meh” material, because the standard starts out so low, you can only go up (maybe).  The reason for that rule is that the opposite is usually also seen as true: trying to remake a film that was great the first time is usually a losing proposition.   One movie that was quite good the first time was 1984’s The Flamingo Kid, which starred Matt Dillon as a young guy working at a Long Island beach resort in the 1960s.  The Flamingo Kid was directed by Garry Marshall back before he retreated into Julia Roberts romantic comedies.  The movie works, which is probably why it has an 88% Fresh rating on the RT Tomatometer.  Anyway, despite all of that, Walt Disney Pictures and producer Brett Ratner are teaming up on a remake of The Flamingo Kid.  It will be adapted by Nzingha Stewart, who coproduced For Colored Girls with Tyler Perry, and has directed music videos for Jay Z and 50 Cent.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Prime","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-SNL-Alumnus-to-Write-Looney-Toons-Reboot"},{"id":"47509213428339","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Metal Gear Solid Movie On Its Way?","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Metal Gear Solid Movie On Its Way?\n                        Plus, new roles for Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Ryan Gosling, and a boy raised by whales.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 31, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nIn this week leading up to the Labor Day weekend (and the de facto end of the 2012 summer season), the Hollywood movie development news cycle went into one of its slower periods.  Where normally there might be 20 to 35 major news stories that are considered for inclusion in the Weekly Ketchup, this week, there were basically just ten, and they all are included below.  Making the grade this week are news stories for such stars as Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael Douglas, Ryan Gosling, and Prometheus stars Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWATCH OUT: METAL GEAR SOLID IS TRYING TO STEALTHILY SNEAK ITS WAY INTO MOVIE THEATERS\n\nBox office and critical success continues to elude video game adaptations, as a film form, in a way that hasn’t been a problem for comic book adaptations now, by and large, for well over ten years.  The man who was central to Marvel’s success in those early years, in the time of films such as Spider-Man and X-Men, was Avi Arad.  And now, those two jigsaw pieces have come together in the form of Konami’s announcement that Avi Arad has come aboard to produce the long-in-development Metal Gear Solid movie.  Metal Gear Solid was of course one of the most popular games for the original Sony PlayStation upon its release in 1998, leading to a franchise of Metal Gear games that has collectively sold over 30 million copies worldwide.  Central to almost all Metal Gear games is the concept of stealth, as the main character is usually master spy and saboteur Solid Snake (voiced in English by X-Men writer David Hayter, by the way).  It’s also worth noting that this reinvigorated development of a potential Metal Gear Solid movie comes not that long after the news earlier this summer of Michael Fassbender producing and starring in another stealth-based videogame adaptation, Assassin’s Creed.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MICHAEL FASSBENDER’S WHOLE WORLD HAS COME UNDONE, NOW THAT JANE GOT A GUN\n\nMichael Fassbender is in talks to costar with Natalie Portman (who is also producing) in an independent cowboy western called Jane Got a Gun.  Natalie Portman will be playing “a woman married to an outlaw who returns home bullet-riddled and half dead, betrayed by criminal confederates hot on his heels.”  Michael Fassbender would play “the ex-lover [Portman’s character] seeks out to help her defend her farm from the imminent onslaught of black hats” (presumably with bad guys underneath them).   The $20 million independent production has already attracted a director well familiar with indie budgeting in the form of Lynne Ramsay (Morvern Callar, We Need to Talk About Kevin), working from a script by newcomer Brian Duffield which was included in last year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays.\n\n\n\t\n#2 CHARLIZE THERON MIGHT WEAR THE EYEPATCH OF A WAR JOURNALIST\n\nThere’s a very elite little club whose members include Ziggy Stardust, Molotov Cocktease (The Venture Bros), and Nadine Hurley (Twin Peaks).  Figure out the connection yet?  All of them were redheads with eye patches.  Until recently, journalist Marie Colvin also fit those descriptions (almost; her hair was more auburn), except unlike them, Colvin was actually a real person.  Perhaps dwelling on her personal appearance is a way of tiptoeing around the sadder reality, which is that in February, 2012, Colvin was killed by an IED (improvised explosive device) while covering the civil war in Homs, Syria.  Colvin died the way she lived, which included covering dangerous war zones in such places as Chechnya, East Timor, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, and Zimbabwe.  And now, we finally get to the movie development part of this story.  Charlize Theron and producer Basil Iwanyk (The Town, We Are Marshall) have optioned the film rights to the Vanity Fair article, “Marie Colvin’s Private War.”  That piece by Marie Brenner specifically told the story of how Colvin smuggled herself and (also now deceased) photojournalist Remi Ochlik into Syria to cover the civil war.  Charlize Theron’s interest as producer may also (and presumably will) include her playing Marie Colvin herself, but Theron isn’t technically attached as the possible film’s star, yet.  One possible obstacle is that Charlize Theron (37) is nearly 20 years younger than Marie Colvin was when she went to Syria (56).  Of course, if she does star in this film, it also wouldn’t be the first time Theron has changed her appearance for a film (Monster, North Country, etc).\n\n\n\t\n#3 RYAN GOSLING KNOWS HOW TO CATCH A MONSTER (BUT DOES HE KNOW HOW TO DIRECT?)\n\nThe first thing this writer thought of when he heard the taglines for this story (noir fantasy with a female protagonist) was the 2011 Zack Snyder-directed flop Sucker Punch.  That may be why this story’s logline is quick to also include “modern day.”  The bigger part of the headline also involves the director, which is former MMC member Ryan Gosling, making his directorial and screenwriting debuts.  The independent film in question is entitled How to Catch a Monster, and it will feature Christina Hendricks (who also costarred with Gosling in Drive) as a single mother who finds “a road leading to an underwater town.”  Filming is expected to start sometime in the spring of 2013.\n\n\t\n#4 MICHAEL DOUGLAS FOLLOWS LIBERACE WITH RONALD REAGAN IN REYKJAVIK\n\nFor most of his career, Michael Douglas was never one of those actors who particularly specialized in playing real life characters, or historical figures (unless I’m forgetting a film, which I’m sure commenters will point out).  However, now that Douglas is approaching his 70s, he appears to be changing that profile, either deliberately or coincidentally.  Douglas is currently filming the Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra for HBO and director Steven Soderbergh.  That will be followed by the Hangover-with-old-guys comedy Last Vegas, and then likely after that, Michael Douglas will be returning with another very famous celebrity portrayal.  Douglas has signed on to star as President Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, a drama about the 1986 peace summit in Iceland between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev (who hasn’t been cast yet).  Ridley Scott had previously been attached to direct Reykjavik, but he has since dropped out (probably due to Scott’s always full slate of film projects).  Instead, Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) will be directing Reykjavic from a script by Kevin Hood (Becoming Jane).  Filming is scheduled to start in March, 2013 on location in Germany, which will be standing in for Reykjavic and elsewhere in Iceland.  To close, I guess this piece shows that one really can write about Mikhail Gorbachev without mentioning that thing on his head.  Oh, wait…\n\n\n\t\n#5 PAUL RUDD AND ZACH GALIFIANAKIS TO STAR IN THE ANGELIC COMEDY WILL\n\nIt’s pretty much an annual ritual that the director of the previous Best Picture Oscar winner will be hotly pursued by Hollywood in the following months.  This year, the winner of that distinction is Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist), but in his case, he’s not necessarily traditional, mostly because he’s A) a comedy director and B) you know… French.  Paramount Pictures, however, does have a long-brewing comedy project that Hazanavicius is interested in, complete with two comedy stars attached.  If and when it actually gets made, Paul Rudd will star in the comedy Will, set in an imaginary world “devoid of free will where every action is written by angelic scribes,” with Zach Galifianakis set to play Rudd’s angelic writer.  The scenario basically sounds a bit like the Ricky Gervais comedy The Invention of Lying because the rest of the logline is that Galifianakis’ character “quits” his job, allowing Rudd’s character to do whatever he wants (which could also be seen as sort of like Bruce Almighty).  As noted before, Will has been around for a while, with both Will Ferrell and the Little Miss Sunshine directors Valerie Ferris and Jonathan Dayton previously attached.  As for who actually wrote this hotly sought after comedy script, Will was written by Demetri Martin, formerly of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Important Things with Demetri Martin, and most recently, for an unexpected dramatic supporting role in Contagion.  The world will have to wait a little bit longer for Will, however, as Michel Hazanavicius is expected to next direct a remake of the 1958 film The Search.\n\n\n\t\n#6 DICAPRIO, MAGUIRE AND HARDY UNITE TO TAKE ON THE MODERN POACHING TRADE\n\nAnimal rights activist Leonardo DiCaprio is teaming up with his longtime friend Tobey Maguire and his Inception costar Tom Hardy to jointly produce an untitled drama about poaching and animal products trafficking in the political ensemble style of Traffic.  The project is being set up at Warner Bros, where DiCaprio has a history as both a star and producer, and a writer is currently being sought.  Although all three actors are producing, there’s no word yet as to whether all (or any) of them will actually costar in the eventual project.  This film idea started with Tom Hardy, who was “inspired by friends who are former Special Forces operatives and went on to become anti-poaching fighters in South Africa and other nations.”  Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire will also be seen acting together in next summer’s The Great Gatsby, also being distributed by Warner Bros.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 CAN MICHAEL KEATON JOINING THE CAST OF THE ROBOCOP REMAKE TURN AROUND PUBLIC PERCEPTION?\n\nMGM’s 2013 remake of the 1980s science fiction/satire classic RoboCop has gone through something of a rollercoaster ride of online fan reactions.  There had been much good will rewarded to the remake with the casting of such actors as Gary Oldman, Samuel L. Jackson, Jackie Earle Haley, Michael K. Williams, and Hugh Laurie.  Then, however, a scathing script review made its way online, and over night, you could tangibly feel millions of RoboCop fans recoil.  This was followed by the news that Hugh Laurie (House MD) had dropped out of negotiations to play the remake’s villain.  The search for Laurie’s replacement didn’t last long, however, as we now know that the role has been landed by Michael Keaton, who is himself not unfamiliar to fans of 1980s genre films, in particular.  Keaton has seemed to be somewhat missing in action in recent years; although he’s technically still been getting work, it has, with the exception of a supporting role in The Other Guys, mostly been voice work (such as Ken in various Toy Story projects).  This particular news story is definitely borderline.  The film itself may indeed be a “Rotten Idea” and a train wreck, but if director Jose Padilha can make it work, this might also mean a comeback of sorts for Michael Keaton.  That is, of course, if MGM allows Padilha to “make it work.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 TRANSFORMERS SCREENWRITERS TAKE ON COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GIANT BEASTS WITH DRAGONOLOGY\n\nThe late 2000s was a period during which it seemed like nearly every week saw another children’s book series being picked up for film rights by a Hollywood studio.  In 2008, such was the case for Universal Pictures and the Dragonology series, which is written by various authors under the joint pen name of Ernest Drake, writing from the perspective of a Victorian Era world in which dragons actually exist.  Now, four years later, Universal Pictures is hoping to revive their Dragonology adaptation by bringing aboard as producers the writing team of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci.  Kurtzman and Orci have frequently worked together as producers in the past (such as TV’s Fringe), but they are best known as a screenwriting team responsible for such films as Cowboys &amp; Aliens, the first two Transformers movies, and more positively, the reboot of Star Trek.  It is because Star Trek and Mission: Impossible III are the only spots of red in a filmography of green splotches on their RT Tomatometer page that Dragonology is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#1 BEACHED IS THE STORY OF A BOY RAISED BY WHALES. SERIOUSLY.\n\nHollywood has of late become so fascinated with the hot art of the remake that they have become the dominant story type each week in this “Rotten Ideas” space.  As a result, it’s been a while since there was a movie news story that earned its place here just because it was truly a ridiculous story idea, period.  Which brings us to a Fox property called Beached, which director Jon Turteltaub (Cool Runnings, National Treasure) is now attached to helm.  Here’s pretty much all that you need to know, in a tidy logline from The Hollywood Reporter: “Beached centers on a chubby 4-year-old child who falls overboard during a family outing, is raised by whales and goes on to become an Olympic swimmer.”  It’s rare enough nowadays that a premise dares to be so completely nonsensical that this one is almost refreshing in its “Who needs logic?” mental gymnastics.  I was going to fill this article with questions about how-exactly-does-that-work, but I think I’ll leave them to the commenters down below to point out.   Beached got its start as a script by screenwriter Ted Griffin (cowriter of Tower Heist, Matchstick Men), and the most recent draft was by Jordan Roberts (March of the Penguins).\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Box, Baby, Chernobyl, RT21","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Metal-Gear-Solid-Movie-On-Its-Way"},{"id":"47509216191112","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy Gets Another Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: The Mummy Gets Another Reboot\n                        Plus, biopics for Grace Kelly, Hank Aaron, and Pam Grier.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 6, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup was carefully compiled for you, as Greg Dean Schmitz had to sort through dozens of stories that were posted over the weekend in attempts to trick movie fans into believing various flights of April Fools fancy.  Stories that came out this week that actually are real include reboots of The Mummy and Summer School, movies based on the lives of actresses Grace Kelly and Pam Grier, baseball great Hank Aaron, and Apple founder Steve Jobs, and sequels for Captain America, The Hunger Games and The Woman in Black.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nUNIVERSAL PICTURES REBOOTING THE MUMMY… AGAIN\n\nIt was just thirteen years ago next month that Universal Pictures bombastically rebooted one of their classic monster properties as The Mummy, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and millions of CGI grains of sand.   That film led to two sequels and a spin off series for The Scorpion King.  Rather than continue the franchise with a fourth film, Universal Pictures is now developing a new reboot of The Mummy.  Screenwriter Jon Spaihts has been hired to bring the franchise back to its roots in the “dark, scary source material, and simultaneously open it up to an epic scale we haven’t seen before.”  Jon Spaihts’ previous film credit is another movie with lots of swirling CGI bits, last year’s The Darkest Hour.  Jon Spaihts was also the original writer of Ridley Scott’s Prometheus before Damon Lindelof (LOST) came aboard for rewrites.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 CAPTAIN AMERICA, THE SECOND MOVIE, IS ALMOST EXACTLY TWO YEARS AWAY \n\nIt’s been known for a while that Disney and Marvel Studios had slotted two mystery projects for release dates on April 4th and May 16th in 2014.  This week, the two studios revealed, almost to the day two years ahead, that it will be the Captain America sequel that will be released on April 4th, 2014.  Although few other details are known yet, the sequel is known to be continuing the story following The Avengers, as Captain America (Chris Evans) continues to acclimate to living in the 21st century and find his role in our modern world.  Just last week, a short list was revealed of directors that Marvel is currently considering for the Captain America sequel.  That list includes F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job, Law Abiding Citizen), George Nolfi (The Adjustment Bureau) and Community creators Joe and Anthony Russo (You, Me and Dupree).   As for what the second Marvel release might be in 2014, strong possibilities include Ant-Man, Doctor Strange and (perhaps most likely) The Avengers 2.\n\n\n\t\n#2 HANK AARON GETS A BIOPIC AND THE NATURAL CHOICE FOR DIRECTOR\n\nThe critical and box office success last year of Moneyball has some pundits and producers wondering if there’s a new and growing movie audience for true baseball stories.   One project that is currently in the works is 42, about the relationship between Jackie Robinson and Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey (to be played by Harrison Ford).  This week, Jackie Robinson got some competition as Hank Aaron (who’s still alive and kicking at the age of 78, by the way) has sold his life rights in a deal that includes the Howard Bryant book The Last Hero: The Life Story of Henry Aaron.   The deal was orchestrated in part by producer Mike Tollin, whose past films include the sports movies Hardball, Varsity Blues and Coach Carter.   Tollin isn’t the only one with baseball movie experience, as the director that has been hired for the Hank Aaron biopic is none other than Barry Levinson, who in addition to directing Rain Man and Good Morning Vietnam also gave the world one of the most iconic baseball movies ever, The Natural.   The as-yet-untitled Hank Aaron biopic is expected to especially focus on Aaron’s pursuit of Babe Ruth’s home run record during his years with the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DANIEL RADCLIFFE MAY GET A NEW FRANCHISE WITH THE WOMAN IN BLACK: ANGELS OF DEATH\n\nThe question of whether Daniel Radcliffe could have a successful post-Harry Potter film career seemed to be at least partially answered earlier this year with The Woman in Black.  That film has earned over $120 million worldwide, making it the most successful British horror film of the last 20 years.  Because of that, Hammer Films is now moving ahead with plans for a sequel called The Woman in Black: Angels of Death, which will move the ghost story ahead 40 years, as a new couple encounters the haunted Eel Marsh House in the 1940s.  The sequel is being written by Jon Croker, a newcomer who worked as story editor on the first film, and also as a production assistant on the third and fourth Harry Potter movies.  It’s not yet known if director James Watkins will return for the sequel, or to what extent (if any) Daniel Radcliffe will be involved with the sequel.\n\n\n\t\n#4 NICOLE KIDMAN TO PLAY HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY AS GRACE OF MONACO\n\nAfter a competitive casting process, Nicole Kidman has come out on top to star as actress-turned-royalty Grace Kelly in Grace of Monaco.  The script by newcomer Arash Amel scored very well on the Black List of Unproduced Screenplays, and it will be directed by Olivier Dahan (La Vie en Rose, Crimson Rivers 2: Angels of the Apocalypse).  Rather than a full biopic, like several other recent films (The King’s Speech, The Queen, The Iron Lady, etc), Grace of Monaco will focus on a specific period from 1961 to 1962 during which Princess Grace worked as a diplomat with Prince Rainier III to defend the sovereignty of Monaco.\n\n\n\t\n#5 PAM GRIER GETS HER OWN FOXY BIOPIC TOO\n\nTwo actresses probably couldn’t have been more different, but Grace Kelly and Pam Grier now have something in common. Imprint Entertainment, one of the production companies behind two of the Twilight movies and also Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, has secured the film rights to Pam Grier’s autobiography Foxy: My Life in Three Acts.   Pam Grier is of course an actress hailed by some (like Quentin Tarantino) as the first female action star, with her filmography including such early films as Coffy and Foxy Brown, and her later career has included Jackie Brown, Escape from L.A., Ghosts of Mars and a regular role on the Showtime series The L Word.  Imprint Entertainment has hired TV writer and producer Eunetta Boone (My Wife and Kids, One on One) to adapt Grier’s story, which for this film is expected to especially focus on her early career in the 1970s and personal experiences that included relationships with Richard Pryor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\n\n\t\n#6 THIS WEEK IN HUNGER GAMES SEQUEL NEWS\n\nFor obvious reasons, Lionsgate is working diligently to get production started quickly on Catching Fire, their adaptation of the second novel in the Suzanne Collins trilogy that started with The Hunger Games.  This week, there were two different news stories related to Catching Fire, one helping the adaptation move forward, and the other possibly slowing things down a bit.  First, the good news:  20th Century Fox has scheduled filming of the sequel to X-Men: First Class for a start in January, 2013 with an eye towards allowing Jennifer Lawrence to film Catching Fire this fall, first.  This is obviously also good news for fans of that movie, who are looking forward to more retro back story with Charles Xavier and his mutant students.  The not-as-great news is that director Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Seabiscuit) will not be returning for the sequel after obviously being a big part of what made the first novel’s adaptation successful both as a movie and an adaptation of Collins’ novel.  We can also now expect to be deluged with stories in the coming weeks as Lionsgate begins to consider who will take over the directing reins for Catching Fire.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 KATY PERRY MAKES HER LIVE ACTION DEBUT PLAYING… HERSELF IN KATY PERRY: PART OF ME\n\nAlthough she did voice Smurfette last year in The Smurfs, pop singer Katy Perry has not yet had a role in a live action movie, but that will change this summer… sort of.  In a somewhat last minute announcement (just 3 months ahead), it was learned this week that Paramount Insurge and Imagine Entertainment will be releasing the 3D musical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me in theaters on July 5th, 2012.  The behind-the-scenes concert movie is being described as “the first ever big-screen look at the international superstar’s life both on- and off-stage.”\n\n\t\n#2 ASHTON KUTCHER LANDS THE INEVITABLE STEVE JOBS BIOPIC\n\nEvery year on the last day of March, movie fans and reporters alike get ready to disbelieve pretty much everything that is soon to appear online.  It happens almost every year, however, that one of the incredible sounding news stories that appears online on April 1st actually turns out to be legit.  The news that Joss Whedon would be directing The Avengers was actually one relatively recent example of that.  This year, that distinction most likely goes to the revelation that Steve Jobs lookalike Ashton Kutcher has actually been cast as the Apple founder in an independent biopic called Jobs.   It’s important to note, however, that Jobs is not the biopic that was much publicized last year after Jobs’ passing, which is still in development at Sony Pictures, and is based upon Walter Isaacson’s authorized Steve Jobs biography.  Instead, Jobs was written by newcomer Matt Whiteley and will be directed by Joshua Michael Stern (Swing Vote, Neverwas).  It’s Stern’s RT Tomatometer scores that land Jobs a spot as one of this week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ADAM SANDLER AND HAPPY MADISON REMAKING SUMMER SCHOOL\n\nHollywood is full on in love with remaking, rebooting and sequelizing the 1980s; that much cannot be disputed.  A sign that such a trend is deeply entrenched is when the movies that are getting rebooted and remade aren’t just the obvious successes and cultural milestones, but also include less remembered or cherished properties.  The 1987 Mark Harmon comedy Summer School is arguably in that category.  Although Summer School did have the distinction of being directed by Carl Reiner (The Jerk, All of Me, The Man with Two Brains — he really liked working with Steve Martin), it’s often forgotten when writers or fans look back on the teen comedies of the 1980s.   And that’s too bad, because as the film’s 61% RT Tomatometer score shows, it’s actually a pretty good little comedy, with Mark Harmon playing a gym teacher forced to babysit a group of varied underachiever students during the summer.  Anyway, Paramount has wanted to remake Summer School for several years now, and this week, the project got new life.   Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison production company is now attached to shepherd the remake through development.   The next step is to find a new writer to tackle the remake, which Adam Sandler isn’t (currently) expected to star in.  One movie that Sandler will definitely be in however is Grown Ups 2, which will be his first sequel.  Sandler’s friends Chris Rock, Kevin James and David Spade are all also expected to return, and this week brought news of the first new cast member for Grown Ups 2.  Taylor Lautner, best known for his work as a teen actor in movies like The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3D has signed on for an unspecified role in Grown Ups 2, which is just described as being “fun” and that he goes “toe to toe” with Sandler’s character.  Or as might be better said for a new role for the Sharkboy kid… “fin to toe.”\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Animation, new, children's, batman","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-Mummy-Gets-Another-Reboot"},{"id":"47509214934660","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Signed to Van Helsing Reboot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Tom Cruise Signed to Van Helsing Reboot\n                        Plus, new versions of Little Shop of Horrors, The Jungle Book, and Tarzan.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | May 4, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week’s Ketchup covered a week almost entirely comprised of reboots of old familiar concepts.  Included in the mix are titles like The Jungle Book (this time in live action), Little Shop of Horrors (a third time), The Dukes of Hazzard (maybe), Tarzan (this time in 3D), and Van Helsing (yes, really).  All that, and there’s an animated sequel for The Wizard of Oz, too.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nTOM CRUISE TO REMAKE HUGH JACKMAN’S BIG FLOP FROM JUST 8 YEARS AGO: VAN HELSING\n\nSometimes, bizarre movie news stories emerge and then seem to disappear again so quickly that it seems to confirm they were indeed too crazy to ever be true.  Such seemed to be the case in 2010 when there was talk about Tom Cruise possibly being involved in a remake of Van Helsing, the monster mash up flop released not that long ago in 2004.  At the time, it looked like the project might have fallen apart because of Guillermo del Toro’s departure following problems with Universal over the H.P. Lovecraft adaptation At the Mountains of Madness (which Tom Cruise was also attached to at the time).  This week, a press release from Universal Pictures about a new deal with producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci for new versions of The Mummy and Van Helsing almost seemed to bury the lead, which is that Tom Cruise is indeed attached to star as Van Helsing.  This story may seem like deja vu for another reason, as last week’s top Weekly Ketchup story was also about Kurtzman and Orci, except last week it was about them signing on with Sony to be the writers of The Amazing Spider-Man 2.  Kurtzman and Orci’s other credits include cowriting the first two Transformers movies and Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and for receiving sole writing credit for the Star Trek reboot.  As for Van Helsing himself, the character first appeared as a vampire hunter in Bram Stoker’s novel Dracula, but over the last 100 years, and especially in the 2004 film, his specialty has expanded to fighting off all types and brands of supernatural monsters, preferably while wearing preposterous hats and jackets.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT WANTS TO REOPEN LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt, who through Christopher Nolan’s films Inception and The Dark Knight Rises is recently tight with Warner Bros, is now developing with the studio a third movie version of Little Shop of Horrors.  If JGL’s version goes forward, it will follow the original 1960 movie that starred a then-unknown Jack Nicholson, and the 1986 musical version starring Rick Moranis as nerdy florist Seymour.  Little Shop of Horrors is of course the story of the wackiness that ensues when a giant man-eating plant named Audrey II grows and grows, becoming increasingly demanding for more human treats.  The new version appears also to be planned as a musical, as one of the producers is Marc Platt, who produced the Broadway hit Wicked, and playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark) has been hired to work on the screenplay adaptation.\n\n\n\t\n#2 FROM THE HUNGER GAMES TO HOUDINI\n\nFans of The Hunger Games were understandly surprised when director Gary Ross decided not to sign to return for the sequel Catching Fire (which will be directed by Francis Lawrence of I Am Legend and Water for Elephants).  This week, we found out that the project that Gary Ross may take on instead is something that might fit in better with his other previous films Pleasantville and Seabiscuit. Ross is in negotiations with Summit Entertainment to direct Houdini, a biopic about the life of the famous magician and escape artist Harry Houdini.  This biopic is based upon the 2006 book The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America’s First Superhero by William Kalush and Larry Sloman.   That book attracted attention for its depiction of Houdini as a spy for Great Britain, and for assisting the Secret Service and other police organizations.  As such, Summit’s adaptation is said to depict Harry Houdini as part Indiana Jones and part Sherlock Holmes, and the movie is expected to be as much an action-thriller as it is a straight biopic.  The latest screenplay adaptation was by Noah Oppenheim, a producer of the TV series The Today Show and Hardball with Chris Matthews.\n\n\n\t\n#3 EMMA WATSON AND JASON SEGEL WILL BE THERE TOO AT THE END OF THE WORLD\n\nThe End of the World is the new title of the post-apocalyptic comedy from writing partners Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg which got its start as a YouTube trailer spoof called Jay and Seth Vs the Apocalypse.  The premise of the movie is that it depicts various Hollywood celebrities as themselves as they hole up in a house with some sort of apocalypse being unleashed outside their door.  This week, the cast grew a bit larger as Emma Watson (Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies), Jason Segel (The Muppets) and David Krumholtz (Numb3rs) all signed on to play themselves.  Other actors also playing themselves in The End of the World include the original pair of Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel, as well as James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson.  At one time, Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe was rumored to also be involved, but it looks like that plan may have been changed to include Emma Watson instead.\n\n\n\t\n#4 GUILLERMO DEL TORO TO PRODUCE TRUE HORROR STORY THE BLOODY BENDERS\n\nGuillemo del Toro is teaming up with Angry Films (Real Steel, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) to produce The Bloody Benders, a spec script based on a true horror story from the American wild west of the 1870s.  The script comes from Adam Robitel, who is described as a protege of director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns, Apt Pupil).  The Bloody Benders tells the true story of a family who operated a hotel on the outskirts of the Kansas prairie, where they robbed and murdered their guests using a system of elaborate trap doors and hammer-to-the-skull type murder mechanisms.  Guillermo del Toro is not expected to direct The Bloody Benders.  The producers were reportedly attracted by the way the script combines genres: “Western, horror, thriller, and love story.”  This is the second project that GDT and Angry Films are developing together, as they are still trying to find a studio home for Del Toro’s adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft horror adventure At the Mountains of Madness, in which Tom Cruise was once attached to star, back when it was being produced at Universal Pictures.\n\n\n\t\n#5 HARRY POTTER SCREENWRITER REOPENS THE JUNGLE BOOK\n\nWarner Bros has started development on a new live action adaptation of the 1894 children’s literature anthology classic The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.  For the task, the studio has hired screenwriter Steve Kloves, who is best known for his work on seven of the eight movies in the Harry Potter series.  Steve Kloves will also direct, which will be a return long in the coming for him after last working on The Fabulous Baker Boys and Flesh and Bone in 1989 and 1993.  The Jungle Book has, of course, been most famously adapted as the 1967 Walt Disney animated film.  Curiously, this news from Warner Bros came just before another announcement from Disney itself, about a book that was itself written as an homage of sorts to The Jungle Book.  Walt Disney Pictures has secured the rights to the 2008 Neil Gaiman children’s book The Graveyard Book, which won the Newberry Medal. The Graveyard Book has been in development before, but Disney’s involvement may be just what’s needed to finally get the adaptation produced.  The Graveyard Book tells the story of a boy raised in a graveyard, with his only friends being all the supernatural ghosts and creatures there (much like how Mowgli grew up in the jungle, and was friends with the animals).\n\n\n\t\n#6 BERNADETTE PETERS AND LEA MICHELE FROM GLEE HEADLINE THE 3D CGI SEQUEL DOROTHY OF OZ\n\nDorothy of Oz is the title of an independently produced 3D CGI animated sequel to L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, which of course, is most famous for being adapted as the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.  This week, the voice cast was announced.  Bernadette Peters, who recently guest-starred on the TV series Smash, will voice Glinda the Good Witch, with Megan Hilty, who played her daughter on Smash, voicing the China Princess.  The voice of Dorothy Gale comes from another musical TV series, Glee, in the form of Lea Michele.  Dorothy of Oz will depict what happens when Dorothy Gale returns to Oz to find that her friends (Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion) have disappeared, and Oz is in a state of decay (you can find out more at the official site http://www.dorothyofoz.com/).  The rest of the voice cast includes Dan Aykroyd (The Scarecrow), Kelsey Grammer (The Tin Man), Jim Belushi (The Formerly Cowardly Lion), Martin Short (The Jester), Oliver Platt (Wiser), Hugh Dancy (Marshal Mallow) and Patrick Stewart (Tugg).  Dorothy of Oz is being directed by Dan St. Pierre (Everyone’s Hero, Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey).\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 ROBERT PATTINSON HUNTS SADDAM IN MISSION: BLACKLIST AND STEALS CARS IN ROVER\n\nThe Twilight Saga doesn’t end until Breaking Dawn Part II comes out this fall on November 16, 2012, but the YA-friendly franchise’s stars are continuing to line up new roles.  This week was a big one for Robert Pattinson, who was announced as being in negotiations for two movies.  First up is Mission: Blacklist, in which Robert Pattinson will portray real life military interrogator Eric Maddox, who was involved with the manhunt in Iraq for deposed dictator Saddam Hussein.  The independent/European production will be directed by Jean-Stephane Sauvaire (Johnny Mad Dog), based on a script adapted by Erik Jendresen, cowriter of four episodes of the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers.  Robert Pattinson and Guy Pearce (Lockout, Memento) are also in negotiations to star in the Australian thriller Rover from director David Michod (Animal Kingdom).   The premise came from an idea shared between Michod and actor Joel Edgerton, and goes like this, “Pearce will play a man who pursues a group of men who stole his car through the wild and rugged Australian Outback. Pattinson will play one of the thieves.”\n\n\n\t\n#2 THE WHOLE REBOOTING-2000S-MOVIES THING MIGHT GIVE US ANOTHER RIDE IN THE GENERAL LEE\n\nWhen Sony Pictures decided to reboot a franchise which at the time was only eight years old (2002’s Spider-Man), the studio may have started a new trend: recent reboots.  Instead of having to wait decades, studios now are starting to feel comfortable, it appears, with restarting within a range of less than ten years (see this week’s top story).   The next example of this may be the latest film from writer/director Jody Hill (Observe and Report).  Jody Hill is currently writing an untitled project for Warner Bros, which is set in the American South of the 1970s, and is reportedly “inspired by the style of Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch).”  And now here’s the really crazy part… depending upon the results, Hill’s script could be rebranded as a reboot of The Dukes of Hazzard.  Originally an action comedy TV series on CBS from 1979 to 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard also became a movie in 2005 starring Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson.  If WB does decide to move forward with this Dukes of Hazzard reboot, it will clearly be a very different movie, based just on the allusion to Sam Peckinpah.  This story is a borderline Rotten Idea that can probably be best evaluated based on how much one wants to see The Dukes of Hazzard given another chance.  Another factor might also be whether or not you agree with the “Rotten” 51% RT Tomatometer score that Jody Hill‘s first film Observe and Report received.\n\n\n\t\n#1 THE STARS OF TARZAN 3D SWING IN FROM THE TWILIGHT AND RESIDENT EVIL FRANCHISES\n\nConstantin Film is a German production company and distributor best known for its genre films such as the Resident Evil franchise, the Fantastic Four movies (including Roger Corman’s 1994 version) and the recent 3D version of The Three Musketeers.  One of Constantin Film’s most ambitious upcoming projects is a CGI motion capture adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan, which comes hot on the heels of another recent ERB adaptation that featured a lot of motion capture CGI work, John Carter.   This week, we learned who will be putting on all those little ping pong ball things as Tarzan and Jane for director Reinhard Klooss (Animals United).  Kellan Lutz, who played Emmett Cullen in the Twilight movies, will play Tarzan, and Spencer Locke (yes, she’s a girl), who played K-Mart in two of the Resident Evil movies, will play Jane.  And now, here’s where you find out why this movie is the week’s Most Rotten Idea.  This version of Tarzan, which is being called Tarzan 3D, completely updates Edgar Rice Burroughs’ story for the 21st century, with a villain who is the new CEO of Greystoke Energies, the man who took over the company run by Tarzan’s deceased parents.  Here’s some more, quoted from The Hollywood Reporter, “In the script, Jane is the daughter of an African guide and is committed to the conservation and preservation of the African jungle. She eventually works with Tarzan to defeat the mercenary army of Greystoke Energies.”  It’s also worth noting that Tarzan 3D should not be confused with Warner Bros’ plans to also reboot the Tarzan franchise.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"ratings, Holiday, CNN, french, demand, Plus, Peek, screen, TV, Amazon, SDCC, President, YouTube, Access","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Tom-Cruise-Signed-to-Van-Helsing-Reboot"},{"id":"47509216001669","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Kurtzman/Orci to Write The Amazing Spider-Man 2","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

And did we mention Pauly Shore?  Really need to say it twice for it to sink in as a reality.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nMORE VILLAIN NEWS FRESH FROM THE SET OF IRON MAN 3\n\nIf you want to see Iron Man 3 in theaters on May 3, 2013 with absolutely no knowledge of what may or may not be spoilers, you should stop reading now.  Of course, it’s likely that most of what this article covers will be revealed in the trailers for Iron Man 3 anyway.  First off, there was an online story this week at Latino Review that basically confirmed that Marvel Studios was sort of/kind of not being 100% truthful when Sir Ben Kingsley was announced as joining the cast of Iron Man 3; indeed, Kingsley is playing the Mandarin, who is traditionally Iron Man‘s biggest archenemy in the comics.  That, however, wasn’t really the story that blew most fans’ minds this week.  That honor would go to these photos, which show actor James Badge Dale in a costume that is not that of Coldblood, the code name of his character Eric Savin in the comics.  Nope, that armor is that of… Iron Patriot, who in the comics is an alter ego of one Norman Osborn, who for obvious reasons (thanks to Sony Pictures and their rights to the Spider-Man movies) can’t be in any Iron Man movie.  Interestingly, it appears that Sony’s rights to Norman Osborn don’t apply to the Iron Patriot armor itself, and so… there you go.  What this will mean in the movie universe, it appears, is that the military will possibly be creating armor with Tony Stark’s technology that uses the colors and designs of the First Avenger, Captain Steve Rogers.  And in other news, William Sadler is also rumored to now have a role in Iron Man 3 as well, but we don’t yet know who Sadler’s playing.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 SPIKE JONZE’S NEXT JOURNEY INTO THE MIND TACKLES MODERN TECHNOLOGY\n\nOnce upon a time, Spike Jonze was considered something of a directing wunderkind, after the innovative critical successes of Being John Malkovich and Adaptation.  However, in the years since 2002, Jonze has only directed one film, 2009’s adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are.  Now, Jonze is ramping up to finally bring us his fourth feature film, and the currently untitled project (which Jonze wrote) has a premise that harkens back to his first two films.  Joaquin Phoenix will play a man “who falls in love with a Siri-like computer voice.” Amy Adams (The Muppets), Rooney Mara (the remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), Samantha Morton (Minority Report) and Olivia Wilde (Tron: Legacy) will all have supporting roles (with one of them presumably providing the voice in question).  Sony Pictures has acquired the distribution rights from Annapurna Pictures, the financing company run by Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle founder Larry Ellison.  The deal also included an upcoming project from director David O. Russell (Three Kings, The Fighter) formerly called American Bullsh** about the Abscam scandal in the 1970s that will feature both Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BEYONCE HEADLINES THE VOICE CAST OF BLUE SKY STUDIOS’ EPIC\n\nOnce upon a time (like back in 2008), the upcoming Disney/Pixar movie we now know as Brave was known as The Bear and the Bow.  20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have likewise revealed the new title of Epic for their May 24, 2013 project that was formerly entitled Leafmen.  The real news this week for Epic, however, concerns the newly unveiled voice cast.  Beyonce Knowles, Colin Farrell, Johnny Knoxville, Amanda Seyfried, Jason Sudeikis, Steven Tyler, Aziz Ansari (Funny People), rapper Pitbull, and Josh Hutcherson (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), will all be portraying either bugs, spiders, the mystical creatures known as Leaf Men, or the teen girl who ends up in their magical forest environment.   Epic is an adaptation of the 1996 children’s book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs by William Joyce, whose books were also the inspiration for Meet the Robinsons, and the upcoming DreamWorks Animation film Rise of the Guardians.  Epic will be the third CGI animation feature film for Blue Sky Studios directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots).\n\n\n\t\n#3 ANNE HATHAWAY’S NEXT MUSICAL WILL BE INDIE, STARTING OVER WITH SONG ONE\n\nThe trailer for Anne Hathaway’s next musical feature, the adaptation of the stage hit Les Miserables, debuted online this week, and will be in theaters before Snow White and the Huntsman.  For her next musical film, however, Anne Hathaway is in talks for a project that is considerably more scaled back.  The relatively low budget independent musical drama is called Song One, and it “tells the story of a woman who, after her brother is hurt, returns home and begins a relationship with the brother’s favorite musician.”  Song One also marks the directorial debut of Kate Barker-Froyland, who has previously directed a few short films, and previously worked with Anne Hathaway as a production assistant on The Devil Wears Prada.\n\n\n\t\n#4 MICHELLE PFEIFFER WILL BE MARRIED TO THE MOB AGAIN\n\nIt’s easy to forget this now, but two of Michelle Pfeiffer’s biggest movies of the 1980s had something very specific in common.  Her first big movie after Grease 2 was Brian De Palma’s Scarface, in which she played Tony Montana’s coke addict wife.  And then in 1988, she was Married to the Mob.  Now, a couple of decades later, Michelle Pfeiffer is in negotiations to once again play a mobster’s wife.  The movie is called Malavita, and Robert De Niro is already attached to star in the “darkly comedic actioner” as the head of the Manzoni crime family, who are collectively relocated to Normandy, France as part of the witness protection program.  It’s worth mentioning that this premise of sending an American gangster to Europe is not unlike the made-for-Netflix series Lilyhammer, starring Steven Van Zandt (from The Sopranos).  Malavita will be directed by Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional) from his own adaptation of the book Badfellas by author Tonino Benacquista.\n\n\n\nRotten Idea of the Week\n\t\n#5 ADAM SANDLER REPLACES MARK WAHLBERG IN FOOTBALL COMEDY THREE MISSISSIPPI\n\nAbout a year or two from now, when the football comedy Three Mississippi opens in theaters as the first team up between two of Saturday Night Live’s most successful alumni, you will be able to either thank or blame Battleship.   Originally, Three Mississippi was supposed to be a reunion project for Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, after the relative success of The Other Guys.  And then, Battleship happened; but let’s explain the connection.  Universal Pictures, the studio behind Battleship, could see that the movie was probably going to be a bomb, and so for director Peter Berg’s next film, the Navy SEAL action film Lone Survivor, they wanted a star commitment.  That star was Mark Wahlberg, and the commitment had to be for Lone Survivor to be Wahlberg’s next film, and that’s how he ended up not being able to star in Three Mississippi for Warner Bros.   And so, Three Mississippi gets the distinction of being the first Ferrell/Sandler movie.  Another reunion was also thwarted in that director Adam McKay, who originally thought up Three Mississippi, will have to focus on Anchorman: The Legend Continues (also with Ferrell, but still).  Instead, Adam Sandler’s director on That’s My Boy, Sean Anders (who also directed Sex Drive) will get his own chance to work again with Sandler… really soon.   Finally, another reunion that all of this will prevent was the originally planned banter-fest between Mark Wahlberg and Alec Baldwin, one of his costars from The Departed.  Instead, we will probably get a cast padded out with Sandler regulars.  Anyone want to watch Rob Schneider, Allen Covert and Chris Rock play football?  Oh wait, we already did… it was called The Longest Yard.\n\n\n\t\n#4 WHEN THE DOGS BEGIN TO SMELL EMILY BROWNING IN PLUSH, WILL SHE STAND ALONE?\n\nIn an alternate reality where Zack Snyder’s Sucker Punch was a huge box office hit last year, Emily Browning would probably be one of the most in-demand young actresses right now.  Browning is still finding work, but her name is not coming up for big movies quite as often as it might have otherwise.  Emily Browning did however make the cut for the lead role in Plush, the next film from director Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight, Red Riding Hood).  Browning will play a rising rock star whose band Plush is in turmoil after her brother (and band mate) dies in a drug overdose, and the band’s second album is a flop.  Browning’s character begins a relationship with the new replacement guitarist, but soon begins to wonder if “she may have let a madman into her home and family and that her mistake may cost the lives of people closest to her.”  Plush is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because all five of Catherine Hardwicke’s most recent films as director have been rated “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer.  Will Plush turn things around for her?  Well, Hardwicke’s got time, time to wait for tomorrow, to find it, to find it.\n\n\n\t\n#3 MALIN AKERMAN, ZAC EFRON AND GOLDIE HAWN AMONG THE ENSEMBLE CAST OF THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU\n\nThis is Where I Leave You is the title of an upcoming Warner Bros ensemble comedy about a dysfunctional and non-religious family asked to fulfill their dead father’s request to sit Shivah for seven days.  The actors currently in negotiations to make up the family include Malin Akerman (Watchmen), Jason Bateman, Zac Efron, Goldie Hawn, Leslie Mann and Jason Sudeikis.  This is Where I Leave You will be the next film for director Adam Shankman after this summer’s Rock of Ages.  Shankman’s past films include Bedtime Stories, The Pacifier, Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Bringing Down the House and Hairspray, which has the distinction of being his only film to earn a “Fresh” rating on the RT Tomatometer.  If the deal goes through, this movie will also be noteworthy for being Goldie Hawn’s first movie in over 10 years, since 2002’s The Banger Sisters.  Malin Akerman also made the news this week for signing on to play Blondie lead signer Debbie Harry in the CBGB movie, which will also feature Harry Potter star Rupert Grint as Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys.\n\n\n\t\n#2 ROCKY VS RAGING BULL IN… GRUDGE MATCH?\n\nThis story is one that is not yet confirmed as of yet, but if it goes through, it’s a movie whose promotion pretty much writes itself.  Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone are both reportedly in negotiations with Warner Bros to star in the boxing comedy Grudge Match about two aging pugilists who take on each other in one final match.  Now, let that little piece of information sink in… yes, that’s right, we’re talking about the stars of Raging Bull and Rocky in a boxing comedy.  If that premise gets you excited, well, now here’s the bad news.  The director of Grudge Match, if it goes forward at this point, will be Peter Segal, whose filmography is comprised of several comedies that were box office hits, but not a single one ever scored higher than 53% on the RT Tomatometer.  That list includes 50 First Dates, Anger Management, Get Smart, The Longest Yard, Tommy Boy and The Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.  It sounds like the news of Grudge Match got leaked online before Warner Bros was ready to make an official announcement, but a representative for Sylvester Stallone did confirm that it is a movie that he is considering.  There’s no word yet as to whether Talia Shire might be interested in costarring.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ARE YOU READY FOR THE RETURN OF PAULY SHORE?\n\nLast week, Pauly Shore, Andy Dick and a bunch of girls in bikinis got together for what was probably a wild and wacky live internet TV show on FilmOn.TV.  Anyway, the two “comedians” got talking about their time costarring together in the 1994 comedy In the Army Now.   To make a short story shorter, Andy Dick brought up the idea of a sequel called In the Army Again (along with a crack about rescuing Katy Perry from a USO show gone bad).  Pauly Shore replied, “we just need a script and someone to back the project and I’m in,” and within minutes, they actually had their funding from FilmOn.TV founder and billionaire Alki David.   Andy Dick has already written a treatment, and he and Pauly Shore will start writing a script soon.  In the Army Again will presumably be about Shore and Dick’s characters nearly 20 years later, back in the military, and getting into all sorts of wacky high jinks.  It all seems like a crazy joke, but In the Army Again has a press release and everything.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"new, HBO, Sci-Fi, Nominations, kong, australia, book, Grant, Movies, DC, History, dceu, fast, your, Christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Iron-Man-3-Villain-Officially-Revealed"},{"id":"47509216189063","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ben Kingsley Cast as Iron Man 3 Villain","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Ben Kingsley Cast as Iron Man 3 Villain\n                        Plus, new roles for Tina Fey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 13, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes movies a movie about the making of Mary Poppins, a new take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and new roles for Steve Carell, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tina Fey, Harrison Ford, Dwayne Johnson, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nSIR BEN KINGSLEY IS TONY STARK’S NEXT VILLAIN IN IRON MAN 3\n\nDirector Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) will be starting filming of Iron Man 3 in North Carolina in just five weeks, so it’s about time that we start hearing about casting, and this week, we did.  Sir Ben Kingsley, recently of Hugo and currently filming Ender’s Game, is in final negotiations to play “the villain” in Iron Man 3.  The initial release also goes out of its way to specify that Ben Kingsley will not be playing The Mandarin, Iron Man’s traditional arch-nemesis whose existence has been teased in previous films.  All that is known about who Kingsley will play is that he is somehow involved with nanotechnology.  An interesting aspect of the whole Kingsley-isn’t-the-Mandarin announcement is that when he wears a goatee or van dyke, Sir Ben Kingsley does in fact bear a resemblance to the way the Mandarin has often been drawn.  Another possibility is that this could be a situation similar to the casting of the villain in Batman Begins, where there was some subterfuge surrounding who exactly Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe were playing.  In this case, is it possible that Sir Ben Kingsley is playing a character that doesn’t call himself The Mandarin, but basically is, you know… The Mandarin?\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 MR. AND MRS. SMITH MAY REUNITE IN THE COUNSELOR\n\nThe Counselor is the name of a movie that has been moving through development at an unusual pace, when one considers that most movies take at least a few years (if not much longer).  The Counselor was the first spec script sold by author Cormac McCarthy (The Road, No Country for Old Men) (whose novels are normally sold as existing properties).  Then, director Ridley Scott picked The Counselor as his next film after Prometheus and its profile jumped up a little bit higher yet.  Along the way, Michael Fassbender signed on to star as a successful attorney who gets involved with the illegal drug business, much to his regret.  This week, the profile of The Counselor went even higher as both Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem are now in talks to costar, with Angelina Jolie also discussing taking on a small role.  Particularly because of Ridley Scott’s involvement (though Pitt and Jolie don’t hurt), 20th Century Fox is also now in negotiations to distribute The Counselor, which starts filming in June.\n\n\n\t\n#2 TOM HANKS GOES DISNEY, AS DISNEY, IN SAVING MR. BANKS\n\nTom Hanks and Emma Thompson have signed on with Walt Disney Pictures to star in Saving Mr. Banks, a film about the making of the classic 1964 Disney musical film Mary Poppins.  Tom Hanks will be playing Walt Disney himself, who spent 14 years trying to get Australian author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to sign off on a film inspired by her series of Mary Poppins books.  The film will tell the story of Disney’s pursuit of the rights, Travers’ apprehension about the project, and her eventual dissatisfaction with the final product (particularly the animated sequences).  Saving Mr. Banks will be directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie, The Blind Side) from a script by Kelly Marcel, creator of the FOX TV series Terra Nova.\n\n\t\n#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO REUNITES WITH THE AUTHOR OF SHUTTER ISLAND FOR LIVE BY NIGHT\n\nWarner Bros has acquired the rights to Live By Night,  the latest novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island), as a starring vehicle for Leonardo DiCaprio, who will also be producing through his Appian Way Productions.  Written as a sequel (and the second novel of a trilogy) to his 2008 novel The Given Day, Live By Night brings (some of) the same characters in Boston and Tulsa, Oklahoma from the 1910s of The Given Day into the Prohibition Era of the 1920s.  Warner Bros now has the film rights to all three books of the trilogy, including the third book that has yet to be written.\n\n\t\n#4 STEVE CARELL TO HAVE A …TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY\n\nSteve Carell is in talks with 20th Century Fox to star in the studio’s live action adaptation of the Judith Viorst children’s book Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.  Steve Carell would play Alexander’s father Ben in this story about a boy going through a day full of unfortunate incidents.  This movie with a very long title I don’t want to type or paste again will be directed by Lisa Cholodenko, as her first feature after winning critical success in 2010 with The Kids Are All Right.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TINA FEY TO STAR IN LATEST NANCY MEYERS ROMANTIC COMEDY, THE INTERN\n\nParamount Pictures has made a deal to finance and distribute The Intern, the latest romantic comedy from writer/director Nancy Meyers (What Women Want, It’s Complicated, Something’s Gotta Give).  In what sounds like a continuation of themes from Meyers’ previous films, Tina Fey will play the founder of a fashion e-business who is surprised to find that the “senior” who is recruited to become her intern is actually a man in his 70s.  The two eventually develop a friendship and platonic bond (though Meyers still describes it as a love story).  Nancy Meyers reportedly already has an idea as to who will play the older man, but isn’t revealing the name until deals are underway with that actor.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#4 A MOVIE BASED ON THE NON-NARRATIVE NEED FOR SPEED VIDEO GAMES?\n\nElectronic Arts has begun development on a movie based upon their popular series of Need for Speed racing video games.   EA is getting things started by hiring screenwriter John Gatins (Real Steel, Hardball) to start work on a pitch that will be shopped around to various studios, including Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros.  Universal Pictures is not expected to be one of the studios talked to since Universal already has the Fast and the Furious franchise.  Unlike many intellectual properties, Need for Speed brings with it very few narrative demands since most of the games are mostly basic racing games with very little narrative structure.   In that way, Need for Speed is very much like the titles in the recent trend of movies based on board games and toys… and that’s why it’s one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\n\t\n#3 DWAYNE JOHNSON TO FIGHT THE MONSTERS OF LORE\n\nWarner Bros is picking up the screen rights to the IDW Publishing comic book series Lore as a sci-fi action movie for Dwayne Johnson to star in.  Described as “Men in Black with mythological creatures,” Lore is set in a world where a long line of “Shepherds” have protected Earth from various monsters of myth, with a modern woman finding herself in the middle of the creatures’ return.  Lore was adapted by screenwriters Cory Goodman (Priest) and Jeremy Lott, who doesn’t yet have any produced films to his credit.  In addition to Warner Bros, Lore is being produced by Mad Chance (Jonah Hex, Cats &amp; Dogs) and Circle of Confusion (TV’s The Walking Dead).\n\n\t\n#2 GALE FROM THE HUNGER GAMES, HAN SOLO, AND COMMISSIONER GORDON ARE OBSESSED WITH PARANOIA\n\nDirector Robert Luketic (21, Legally Blonde) is set to start work this summer on a “corporate espionage thriller” called Paranoia, based on a novel by Joseph Finder.  Liam Hemsworth, who recently costarred as Gale in The Hunger Games, is signed to play the lead character as a low level employee who becomes a corporate spy (to avoid going to prison for a crime).  Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman are both also in final negotiations to costar.  Paranoia is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the RT Tomatometer scores for director Robert Luketic, whose filmography also includes Killers, The Ugly Truth and Monster-in-Law.\n\n\t\n#1 SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH… AS A SUPERHERO?\n\nSony Pictures has announced ongoing development of a superhero movie based on Sabrina the Teenage Witch, who got her start in the 1960s as a spin off in Archie Comics.  The series about a precocious, well… “teenage witch” has previously been adapted as three different animated TV series and most famously, as a long running live action ABC/WB sitcom starring Melissa Joan Hart.  This new superhero take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch will be “an origin story in the vein of Spider-Man, about a young girl coming to terms with her remarkable powers.” Probably everything a person needs to know about this project is contained in this sentence from Deadline.com: “While the tone of the movie will be edgier, they are keeping her talking black cat Salem, who here is a transformed prince creating unique love stories for Sabrina.”  This live action film is being developed concurrently with a new animated series announced in September that was described as “Twilight meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”   Director Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) worked on the presentation that sold Sony on the project, but he is not yet signed to direct, depending upon scheduling.  Meanwhile, over at Warner Bros, they already have the rights to a very similar character, and she’s been around (almost) as long as Sabrina the Teenage Witch… she’s called Zatanna.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a u=513376″>RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            \n                \n                \n\n\n\n     ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"stand-up","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ben-Kingsley-Cast-as-Iron-Man-3-Villain"},{"id":"47509216220818","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Hugo and The Artist Top Oscar Nominees","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Hugo and The Artist Top Oscar Nomineesby Greg Dean Schmitz | January 27, 2012 |  CommentsThe entire last week has seen much of Hollywood’s movers and shakers in Utah for the Sundance Film Festival, and so this was another slow news week, and more than that, it was also one of the most “Rotten Idea” filled weeks this column has ever seen. Given that the lead story is the Academy Awards, that’s really saying something, too. The stories that did make the cut include a sequel for The Last Exorcism, two other movies involving ghosts or the supernatural, and new roles for Alec Baldwin, Russell Brand, Selena Gomez, Ryan Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon.This Week’s Top StoryHUGO AND THE ARTIST ARE THE TOP OSCAR NOMINEES THIS YEARThis entire week made up the biggest chunk of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, and so there was very little movie news of much note. In fact, much of what drove movie site traffic this week was actually re-reporting of earlier news stories, such as Steven Spielberg being in talks for a Moses movie, and the quasi-Monty-Python-reunion movie Absolutely Anything (previously covered in the Ketchup here and here, respectively). Nope, the one really big movie thing that actually did happen this week was the Academy Award nominations on Tuesday morning. As with any year, there were movies that did better than expected (Hugo leading the pack with 11 nominations), movies that did worse than expected (50/50, The Adventures of Tintin, Drive, and Young Adult), and movies that did pretty much as expected (The Artist, Moneyball). A few studios reacted immediately to the results, with the two films with the most nominations (Hugo and The Artist), and one of the films tied for 5th (The Descendants) all getting theatrical expansions today.Fresh Developments This Week#1 REESE WITHERSPOON AND RYAN REYNOLDS JOIN BIG EYESThe screenwriting team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski have been trying to direct a biopic called Big Eyes made since at least 2008, when Kate Hudson was first announced as landing the lead role. Big Eyes will tell the true story of American painter Margaret Keane, whose work became famous for depictions of girls and women with unusually large eyes, but it was actually her husband Walter Keane who took the credit. Tim Burton, who directed the Alexander/Karaszewski movie Ed Wood, recently came aboard the troubled project, and now Big Eyes is back on track, with filming finally scheduled to start this spring. Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Reynolds are now signed to star as Margaret and Walter Keane, which makes Big Eyes Reese Witherspoon’s second biopic, after playing June Carter Cash in Walk the Line. Celebrity biopics are often made after the inspiration has passed, but such is not the case with Margaret Keane, who is still alive at the age of 84, and it’s not yet known if Keane will be involved with the production. Although their first film as co-directors was the Rotten-rated Screwed, all three of Alexander and Karaszewski’s previous celebrity biopics (Ed Wood, The People vs Larry Flynt and Man on the Moon) were rated Fresh, and so this story is, too.#2 THE LAST EXORCISM JOINS FINAL DESTINATION IN THE IRONICALLY TITLED HORROR FRANCHISE GAMEAlthough many movie fans are not enamored of the current “found footage” horror trend, many of those movies (like, say, the Paranormal Activity franchise) get better RT Tomatometer scores than you might expect, just by gauging the online reactions. Lionsgate’s 2010 release The Last Exorcism (73% Fresh) is definitely an example of that. And so, this week’s news of a planned sequel to The Last Exorcism lands a spot as a Fresh Development. Ashley Bell will return to reprise her starring role as Nell Sweetzer in an as-yet-to-be-titled sequel which is expected to be produced quickly enough to be released in either late 2012 or early 2013. The sequel will otherwise have mostly new creatives, however, as both the director and screenwriter were not involved with The Last Exorcism. Director Ed Gass-Donnelly (This Beautiful City, Small Town Murder Songs) and screenwriter Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) also share a background in movies that most people have not yet really heard of, or have seen. One more difference that this sequel will have from The Last Exorcism is its planned MPAA rating, as the sequel will be aiming to be a hard-R-rated horror movie, instead of the PG-13 rating that The Last Exorcism received. Since this writer hasn’t actually seen The Last Exorcism to know if that Fresh status is warranted, you can consider this one a borderline Fresh Development… which also sort of tells you exactly what an awful week this has been for movie news.Rotten Ideas of the Week#7 THE WEEK IN CAST DEPARTURES: EVIL DEAD, DESPICABLE ME 2, LOVELACEPerhaps it was the otherwise slow news week, but three different actors/actresses dropped out of prominent movie projects this week. First up was Lily Collins, the star of the upcoming Snow White movie Mirror Mirror, who had recently been announced as starring as the female lead in the reboot of Evil Dead (as basically the female version of Ash, under a different character name). That old stand by of “scheduling issues” was given as the reason for Collins’ departure, but it’s easy to imagine the negative reactions from Evil Dead fans online could have also been an “issue.” Not really that long after dropping out of the Star Trek sequel, Javier Bardem has dropped out of playing the villain in yet another sequel, this time being Despicable Me 2, in which Bardem was to have played a character called “El Macho.” Finally, there’s Demi Moore. You might have heard something else about her this week… this writer is nearly whipping himself trying to remember what it was. Anyway, Demi Moore has also pulled out of playing Gloria Steinem in Lovelace, the Linda Lovelace biopic starring Amanda Seyfried.#6 JULIA ROBERTS, ALEC BALDWIN AND OTHERS JOIN THE NORMAL HEARTJulia Roberts, Alec Baldwin, Matt Bomer (TV’s White Collar) and Jim Parsons (TV’s The Big Bang Theory) have all joined the already cast Mark Ruffalo in the film adaptation of the Tony Award winning play The Normal Heart. The Normal Heart tells the nearly autobiographical story of the founder of a New York HIV advocacy group during the early 1980s, as written by Larry Kramer. Ryan Murphy, who is best known as the creator of the TV shows Nip/Tuck, Glee and American Horror Story, will be directing from Larry Kramer’s own adaptation of his play, in what will be his third film as director after Running with Scissors and Eat Pray Love. Mark Ruffalo will be starring in The Normal Heart, with Julia Roberts playing his wheelchair-bound doctor, Alec Baldwin playing his lawyer brother, Matt Bomer playing his boyfriend, and Jim Parsons will play a Southern gay rights activist. It’s also worth noting that a movie version of The Normal Heart had long been one of Barbra Streisand’s top priorities, but the Glee guy is succeeding where Streisand is not. The Normal Heart is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because both of Ryan Murphy’s previous films as director received Rotten scores on the RT Tomatometer.#5 SOME OF THE INSIDIOUS TEAM REUNITE FOR THE CONJURINGAnother recent horror film that did much better on the RT Tomatometer than one might think was the 2011 release Insidious. Indeed, it was the first time that a movie from director James Wan scored a “Fresh” movie after four other movies that weren’t simply Rotten; three of them earned Tomatometer scores of less than 21% (Saw IV, Death Sentence, Dead Silence). James Wan’s next movie (for New Line Cinema) until very recently had the title The Conjuring (this week, that title got dropped). The now-untitled script was written by Chad and Carey Hayes, who also were responsible for three movies poorly rated on the RT Tomatometer (House of Wax, The Reaping, Whiteout). What’s deceptive about The Conjuring, then, is that the four actors who were announced this week all seem like maybe they should be in better movies than these Tomatometers suggest The Conjuring has a chance of being. Patrick Wilson (Little Children, Watchmen) and Vera Farmiga (Source Code, Up in the Air) will play a husband/wife team of “ghost hunters” who investigate a haunted farmhouse in Rhode Island, and Ron Livingston (Office Space, Swingers) and Lili Taylor (High Fidelity, Say Anything…) will play the couple that lives there.#4 THE SAINT GETTING REBOOTED (AGAIN)In 1997, Val Kilmer starred in The Saint, an attempt to reboot the Simon Templar character first popularized in a series of novels by Leslie Charteris. The Saint has been the inspiration for 16 movies since 1938, and three different TV series, including the 1962-1969 version that helped launch Roger Moore’s career (and land him the James Bond franchise a few years later). The premise behind Simon Templar, AKA The Saint, is that he is a “gentleman thief” who travels around the world, targeting wealthy criminals, politicians and otherwise evil types, in a sort of modern variation on Robin Hood. RKO Pictures was responsible for 9 of those early 1930s-1940s Saint movies, and now the revived RKO Pictures has set its sights on rebooting The Saint in a potential new trilogy of films. RKO Pictures is doing this by hiring screenwriter Travis Wright (cowriter of Eagle Eye) to adapt one of three of the nine Simon Templar movies that RKO produced, although which three they are is currently unknown. This story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly due to the RT Tomatometer scores of the new version of RKO Pictures to date (such as Are We Done Yet? and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt).#3 SELENA GOMEZ FINDS LOVE WHEN SHE NOTICES THAT THE SKY IS EVERYWHEREThe Disney Channel series Wizards of Waverly Place recently ended its four season run, and the show’s star Selena Gomez is as expected turning her attention towards a film career. These plans include having her own production company called July Moon. One of Selena Gomez’s first new projects as producer is an adaptation of the Jandy Nelson young adults novel The Sky is Everywhere, in which Gomez is intending also to star. Selena Gomez will play a 17-year-old “bookworm and band geek” whose romantic life is changed drastically following the death of her older sister, whose boyfriend turns to Gomez’s character, while she also attracts the interest of a French foreign exchange student. There’s no writer or director announced yet for this project. The Sky is Everywhere is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas partly because of the mixed RT Tomatometer scores for Selena Gomez’s films thus far, but that’s only part of the reason. This writer also can’t help but think that a movie about how awesome a dead sister can be for one’s love life is nearly as creepy as, you know, a teenage girl falling in love with a blood-thirsty zombie (or as some people might call it, a “vampire”).#2 RUSSELL BRAND TAKES ON THE BEETLEJUICE SEQUEL AS THE HAUNTREPRENEURSometimes, the hidden subtext in the announcement of a new movie is not the titles that are mentioned, but the movie that doesn’t get mentioned. In this case, it’s easy to see the thorough line that connects to Warner Bros’ plans for a Beetlejuice sequel. Paramount Pictures has signed Russell Brand to star in a live action “supernatural children’s tale” called The Hauntrepreneur, about an expert (Brand) who is hired by a family to build a haunted house in their neighborhood. The concept is also similar to the plans for a movie based upon the British TV series Rentaghost, which Russell Brand was formerly attached to star in (until he was eventually replaced by Ben Stiller). The Hauntrepeneur doesn’t have a director yet, and it got its start at Paramount as a spec script sold by screenwriter Scott Rosenberg (Con Air, Gone in Sixty Seconds; cowriter of Kangaroo Jack). The mostly Rotten RT Tomatometer track records of both Scott Rosenberg and Russell Brand are both part of why The Hauntrepreneur is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 THOR‘S LITTLE BROTHER TO PLAY A TIME TRAVEL-INVENTING “SCIENTIST” IN TIMELESSAustralian actor Liam Hemsworth is the little brother of Thor star Chris Hemsworth, and one of the costars of the 2010 film The Last Song and this spring’s The Hunger Games. And now, the 22 year old actor has already signed on to play a role that seems a bit old for Hemsworth: a married scientist with enough experience in his given field to invent a working time machine. The movie is called Timeless, and it’s about a man who tries to invent a time machine after his wife dies. Timeless will be directed by Phillip Noyce (Salt, The Bone Collector, The Saint) from a script by Bill Kelly (Enchanted, Premonition; cowriter of Blast from the Past). Although Phillip Noyce has directed many “Fresh” rated movies, Timeless is still the week’s Most Rotten Idea simply because the just-turned-22 Liam Hemsworth seems entirely too young for this role. Of course, to be fair, Jerry O’Connell was a year younger when he played a grad student who invented an alternate reality portal device in his Mom’s basement in Sliders, but… that was also Sliders.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Poppins, nightmare","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Hugo-and-The-Artist-Top-Oscar-Nominees"},{"id":"47509219192484","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Scarface Reboot in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Scarface Reboot in the WorksPlus, Thor 2 gets a director, and more English language remakes.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 23, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers another slow week as many of Hollywood’s movers and shakers were either in Toronto, attending various Emmy related events, or just pretending like they were doing either. The stories that did emerge as the top 10 movie development news items of the week include plans for a new Scarface movie, an Elton John biopic, director news for Thor 2 and new roles for Casey Affleck, Jeremy Renner, Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron.This Week’s Top StorySAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE SCARFACE REBOOTUniversal Pictures has started development on a new Scarface project that will borrow elements from both the original 1932 Paul Muni gangster movie and the 1983 film starring Al Pacino. The new Scarface will not be a sequel or a direct remake, but will instead use the same basic premise of both films: “An outsider, an immigrant, barges his way into the criminal establishment in pursuit of a twisted version of the American dream, becoming a kingpin through a campaign of ruthlessness and violent ambition.” What is being kept secret for now is where exactly the “immigrant” will be from in this third film, after the first two films featured gangsters named Tony who were Italian (1932) and Cuban (1983). Universal and producer Martin Bregman (who produced the 1983 version) are currently meeting with potential screenwriters, and there’s also no word yet about who might direct this new Scarface. The original Scarface was produced by Howard Hughes and directed by Howard Hawks (The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo) from a script by Ben Hecht (Notorious, Spellbound) (that’s a lot of H names for one movie). The Al Pacino version was directed by Brian De Palma (Carlito’s Way, The Untouchables) from a script by Oliver Stone (Platoon, cowriter of most of his films as director). The impressive credits of the men behind the first two Scarface films are listed here to demonstrate exactly how big the shoes are that the new Scarface collaborators will be attempting to fill.Fresh Developments This Week#1 THOR 2: FROM KENNETH BRANAGH TO… THE DIRECTOR WHO UGLIFIED CHARLIZE THERON?Marvel Studios shocked some fans when Kenneth Branagh, who is most associated with Shakespearean movies like Henry V and Hamlet, was chosen to direct Thor. Marvel may be setting a pattern with Thor 2, as this week, it was revealed that Marvel’s top choice is director Patty Jenkins, whose one feature film was 2003’s Monster (starring Charlize Theron as serial killer Aileen Wuornos) and the pilot episode of AMC’s series The Killing. If Marvel does indeed sign Patty Jenkins to direct Thor 2, this choice seems to suggest a story more female-centric than people generally think of when they think “Asgardian mythology.” Marvel’s Kevin Feige added a little bit of fuel to the premise speculation this week by saying that the sequel will “primarily be the journey of that character, of he and Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and how the new dynamic with his father is working out, as well as what are the broader stakes for The Nine Worlds.” In addition to Jane Foster and Sif, there are also a few female characters in the Thor comics that seem ripe for propelling the sequel’s story, starting with Amora the Enchantress, Hela the Goddess of Death and Brunnhilde, AKA Valkyrie. Marvel has already set a July 16, 2013 release date for Thor 2.#2 WAS ELTON JOHN HIGH AS A KITE WHEN HE GREENLIT ROCKETMAN?Sir Elton John and his Rocket Pictures partners had a medium-sized hit this year (especially overseas) with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, but their next project is even more ambitious than combining talking CGI garden gnomes and Shakespeare. Elton John is teaming up with screenwriter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot; cowriter of the upcoming War Horse) on a biographical musical fantasy called Rocketman. Rocketman will blend together elements of Elton John‘s true story with his music, the lyrics of which were actually mostly written by his partner Bernie Taupin. The story is expected to include Elton John’s childhood start as a piano prodigy, his time as “a young man who rebelled against his strict upbringing,” and of course, the pop star years of flamboyant costumes and crazy eyeglasses. Elton John’s many hit songs will be used to propel the film’s narrative through choreographed sequences. As for who will actually play Elton John, the pop singer has in the past mentioned Robert Downey, Jr, but no actor was officially mentioned with the announcement of Rocketman. Part of the reason for that may be that Rocketman is likely to borrow a strategy from the Bob Dylan quasi-biopic I’m Not There, and use multiple actors to portray Elton John at different stages in his life.#3 JEREMY RENNER WILL BE THE KING OF HEISTSIt has only been 18 months since The Hurt Locker won its Oscars (including Best Picture and Best Director), and propelled Jeremy Renner’s career into the stratosphere with roles in three very big action movie franchises (Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy). With those films still on the way, there have actually only been two movies since The Hurt Locker that Renner was actually in (The Town and the bathroom-break-long cameo in Thor). For his part, Renner is definitely not letting this period of interest go wasted, as he continues to sign on roles. This week, he attached himself to star in King of Heists, an adaptation of the J. North Conway nonfiction book about late 19th century bank robber George Leslie; Renner is also producing the film. During the years of 1874 to 1884, it was estimated that George Leslie’s gang of thieves were responsible for 80% of America’s bank robberies, but Leslie’s involvement remained unknown until after his death. George Leslie used his background as an architect to analyze every planned heist location, spending up to three years to plan each heist. Jeremy Renner and his producing partners have hired screenwriter Will Staples to adapt King of Thieves. Staples does not yet have a produced film to his credit, but he has sold the scripts Apaches, World’s Most Wanted and Kings of the Trail to Jerry Bruckheimer, Universal, and Walden Media, respectively.#4 DANNY MCBRIDE AND CRAIG ROBINSON JOIN SETH ROGEN AT THE APOCALYPSELast week, Seth Rogen revealed that his planned movie with Jay Baruchel originally callled Jay and Seth Versus The Apocalypse had been expanded to also include Jonah Hill and James Franco. This week, Seth Rogen talked about the comedy (now titled just The Apocalypse), which is expected to start filming in February, and added the names of frequent costars Danny McBride and Craig Robinson as well. That group of six comic actors (and real life friends) will all be playing themselves (or versions of themselves) in a story that sees them having to live together in a house while some sort of Apocalypse is going on outside, and the six friends find that living together might be worse than whatever doomn awaits them outside. One actor that appears not to be participating in this comedic experiment is Daniel Radcliffe, who Seth Rogen had in the past mentioned as a possibility.#5 CHARLIZE THERON TO INVESTIGATE CITIES OF REFUGEIn the three years since Hancock, Charlize Theron’s film presence has been minimal, with just a supporting role in The Road and a voice role in Astro Boy, both in 2009. This fall, however, Charlize Theron is starring in Young Adult (from the Juno team of Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman), and in 2012, Theron also has starring roles in Snow White and the Huntsman (as the Evil Queen) and Ridley Scott’s Prometheus. This week, Theron began negotiations with Benderspink (The Ruins, The Butterfly Effect) to produce and star in a crime thriller called Cities of Refuge. Not much is really known about Cities of Refuge except that Theron would play an “investigator” who is brought in on a case involving a murder and kidnapping that “aren’t what they seem” (when are they ever, in movies and TV shows?). Cities of Refuge was written by newcomer screenwriter Brandon Willer.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 THIS WEEK IN ENGLISH ADAPTATIONS OF FOREIGN MOVIES: THE RAID, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, SILKHollywood may have mostly taken the week off from remaking favorites from the 1980s and 1990s (except Scarface, of course). However, the Toronto International Film Festival also ended last weekend. So, there was a fair amount of news coming out from Toronto, including two stories about English language remakes of foreign films, plus a third one that has nothing to do with Toronto at all. First up is the 2006 Taiwanese supernatural thriller Silk, which Gold Circle Films (The Haunting in Connecticut, The Haunting in Georgia) has hired the screenwriting team of Marko King, Mary King and Jonathan Watters to adapt. Watters and the Kings were 50% of the six writers who worked on the 2010 Halle Berry drama Frankie &amp; Alice. The original Taiwanese film Silk was about a group of “scientists who capture the ghost of a child in an apartment and the detective charged with discovering clues to the ghost’s identity and demise.” That’s right, it’s an Asian horror movie featuring a spooky little ghost kid. Next up is The Raid, the Indonesian action movie that just won Toronto’s Midnight Madness audience award. Screen Gems is in negotiations for the English language remake rights for the movie about a SWAT team that becomes trapped in a tenement run by a mob boss, as they battle martial arts assassins and an army of machete-wielding thugs. Finally, there is the French action film Sleepless Night, which breaks the trend by not being set in an apartment building, or originating from Asia. Warner Bros has picked up the rights to pick up the English language remake rights to this story about an undercover cop trying to get his kidnapped son back from a drug dealing nightclub owner. And now, we get to the part where the Rotten Idea justification is explained, which really applies more to The Raid and Sleepless Night than Silk. At issue here is the long-standing debate over how foreign films seem to receive a certain level of attention, while remakes of those very same films are greenlit before the original foreign film even gets a chance to gain attention in the United States. Both of those films just debuted at Toronto, and before they even get a chance at their own releases in the USA, English language remakes are already being discussed. Of course, there’s no way of knowing whether any of these three film adaptations might turn out to be pretty good (as was the case, for example, with Let Me In, somewhat surprisingly), and that’s why these stories are just borderline Rotten Ideas.#3 20TH CENTURY FOX RETURNS TO ASIMOV’S ROBOTS WITH THE CAVES OF STEELIn 2004, 20th Century Fox released the Will Smith futuristic science fiction film I, Robot, which borrowed a title and some elements from the stories of Isaac Asimov. That film, however, actually started off originally as a script called Hardwired that had no connection whatsover to I, Robot or the works of Isaac Asimov (though it was eventually rewritten to do so). I, Robot went on to bring in $347 million in worldwide gross (thanks in no small part to the fact that it starred Will Smith). Now, 20th Century Fox is set to return to the general premise of a world based upon Asimov’s Robot Series with the news that the studio is developing an adaptation of The Caves of Steel, the first novel in the series. Like the movie that was released as I, Robot, Asimov’s The Caves of Steel is a murder mystery involving robots, but integral differences include a setting much farther in the future and that the human detective has a robot partner. 20th Century Fox has hired first time director Henry Hobson to work on The Caves of Steel. Hobson’s previous experience has been in designing visually striking opening and closing credits sequences for films such as Rango, Sherlock Holmes and The Hangover Part II. Hobson’s screenwriting partner will be another newcomer, John Scott 3, who is also working with Hobson on a script called Maggie, about a 16 year old girl who slowly turns into a zombie while continuing to live with her family. John Scott 3 is also a real life NASA engineer who works on the agency’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory. The Caves of Steel is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the studio’s past results with I, Robot, and also because of the massive question marks surrounding first time directors and screenwriters like Hobson and Scott.#2 CASEY AFFLECK’S CLEAR ENUNCIATION WILL SERVE HIM WELL AS GABRIEL IN PARADISE LOSTDue to its source material, Legendary Pictures’ and Warner Bros’ adaptation of John Milton’s 17th century epic poem Paradise Lost is expected to have a fairly large ensemble cast. Director Alex Proyas (I, Robot, The Crow, Knowing) has already cast Bradley Cooper, Benjamin Walker and Djimon Hounsou as the archangels Lucifer and Michael, and the seraph Abdiel, respectively. This week brought news of who is likely to play the poem’s two most central characters, Adam and Eve, as well as Gabriel, who is traditionally described as God’s messenger angel. Camilla Belle, who is probably best known for starring in 10,000 BC, has been offered the role of Eve, and Mexican singer/actor Diego Boneta (who will be starring in the 2012 musical Rock of Ages) has been offered the role of Adam. Although John Milton’s poem was primarily about Adam and Eve’s fall from grace in the Garden of Eden, the film’s focus will be more on the war between the angels (complete with extensive scenes of aerial Angelic warfare). The latest actor to join the Heavenly Choir is Casey Affleck, who will be playing Gabriel, the chief angel who overlooks Paradise, and serves as God’s messenger to Adam and Eve. This casting decision is particularly interesting when one considers that Casey Affleck’s thick Boston accent is, well… a thick Boston accent. And that’s also why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 MICHELLE RODRIGUEZ RETURNS TO LIFE (AGAIN) IN RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION 3DIf the nine years since the 2002 release of the first Resident Evil movie hasn’t been quite long enough for you to see the film, and you’re still concerned about being spoiled, stop reading this paragraph right now. Okay, for all of those folks who are still with me, here’s the news this week for Resident Evil: Retribution 3D, the fifth film in the franchise. Michelle Rodriguez has signed on to reprise her role as Rain Ocampo. Actually, that’s not the spoiler part. No, the spoilery part is when I remind people who saw the first movie that Michelle Rodriguez’s character 1) became a zombie and was then 2) killed while still a zombie. So, that Michelle Rodriguez is returning to the franchise four movies later will surely be the basis for speculation among fans. Will Rodriguez be just seen in a flashback? Is she somehow brought back to life through wacky genetic DNA cloning? Or will she just still be a zombie? Anyway, Michelle Rodriguez is joining a cast of returning actors that also includes Milla Jovovich as Alice (obviously), Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, Shawn Roberts (in a cameo role) as Albert Wesker, and new cast member Colin Salmon (who had a small role in three of the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movies). Resident Evil: Retribution 3D is being directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AKA Mr. Milla Jovovich and the director of the first film and Resident Evil: Afterlife) from his own script. Filming will be done in Toronto from October to December, and Screen Gems has set a release date for Resident Evil: Retribution 3D on September 14, 2012. Resident Evil: Retribution 3D is the week’s Most Rotten Idea mostly because the RT Tomatometer scores for the three sequels are all in the 20%-24% “Rotten” range. What are the chances the fifth film will be rated more than twice as positively?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Month, TV, Guild, Oscars, laika","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Scarface-Reboot-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509219194533","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Top Gun Taking 3D Flight in 2012","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Top Gun Taking 3D Flight in 2012Plus, Highlander and Point Break remakes, and a new role for Whitney Houston.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 16, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup sees Hollywood’s love affairs with all things 1980s and 1990s continue with rereleases of Ghostbusters and Top Gun and remakes of Highlander and Point Break. There’s also news for the Wachowski’s next film, comedy high jinx from the South Park guys and Seth Rogen, and new roles for Hugh Grant, Whitney Houston and Arnold Schwarzenegger.This Week’s Top StoryTHE AWESOME 80S MUSTACHES OF TOP GUN ARE BEING CONVERTED TO BE IN YOUR FACE… IN 3D!The current wave of 3D movies has been used to depict many things, but so far, huge mustaches have been sadly neglected. Paramount Pictures is working to correct this, however, with the news that the milk sponges sported by Anthony Edwards and Tom Skerritt in the 1986 hit Top Gun are currently being converted to 3D for a theatrical rerelease planned for early 2012. Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and Kelly McGillis were also in Top Gun, but they sadly didn’t sport awesome 1980’s ‘staches. Oh, okay, maybe there was more to the popularity of Top Gun than the facial hair of two guys who went on to star in ER and Picket Fences. The many aerial dogfight scenes are more obviously what people would probably want to see in 3D (if they want to see any of Top Gun in 3D, that is). Top Gun is of course the tale of a group of cocky Navy pilots, a sexy female flight instructor, and how they all overcome their rivalries in the end to deal with a confrontation with Soviet MiG jets (and sing, badly, a Righteous Brothers song along the way). Top Gun was directed by Tony Scott (Ridley’s brother), who went on to direct such films as Beverly Hills Cop II, Days of Thunder, True Romance and last year’s Unstoppable. Tony Scott and Paramount are also developing a remake of Top Gun, and this 3D rerelease can most likely be seen as a test to see whether there remains an audience for the Top Gun brand name. Paramount has not yet officially announced the 3D rerelease, however, as the 3D conversion still needs to be approved by director Tony Scott. Paramount’s plans join those already announced by 20th Century Fox for 3D rereleases of Titanic (on April 6, nine days before the 100th anniversary of the RMS Titanic sinking) and the six movies in the two Star Wars trilogies (starting in 2012). And, of course, Walt Disney Pictures is rereleasing The Lion King in theaters this weekend in 3D as well. Meanwhile, in other rerelease news which can be interpreted as a test run to test modern interest in an aging franchise, Sony Pictures will be rereleasing Ghostbusters (but not in 3D) next month in October in a few hundred theaters. This news comes as the long planned Ghostbusters 3 appears to be getting closer and closer to actually being made. That announcement came via the Ghostbusters Facebook page, which is a rather clumsy way to break news, but you can find it posted on September 14 here.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN: THE BOOK OF MORMON: THE MOVIESometimes movie development news falls into a sort of “well, duh” category, because the newly announced film project already seemed inevitable. But, if it’s big enough of a story, it’s still news even if it surprises no one. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the masterminds behind South Park and Team America: World Police, have just announced such a project. Parker and Stone have confirmed that they do indeed plan to someday adapt their recent Broadway hit musical (and multiple Tony winner) The Book of Mormon as a feature film. For those unfamiliar with the play, The Book of Mormon tells the story of two young Mormon missionaries who travel to wartorn Uganda in search of new converts, which leads to them having to deal with a violent warlord and the realities of Third World poverty, famine and disease. And along the way, there’s about twenty rousing musical numbers and plenty of jokes (and not jokes) about faith. The Book of Mormon was cocreated by Parker and Stone with Robert Lopez, one of the cowriters/co-composers of the 2003 hit musical (and similarly toned, comedically) Avenue Q. This story, does however, have a big asterisk at the end of that announcement: “Hopefully, it will have a big run and a big tour and then we can do the movie in several years,” said Trey Parker, who is likely to direct the eventual film adaptation. That’s right, “several years,” as in probably not before 2015.#2 SETH ROGEN AND PALS DELIVER UNTO THEE: THE APOCALYPSEIt’s already been four years now since Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel produced an 86 second teaser on YouTube for a planned comedy called, at the time, Jay and Seth Versus The Apocalypse. Promoting 50/50 and Take This Waltz at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, Seth Rogen has finally confirmed that the movie should start filming in February, 2012. The title has now been shortened however, to just The Apocalypse, due to a shift in the film’s concept. Instead of just being about Jay and Seth, The Apocalypse will also costar their pals (and frequent costars) Jonah Hill and James Franco. The basic premise remains the same, but now all four actors will be playing themselves in a fictional comedic scenario in which they are stuck together in a house while some sort of apocalypse is going on outside. “They think they’ve kind of survived the worst and then they realize they all really can’t stand to be around each other as they’re stuck in this house together,” Seth Rogen elaborated. The plan is for Seth Rogen and his frequent writing collaborator Evan Goldberg (Superbad, Pineapple Express) to make their directorial debuts with The Apocalypse.#3 HUGH GRANT JOINS THE STAR STUDDED CAST OF THE WACHOWSKIS’ CLOUD ATLASHugh Grant is the latest actor to join the ever expanding cast of Cloud Atlas, the ensemble quasi-sci-fi drama adaptation that is being directed as a collaboration between Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and Andy and Lana Wachowski (The Matrix, Speed Racer). Hugh Grant joins a cast that already includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Ben Whishaw and South Korean actress Bae Doona. Filming of Cloud Atlas started this week in Glasgow, Scotland, and there are already images of Halle Berry and Ben Whishaw filming together (other locations will include Germany and Spain). Cloud Atlas is based upon the novel by David Mitchell and tells a series of stories set across history as people in different eras and locations experience echoes from each other from both the past and future.#4 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER NEGOTIATES HIMSELF INTO BEING A CAPTIVEAfter a few months of cooling down past his recent marital controversy, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back into a series of negotiations that will keep the bodybuilder-turned-actor-turned-governor very busy, post politics. Following the neo-Western Last Stand and a supporting role in The Expendables 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s third film is likely to be the independent action drama Captive. If the negotiations go through, Schwarzenegger will play a wealthy American real estate tycoon who is kidnapped while living in Brazil, and must figure out a way out of an armored truck that is buried in a Sao Paolo landfill. Captive, in other words, sounds a bit like last year’s Buried (starring Ryan Reynolds in a box), except that the addition of a second storyline involving a detective searching for Schwarzenegger expands the setting quite a bit. The Captive script was written by Benjamin van der Veen (cowriter of Che) and Kario Salem (HBO’S The Rat Pack and Don King: Only in America). First time director Nicolai Fuglsig was originally expected to direct Captive, but he has since moved on to working on a futuristic retelling of Robin Hood instead, while the producers of Captive continue to look for a director.#5 SCRAPPY NEWCOMER DUSTIN HOFFMAN MAKES HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WITH QUARTETMovie fans with a sense of history may know (or remember!) about the time in the late 1960s when Dustin Hoffman was considered one of a group of young actors bucking the Hollywood system with roles in movies like The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy. Now 74, Hoffman hasn’t been considered a newcomer in Hollywood for a long, long, long time. But, that all changes this week, as Hoffman has started filming his directorial debut, Quartet, in the UK. Quartet is based upon a stage play by screenwriter Ronald Harwood, who also adapted this film’s screenplay. Ronald Harwood was nominated for an Oscar for The Dresser and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and won an Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist. Quartet tells the story of the residents of a retirement home for retired opera singers who collaborate each year on Giuseppe Verdi’s birthday to raise funds for their home. The cast of veteran British (and at least one Scottish) actors includes Dame Maggie Smith, Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins and Sheridan Smith.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 ONE OF THOSE WACKY TWILIGHT KIDS WILL BE OLIVIA TWISTEDAshley Greene, the 24 year old actress best known for playing Edward’s adopted sister Alice Cullen in the Twilight Saga movies, has landed the lead role in a movie called Olivia Twisted. Based upon the classic Victorian novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, Olivia Twisted will be an “ultra modern” reimagination that gender swaps the lead role into being Olivia, the leader of a gang of criminal street urchins who find themselves in the midst of a gang war after a kidnapping plot goes bad. Oliver Twist has been adapted to film a few times before, including a 1948 David Lean adaptation, the musical Oliver! in 1968, Roman Polanski’s 2005 version and the 1998 Walt Disney Pictures animated kitty cat movie Oliver and Company. Olivia Twisted was adapted by newcomer screenwriter Michael Roberts, and is also described as having a “Gothic backdrop,” which, considering the setting, probably refers more to a predominance of black clothing and eye shadow than the architectural style. There’s no word yet on who will be directing Olivia Twisted.#3 EXPECT THE HIGHLANDER REBOOT TO ARRIVE MORE THAN 28 WEEKS LATERSpanish thriller director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto, 28 Weeks Later) has been attached for a while to direct the reboot/remake of The Crow. This week, Fresnadillo added another reboot to his upcoming slate as he is now in negotiations with Summit Entertainment to direct the reboot of Highlander as well. Director Justin Lin had formerly been attached to the project, but he dropped out following the success of Fast Five, which led to Lin being attached to direct the sixth Fast and the Furious film as well. Highlander was of course the 1986 film starring Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery as members of an immortal race locked in a centuries old conflict centered around the motto, “There can be only one.” Multiple sequels, a long running TV series and now this remake, however, apparently prove that there can be more than one version of Highlander. The current reboot script was originally written by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (cowriters of Iron Man and Punisher: War Zone), and has since been rewritten by Melissa Rosenberg, the screenwriter who adapted the five movies of The Twilight Saga.#2 WHITNEY HOUSTON TO RETURN TO THE BIG SCREEN IN SPARKLEHollywood has been trying to get a remake of the 1976 musical Sparkle going ever since the 2001 death of rising star Aaliyah (the 10th anniversary of which was just this past August 25th, by the way). Back then, the Sparkle remake was set up at Warner Bros, but in the decade since, the studio put Sparkle into turnaround, and it is now a Sony Pictures property. That studio has announced that the three performers now in negotiations (or signed) to star in Sparkle are American Idol winner Jordin Sparks (Sparks, Sparkle… cute, Sony), Mike Epps (of the Friday series of comedies) and (here is the real shocker), Whitney Houston. The original 1976 film was inspired by the story of the Supremes, and told a fictional story of three sisters who rise from being church choir singers to being national pop stars, until their sudden fame causes their personal lives to unravel. Jordin Sparks will play the trio’s leader, Whitney Houston is in talks to play the sister’s controlling mother, and Mike Epps will play Satin, a stand up comedian “who marries one of the sisters and gets her hooked on drugs.” The other two sisters have not yet been cast. Mara Brock Akil, the creator of the BET series The Game adapted this remake’s script, and her husband Salim Akil (who has directed every episode of that series and also several episodes of the UPN series Girlfriends) will direct the Sparkle remake. Salim Akil also recently made his feature debut with the 2011 romantic comedy Jumping the Broom. The Sparkle remake will be Whitney Houston’s first theatrical film as an actress in 15 years since 1996’s The Preacher’s Wife, and only her fourth ever (the first two being The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale). On television, Whitney Houston has only appeared in one production since 1996, a year later as the Fairy Godmother in the TV movie Cinderella.#1 REMAKE FEVER CONTINUES ITS CREEP INTO THE EARLY 1990S WITH POINT BREAKJust a few weeks ago, the Most Rotten Idea of the week was the news that remake fever had crept into the 1990s with news of a planned Flatliners remake. Films like The Crow and Spider-Man had already long since been announced as getting remakes, but it seemed like another sign that producers in love with remakes were starting to run out of ideas from the 1980s. More evidence of this slight change in the trend came this week with the announcement from Alcon Entertainment and Warner Bros of plans to remake the 1991 action thriller Point Break. Keanu Reeves and the late Patrick Swayze (whose Dirty Dancing was also recently announced as being remade) starred in the original Point Break as, respectively, a young FBI agent and the leader of a group of surfing, sky diving bank robbers (which the FBI agent infiltrated). The new Point Break is confirmed to be still set in the world of “international extreme sports,” but the coyness of that description seems to imply that the new film may tackle other activities that the first film did not. This reboot is being adapted by screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen), who also cowrote the upcoming remake of Total Recall (starring Colin Farrell in the Arnold Schwarzenegger role). As part of this remake deal, Alcon Entertainment also secured the television and video game rights to Point Break.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, Poppins, Schmidt, Witch, frames, ABC, Logo, venice, Spectrum, toronto, curtis, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Top-Gun-Taking-3D-Flight-in-2012"},{"id":"47509217692317","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Benicio Del Toro as the Villain in Star Trek 2?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Benicio Del Toro as the Villain in Star Trek 2?Plus, some planned blockbusters get rewrites, and movies based on Where's Waldo? and a Facebook game.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 11, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers a relatively slow one, following last week’s which was full of big movie franchise news. At least one big franchise (Star Trek) does get covered here, but technically, even that happened last week, just after the Ketchup was published last Friday. Other stuff that made the cut this week includes movies based on Absolutely Fabulous, Where’s Waldo? and the Facebook game Monster Galaxy, and new roles for Steve Carell, Michael Fassbender, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood.This Week’s Top Story“KHAAAANNN” YOU SEE BENICIO DEL TORO AS THE VILLAIN IN STAR TREK 2?With the large ensemble cast already signed to return for the sequel to the 2009 reboot of Star Trek, the biggest question mark has always been who would be joining them as the new villain. The answer was revealed this week to be Puerto Rican/Spanish actor Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for Traffic, and also costarred in Sin City, Snatch and The Usual Suspects. The deal came after meetings between Del Toro and producer/director J.J. Abrams, although Abrams reportedly allowed one detail to remain a mystery even to Del Toro himself: what character would Benicio Del Toro be playing? The obvious guess (which may or may not be correct) among fans would be Khan Noonien Singh, a super soldier from the past who was portrayed by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalban in both the original 1960s TV series (“Space Seed”) and in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The sequel has been written by returning writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, as well as LOST executive producer Damon Lindelof, who also collaborated with Orci and Kurtzman on Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and cowrote Ridley Scott’s upcoming science fiction epic Prometheus. Filming of the Star Trek sequel is scheduled by Bad Robot and Paramount Pictures to start in January, 2012.Fresh Developments This Week#1 RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE RUSSIAN SPIESAlthough 20th Century Fox set plans for a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes into motion just last week, the project is far from ready to go, allowing director Rupert Wyatt time to take on another film. Wyatt has been a hot property in Hollywood since the film’s release, and this week, he appears to have found his next project. Wyatt is in negotiations with Warner Bros to direct Londongrad, a spy movie based upon the real events of the final weeks of the life of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko. Litvinenko made international news in November, 2006 when he became mortally ill in London from poisoning by radioactive polonium-210, and subsequently made death bed accusations that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered his execution. Michael Fassbender, who costarred in this summer’s other 20th Century Fox reboot/prequel (X-Men: First Class) is also in negotiations to star in Londongrad as Alexander Litvinenko. Screenwriter David Scarpa, who wrote the 2008 remake The Day the Earth Stood Still and cowrote The Last Castle, adapted the Londongrad script from the Alan Cowell book The Terminal Spy.#2 IT WORKED FOR SEX AND THE CITY, SO WHY NOT… ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: THE MOVIE?British comedienne/actress Jennifer Saunders has announced plans to write a movie based upon the popular and long running BBC TV series Absolutely Fabulous (which she also created). Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley starred in the various (and still continuing) incarnations of Absolutely Fabulous as two older women whose various traits include a fascination with staying in touch with youth culture (despite their ages) and the consumption of mass quantities of drugs and alcohol. The BBC has recently commissioned three new Absolutely Fabulous TV specials, the first of which will be air during the Christmas, 2011 season. Jennifer Saunders is currently busy working on the Spice Girls stage musical Viva Forever in London, but expects to start writing the Absolutely Fabulous movie in 2012. The premise of Ab Fab: The Movie appears to borrow its set up from The Hangover, as it will start with “Patsy and Edina waking up hungover in the empty drifting yacht of an oligarch in the middle of the ocean.” Ab Fab: The Movie will actually be the second movie based upon the series, as there was already a French film in 2001 called Absolument Fabuleux based upon the series. The “Fresh or Rotten” status of an Absolutely Fabulous movie probably depends upon whether one is a fan of the show, so it’s a borderline Fresh Development this week.Rotten Ideas of the Week#7 THIS WEEK IN BIG BUDGET REWRITES: GODZILLA, ASTEROIDS, SINGULARITY, ONE THOUSAND A.E.This entry is a catch-all laundry list item covering four different movies that all had two things in common: they’re big budget science fiction movies, and they all got rewrites this week. That last part is not necessarily “Rotten” in every case (and in fact, it might be a good thing), but there’s enough that’s “Rotten” about at least three of the four to still get this group story listed here. Possibly the Freshest of the four is Warner Bros’ and Legendary Pictures’ planned reboot of Godzilla, to be directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters). The script was formerly being worked on by David Goyer, but now it will be rewritten by Max Borenstein (2003’s Swordswallowers and Thin Men), who has lately become something of a WB studio darling (although none of his projects have yet been produced). Over at Universal Pictures, the studio has hired one of the cowriters (Evan Spiliotopoulos) of next year’s Snow White and the Huntsman to rewrite their adaptation of the Atari arcade game Asteroids. Although Asteroids was ostensibly just about a little triangle shooting dots at big rocks (turning them into smaller rocks), the movie’s story is now described as being “the story of two estranged brothers that must team up to save Earth from an alien race.” In the case of One Thousand A.E., it’s a case of a writer (Stephen Gaghan of Syriana and Traffic) with a pretty good resume signing on to rewrite the new film from a director with a spottier track record (M. Night Shyamalan). Will Smith and Jaden Smith will star in One Thousand A.E. as a father and son who crash land on Earth a thousand years after mankind has abandoned the planet. Finally, there is Singularity, the next big budget science fiction extravaganza from director Roland Emmerich, the director of that other Godzilla reboot. The $175 million Sony project was expected to start filming in March, but it has now been put on hold while Singularity gets a rewrite by Ray Kurzweil, a “futurist and AI specialist.” Kurzweil’s hiring suggests that the problems with Singularity involve the science behind the premise, which involves “a young man whose body is made up of a swarm of nanobots, giving him all sorts of human powers at the same time it brings unwanted attention from an evil corporation.”#6 MGM ASKS WHERE’S WALDO?Just a week after Walden Media and Jennifer Lopez announced movie plans for Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, a very similarly themed movie project has also been announced. MGM has acquired the feature film rights to the Where’s Waldo? franchise from Classic Media, based upon the series of books created by Martin Handford, first published in 1987. The Where’s Waldo? books (and also videogames, etc) involve large crowd shots that challenge the reader to find the thin lead character wearing a red-and-white-striped sweater. MGM is just the latest studio to start development on a Where’s Waldo? live action movie, following previous attempts at both Nickelodeon/Paramount (in the early 2000s) and Illumination/Universal (in 2009). Where’s Waldo? is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas based mostly on the non-narrative nature of the puzzle books.#5 CLIVE OWEN CAN’T RECALL WHY HE’S STARRING IN RECALLClive Owen has signed on to star in an independent thriller entitled Recall, about an NSA agent trying to piece together what exactly happened during a botched hostage rescue operation. Recall will be the first film in over a decade for director Harold Becker, since 2001’s Domestic Disturbance. Harold Becker’s filmography, which also includes Sea of Love and Mercury Rising, includes a total of 9 movies with RT Tomatometer scores, only 3 of which are “Fresh” (and 2 of those are early in his career: Taps and The Onion Field). Becker’s screenwriting partner on Recall is someone else who has mostly been (nearly) inactive in the last decade, Paul Schrader, who is still best known for his collaborations with Martin Scorsese, such as Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. Harold Becker and Paul Schrader also worked together on the 1996 film City Hall. The independent production company Moonstone Entertainment aims to start filming of Recall in March, 2012 at locations in Washington DC and Bulgaria.#4 MGM ORDERS UP SOME KILLER PIZZAMGM is in negotiations to acquire the feature film rights to Killer Pizza, a novel by Greg Taylor about “a 14 year old boy who lands a summer job at a pizza joint that is actually a front for a monster hunting enterprise.” Director/producer Chris Columbus is one of the film’s producers, but he is not expected to direct, as that job is more likely to go to Adam Green, who adapted the script from the novel. Adam Green is an independent horror filmmaker best known for Hatchet (50% RT Tomatometer, Rotten), Hatchet II (36% RT Tomatometer, Rotten) and Frozen (60% RT Tomatometer, Fresh). Chris Columbus reportedly brought Killer Pizza to MGM because he knew that the studio was interested in “Gremlins and Goonies-type fare.” Killer Pizza is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas partly because of Adam Green’s RT Tomatometer track record, but also because there are a lot more “Rotten” movies that tried to be like Gremlins and The Goonies than those that were actually as good.#3 ELIJAH WOOD IS A REMAKE MANIACLord of the Rings star Elijah Wood has signed on to play the lead role as the serial killer Zito in the remake of the 1980 slasher flick Maniac. Reasons for this being a Rotten Idea lie in the Wikipedia description of Zito, as “a middle-aged, overweight, Italian-American loner,” and the fact that Elijah Wood… doesn’t really seem like he’d be great at “being” any of those things. This remake of Maniac was cowritten by horror director Alexandre Aja (Mirrors, Piranha 3-D), who also directed the 2006 remake of Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes. The remake of Maniac will be directed by Franck Khalfoun, who previously directed P2, which received a “Rotten” Tomatometer score of 34%, which is another reason why this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#2 STEVE CARELL IS ONE OF DAVE BARRY’S LUNATICSUniversal Pictures has acquired the feature film rights to the novel Lunatics by Dave Barry and Alan Zweibel, who will also adapt their book’s script. The plan is for Steve Carell to star in the comedy about two “soccer dads” in New Jersey whose “minor feud escalates to create worldwide consequences.” Dave Barry’s novel Big Trouble was also previously adapted as a 2002 movie (RT Tomatometer “Rotten” score = 48%) starring Tim Allen and Rene Russo. Alan Zweibel’s career as a screenwriter includes cowriting Dragnet, The Story of Us and the adaptation of his novel North, of which film critic Roger Ebert once wrote, “I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.” That Lunatics gave me an opportunity to use that famous North quote is part of why it is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas.#1 FIRST THE SOCIAL NETWORK, NOW MOVIES BASED ON FACEBOOK GAMES: MONSTER GALAXYWith rumors and reports about possible movie projects based on games like Angry Birds and Farmville, the basic premise of this story is not entirely new news, but it’s certainly part of a growing trend. Gaia Interactive, the company behind the Facebook game Monster Galaxy, has signed a deal with Radar Pictures to adapt the game into an animated feature film. Radar Pictures was the production company behind movies like The Invention of Lying, All About Steve, Swing Vote and the 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror, but mostly the press release stresses that producer Ted Field also produced the Vin Diesel science fiction film Pitch Black. Monster Galaxy has been one of the top 10 most played Facebook games for over six months, based upon a game style that many compare to Pokemon… except it’s on Facebook. Monster Galaxy is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because if you’re going to make a Facebook game movie, Farmville seems the more obvious choice? (Not that the idea of a Farmville movie is particularly “Fresh” either…)For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Anna, Star, Summer, game-of-thrones, Prime, Mary, Fox, saw, Swim","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Benicio-Del-Toro-as-the-Villain-in-Star-Trek-2"},{"id":"47509219190435","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mortal Kombat Reboot is Actually Happening","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mortal Kombat Reboot is Actually HappeningPlus, a new Roald Dahl adaptation, and a Dead Island movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 30, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes new life for the Mortal Kombat film franchise (as well as another movie based on the Dead Island video game) and three different biopics (about Moses, Mount Everest, the founder of Casablanca Records and convicted murderer John du Pont).This Week’s Top StoryWARNER BROS. SAYS “TEST… YOUR MIGHT (EXCELLENT). FIGHT! MORTAL KOMBAT!“It’s now been sixteen years since New Line Cinema released the first movie based upon the martial arts/fighting video game franchise Mortal Kombat. There had been movies based upon video games before (like 1993’s Super Mario Bros), but Mortal Kombat had the distinction of being a genuinely successful action/genre film with a pretty great soundtrack that seemed to convey the entertainment of the video game to the big screen in a way that hasn’t been realized very often in the years since. That movie was followed in 1997 by the less effective Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and the video game franchise has been continuing on ever since. In 2010, director Kevin Tancharoen, who worked on the 2009 remake of Fame and Glee: The 3D Concert Movie, teamed up with other producers to deliver an 8 minute live action short film called Mortal Kombat: Rebirth. This led to a series of short films called Mortal Kombat: Legacy, featuring actors like Michael Jai White and Jeri Ryan. The reason for that original short was said to be as a “proof of concept” to show how Mortal Kombat could return as a feature film franchise. Well, this week, Kevin Tancharoen and crew got what they asked for, as New Line Cinema and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment are now developing a new live action Mortal Kombat film that Tancharoen is attached to direct. Production is expected to start sometime in 2012 (the year that marks the 20th anniversary of Mortal Kombat) for a release in 2013. It’s not yet known if all of the actors from the Mortal Kombat shorts will return for the reboot.Fresh Developments This Week#1 JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE GOES BACK TO THE 1970S FOR SPINNING GOLDJustin Timberlake’s expansion into the feature film business continued this week with the announcement of his first project as a feature film producer. Spinning Gold is the new title for the long planned biopic of music executive Neil Bogart, who founded Casablanca Records in 1973. Under Neil Bogart, Casablanca Records quickly became a label synonymous with two quite different, and yet parallel and integral developments in 1970s music: the rise of glam rock (KISS, T. Rex) and the popularity of disco (Donna Summer, the Village People, Cher), all of whom were signed to Casablanca. Neil Bogart’s legacy became cemented to the 1970s, ultimately, when he died at the age of 39 in 1982 after a battle with cancer and lymphoma. Two of Justin Timberlake’s producing partners on Spinning Gold are Neil Bogart’s sons Evan “Kidd” Bogart and Timothy Scott Bogart, who is also adapting the script. Now 30, Timberlake is currently almost exactly the same age that Neil Bogart was when he signed groups like KISS and Parliament in the early days of Casablanca Records. The next step is finding a director for Spinning Gold. A soundtrack album of classic songs by Casablanca recording artists covered by the pop stars of today (one of whom will almost certainly be Timberlake himself) is also planned.#2 STEVE CARELL TO PLAY FOXCATCHER FOR MONEYBALL DIRECTORDirector Bennett Miller appears to have knocked another one out of the critical park this past week with his second narrative feature, Moneyball (his first two films were The Cruise, a documentary, and 2005’s Capote). What all three of Miller’s films have in common is a basis on real life stories, and Bennett Miller is already lining up his fourth film which will also follow that pattern. Steve Carell will star in the dramatic film Foxcatcher, about the true story of the murder of Olympic wrestler David Schultz by chemical fortune heir John du Pont in 1996. John du Pont was convicted on a charge of 3rd degree homicide and was sentenced to 13 to 40 years in prison, where he died in 2010 at the age of 72. Bennett Miller plans to start filming this independent production in March, 2012, working from a script by E. Max Frye (Something Wild, Palmetto) and Capote screenwriter Dan Futterman (he’s also cowritten several episodes of HBO’s In Treatment). The casting of Steve Carell is significant in that it appears to mark a return to drama (ala 2006’s Little Miss Sunshine) after several years of an emphasis on comedies like Evan Almighty, Dinner for Schmucks and Crazy Stupid Love.#3 DREAMWORKS DELIVERS THE BFG; VIDEO GAMERS DISAPPOINTED BY WHAT THAT ACTUALLY ISIn 1982, children’s book author Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach) wrote and published a book called The BFG about a Big Friendly Giant who befriends a little girl named Sophie and then they go off and have magical adventures together. And then, in 1993, id Software unleashed the video game DOOM on the world, which featured the powerful weapon, the BFG 9000, and a whole generation got a completely different definition of those initials (“Big F***ing Gun”). Needless to say, DOOM fans may be disappointed to hear that the movie that DreamWorks is now developing as a feature film does not involve blasting away at demons from the gates of Hell. Although live action is not specifically mentioned in the lengthy article announcing the project, The BFG is also not described as being a DreamWorks Animation project, so the implication appears to be that it will be live action. Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, whose latest hit was The Help, are the producers working with DreamWorks on The BFG. For The BFG, the studio that Steven Spielberg cofounded is reaching way, way back into his filmography, by hiring screenwriter Melissa Mathison, whose biggest claim to fame was the script to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (as well as The Indian in the Cupboard and cowriting The Black Stallion).#4 MICK JAGGER KNOWS A FEW THINGS ABOUT BEING A TABLOID STARIt’s been a long while since Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones joined the ranks of musicians-turned-actors like Bob Dylan, David Bowie and John Lennon in 1970 with roles in Ned Kelly and Performance. Jagger has had intermittent roles in the years since in movies like Freejack and The Man from Elysian Fields, but his film profile has been much lower than David Bowie, in particular. Jagger now appears to be working to return to the movies with plans to produce and star in a movie called Tabloid. Tabloid will be an adult thriller about “a global media mogul with dubious morality” (who Jagger would play) and “a young journalist who gets seduced and sucked into that immoral world.” Screenwriter Josh Olson (A History of Violence; cowriter of Batman: Gotham Knight) has been hired by Jagger’s production company to start work on the Tabloid script, based upon Jagger’s own story idea. Josh Olson also has contributed to the script for One Shot, the movie based on the novel by Lee Child which is currently filming, with Tom Cruise playing a character who in the books was described as a hulking, intimidating presence.#5 REESE WITHERSPOON AND MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY WALLOWING IN THE ENSEMBLE CAST OF MUDIndependent director Jeff Nichols got his career started with 2007’s Shotgun Stories, and has his second film Take Shelter opening this week. Nichols started production this week on his third film, entitled Mud, which will feature a large and fairly impressive ensemble cast as part of its Southern coming-of-age dramatic tale about two 14-year-old boys who encounter a fugitive hiding out on an island in Mississippi. Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon (despite her recent head injury) were among the first actors to be cast. This week, they were joined by six more actors, including Joe Don Baker (Jack Wade from the Pierce Brosnan Bond films), Sarah Paulson (Serenity, What Women Want), Michael Shannon (The Runaways, Boardwalk Empire, General Zod in the upcoming Man of Steel) and Sam Shepard (The Right Stuff, Days of Heaven).#6 WHY MAKE A MOVIE CALLED EVEREST? BECAUSE IT’S THEREGeorge Mallory was an English mountaineer who became famous posthumously for his attempts to scale Mount Everest in the 1920s (nearly 30 years before Edmund Hillary). It was also George Mallory who gave the world the famous “because it’s there” quote about why people want to climb Mount Everest. Mallory, however, went missing during his third expedition in 1924 and his body wasn’t discovered until 1999. What Mallory left behind is a lingering mystery about whether or not he actually achieved his goal or not. Now, Sony Pictures has signed director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith) to develop a film called Everest about Mallory’s quest to reach the mountain’s summit. Liman already has several other projects in development, including the science fiction projects Luna (a heist movie set on the Moon) and the alien invasion war movie All You Need is Kill (for which Brad Pitt’s name was mentioned this week, in other news). Everest is seen as having an advantage in getting made earlier because Doug Liman is himself an avid mountain climber. Screenwriter Sheldon Turner (The Longest Yard; cowriter of Up in the Air) is currently adapting the Everest script from the Jeffrey Archer novel Paths of Glory, which attempted to fill in the holes in Mallory’s true story.#7 THE LONE RANGER IS BACK IN THE SADDLE AGAIN AFTER ALLBack in early August, the story broke that Walt Disney Pictures was pulling the plug on their $250+ million live action reboot of The Lone Ranger. More often than not, these sort of big budget movies that are abandoned are never heard from again (though obviously, there are exceptions to that rule). The last several weeks have seen many articles and reports written about the attempts to get the project back on its feet. The stated goal was always to get the budget down to the $215 million range, as long as star Johnny Depp (who will play Tonto) stayed attached. Complicating matters was Depp’s insistence that he would only star in The Lone Ranger if director Gore Verbinski (the director of the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies for Disney) was also still attached, despite reports that Verbinski (and his big action scene plans) was part of the budgetary problem. Another factor that appears obvious by the timing of when Disney initially pulled the plug was the box office failure of Cowboys &amp; Aliens, which, as a western/genre mashup, bears some resemblance to The Lone Ranger. Or, maybe, Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig just don’t have the box office appeal of Johnny Depp. This week, however, all of that became material for the history books, as a deal has been reached, and filming of The Lone Ranger is now scheduled to start in January or February of 2012. Armie Hammer (The Social Network) is also still attached to star as the title character, and British actress Ruth Wilson (from the TV show Luther) is still expected to be the female lead. What is less certain is whether this delay in filming will cause Disney to change the current release date of December 21, 2012. The new budget deal may also mean script changes for screenwriter Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road; cowriter of The Clearing). Reports during this budget kerfuffle described the premise of The Lone Ranger as involving werewolves, Native American mythology and Verbinski’s plans for what may be the most ambitious railroad action sequence ever filmed. Whether this story about the revived film should be listed as a “Fresh Development” or a “Rotten Idea” depends upon the reader’s own opinion about whether a $200+ million tentpole action movie starring Johnny Depp as Tonto is a good idea or not.Rotten Ideas of the Week#2 WARNER BROS. WANTS STEVEN SPIELBERG FOR THE MOSES EPIC GODS AND KINGSThe late 1990s was the time of high expectations for the new studio called DreamWorks SKG, and one of the nascent company’s earliest and most ambitious projects was the 1998 animated film The Prince of Egypt, which retold the Biblical story of Moses. Now, Warner Bros is attempting to develop a live action Moses movie called Gods and Kings, and the director WB is going after is Steven Spielberg (who is credited with giving Jeffrey Katzenberg the original idea of making The Prince of Egypt). At this point, Warner Bros has not yet begun official negotiations with Spielberg, but he has read the script. Spielberg already has a very busy schedule which includes post production on War Horse and The Adventures of Tintin, as well as filming dates for both Lincoln and Robopocalypse that will likely keep him busy well into 2013. Gods and Kings is reportedly based upon the life of Moses as depicted in the Book of Exodus and other Old Testament stories. Gods and Kings got its start as a treatment by producer Matti Leshem (who has mostly worked on the USA Rock Paper Scissors League Championship broadcasts). Leshem’s treatment then became a screenplay by Michael Green (cowriter of Green Lantern; writer of several episodes of Smallville and Kings) and Stuart Hazeldine, who worked on the recent Riverworld TV movie as well as cowriting Warner Bros’ adaptation of John Milton’s Paradise Lost. The catchy headline for this story is the idea of Steven Spielberg directing a live action Moses epic. However, the reason this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas has more to do with the screenwriters that have been working on Gods and Kings, and the implication that Warner Bros might be eyeing Gods and Kings as some sort of flashy Biblical action movie (in the same vein as their other flashy quasi-Biblical action movie, Paradise Lost).#1 LIONSGATE ANNOUNCES DEAD ISLAND MOVIE, MENTIONS THE WORD “TRAILER” 13 TIMESCompiling the Weekly Ketchup each week, this writer reads a lot of press releases. This week, Lionsgate announced plans for a feature film based on the recent cross-platform survival horror video game Dead Island. That press release mentioned the word “trailer” thirteen times. The reason for that is that the trailer for the Dead Island video game was something like a short film, telling the story (in reverse) of a father being attacked by his zombiefied daughter while on vacation on a tropical island beset by a zombie invasion. It’s a very nice trailer, but it’s just sort of humorous exactly how much Lionsgate’s press release dwells on that trailer, and not so much on other little details, like say, the actual video game (which generally has received positive reviews). Lionsgate’s partner on the Dead Island movie will be producer Sean Daniel, who is best known for working with Universal Pictures on The Mummy franchise, as well as the 2002 spinoff The Scorpion King and 2010’s The Wolfman. As for why Dead Island is this week’s Rotten Idea, it’s basically due to the vibe that Lionsgate and Sean Daniel are perhaps a little bit too impressed with the narrative power of a dialogue-free music video that tells its story in reverse. Do they think they can make a whole movie like that?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"japanese, 007, jurassic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mortal-Kombat-Reboot-is-Actually-Happening"},{"id":"47509219202730","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Thor 2 Gets A Director","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Thor 2 Gets A Director\n                        Also, new roles for Leonardo DiCaprio, Chuck Norris, and John Travolta.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 5, 2011                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nAfter a slow post-Comic Con week, this week’s Ketchup sees Hollywood getting back into full swing, with news for big superhero movies like Thor 2 and Man of Steel, and a laundry list of casting announcements for stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert DeNiro, Chuck Norris (yes, really), Brendan Fraser and Reese Witherspoon.  Also included in the mix are The Expendables 2, a remake of Short Circuit, and at least three CGI animated family films.  This week also has the rare distinction of having six “Rotten Idea” stories out of ten, giving Rotten-ness in Hollywood an unwanted plurality.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nWILL THOR 2 BE ABOUT A GAME OF THRONES?\n\nOne of the first things movie fans knew about Marvel and Disney’s plans for a sequel to Thor was that Kenneth Branagh would not be returning as director.  This week, we learned that the job looks likely to go to director Brian Kirk, who has mostly worked in television, directing episodes of shows like Dexter, The Tudors, Boardwalk Empire, and most interestingly, episodes 3, 4 and 5 of the first season of HBO’s Game of Thrones.  Since both are fantasy adaptations set in worlds of political intrigue, it’s easy to see the through line that leads Brian Kirk from directing Game of Thrones to directing the Thor sequel.  Not much else is yet known about Thor 2, except that it is described as featuring “a large cast of Asgardians and creatures in the Norse mythology-set world,” which suggests that perhaps Thor 2 will be set more in Asgard and Midgard than the original film was.  Walt Disney Pictures has already scheduled Thor 2 for a release date of July 26, 2013.  Thor 2 wasn’t the only Marvel character to attract online buzz this week, however, as the TwitchFilm.com site this week reported on two separate Marvel projects: Doctor Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy.  There wasn’t much actual news to either story, as both Doctor Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy have been known about since last summer.  However, the online movie fan community at large has been acting like it’s “news,” and so these stories get mentioned here too. \n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 THE NEW PERRY WHITE SAYS: DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT’S AIR YOU’RE FLYING THROUGH?\n\nMuch of 2011 has been filled with casting news for Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, but since Superman has such an extensive supporting cast of characters, we’re not quite done with them yet.  Laurence Fishburne has been cast as Perry White, the editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet, the newspaper that Clark Kent works for (though I doubt most people reading this column needed that extra explanation).  Jackie Cooper previously played Perry White in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and Frank Langella portrayed the editor in Superman Returns.  Laurence Fishburne joins a star-studded Man of Steel cast that already includes Henry Cavill (Supes, himself), Amy Adams (Lois Lane), Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents, Russell Crowe and Julia Ormond as Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van, Michael Shannon and Antje Traue as Kryptonians General Zod and Faora, and Harry Lennix and Christopher Meloni as military officers.  This week also gave us the news that post-Superman, Zack Snyder is planning on directing a much smaller movie called The Last Photograph, about two men who are “inspired by a photograph to travel war torn Afghanistan.”  Man of Steel has been scheduled by Warner Bros for a release date of June 14, 2013.  The first photo of Henry Cavill in the Superman costume was also released online this week, along with our first image of Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (AKA Catwoman) in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises. \n\n\t\n#2 LEONARDO DICAPRIO MAY BELIEVE IN THE CREED OF VIOLENCE\n\nBack before it was called Django Unchained, Quentin Tarantino sometimes referred to his upcoming slave era project as “a Southern,” which was his way of saying it would be a Spaghetti Western set in the South.  Leonardo DiCaprio will be playing the evil slave owner villain in Django Unchained, and now it looks like he might be involved with another western.  Based upon a 2010 novel by Boston Teran, The Creed of Violence is set in the 1910s, and is the story of “a criminal named Rawbone who tries to take a cache of weapons into Mexico as part of the country’s revolution but is caught and then accompanied by a government agent who, it turns out, shares a secret past with him.”  Leonardo DiCaprio is reportedly interested in one of the two leads, either Rawbone or the government agent, though it’s not yet known which.  The Creed of Violence is set up at Universal Pictures, with Todd Field (Little Children, In the Bedroom) attached to direct from his own screenplay adaptation.  Todd Field’s first two films were both intense family dramas, so a western would be a departure.\n\n\t\n#3 MCAVOY, BELL, AND CUMMING IMMERSE THEMSELVES IN FILTH\n\nIrvine Welsh is a Scottish novelist and playwright who is probably best known for the novel Trainspotting, which was adapted in 1996 as a film that helped launch the careers of Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle and others.  The entire “hipster” scene also arguably owes much of their style to that film.  This week, while being interviewed about the film Irvine Welsh’s Excstasy (which adapts another Welsh book), Welsh revealed who will be starring in an adaptation of his novel Filth.  James McAvoy will play the lead character of a “sex-obsessed, cocaine-addicted, bigoted Scottish police officer who is supposed to be investigating a murder but gets sidetracked by his own peculiarities, worries and hangups ranging from the pranks he pulls on his co-workers to his various sexual conquests.”  Jamie Bell will play his partner/sidekick, and Alan Cumming will play his boss.  Filth will be directed by Jon S. Baird (2008’s Cass), who also adapted the novel.  Filming of Filth is expected to start in Scotland in January, 2012.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#6 REESE WITHERSPOON WILL SEE HER WISH LIST COME TRUE\n\nReese Witherspoon has attached herself to star in a Walt Disney Pictures comedy called Wish List.  Witherspoon will play a woman who 25 years ago as a little girl made ten wishes on a coin at a wishing well, but the coin got stuck without hitting the bottom.  Now, when she’s an adult, the coin finally hits the bottom of the well, and this “ambitious career woman” finds those 10 wishes all coming true at once.  Wish List was originally conceived as a project for a male star, but screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer (cowriter of Mrs. Doubtfire, The Tooth Fairy) is now writing the script to fit Reese Witherspoon.   Wish List is being produced for Disney by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray, whose most recent project was Secretariat, also a Disney movie.  Although the premise sounds possibly promising, Wish List is a borderline Rotten Idea because of the very low RT Tomatometer score for The Tooth Fairy.   This week, Reese Witherspoon and Matthew McConaughey were also announced as being in talks to star in Mud, the next movie from indie director Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Shotgun Stories), about the friendship between a 14-year-old and a fugitive (McConaughey) on the run from the law.\n\n\n\t\n#5 THE PENGUIN CRAZE CONTINUES WITH DISNEY’S TUX\n\nAlthough the box office results for Mr. Popper’s Penguins may suggest audiences feel differently (or at least they did for that movie), Hollywood continues to have a crush on penguin movies.   Penguins in recent years have been featured in March of the Penguins, Farce of the Penguins, Happy Feet, Surf’s Up and the Madagascar movies (which led to the Nickelodeon series The Penguins of Madagascar).  The penguin madness is already set to continue in Happy Feet 2 and a spin off movie for The Penguins of Madagascar.  Most of these have been family movies, and a studio that has been conspicuously absent from the penguin bandwagon is Walt Disney Pictures.  That changed this week as Disney has acquired the movie rights to the Japanese manga novel  Tuxedo Gin, which the studio will adapt under the title of just Tux.  Tuxedo Gin is the story of a young street fighter who falls into a coma and discovers that he only has enough “karma points” to come back as a penguin, which leads to an adventure of good deeds where he tries to score enough “karma points” so he can return to his body and the girl that he loves.  Robert Ben Garant, cowriter of The Pacifier and the Night at the Museum movies has been hired by Disney to adapt Tuxedo Gin.  It’s position as yet another CGI penguin movie is what lands Tux a spot as one of the week’s most Rotten Ideas. \n\n\t\n#4 ARE CHUCK NORRIS AND JOHN TRAVOLTA EXPENDABLE TOO?\n\nWith Simon West (Con Air, The Mechanic) signed to direct, casting of The Expendables 2 appears to be underway, with a quasi-rumor this week about two actors who might be joining the cast for the sequel.  In an interview, the CEO of the Bulgarian studios where The Expendables 2 will film said that Chuck Norris and John Travolta are expected to costar with the returning cast.  The actors who are expected to return are Sylvester Stallone (obviously), Dolph Lundgren, Mickey Rourke, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham and Bruce Willis (though not Jet Li).   Sylvester Stallone will not be\nwriting this sequel, but his story idea is being adapted by Ken Kaufman (The Missing; cowriter of Space Cowboys) and newcomer David Agusto.  Lionsgate has already scheduled The Expendables 2 for release on August 17, 2012.  This story’s Rotten Idea status mostly comes from the 40% that The Expendables scored on the RT Tomatometer last summer.\n\n\n\t\n#3 NOW YOU SEE ME AND THE BIG WEDDING: TWO MOVIES WITH AMANDA SEYFRIED THAT OTHERWISE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON\n\nSometimes, in this writer’s efforts to fit as many movies as possible into ten stories, movies are lumped together on the admittedly flimsiest of pretenses.  For this entry, the connection is that Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!, Red Riding Hood) is in both movies.  First up is the action thriller Now You See Me, about a team of FBI agents who find themselves engaged in a game of cat and mouse with a “super team” of the world’s greatest illusionists who are pulling off a series of bank heists during their performances.  Amanda Seyfried and Mark Ruffalo are in talks to join a cast that already includes Jesse Eisenberg and Melanie Laurent.  Louis Leterrier, whose filmography includes The Incredible Hulk, the first two Transporter movies and Clash of the Titans will be helming Now You See Me as well.  Jesse Eisenberg also made the news this week for signing on to star in an independent adaptation of the Fyodor Dostoyevsky novella The Double, in which Eisenberg will play a government office worker who believes he has been replaced by an exact copy of himself.  That particular item just allowed me to sneak in yet another movie to this story.  Going back to Amanda Seyfried, she will also be costarring in the Lionsgate comedy The Big Wedding from director Justin Zackman (The Bucket List).  The Big Wedding is truly star studded, as the cast also includes Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Katherine Heigl, Robin Williams, Topher Grace and Ben Barnes.  In The Big Wedding, Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton play a long divorced couple who have to pretend that they are still happy married at their son’s wedding.  The Double sounds promising, but both Now You See Me and The Big Wedding are just questionable enough to land this as one (actually, two) of the week’s Rotten Ideas.\n\n\t\n#2 ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH IS NOT THE ONCE PLANNED SNAKE PLISSKEN SEQUEL\n\nThe Weinstein Company (AKA Bob and Harvey Weinstein) are best known for their decades of producing the movies of filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Robert Rodriguez.  However, in recent years, the Weinstein Company has also given us the two Hoodwinked CGI animated fantasy comedies.  This week, the Weinsteins announced their next CGI animated family film called ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"robots, medical, black, demand, spider-man, Diego, Review, book","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Thor-2-Gets-A-Director"},{"id":"47509220704946","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Is Naomie Harris the Next Bond Girl?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Is Naomie Harris the Next Bond Girl?by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 10, 2011 |  CommentsThere are Rotten Ideas in the Ketchup every week, but Hollywood went a little crazy this week, with almost enough major stories (8!) that could have nearly filled the entire column with Rotten Ideas. Sequels (G.I. Joe 2, James Bond 23, Salt 2, TRON 3) and remakes/reboots (Big Man Japan, Cherry 2000, Daredevil, King Kong, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) dominated the week. This writer has seen our cinematic future and it’s very, very familiar.This Week’s Top StoryTHE NEW BOND GIRL MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH PIRATES AND ZOMBIESAs filming proceeds on Peter Jackson’s two movie adaptation of The Hobbit, the other big franchise most halted by MGM’s financial woes is finally getting closer to production. One of the crucial steps on the road to getting a James Bond movie going is the casting of the first Bond Girl, and this week brought exactly that news. British actress Naomie Harris is reportedly in talks to join the dozens of previous actresses who have been Bond Girls. Naomie Harris is best known for costarring in 28 Days Later and as Tia Dalma in the second and third Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Rumors about who might be the villain in this 23rd film have also included Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes and even Sir Anthony Hopkins. British director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) will make his James Bond debut with this film, working from a script from series regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (#23 being their 5th Bond film) and John Logan (Rango, The Aviator). Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench will be returning for their third and seventh Bond films, respectively. MGM and Sony Pictures will be codistributing the 23rd James Bond, with a release date currently scheduled for November 9, 2012. Filming is scheduled to start in the fall of 2011, at locations all over the world, including England and India.Fresh Developments This Week#1 20TH CENTURY FOX GOES APE OVER ANIMATED KING KONGThis summer’s franchise reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes is looking (in this writer’s opinion) more promising than anyone could have expected. 20th Century Fox is looking to continue the primate love with the news that Fox Animation is developing a “modern day twist” on King Kong. The animated remake will be from Kong’s perspective, which will be a first for a franchise that has had three major versions (1933, 1976 and 2005) and multiple sequels. Some readers may question why this is a Fresh Development, and the answer to that is in the writers. Although Christian Magalhaes and Bob Snow don’t yet have any produced features to their credit, their screenplay called Murder of a Cat was on the 2010 Black List. Of course, Your Highness was also a Black List script, so…#2 LOST CO-CREATOR HAS A BIG IDEA FOR 1952… WE JUST DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS YETLOST co-creator and showrunner Damon Lindelof has had a very busy year in the year since the show ended. Lindelof cowrote Cowboys &amp; Aliens, was responsible for the rewrite that led to Prometheus being called something other than an Alien prequel, and is currently cowriting the sequel to J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek reboot. This week, Damon Lindelof made his biggest post-LOST deal yet with Walt Disney Pictures, the parent company of ABC (and therefore, LOST). Lindelof is being paid a 7 figure deal (fairly unusually high for original properties) for an “original large-scale science fiction feature film” with the working title of 1952. That sentence contains just about everything that is currently known about 1952, except that it’s not just being seen as a movie, but also has “multiple platform aspirations,” whatever that actually means (TV? video games? haikus? who knows). Although Disney is saying 1952 is “original,” there remains speculation that 1952 could be somehow connected to LOST. That year didn’t have a direct significance in LOST, unless it’s seen as a prequel to the events set in 1954. The more likely scenario is that 1952 may be an homage by Damon Lindelof of the science fiction and monster movies of that era (although that is just speculation by this writer).#3 HERE’S HOPING SALT 2 IS CALLED PEPPERSony Pictures is moving forward with plans for a sequel to the 2010 Angelina Jolie spy/action film Salt by hiring screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen). Wimmer also wrote the original Salt and recently adapted the remake of Total Recall for the same studio. In Salt, Angelina Jolie played a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy assigned the task of assassinating the POTUSA, leading to a series of chase scenes which comprise most of the movie. Salt also ended with a set up that implied her adventures would continue in a sequel. Salt was originally supposed to be called Edwin A. Salt (and star Tom Cruise), but the character’s name was changed to Evelyn Salt when Angelina Jolie was cast instead. Salt opened in July, 2010 to a $36 million domestic weekend that led to a domestic gross of $118 million and a worldwide gross of $295 million. Salt also received an RT Tomatometer score of 62%, earning it a Fresh label (although by a narrow margin), which is why this story is a “Fresh Development” (also by a narrow margin).Rotten Ideas of the Week#6 RIDICULOUS JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE BIG MAN JAPAN TO BE REMADE AS RIDICULOUS AMERICAN MOVIE, RIDICULOUSLYBig Man Japan was a 2007 Japanese monster movie (released in the USA in 2009) about a man who is able to grow 100 feet tall by absorbing electricity in an ongoing struggle against the various giant monsters that plague Japan. Here’s an example of a fight with a giant tapeworm-ish monster with a comb-over hairstyle which (possibly) isn’t even the weirdest scene in the movie. Columbia Pictures and producer Neil H. Moritz (I Am Legend, the Fast and the Furious franchise) have announced plans for an English-language remake of Big Man Japan. The screenwriting team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, who have previously collaborated on Aeon Flux and Clash of the Titans, have been hired to adapt Big Man Japan. Hay and Manfredi also recently worked on the Dark Horse comic book adaptation R.I.P.D., in which Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges will star as undead cops assigned to bring down supernatural menaces. The title of the Big Man Japan remake will probably be changed to reflect the new setting.#5 DISNEY PROCEEDS WITH PLANS FOR TRON 3Walt Disney Pictures has hired screenwriter David DiGilio (Eight Below) to start work on a third movie in the TRON franchise, which they are curiously referring to as a sequel to TRON: Legacy. Last year’s TRON: Legacy was an expensive gamble at an estimated cost of $170 million, but the film has since brought in over $400 million in worldwide grosses for Disney. Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, the writers of TRON: Legacy, had been expected to work on this third film, but they are now busy working on their new ABC TV series Once Upon a Time, which debuts this fall. It’s also unknown if that film’s director, Joseph Kosinski, will return for this third movie. Kosinski is also developing a remake of The Black Hole for Walt Disney Pictures. The decision to proceed with a third TRON movie will reportedly depend at least partially upon the success of the animated TV series TRON: Uprising, which will debut on the Disney XD channel in 2012. This is one of the Rotten Ideas of the week partly based on both the weak RT Tomatometer score for TRON: Legacy (50%). The decision by Disney to hire a screenwriter currently known mostly for a Paul Walker “doggie movie” to adapt something like a TRON sequel was also a factor. Speaking of which…#4 TERMINATOR 5 MAY REWRITE CONTINUITY A LA STAR TREKLast month, Arnold Schwarzenegger postponed his various “return to acting” movie plans following the controversy of his affair (and his familial spin-off project) with his long time live in maid. Oracle heiress and movie producer Megan Ellison, however, had just recently spent quite a bit of cash on acquiring the rights to the Terminator franchise. So, not surprisingly, there are now reportedly plans about how the fifth Terminator movie can be adapted to lessen (or not require at all) Schwarzengger’s involvement. It should also be noted right up front that this story comes from an unconfirmed source, so it does sort of border on “rumor.” If true, Elison and crew’s new plan may be to style the next film after J.J. Abrams’ reboot of Star Trek, going back to the original film’s characters of Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese, with events that would be changed through the miracle of time travel. That’s a handy solution made quite viable through the already existing precedent of time travel in the franchise. Where this story gets its Rotten Idea tag is the suggestion that the new film’s star value may come from Paul Walker, who might be the choice to play the new Kyle Reese. If Paul Walker does take the job, he will be the fourth actor to play Kyle Reese after Michael Biehn (Terminator), Jonathan Jackson (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles) and Anton Yelchin (Terminator: Salvation). Paul Walker would also be reuniting with director Justin Lin, who Walker worked with on Fast &amp; Furious and Fast Five.#3 DWAYNE JOHNSON AS ROADBLOCK IRONICALLY HELPS G.I. JOE SEQUEL GET MADEBack in March, Rachel Nichols (who played Scarlett in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra) revealed that only three characters would be returning for the sequel: Duke, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. That story was particularly interesting because two of those characters are also mute and wear masks, which suggested that they were chosen to return because they could most easily be recast. Channing Tatum, Ray Park and Lee Byung-hun played those characters in the first film. This week brought the news that Dwayne Johnson is in talks with Paramount Pictures to be the first new cast member, taking on the character of Roadblock, who also appeared in previous cartoon and comic book adaptations of the G.I. Joe toy franchise. Channing Tatum is also in talks to return as Duke. The G.I. Joe sequel will be directed by Jon M. Chu, whose career started with Step Up 2: The Streets and Step Up 3D, and recently included Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, also for Paramount Pictures. The studio is reportedly increasingly interested in getting G.I. Joe 2 produced as a likely summer, 2012 release following recent reports that Star Trek 2 may not be ready in time for its originally projected release in that season. The G.I. Joe sequel is being adapted by the Zombieland screenwriting team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.#2 THIS WEEK IN GAME-BASED MOVIES: RISK AND ASTEROIDSAlthough the trend’s been relatively dormant lately, Hollywood is still very much pursuing the notion of movies based upon aging non-narrative games of all types. One such example is the Parker Brothers game Risk, in which players compete to control geographic sections of the world map. The lack of a story isn’t stopping Hasbro and Columbia Pictures from moving forward with a Risk movie. This week Columbia hired TV writer John Hlavin to make his feature film debut on adapting Risk. Hlavin has previously worked on seven episodes of television shows like Day Break, LAX, The Shield and Trust Me. There are no details known yet about how exactly Risk will become a full length movie, except that it will be set in the modern day, and take place at locations all around the world. The fun doesn’t stop there, however. Universal Pictures is also moving ahead with one of their video game adaptations that is so old that it might as well be a board game: Asteroids, one of the original Atari arcade hits back in 1979. The director that Universal is currently talking to for Asteroids is Roland Emmerich, who, more than any other modern director, has established his career on a string of big budget disaster movies (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012). Universal Pictures already has a script for Asteroids by screenwriter Matt Lopez, cowriter of The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Bedtime Stories and Race to Witch Mountain. Roland Emmerich has reportedly imposed on himself a ban from directing any more “end of the world” movies, and the Asteroids script just barely upholds that: it’s set after the end of the world. Totally different. In the Asteroids movie, “the remnants of human civilization are now living on far-flung colonies within an asteroid belt alongside aliens. The survivors were led to believe that this alien civilization was benevolent, rescuing them from doom, but ultimately discover that the aliens have engineered Earth’s destruction, and soon will do the same for the rest of humankind.” That scenario will also undoubtedly feature at least one triangle shaped spaceship that shoots pellets at large asteroids, which will then become medium-sized asteroids, and then finally small asteroids. As for the aliens in the Asteroids movie, there was indeed a UFO that would fly by every so often in the game, so Universal can’t be accused of not being faithful to the source material.#1 THIS WEEK IN REMAKE/REBOOT NEWS: DAREDEVIL, WEREWOLF, TMNT, AND… CHERRY 2000?Wow, when Hollywood gets in the mood to unleash rotten news, they don’t hold back. Normally, the Weekly Ketchup has ten stories each week, but there were so many remake/reboot stories this week, that (along with Rotten #2), this column actually covers 14 stories, 8 of which are Rotten Ideas. Fasten your seatbelts (well, no, you shouldn’t be driving while reading this), because here we go. 20th Century Fox has hired TV writer Brad Caleb Kane, who has written three episodes of FOX’s Fringe, to work on their reboot of the Marvel Comics character Daredevil. The reboot will be an adaptation of the Born Again storyline written by Frank Miller, in which the Kingpin uses his knowledge of blind attorney Matt Murdock’s identity to ruin his entire life. That part would be fresh. That the new Daredevil is still to be directed by David Slade (30 Days of Night, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse), not so much. Brad Caleb Kane has also worked on DreamWorks’ movie based upon the View-Master toy, director Bill Condon’s planned Richard Pryor biopic, and a vampire movie called The Historian. Next up is yet another reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, just four years after the previous reboot of TNMT in 2007. The previous movies were distributed by New Line Cinema and then Warner Bros (the 2007 reboot), but this latest version is from Paramount Pictures. Paramount has hired screenwriters Josh Applebaum and Andre Nemec to work on the next live action reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, following their work on the upcoming Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. Next up is Universal Pictures, and a rumor/report that the studio has changed up its plans for a possible sequel to The Wolfman to another lycanthrope reboot that will instead be called Werewolf. Newcomer Michael Tabb was the writer originally working on the sequel, and he is reportedly now also adapting his script to be an original film instead. Finally, there is Cherry 2000, the 1987 science fiction film starring Melanie Griffith and Pamela Gidley, who played a “pleasure model” robot in the distant future of 2017. Producer Ed Pressman, who is also working on remakes of movies like Bloodsport and The Crow, is reportedly considering a Cherry 2000 remake as well. Melanie Griffith has already spoken to Pressman about the remake, and has suggested to him that it might be a good movie for Dakota Johnson, Griffith’s daughter with Don Johnson, who had supporting roles in Beastly and The Social Network. Ah, the circle of life.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"jurassic, Photos, BBC, sag, Marvel, National, Teen, Film, Studios, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Is-Naomie-Harris-the-Next-Bond-Girl"},{"id":"47509219206828","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Captain Planet in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Live Action Captain Planet in the WorksPlus, several Robert Rodriguez projects, a new Spielberg movie, and Voltron.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 22, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup comes to you right in the middle of San Diego Comic-Con, 2011, and already it’s been a news packed seven days (much of the news actually comes out before the Con). The Weekly Ketchup is normally just 10 stories, but to avoid missing too many items of interest, this week, over twice as many stories are presented to you, sometimes three, four or five at a time under each headline. And Comic-Con isn’t even halfway over as we’re posting this!This Week’s Top StoryCAPTAIN PLANET MAKING THE WORLD SAFE FOR BLUE-SKINNED GUYS WITH MULLETSCartoon Network has signed a deal with Transformers producer Don Murphy to start development of a live action adaptation of the 1990s animated superhero TV show Captain Planet. In the series, which ran for six seasons, Gaia (AKA Mother Earth) brings together five youngsters who gain powers representing the four classic elements (air, earth, wind and water), along with a completely made up element, heart. When the Planeteers perform a ritual, they are able to summon Captain Planet, a blue-skinned male superhero with a green mullet. Captain Planet and the Planeteers fought a series of Eco Villains who represented all the different ways humans generally make life on Earth a bit less clean and safe. Murphy’s coproducer partner Susan Montford said, “With the earthquakes, tornadoes, melting icebergs and all the other problems threatening the world right now, Earth really needs her greatest defender,” which is a bit odd since at least one of those things (earthquakes) seems to be something Earth just does without any evil human interference. Captain Planet and Captain America: The First Avenger got another competitor this week with the news of a movie based on the indie Canadian superhero Captain Canuck. Minds Eye Entertainment is a Canadian production company whose releases mostly go direct-to-video in the USA, such as the 2009 Stephen King adaptation Dolan’s Cadillac, starring Christian Slater. And that leads us to the latest news from Hugh Jackman about The Wolverine (who is arguably the real “most famous Canadian superhero”), who confirmed at Comic-Con that the Silver Samurai will indeed be the main villain in the next Japan-set film. Drawing a line from Captain Planet to Captain Canuck to The Wolverine is an example of how this week’s crowded plethora of news items are being presented to you in just ten actual stories.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ROBERT RODRIGUEZ USES COMIC-CON TO ANNOUNCE A DECADE’S WORTH OF AMBITIOUS MOVIESSome directors regularly associate themselves with more movie projects than it seems possible for them to actually do within the scope of say, a decade or so. Robert Rodriguez is one such director, but the difference between him and many others is that he directs many more films than some of his contemporaries, thanks to having his own production studio in Austin, Texas. Yesterday, Rodriguez took to the massive Hall H to make a series of announcements that included sequels to Machete and Sin City, as well as remakes of Fire and Ice and Heavy Metal. The ending of Machete revealed titles for two sequels, with the next one being Machete Kills. Rodriguez has now revealed that the third project, which will get its start as a trailer attached to Machete Kills, will be called Machete Kills Again… In Space! This third film will “include space babes and a lightsaber style weapon.” Although it feels like Rodriguez has been saying this for several years now, the director also said that Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For could start filming “as early as later this year.” In addition to adapting the Sin City trade paperback of that title, the movie will feature two new stories written by Frank Miller, one of which will be called The Long Bad Night. And now, for the remakes. Robert Rodriguez is teaming up with the estate of fantasy artist/painter Frank Frazetta to produce a live action remake of the 1983 sword and sorcery film Fire and Ice from animation director Ralph Bakshi. Finally, Rodriguez also wants to make a new Heavy Metal movie, and he is looking for story ideas from fans, who can submit their concepts to this website established for just that purpose: http://www.badassdigest.com/heavymetal.#2 HERMIONE AND THE BEASTWhile promoting Crazy, Stupid Love, producer Denise Di Novi revealed that one of her latest projects is a new version of Beauty and the Beast. Di Novi is coproducing the adaptation of the French fairy tale La Belle et la Bete with Guillermo del Toro. Emma Watson, AKA Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies, is already attached to star as the titular Beauty. There’s no word yet as to whether Guillermo del Toro is considering Beauty and the Beast as a potential directing project, or if he will just be producing. Del Toro’s next film as director will be the giant monster invasion movie Pacific Rim. A connection that Guillermo del Toro has to Beauty and the Beast is that the actor who played the Beast in the 1987-1989 CBS TV show was Ron Perlman, who went on to work with del Toro on Cronos, Blade II and the two Hellboy movies.#3 STEVEN SPIELBERG’S FORECAST INCLUDES A STEADY RAINThe increasing number of A list stars that show up at San Diego Comic-Con means that not necessarily all of the news that comes out this week in July is limited to fanboy-related adaptations. While there to promote Real Steel, Hugh Jackman mentioned a Broadway adaptation that Steven Spielberg is looking to add to his slate, after directing the upcoming films War Horse, The Aventures of Tintin, and Lincoln. In 2009, Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig starred in a 12 week Broadway staging of the Keith Huff play A Steady Rain. In a plot reminiscent of the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, A Steady Rain depicts two Chicago police officers who discover that they returned a Vietnamese boy to a cannibal serial killer pretending to be his uncle, who then went on to make the boy his next victim. Regardless, Hugh Jackman has said that a writer is currently working on adapting A Steady Rain. It is also likely that Spielberg’s plan involves recruiting Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman (which is probably how he knew about it) to reprise their performances in this film. What is unclear is whether A Steady Rain will be a directorial project for Steven Spielberg, or just something he will produce. That stark scenario seems like quite a departure from the tone Spielberg is normally known for, and the famed director has also mostly avoided the crime story genre.#4 SHIA LABEOUF AND ROBERT REDFORD ARE THE COMPANY YOU KEEPPossibly hoping to stand out amidst all the genre fare announced at Comic-Con, some producers with very different projects tip their hat this week as well. Shia LaBeouf and Robert Redford have signed to star in an independent adaptation of the 2003 Neil Gordon novel The Company You Keep, which Redford (Ordinary People, Quiz Show, The Legend of Bagger Vance) will also direct. Told through a series of e-mails (in the novel, at least), The Company You Keep is the story of one of the last Vietnam era fugitives (Redford) still wanted for a 1974 crime who encounters a young reporter (LaBeouf) who wants his story, which leads them on a road trip across America as the former anti-war radical rediscovers his past. Screenwriter Lem Dobbs (The Limey; cowriter of Dark City, The Score) is currently working on adapting the novel.#5 SAMUEL L. JACKSON PRESENTS: AFRO SAMURAI… IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLICSamuel L. Jackson, the Indomina Group, and Gonzo Studios are teaming up to give the world a live action movie adaptation of Afro Samurai. Afro Samurai started as a manga book series, and has since branched into television and video games. Afro Samurai is set in a futuristic Japan that has also returned to being a feudal state, and tells the story of a swordmaster who is seeking revenge for the death of his father when he was a child. Gonzo Studios is the animation studio behind the 5 episode anime TV show based on the character, Samuel L. Jackson voiced the character on that show (and the movie Afro Samurai: Resurrection), and the Indomina Group is “the fast-growing U.S. and Dominican Republic based producer and distributor of film.” Despite his previous work on the character, Samuel L. Jackson is not expected to star as Afro in the live action version, other than his role as producer. Indomina Studios plans to find a director and writer this summer, finish casting by the end of 2011, and start filming Afro Samurai in the Dominican Republic sometime in 2012. That is sort of a fast pre-production schedule, but it’s not impossible. One of Jackson’s next films as an actor will be Quentin Tarantino’s slavery era Spaghetti Western Django Unchained, in which Jackson will play a house slave. This week, Kevin Costner was cast as Ace Woody, “the sadistic trainer of the male fighting slaves who entertain the white patrons of Candyland as well as the female slaves who are forced to be prostitutes.” Costner joins the already cast Jackson, Leonardo DiCaprio as the evil slave owner Calvin Candie, Jamie Foxx as the title character, and Christoph Waltz as the man who trains Django in the skills of a bounty hunter. This is the second high profile film that Kevin Costner has landed a supporting role in lately, following his casting as Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 300 COWRITER REVIVING SPARTACUSThis week, relatively new production company GK Films announced plans for a historical epic based on the life of Spartacus, the leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman Republic in the first century B.C. The story of Spartacus was previously adapted in 1960 as a film directed by Stanley Kubrick, and starring Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Laurence Olivier and Peter Ustinov. The Starz network also airs a series called Spartacus: Blood and Sand (and Spartacus: Vengeance) which focuses more on the gladiator aspect of the Spartacus story. The GK Films project will be written by 300 cowriter Michael B. Moore (he also had a story credit on G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra). To distinguish this movie from Kubrick’s Spartacus, an emphasis will be placed on the historical facts of the slave rebellion, so that it will not be a remake of Kubrick’s film. GK Films’ previous productions include Edge of Darkness, Rango, The Tourist and the Starz series Camelot. GK Films’ upcoming projects include Dark Shadows, The Rum Diary and the Martin Scorsese missionary epic Silence.#3 THE VOLTRON MOVIE STEPS RIGHT OVER THE MAJOR STUDIOSLast September, it was revealed via three leaked concept art images that Atlas Entertainment (Get Smart, The Brothers Grimm) had acquired the rights to the Japanese anime TV series and toy line Voltron. Voltron is of course about five young pilots who each control a different massive robot lion, which can then come together to form an even more massive humanoid robot. And then they have adventures. Yesterday, the Voltron live action movie got a little bit closer to actually happening, as Relativity Media has picked up the rights from Atlas Entertainment. Relativity Media started as a production company, but has since 2010 branched into distribution as well, releasing such films as Let Me In, Season of the Witch, Limitless and Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer. The live action Voltron project represents the most ambitious movie for Relativity Media to date.#2 THIS STORY MENTIONS HILARY SWANK AND FOUR OTHER RANDOM COMIC BOOK MOVIES ANNOUNCED AT SDCCAnd this is the part where several new comic book movie projects will get dumped as quickly as possible, just to make sure they get some mention. These are listed in the Rotten Idea category somewhat cynically; it’s possible some of these could be great, but most of them… probably won’t be (or even get made at all). Hilary Swank will produce and star in an adaptation of the Radical Comics title Shrapnel. Newcomer screenwriter Toby Wagstaff will adapt the story of a former military officer (Swank) who leads a revolt on the planet Venus in the year 2250. After years of development at Dimension Films, the Top Cow comic book The Darkness found new life this week with Mandeville Films (The Fighter, The Muppets) acquiring the rights to the supernatural crimefighter franchise, which has also inspired two video games (one of them upcoming). The late 1980s Marvel Comics science fiction series Strikeforce: Morituri is also getting developed as a movie. This project in particular is not really that surprising considering that its “alien invasion” concept is one of the most popular recent trends in movies. A comic book-turned-potential movie that is a bit more esoteric is The Red Star, which is now being developed by Warner Bros after being put into turnaround by Universal Pictures. The Red Star is set in an alternate reality version of the Soviet Union where magic and technology are both commonly used in a war in which ghosts fight alongside human soldiers. Neal Moritz, the producer behind the Fast and the Furious and xXx franchises, is producing The Red Star. Finally, 20th Century Fox is developing an adaptation of the indie comic book Rust, about a boy whose jetpack crash lands him on a farm, while he’s still being pursued by an old war robot. That premise actually sounds pretty cool, but it’s more difficult to imagine how it will be adapted by screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (27 Dresses, Morning Glory), whose next two films in theaters will be I Don’t Know How She Does It and We Bought a Zoo. The thematic connection to an adventure involving robots and jetpacks… not seeing it.#1 UNIVERSAL PICTURES WON’T SCALE THE DARK TOWERThe writing may have been on the wall after Universal Studios delayed pre-production back in May, but this week, the studio backed out from developing Ron Howard’s ambitious plans for Stephen King’s The Dark Tower series. What Howard and Imagine Entertainment were hoping for was a plan that included three movies and two limited run TV series that cover what the movies don’t. Universal came back with an offer to greenlight just one movie, and that pretty much led to the two sides parting ways, with Ron Howard and Imagine now free to shop their concept elsewhere. Universal has a corporate cousin in NBC, but other studios have similar TV connections (Disney and ABC, Fox and Fox, etc), so there is still hope for The Dark Tower. However, this delay may mean Javier Bardem (who was signed to star as Roland Deschain) might not be available when and if The Dark Tower ever gets going again. This is the Week’s most Rotten Idea, particularly for all of the fans who were so excited that the book series might get an ambitious depiction on a grand scale. Ron Howard’s career, however, continued on in another direction this week, as he has signed with Warner Bros to direct a planned adaptation of the non-fiction book Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer, whose book Into the Wild also became a film. Dustin Lance Black (Milk and the upcoming J. Edgar biopic) is adapting the true story of two brothers who followed an extreme fundamental sect of Mormonism and claimed that they murdered their younger brother’s wife and infant daughter on orders from God. As with Steven Spielberg and A Steady Rain, Ron Howard appears to be going into darker territory with Under the Banner of Heaven than the tone he is generally associated with.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"camera, ratings, of, what, Country, Spike, review, streaming, Showtime, movie, BAFTA, Paquin, Films, doctor","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Live-Action-Captain-Planet-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509219207853","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Spike Lee Reprises Do the Right Thing Role","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Spike Lee Reprises Do the Right Thing RoleAlso, news on remakes of Godzilla and Evil Dead, and Ahnuld is back.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 15, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup features news stories about new entries in the Godzilla, Evil Dead, G.I. Joe and Bourne franchises, as well as new roles for Johnny Depp, Edward Norton, Jennifer Lopez and Arnold Schwarzenegger.This Week’s Top StorySPIKE LEE RETURNS TO BROOKLYN AS MOOKIE FROM DO THE RIGHT THINGAs this writer compiles the Weekly Ketchup each Friday, sometimes it seems like many movie websites overlook some of the biggest stories. This one is definitely in that category. While many sites continued to cover last week’s news about Spike Lee’s involvement with the English language remake of South Korean thriller Oldboy, a potentially much bigger story didn’t even always get a mention. Spike Lee has started filming an independent movie called Red Hook Summer in Brooklyn, NY and in addition to directing, he’s also acting… as Mookie from Do the Right Thing. That’s right, Red Hook Summer appears to be a de facto sequel to the film that many consider to be not just Spike Lee’s best film, but arguably one of the best films of the 1980s. Red Hook Summer is described as a story about an Atlanta man spending the summer in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, which is also home to the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood (AKA Bed-Stuy) depicted in Lee’s controversial 1989 drama. Spike Lee directed, wrote, produced and starred in Do the Right Thing as Mookie, a young pizza delivery man caught in the middle of a racial incident at Sal’s Pizzaria (where he works). That’s one way to describe Do the Right Thing, but the reason it’s considered a modern classic is that the film succeeds even without the socio-political elements. So, the question now is whether Red Hook Summer has what it takes to live up to the promise of being an implied Do the Right Thing sequel/spin off/whatever-it-is? There’s also no word yet as to whether other Do the Right Thing costars will also be returning (such as, say, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro, Rosie Perez or Martin Lawrence).Fresh Developments This Week#1 JOHNNY DEPP’S PRODUCING NIGHT STALKER AND PAUL REVERE MOVIESWalt Disney Pictures is looking to keep their Jack Sparrow in-house by aligning with Johnny Depp’s Infinitum Nihil production company on two ambitious movie projects that Depp is likely to star in. The two projects are a big screen adaptation of the classic (but short lived) 1970s supernatural thriller TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker and a historical drama about Paul Revere’s Midnight Ride. The Night Stalker project is described as an adaptation of the original 1972 TV movie that led to the reporter character of Carl Kolchak (as played by Darren McGavin) getting his own TV show. Kolchak: The Night Stalker featured a different supernatural-themed investigation every week, but that TV movie’s story was all about a serial killer that Kolchak suspects might actually be a real vampire. If Depp’s Night Stalker sticks with that story, it can be seen as something of a follow up to the Dark Shadows movie (also based on an early 1970s cult hit TV show) in which Depp is playing the vampire Barnabas Collins (directed by Tim Burton… of course). As for the Paul Revere project, the movie is expected to focus on the 24 hour period in April, 1775, during which Boston silversmith Paul Revere made his ride from Charlestown to Lexington to warn the provincial congress (and all other Revolutionary forces he met along the way) of the incoming British advance. Johnny Depp and his coproducer are currently looking for screenwriters to work on both projects.#2 HAWKEYE AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK FACE OFF IN THE BOURNE LEGACYIt’s been known for a while that Jeremy Renner will be following up his role as Hawkeye in The Avengers with yet another franchise entry: The Bourne Legacy. Rather than playing Matt Damon’s role of Jason Bourne, Jeremy Renner will be playing another government assassin trained by a department even more nefarious and dangerous than Bourne’s. It?s been known for a while that Rachel Weisz will be playing the new agent’s love interest. This week, however, brought news of who is in talks for the role of the film’s villain, and it’s Edward Norton. If Norton signs, The Bourne Legacy will potentially be the answer to a future trivia contest. Before Jeremy Renner signed on to play Hawkeye in The Avengers, Edward Norton was at one time expected to reprise the role of Dr. Bruce Banner from The Incredible Hulk. The Hulk production was the focus of many media stories involving the script, which Edward Norton reportedly rewrote (although he wasn?t credited by the WGA in the end). We may never know the exact answer to how it happened, but Mark Ruffalo was eventually cast as Banner/Hulk instead of Edward Norton. Anyway, back to The Bourne Legacy, Tony Gilroy (Duplicity, Michael Clayton), who also cowrote the first three Bourne movies, will be directing the fourth movie this fall for Universal Pictures, from a script he cowrote with his brother Dan Gilroy (Two for the Money; cowriter of The Fall).#3 EVIL DEAD 4 IS FINALLY, REALLY, ACTUALLY HAPPENINGFor horror fans, there may have been really only one news item worth even mentioning this week. It started with a tweet from actor Bruce Campbell, “Believe in the remake, dawg!” The remake Campbell was talking about is the movie that has sometimes been called Evil Dead 4. The news that pre-production is starting in Detroit ends an 18 year wait that began the day after Army of Darkness came out in 1993. Sam Raimi is handing the directing job off to young Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez, for whom Evil Dead 4 (or whatever it’s eventually called) will be his feature debut, following a couple of shorts including one called Panic Attack!. Fede Alvarez also cowrote the remake script with his Panic Attack! cowriter Rodo Sayagues. However, their script is now getting another rewrite from a surprise source: Academy Award winner Diablo Cody (Juno, Jennifer’s Body). Although no plot details are known yet, as a remake, we can guess that it will probably be about someone finding a book called the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in a remote cabin, which then leads to the unleashing of “deadites,” which are reanimated body parts and corpses possessed by evil spirits. The original Evil Dead producing team of Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell are all shepherding the project through Ghost House Pictures, and Lionsgate is handling international sales for the film’s eventual release. There’s also a strong chance that Bruce Campbell will appear in the remake in some form, although it’s not yet known if he will be playing Ash, or some other character. Finally, you can click here to see the short film Panic Attack! that inspired Raimi, Tapert and Campbell to entrust Alvarez with their most cherished horror franchise. There’s no animated deer heads, but it’s still pretty cool.#4 HOLLYWOOD SCREENWRITER’S BIG THREE ARE THE DARK KNIGHT, MAN OF STEEL AND… GODZILLAScreenwriter David Goyer may have started with movies like Kickboxer 2: The Road Back, Demonic Toys and the TV movie Nick Fury: Agent of Shield, but he really did work his way up to the big time. Later on, he worked on movies like Dark City and the three Blade movies, and today he is working with director and producer Christopher Nolan on The Dark Knight Rises and Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel. Batman and Superman are obviously larger-than-life characters, but Goyer’s next movie has them beat, handily. He has signed with Legendary Pictures (the studio also behind those superhero franchises) and Warner Bros to do a rewrite of the reboot of Godzilla. Screenwriter David Callaham (cowriter of Doom, The Expendables) wrote the first draft, which David Goyer will now rewrite. Movie fans understandably may have bad vibes about Godzilla, following the critically-panned disaster of a movie that was the 1998 Godzilla. However, this new Godzilla relaunch project is expected to have nothing in common with that film except a title and a coproduction credit with Toho, the Japanese company behind the classic monster franchise. Normally, this might be the part where I explain what Godzilla is about, but really, if I have to do that… you’re reading the wrong column. Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros hope to have Godzilla ready to stomp back into theaters possibly as soon as 2013.#5 MICHAEL CHIKLIS AND JENNIFER LOPEZ MAY JOIN JASON STATHAM IN PARKERParker is the name of the latest movie based upon the criminal anti-hero character created by author Donald E. Westlake in a series of novels. Previous movies based on the character (but frequently with a different name) include Point Blank, The Outfit and Payback. It has been known for a while that Parker will be directed by Taylor Hackford (Ray, An Officer and a Gentleman, The Devil’s Advocate). However, enough casting news has happened since Parker was last mentioned in this column that it’s definitely time for an update. First off, the role of Parker himself will be played by Jason Statham, star of the Transporter and Crank franchises. Jennifer Lopez recently started negotiations to play Parker’s love interest. And this week, Michael Chiklis, AKA Vic Mackey from The Shield, signed on to play Parker’s nemesis. Although the nature of Chiklis’ character isn’t precisely known yet, many online fans this week have expressed hope that this will be an opportunity for Chiklis to flex his tougher, meaner acting muscles. Filming of Parker starts in New Orleans next month.#6 ERIC NORTHMAN FROM TRUE BLOOD STICKING WITH THE VIKING THINGSome actors have a niche, and they just stick with what gets them steady work. It’s such an obvious fact that it’s probably not even worth mentioning. Consider Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Eric Northman, the former Viking vampire in HBO’s True Blood, for example. When Thor was casting up, there was a good while when Skarsgard was in the running, and was considered by many fans to be the obvious choice, because, really, who else could Marvel possibly cast? When the guy who played Kirk’s dad in Star Trek got the role instead, many people were frankly dumbfounded. People thought “Norse” and “blonde” and “tall,” and Alexander Skarsgard seemed like almost the only choice (sorry, Tyler Mane!). That notion stuck around when his dad was cast in Thor, and he wasn’t. Well, Alexander Skarsgard’s big screen Viking ship came in this week with the news that he is attached to star in and produce a Warner Bros “epic” with the working title of The Vanguard. Skarsgard will play one of two Viking brothers who are banished to North America, and so they must spend the rest of the movie attempting to get back home to Sweden (Skarsgard is himself Swedish). Screenwriter Chris Boal, who doesn’t yet have any produced movies to his credit, is working on the script. This was a big week for Chris Boal, because he also signed another deal with Warner Bros to work on an untitled ancient war epic about Roman general Gaius Julius Caesar, who went on to become Rome’s first, you know… Caesar. Warner Bros is seeing the project as a two movie franchise with the first movie ending with Caesar taking control of Rome, and the second movie would address the rest of his life (Cleopatra, “Et Tu, Brutus?”, etc). Jonathan Liebesman (Battle: Los Angeles, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning), who is also directing the Clash of the Titans sequel for Warner Bros, is attached to direct the first Julius Caesar movie.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER’S WILL-HE-WON’T-HE RETURN TO MOVIES DRAMA ENDS WITH THE LAST STANDThe year 2011 has seen Arnold Schwarzenegger at the center of a rollercoaster ride revolving around the question of how he will make his return to movies after several years as the Governor of California. The year started with several different projects being mentioned, including a possible movie based upon a planned animated TV series called The Governator (in which he would have played a superhero who fights crime alongside Maria Shriver and their four kids). However, that was all before Schwarzenegger’s extramarital misadventures were made public in May, which very quickly led to Schwarzenegger announcing that he was putting his acting career on hold. Just two months was apparently long enough for Schwarzenegger to recover, because this week Lionsgate announced that the Austrian Oak will indeed make his return in The Last Stand. Schwarzenegger will play ex-LAPD officer Sheriff Owens, whose sleepy border town surprisingly becomes the last line of defense against a fugitive drug kingpin who is speeding towards Mexico with a car full of hostages and violent gang members. The Last Stand will also mark the English language debut of Korean thriller director Kim Jee-Woon (I Saw the Devil, A Tale of Two Sisters). This story is Rotten for other reasons, too, but the clincher was a comment from Kim Jee-Woon, which seems to be trying a bit too hard to draw a connection to one of the best action films of all time. Here’s what he had to say, “[It’s] kind of a combination of Die Hard and High Noon where (the latter) was about protecting something very important that needs to be protected, while Die Hard is a very drawn-out, long process that almost kills someone in the process. So my film will be something that has to be very well protected and, in the process, we almost die protecting it in a way.”#2 RAY STEVENSON TO BE VILLAINOUS AS FIREFLY IN G.I. JOE 2Ray Stevenson is one of those fan favorite actors who unfortunately also frequently signs on for movies that he seems too good for. Stevenson arguably made his reputation playing Titus Pullo on the HBO series Rome, and his filmography also includes roles in King Arthur, The Book of Eli, The Other Guys, The Vampire’s Assistant, Thor (as Volstagg) and of course, as the third Punisher star in Punisher: War Zone. His next movie role will be Porthos in this fall’s The Three Musketeers, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (the Resident Evil guy, not the Boogie Nights guy). This week, Stevenson added yet another potentially disappointing movie to his filmography by signing with Paramount to play the villain Firefly in G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes. Like returning characters Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, Firefly is described as a “ninja master,” as well as an expert saboteur. Channing Tatum (Duke), Ray Park (Snake Eyes) and Lee Byung-hun (Storm Shadow) are the only cast members expected to return. In addition to Ray Stevenson, the other new cast members revealed thus far include D.J. Cotrona (Flint), Dwayne Johnson (Roadblock), Adrianne Palicki (Lady Jaye), RZA (Blind Master) and Elodie Yung (Jinx). Director Jon M. Chu (Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D) will start filming G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes later this summer, from a script by the Zombieland team of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Paramount Pictures has scheduled G.I. Joe 2: Cobra Strikes for release in August, 2012.#1 THE AKIRA REMAKE MAY GET AN UNKNOWN DIRECTORBack in May, Albert Hughes, codirector of The Book of Eli, From Hell and Menace II Society with his brother Allen, dropped out of Warner Bros’ planned live-action adaptation of the manga series Akira. Now, Warner Bros is in talks with director Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown, Orphan) to take on the adaptation instead. Movie fans probably best know Akira as the basis for the 1988 anime film of the same title, which regularly tops critics’ lists as either the best, or one of the best, anime films of all time. Akira tells the story of two teenage motorcycle gang members who become involved with a secret government experiment that causes one of them to become a super-powered mutant with catastrophic mental abilities. The project has been the subject of much fan outrage for a variety of reasons. One issue is the idea of adult actors like Keanu Reeves, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ryan Gosling being considered. Besides age, there’s also the question of Akira being Anglicized, with the setting changed from Neo Tokyo to Neo Manhattan. Besides all that, there’s the very idea of doing a de facto live action remake of Akira at all. Specific to this news, there’s also Jaume Collet-Serra’s Tomatometer record to consider, which is entirely rated “Rotten,” with his best reviewed film (Unknown) only getting a Tomatometer score of 56%. For so many reasons, Warner Bros’ continued efforts for a live action Akira movie is the week’s most Rotten Idea.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"obituary, The, Polls, Election, Sundance, Originals, horror, 99%, and, Epix, Superheroe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Spike-Lee-Reprises-Do-the-Right-Thing-Role"},{"id":"47509220705971","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Hangover Part III Already in the Works","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Hangover Part III Already in the WorksPlus,by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 3, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes tons of news for The Hangover star Bradley Cooper and others, news of biopics based on the lives of Jackie Robinson and Elizabeth Taylor, and a few comic book movies that include Hawkman.This Week’s Top StoryWARNER BROS. SURPRISES NO ONE AND STARTS WORK ON THE HANGOVER PART IIIThis past Memorial Day weekend, The Hangover Part II broke all sorts of box office weekends with $205 million worldwide in just five days, including the biggest opening ever for a comedy. So, it should surprise no one that Warner Bros has hired one of that film’s screenwriters to start work on The Hangover Part III, which is being seen as the final film in what will end up being a trilogy. Craig Mazin didn’t work on the original movie, but his other credits include Superhero Movie (which he has sole credit on) and cowriting duties on Senseless, Scary Movie 3 and Scary Movie 4. There’s no firm confirmation on where the “Wolf Pack” will head next, but the popular consensus among the cast appears to be Amsterdam, which sort of completes a “party city” trifecta that began with Las Vegas and Bangkok. Craig Mazin also revealed this week his idea for how The Hangover Part III might end (though he might have been joking): “I think the third movie ends with Doug staring at a row of crosses in a graveyard. It’s everyone ? his wife, his family is dead, everybody from the first movie is dead. Somebody shows up and tells him his dog is dead.” The “Doug” that Mazin refers to is the character played by Justin Bartha who is mostly absent from the crazy events of the first two movies. The next step for Warner Bros will be to secure stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis (who are believed to have only been signed for one sequel), as well as director Todd Phillips.Fresh Developments This Week#1 CASTING RUMORS FOR QUENTIN TARANTINO’S LATEST ARE LOOSE AND UNCHAINEDTwitter’s 140 character limit is a pox on anyone who wants details in their news scoops. This week, Tweets were twice aflutter about Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, about a slave who seeks revenge against his former Southern master. Normally, the Weekly Ketchup doesn’t repost rumors too often, but directors and movies like Quentin Tarantino and Django Unchained are special exceptions. First, there was a tweet from blogger Jeff Goldsmith (formerly of Creative Screenwriting magazine) announcing, “Leonardo DiCaprio WILL play villian Calvin Candie in Tarantino?s Django Unchained! QT wanted him for I.B. &amp; now has him!” The I.B. that Goldsmith is referring to is, of course, Inglourious Basterds, which DiCaprio was at one time in talks to costar in. It should be noted that, as of this writing, nothing official has come out, so for now, the idea that Leonardo DiCaprio will play the villainous slave owner is just a rumor. Also in the rumor category, thanks to Twitter, is the idea that Idris Elba (Stringer Bell in The Wire, Heimdall in Thor) might be in talks to star as Django after Will Smith possibly dropping out (he was never officially signed). Elba’s possible involvement is even murkier than DiCaprio’s, as the idea just comes from Elba tweeting that he was “Having one of the biggest meetings of my professional life today… meeting a very controversial director for a very controversial part.” People took that to mean Quentin Tarantino and Django Unchained, but really, he could have been talking about any controversial director. Uwe Boll’s pretty controversial, for example.#2 ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND RICHARD BURTON’S FURIOUS LOVE RAGES ONBiopic movie projects have a funny way of popping up not too long after their subject’s demise. Such was the case this week with Elizabeth Taylor, just over two months after her departing on March 23, 2011. The subject at hand is the book Furious Love by Sam Kashner and Nancy Schoenberger about the tumultuous romance between 1950s-1960s movie stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which resulted in Burton being two of Taylor’s eight marriages (#5 and #6). After long negotiations with many other parties, Paramount Pictures has finalized a deal for Furious Love that sets the romantic real life epic up as a directorial project for Martin Scorsese. Screenwriter David Seidler (The King’s Speech) and actress Natalie Portman were among those who had also been trying to secure the rights, which gives us an idea of at least one actress who wants to play Elizabeth Taylor. To be clear, the use of the word “biopic” is slightly off, as Furious Love would not be a full biopic, but would focus on the years of the Taylor/Burton on-and-off-and-on-again romance, starting with the filming of Cleopatra in 1963 until their second divorce in 1976. As for Martin Scorsese directing Furious Love, the movie is likely going to have to wait a few years, as Scorsese has a full plate which includes the upcoming Hugo Cabret, his Five Obstructions project with Lars von Trier (which may be an artsy remake of Taxi Driver), the missionary priest epic Silence, and his plans for another biopic about the life of crooner Frank Sinatra. Furious Love will need that extra time anyway, as the next step for Paramount is to find a screenwriter for the project.#3 HERE’S AN UNEXPECTED REMAKE: THE JACKIE ROBINSON STORYLegendary Pictures is the high profile Warner Bros-based production company most associated with big budget special effects movies like 300, Watchmen, Inception, Clash of the Titans and Christopher Nolan’s three Batman movies. Legendary also produced the two Hangover movies, and a few other less expensive movies like The Town and Observe and Report, and this news item is another project more in that budget range. Legendary Pictures has made a deal with the estate of Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson, who broke the league’s “color line” as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Jackie Robinson himself starred in the 1950 movie The Jackie Robinson Story. There have been other efforts in recent years to get another Jackie Robinson movie made, including one by Spike Lee (which would have starred Denzel Washington), and a project which would star Robert Redford as Branch Rickey, the Dodgers executive who signed Robinson. With the deal with Robinson’s estate, however, Legendary Pictures has the best chance of actually getting their project produced. Legendary has already hired Brian Helgeland to both write and direct the Jackie Robinson biopic. Helgeland’s resume as director includes Payback and A Knight’s Tale, and as screenwriter, Helgeland has also worked on Mystic River, Man on Fire and L.A. Confidential (cowritten with director Curtis Hanson).#4 POP CULTURE SPOOFERS PENNY ARCADE GO TO THE MOVIES WITH THE NEW KIDThe webcomic Penny Arcade has been joking about video games and other pop culture subjects since 1998. Now, thanks to a one shot webcomic called The New Kid (that was a grand total of just 6 panels), the guys behind Penny Arcade are getting into the movie business. Paramount Pictures has acquired the rights to The New Kid to adapt it into an animated film about a kid who is the only human in an outer space school full of aliens. The New Kid is the first step in a new animation launch that follows Rango, the studio’s first recent non-DreamWorks Animation release (not counting the many previous Paramount animated movies like those with Nickelodeon, etc). Paramount Pictures this week also acquired the rights to the DC Comics title The Mighty, which is particularly interesting because DC Comics movie adaptations are usually produced and distributed by Warner Bros. However, in the case of The Mighty, the comic’s creators Peter Tomasi and Keith Champagne controlled the rights, allowing them to go to another studio. The Mighty tells the story of a cop who has long worked with Alpha One, the world’s most powerful superhero, until he discovers that this “hero” actually has evil plans, forcing the cop to attempt to stop him.#5 ELMORE LEONARD’S FREAKY DEAKY FINALLY CASTS UPCrime novelist Elmore Leonard’s books have been adapted as several movies, including 3:10 to Yuma (based on a short story), Get Shorty (and its sequel Be Cool), Jackie Brown, and Out of Sight. Leonard’s novel Freaky Deaky has been in various stages of development pretty much since its 1988 publication, including a time when Quentin Tarantino was considering adapting it. This week, the cast of Freaky Deaky expanded considerably as filming is scheduled to start later this month in Michigan. The previously cast William H. Macy will be joined by Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser and Craig Robinson (The Office, Hot Tub Time Machine). Freaky Deaky tells the story of a Detroit cop (Matt Dillon) in the 1970s who is moved from the bomb squad to sex crimes, who then comes across a group of radicals connected to the bombing of a limousine. William H. Macy will play a Hollywood insider, Robinson will play his former Black Panther assistant, and Brendan Fraser will play a former activist who uses his knowledge of bombs for special effects sequences in Hollywood movies. Freaky Deaky was adapted and will be directed by Charles Matthau, who made his directorial debut in 1995 with The Glass Harp, starring his dad Walter Matthau.#6 THIS WEEK IN BRADLEY COOPER NEWSIt is pretty much standard Hollywood playing rules that the week after a big box office opening, a director or actor will make the news a bit. Bradley Cooper (or more accurately, his agents and publicists) sort of overdid it after The Hangover Part II, maybe. Admittedly, two of these projects were already known, but here are Cooper’s three movies that made the news this week, in order of when they will be filming. First up is The Words, a dramatic thriller about a writer (Cooper) who discovers the price for stealing another writer’s work (which doesn’t sound a bit like Secret Window, of course). That movie will have a star-studded cast that will include Ben Barnes (AKA Prince Caspian), John Hannah (The Mummy), Jeremy Irons, Dennis Quaid, Zoe Saldana (Avatar), J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man) and Olivia Wilde (TRON: Legacy). The Words will be the directorial debuts of TRON: Legacy screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal, and filming starts this month in Montreal. Next up, filming in July in Schenectady, New York, will be The Place Beyond the Pines. Bradley Cooper will play a cop on the hunt for a motorcycle enthusiast (Ryan Gosling) who starts robbing banks to support his newly born baby. The Place Beyond the Pines reunites Ryan Gosling with director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine), who also wrote both films. Finally, there was the revelation that Bradley Cooper has aspirations of being a screenwriter in addition to being one of the most sought after actors in Hollywood today. Talking to Charlie Rose, Cooper revealed that he has written an adaptation of the Dan Simmons sci-fi epic novel Hyperion, and hopes to possibly direct the movie as well. Hyperion is set during an intergalactic war in the 28th century, and for more information on that, you can try deciphering the lengthy and technobabble-filled premise here. These combined stories have “Fresh Development” status mostly on the strength of Blue Valentine, and the suggestion via Hyperion that Bradley Cooper is a super king-sized science fiction nerd behind the dimply good looks (in the best possible way, of course).Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THIS WEEK IN YOUNG ADULT FRANCHISE MOVIESHollywood took the week off, post Memorial Day, from greenlighting movies based on fairy tales and focused instead on one of the community’s other recent obsessions: movies based on Young Adult novel franchises with female protagonists. The 14 year old fanbase isn’t going to make these movies themselves, after all. First off, there is Lionsgate’s adaptation of The Hunger Games, which saw its massive cast get even bigger with the addition of Donald Sutherland as President Snow, “the ruthless autocratic leader of Panem.” Lionsgate also made the news with the revelation that the studio is actually planning on making four movies out of the trilogy that continues with the novels Catching Fire and Mockingjay. How exactly three books will be split up into four movies isn’t yet known, but the popular notion appears to be that Mockingjay would become two movies, in much the same way that the final books in both the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises were done. Ah, but the Young Adult news doesn’t stop there. Universal Pictures has hired director Mary Harron (American Psycho, The Notorious Bettie Page) to take on their adaptation of Wicked Lovely, the first novel in a series of five books by Mellissa Marr. Wicked Lovely revolves around a 17-year-old girl named Aislinn who was born with the ability to see the faeries that are hiding in plain sight in our world, and now finds herself split between “a seductive Faery king” and her mortal boyfriend. Decisions, decisions, decisions! Wicked Lovely was adapted by frequent Tim Burton collaborator and screenwriter Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas). Finally, there is The Mortal Instruments, which is a soon-to-be-produced adaptation of City of Bones, the first novel in the four novel (so far) series by Cassandra Clare. Jaime Campbell Bower, who is best known for playing King Arthur in the Starz series Camelot, has been cast as Jace Wayland opposite Lily Collins, who will play Clary Fray. City of Bones tells the story of Clary Fray, a teenage girl who discovers that she is the descendant of a family of “Shadowhunters,” a secret group of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of the mortal world. The Mortal Instruments will be directed by Scott Stewart (Legion, Priest) from a script by newcomer Jessica Postigo. Surprisingly, there has not yet been any word of Paul Bettany costarring in The Mortal Instruments, which if true, will mark a career first for Scott Stewart. These three movies are collectively in the borderline Rotten Idea category, basically presented to you in order from the Freshest potential to the most Rotten Idea.#2 TARZAN DIRECTOR SAYS IT’S HARD OUT HERE FOR A CHIMPWarner Bros has for a while been trying to get a new live action movie based on Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan books, about an English lord raised in Africa by a family of gorillas. This week, Warner Bros signed a surprising choice to bring Tarzan back to the big screen: director Craig Brewer (Hustle &amp; Flow), whose next movie will be the remake of Footloose (to be released 10/14/11). Craig Brewer reportedly won over Warner Bros with his idea for a story that will stretch out over three movies, forming a new Tarzan trilogy. The news of Brewer’s hiring comes while Warner Bros has also hired screenwriter Adam Cozad (who hasn’t yet had a movie produced, but he has worked on Paramount’s planned Jack Ryan reboot) to also adapt Tarzan into a new live action feature. It’s unknown whether Cozad’s work will be incorporated into Brewer’s trilogy idea, or if a new screenwriter will now be hired. Although Tarzan‘s movie career has slowed down considerably in recent decades (Disney’s animated version being the relatively recent high point), in Hollywood’s golden age, Tarzan was the starring character of dozens of movies. Although the idea of Tarzan getting a 21st century big budget reboot has a lot of promise, this story is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because Craig Brewer seems like such an unlikely and odd choice, associated as he is with mostly musical projects. Does Brewer plan on having Tarzan rap and perform dance routines in the jungle, possibly with a chorus of gorillas, chimps and leopards backing him up? Maybe not, but that this writer even thought of that possibility is why this is a Rotten Idea.#1 HAWKMAN: CARTER HALL AND THE GLIDERS OF THE LOST ARKDC Comics made big news (mostly negative) among fans this week with the revelation that in September, the publisher will be relaunching their entire slate with 52 #1 comics along with major changes and a new online publishing option. These changes include a de-aging of many characters, costume changes like Superman losing his red outside underwear, and matching collars being added to many costumes. One of the characters that is seeing the biggest change is Hawkman, who will star in The Savage Hawkman with a new costume complete with talon-like gloves and porcupine-like wings. Hawkman is one of DC’s oldest superheroes (introduced in 1940), and he has also been the subject of some of the most confusing changes and reboots, to the point that there is not one answer as to who exactly Hawkman even is. Coincidentally, this week, the news also broke about Warner Bros’ plans for a Hawkman movie. The answer can be found in this description sent out to various screenwriting forums, searching for someone to take on the project, “Part INDIANA JONES/DA VINCI CODE, part GHOST tentpole about the fictional superhero that appears in D.C. Comic books. He used archaic weaponry and large, artificial wings attached to a harness made of the Nth metal that allows flight. Most incarnations of Hawkman work closely with a partner/romantic interest named Hawkgirl or Hawkwoman in his fight against supervillains.” That’s right, Warner Bros is comparing Hawkman to Indiana Jones, The Da Vince Code and (of all things), Ghost. The connection here is that the original Hawkman was archaeologist Carter Hall, who discovered in Egyptian ruins a set of wings made of a mysterious “nth metal” that allowed him to fly. Then, in the 1950s, Hawkman was rebooted as a sort of space cop from the planet Thanagar. Hawkman has been a confusing character ever since. This news is the week’s most Rotten Idea because Warner Bros appears to be fitting a fairly simple superhero peg into an Indiana Jones-shaped hole. That is the same problem that DC Comics keeps having too, probably not coincidentally. The difficulty of how to make a Hawkman movie was also sent up quite well in a recent YouTube video sketch (“Hawkward!”).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"History, Animation, criterion, Larson","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Hangover-Part-III-Already-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509222149825","title":"Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Version of Star Blazers?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Version of Star Blazers?Plus, more space opera news, and yet more remakes.by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 25, 2011 |  CommentsAlthough this was sort of a slow news week, this week’s Ketchup is chock full of space operas (Star Blazers and Prometheus) and remakes (Les Misérables, Ferdinand the Bull, Soapdish and The Bodyguard).This Week’s Top StoryFROM REMAKES OF TRUE GRIT AND TOP GUN TO… STAR BLAZERS?David Ellison is the name of a young producer whose father is Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and who took a fraction of his wealth and had recent success by partly financing the Coen Brothers remake of True Grit. Other projects that Ellison’s Skydance Productions is currently developing or financing include the Top Gun remake, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and the reboot of the Jack Ryan franchise. Ellison and Skydance clearly have a penchant for big budget action movies, but they all may pale in comparison to his latest project. David Ellison has started development on a live action, English language adaptation of the 1970s-1980s anime science fiction TV series Star Blazers (the American import of Japan’s Space Battleship Yamato). Star Blazers had an epic storyline which included “alien invasions, the near extinction of the human race, and a last dash journey through space to save the planet.” Ellison has hired screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects; cowriter of Valkyrie) to adapt Star Blazers down to a two hour live action movie. Christopher McQuarrie’s upcoming movies also include Darren Aronofsky’s The Wolverine and cowriting Bryan Singer’s Jack the Giant Killer. This live action movie also follows the 2010 release of the Japanese live action adaptation of Space Battleship Yamato.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MORE SPACE OPERA NEWS: PROMETHEUS CASTING AND OLD MAN’S WARAs if the news of a big budget Star Blazers movie wasn’t enough, that was just one of three news stories this week that one could classify in the “space opera” genre. First up, Ridley Scott’s Prometheus got three new cast members to join Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. Idris Elba (HBO’s The Wire, Heimdall in Thor), Sean Harris (Red Riding Trilogy) and a relative newcomer, Scottish actress Kate Dickie have all signed on to the 20th Century Fox movie which the producers continue to be quick to note is not a direct prequel to Alien as previously reported. The third evidence that Hollywood has a post-Avatar love affair with big outer space adventures is Paramount’s acquisition of the rights to the John Scalzi novel Old Man’s War. That novel (which has since been followed by three more sequel books) is set in a far future when elderly soldiers trade in their original bodies for genetically enhanced younger clones of themselves so that they can protect human colonies in the far stretches of outer space. Old Man’s War also has a romantic subplot, as the main character eventually meets the younger version of his dead wife, although she doesn’t remember or recognize him. Paramount has attached director Wolfgang Petersen to Old Man’s War, which may be his first movie since 2006’s Poseidon. Before that film, which was considered a box office flop, Wolfgang Petersen directed an impressive string of five hit movies in a row: In the Line of Fire, Outbreak, Air Force One, The Perfect Storm and Troy.#2 FROM THE KING’S SPEECH TO LES MISÉRABLES?First off, it should be noted that this story completely hinges upon the word “may,” but since The Los Angeles Times saw it as fit to print, the Weekly Ketchup will go along as well. This story revolves around director Tom Hooper, who is raking up awards with what was only his second movie, The King’s Speech. Hooper has not yet taken on a new movie since wrapping The King’s Speech last year, and so it’s natural that speculation would be wild about what he might take on next. Which brings us to the “news” that Tom Hooper is “weighing an offer” from Working Title Films to direct a big budget movie adaptation of the extremely successful musical Les Misérables. Based on the 1862 French novel by Victor Hugo, Les Misérables tells the story of a former prison inmate Jean Valjean who tries to reinvent his life as a good man, but is plagued by a relentless officer of the law Javert (well, he’s slightly less relentless in the musical), with the French Revolution also happening all around them. Les Misérables has previously been adapted to film and television many times, with one of the most recent examples being the 1998 movie that featured Geoffrey Rush (as Javert), who also costarred in The King’s Speech.#3 FOX ANIMATION REMAKING A DISNEY CLASSIC: FERDINAND THE BULLFox Animation Studios has acquired the feature film rights to the 1936 children’s book The Story of Ferdinand by author Munro Leaf and illustrator Robert Lawson. Also known as Ferdinand the Bull, the short story tells of a pacifist bull who would rather enjoy the pasture than go fight the matadors. The story of Ferdinand the Bull is probably best known because of the 1938 animated short film that won Walt Disney his eighth Academy Award (which you can watch here). Fox and Blue Sky Studios intend to adapt The Story of Ferdinand as a full length CGI animated feature. The movie will be directed by Carlos Saldanha, who directed Ice Age: The Meltdown and the upcoming Rio, and who codirected most of Blue Sky’s other animated movies. An attorney for the estate of Robert Lawson noted that unlike many classic Disney projects (not counting works in the public domain like Snow White), the studio never acquired the rights to The Story of Ferdinand other than that one short film. That mistake back in the 1930s is what has now enabled Fox to make a movie that might have otherwise been Disney’s exclusive property.#4 STEVE CARELL TO GET SERIOUS WITH THE DOGS OF BABELIt’s an inevitable rite of passage for many comedic actors: eventually, they want to go dramatic (and maybe get some Oscar gold). Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Bill Murray, Jim Carrey, even Adam Sandler… they all did it. Although the dramedy of Dan in Real Life and Little Miss Sunshine were half-steps in that direction, Steve Carell has not yet had a heavy dramatic film, absent any comic undertones. That apparently changed this week with the news that Carell has signed to star in Dogs of Babel, based upon the best-selling novel by Carolyn Parkhurst. Described as a “tragic yet beautiful story of love and loss,” Dogs of Babel tells the story of a linguistics professor who attempts to his teach his dog to talk in the hopes that the pet can answer the mysteries surrounding his wife’s death in their backyard. This writer almost teared up halfway through typing that sentence. Dogs of Babel was adapted by screenwriter Jamie Linden, who also adapted We Are Marshall and Dear John, and will be making his directorial debut with the upcoming Ten Year, also starring Dear John lead Channing Tatum. Dogs of Babel does not yet have a director, and with Steve Carell already attached to several comedy projects, there’s no telling when Dogs of Babel might actually get made. However, the producers say they are looking for a director “right away” (possibly Jamie Linden himself?), so Dogs of Babel may happen sooner rather than later.#5 LOUIS LETERRIER SAYS NOW YOU SEE ME, THEN U’S GIn the last year, online opinions about French action director Louis Leterrier seemed to have dipped, following Clash of the Titans. Before that remake, however, Leterrier’s track record was solidly in the middle critically (the first two Transporter movies, Unleashed and The Incredible Hulk), which is pretty good for an action director. So, this column is putting news of his next two movies in the “Fresh Developments” category, by a hair. First, there will be the heist movie Now You See Me for Summit Entertainment. The story “pits a crack FBI squad in a game of cat and mouse against a super-team of the world’s greatest illusionists, who pull off a series of bank heists during their performances, showering their profits on their audiences while staying one step ahead of the law.” Now You See Me was written by Boaz Yakin (cowriter of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights) and Edward Ricourt (who doesn’t have any produced credits yet). The news of that project was followed a few days later by the announcement that Leterrier has also signed with Universal Pictures to direct G, a disaster movie formerly known as Gravity. Compared to The Day After Tomorrow and Taken, G is about “a father who has to search for his lost child as the world stops spinning and Earth begins to lose its gravity.” At this point, G is just a concept, and Universal is currently looking for screenwriters to actually turn the idea into 100 pages or so of actual dialogue and action scenes.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 MICHAEL BAY VS. ZOMBIES VS. ROBOTSMichael Bay’s Platinum Dunes production company (best known for their recent horror remakes) has acquired the rights to the IDW comic book series Zombies Vs. Robots. The deal includes a script based on the comic called Inherit the Earth (possibly a working or subtitle) by J.T. Petty, whose previous work is mostly on video games and the 2008 direct-to-video title The Burrowers. The comic book is about a young girl who is the last survivor of a zombie apocalypse, with a group of robots protecting her from a new pack of zombies that have evolved and are now intelligent. The premise of pitting robots against zombies is somewhat promising in a cheeky B-movie way, but this is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, mostly because the words “Michael” and “Bay” appear in the story.#3 I AM PREACHER FOURGarth Ennis’ blasphemous Vertigo Comics comic book series Preacher has had a long, decade-long road to getting adapted in some form. In addition to being in development as a movie, HBO was at one point considering a television series which would adapt each issue as an hour-long episode (which was a pretty clever idea). Preacher is the story of a minister who receives a powerful supernatural ability who, along with a motley group of friends (including a vampire), sets off across America in search of God, who he is quite upset with (to put it mildly). HBO eventually scrapped the Preacher series in 2008, and now the movie has a new director attached. DJ Caruso has directed such movies as Disturbia, Eagle Eye, Two for the Money, Taking Lives and this week’s release I Am Number Four. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because D.J. Caruso seems like a rather “middle of the road” choice for an adaptation that is so edgy and inherently violent and vulgar. There’s also the issue of D.J. Caruso’s movies mostly getting Tomatometer scores in the 20-30% range, except for Disturbia and The Salton Sea.#2 BIZARRE REMAKE OF THE WEEK: SOAPDISHIn the 1980s and early 1990s, the daytime soap opera was in what we can now see as sort of its golden age. Several soaps had characters and plots identifiable by the public at large, and some of the actors from that time went on to become bigger stars (Alec Baldwin, Meg Ryan, Courteney Cox, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Demi Moore, etc.). In 1991, Paramount released the comedy Soapdish, which was a star-studded (Whoopi Goldberg, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr, etc) comedy set behind the scenes of a fictional soap opera. Today, the daytime soap opera appears to be in a state of fast decline, with a few long-running series ending recently (Guiding Light, As the World Turns), so that now there are only six shows left. Considering that, it is extremely odd news that Paramount is developing a remake of Soapdish. The Soapdish remake will be written by actor-turned-writer Ben Schwartz, who has written several episodes of Robot Chicken and also won an Emmy in 2009 for writing Hugh Jackman’s Academy Awards monologue. It’s possible (actually, quite likely) that the dwindling popularity of daytime soap operas will be an element in the remake’s script, but that doesn’t totally forgive that someone at Paramount thought a remake of Soapdish was a good idea.#1 WARNER BROS SAYS IIIIIIIIIII WILL ALWAYS LOVE THE BODYGUARDThe old thought about remakes is that it is better to remake a movie that was flawed the first time than to remake one that worked (which is actually an argument for the Soapdish remake, admittedly). One movie that definitely worked was the 1992 romance The Bodyguard, starring Whitney Houston as a pop singer and Kevin Costner as the title character, which did much, much better than anyone probably could have predicted (it was the #2 movie of the year, behind only Disney’s Aladdin). What one person sees however, as a reason not to remake The Bodyguard is probably Warner Bros’ reason for doing exactly that. The studio has hired screenwriters Jeremiah Friedman and Nick Palmer (neither of whom yet have a produced movie to their credit) to adapt the original script by Lawrence Kasdan. Friedman and Palmer did write the action comedy Family Getaway for Warner Bros, and which made the 2010 Black List of top rated unproduced scripts. The premise of the remake will reportedly follow a former Iraq veteran who has to protect his client from the scary Internet and “stalkers who can track stars on Twitter, Gawker Stalker, Google Maps and countless other sites.” Warner Bros’ plans for a remake of The Bodyguard follow the recent news that Clint Eastwood will be directing Beyonce in the latest version of A Star is Born. The reason this remake is this week’s Most Rotten Idea is that the bar is set impossibly high. In order not to fail in comparison, this remake will have to do what, be the #1 movie of the year in which it’s released? The original’s success was helped in great part by Whitney Houston’s cover of Dolly Parton’s “I Will Always Love You.” Can a single song achieve the same level of success for a movie today? This story is not, however, the end of Kevin Costner news this week. There is also “buzz” that Costner is a top choice of director Zack Snyder to costar in his reboot of Superman. There’s no word yet as to whom Kevin Costner would play, but the most logical guess has to be Jonathan “Pa” Kent. Costner has the requisite rugged Midwestern charm (even though he’s from California), Field of Dreams could have been set in Smallville, and Costner even looks a bit like John Schneider these days.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Universe, Marathons, heist, VH1, Network, books","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-A-Live-Action-Version-of-Star-Blazers"},{"id":"47509222167242","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Fresh Developments from 2010","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Fresh Developments from 201012 of the top stories of the year, one from each month.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 27, 2010 |  CommentsThe year that was 2010 is coming to an end, and so it’s time to look back at the biggest news items of the year (in lieu of actual weekly movie news, which there isn’t much of around Christmas). This is also a chance to look forward, as most of the movies that were announced in 2010 are still in our collective futures. And so, here are twelve “Fresh Development” movie news items from the past year, one for each month, that also represent some of the biggest upcoming movies of the next few years.JANUARY: HUGO CABRET: FROM THE DIRECTOR OF TAXI DRIVER AND GOODFELLAS COMES… A KIDS MOVIE?In degrees of news stories, an element that makes for some of the biggest items is the unexpected. Christopher Nolan’s directing another Batman movie? Yeah, we sort of expected that. Martin Scorsese is directing an adaptation of a kids book called The Invention of Hugo Cabret? That, not so much. The movie’s title has since been shortened to just Hugo Cabret, and as reported here in January, filming has since wrapped on the European production about a boy who secretly lives within the walls of a busy 19th century Paris train station. Scorsese attracted an all-star cast to his first venture into the “family adventure” genre which includes Sacha Baron Cohen, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Christopher Lee, Chloe Moretz, Emily Mortimer and Ray Winstone. 13-year-old English actor Asa Butterfield, who is currently best known for starring in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas (not as the titular boy, but as the boy’s German friend) may be in line to become one of the breakout stars of 2011 if Hugo Cabret is the critical and box office hit that it could be. Hugo Cabret will be co-distributed by Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros, and is scheduled for release in the USA on December 11, 2011. Martin Scorsese also made news this year with the casting of his upcoming mob movie The Irishman, which will include Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, all appearing in the same movie together for the first time.FEBRUARY: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN IS THE “GODFATHER” OF THE NEXT SUPERMAN REBOOTAdmittedly, the really big news item for Warner Bros’ planned reboot of the Superman franchise was the October hiring of director Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, the upcoming Sucker Punch). However, October was a month full of big “Fresh” movie news, and February, well, wasn’t. But, really, the road to Snyder coming aboard the next Superman movie started with the news in February that Christopher Nolan had agreed to work with Warner Bros as a sort of artistic “godfather” to help the movie get going in a fashion appropriate to its potential. It was through Nolan that Warner Bros picked up a Superman story idea from screenwriter David S. Goyer (who received “story” credit for Nolan’s first two Batman movies, as well as the upcoming third film), who is also now cowriting the reboot with Nolan’s brother Jonathan Nolan. It’s also worth noting that one of the reasons Warner Bros hired the Nolans, Goyer and Snyder in a relatively quick manner this year is that the studio needs to start filming the Superman reboot by 2011. Otherwise, the studio risks losing the rights to the estates of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The Superman reboot is currently scheduled by Warner Bros for a release in December, 2012. Christopher Nolan’s third and final Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises (scheduled for July 20, 2012), also made the news this year a few times. The most notable story was the casting of Inception costar Tom Hardy in an unknown role, possibly as one of the film’s villains.MARCH: THE J. EDGAR HOOVER BIOPIC IS FIRST ANNOUNCEDA high profile biopic that has a lot of movie fans cautiously optimistic was first announced in March of this year. At the time, the first details that were revealed about the movie now known as J. Edgar (formerly Hoover) was that the story of the life of FBI founder and original director J. Edgar Hoover were just the producers and the screenwriter. Dustin Lance Black, the Oscar winning screenwriter of the biopics Milk and Pedro, was announced as working with Ron Howard and Brian Grazer’s Imagine Entertainment. A month later, we learned that the star to play J. Edgar Hoover would be Leonardo DiCaprio, and that the movie would be Clint Eastwood’s next as director after this year’s Hereafter. The latest news for J. Edgar came just a few weeks ago, as Armie Hammer (The Social Network) and Charlize Theron are reportedly in talks to costar, respectively, as Hoover’s longtime companion Clyde Tolson and Hoover’s personal secretary Helen Gandy. Filming of J. Edgar begins in early 2011, and it may be released by Warner Bros in late 2011 as part of next year’s Oscar season.APRIL: RON HOWARD’S EPIC MOVIE AND TELEVISION PLANS FOR STEPHEN KING’S THE DARK TOWERThis story has the distinction of actually appearing in the Weekly Ketchup twice this year (with a few more details the second time), and both times, it was the Top Story. In April, it was revealed that Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine Entertainment had entered into negotations with Universal Pictures and Weed Road (Jonah Hex, The Losers) to adapt Stephen King’s magnum opus, the series of novels known collectively as The Dark Tower. That deal was then confirmed during the slow post-Labor Day week in early September. The Dark Tower is a fantasy epic that combines elements of classic Old West cowboy themes with supernatural and fantasy elements, telling the story of the last member of an order of “gunslingers” descended from King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table. Ron Howard will personally direct at least the first of three movies based upon books in the series, and also direct the first season of an NBC television series that will fill in the gaps in between each of the three movies. Coproducer Akiva Goldsman (Batman &amp; Robin; cowriter of I, Robot, I Am Legend) will also write the first movie and the first season of the TV series. Given the massive scope of this project, it is probably a few years from actually getting started, but if all goes well, it’s possible we could see the first movie by sometime in 2013.MAY: DAVID FINCHER HEADING 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEAAs I went back through the year looking for the freshest ideas each month, I was surprised to find a pretty significant initial announcement here in May that I myself as a movie fan had sort of forgot about. In all the press about The Social Network, the emphasis has been on director David Fincher’s next project being the English language adaptation of the late Stieg Larsson’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (which he is currently filming). However, in May, David Fincher was also first mentioned as being hired by Walt Disney Pictures for a very different movie which has the potential of being the biggest production the already ambitious director has ever tackled. That project is Disney’s long-in-development plan to remake their 1954 hit movie based upon Jules Verne’s 19th century science fiction adventure novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The movie is admittedly at least a year away from filming, but the promise of Fincher working on a movie with the sort of epic scale that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea potentially could have is definitely something that we movie fans should not overlook.JUNE: AFTER THREE SPIDER-MAN MOVIES, DIRECTOR SAM RAIMI TAKES ON THE ORIGINAL WINGLESS WIZARDThe January news of Sam Raimi’s departure from the Spider-Man film franchise (and Sony’s subsequent decision to do a reboot) obviously left a big gaping hole in the director’s schedule. Raimi has long been attached to direct for Warner Bros an adaptation of the Warcraft video game franchise, but 2010 came and went without an official announcement of that movie project being greenlit. In June, the movie that emerged as Sam Raimi’s next was Walt Disney Pictures’ Oz: The Great and Powerful, a new spin on the classic L. Frank Baum character, to be played by Robert Downey Jr. Oz: The Great and Powerful is just one of many movies in active development that are somehow related to L. Frank Baum’s Oz books. Universal’s planned adaptation of the stage musical Wicked is probably the closest thematic relative (as both focus on a supporting character who isn’t Dororthy Gale). Oz: The Great and Powerful wasn’t however, the only project that Raimi’s name was associated with this year. There was also a rumor about a possible reboot of The Shadow, an adaptation of the futuristic cowboy comic book series Earp: Saints for Sinners, and the alien invasion movie EDF (Earth Defense Force) (which Raimi is producing but not directing).JULY: THE SOCIAL NETWORK STAR ANDREW GARFIELD IS THE NEW SPIDER-MANThis right here is probably the story that might be the most disputed by movie fans in the comments below. When Sony Pictures announced in January that they were scrapping plans for a fourth Spider-Man movie featuring Tobey Maguire, and going with a reboot of the franchise instead, I myself wrote up the story as the week’s Most Rotten Idea. That story included the news that the new director would be Marc Webb, whose (500) Days of Summer was one of the best movies (in my opinion) of 2009. However, it was difficult at the time to not be distracted by the concept of a successful franchise being “rebooted” less than eight years after it began. It is arguable that with the July announcement that American-British actor Andrew Garfield would be the new Peter Parker will ultimately be seen as the turning point for how the public perceives this reboot. Or perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that the October 1, 2010 release of The Social Network was that turning point. Looking back now, we can speculate that because the executives and producers at Sony/Columbia had seen The Social Network in July (but we had not), they knew exactly what they had in that movie’s memorable costar, Andrew Garfield (who played Facebook cofounder Eduardo Saverin). Of course, those were just two of the Spider-Man stories this year, which were followed by the casting of Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, the casting of Rhys Ifans as The Lizard, the casting of Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, the casting of Denis Leary as Captain Stacy, and well, a whole bunch more people too. The as-yet-untitled Spider-Man reboot is scheduled for release by Columbia Pictures on July 3, 2012.AUGUST: TOM HANKS AND SANDRA BULLOCK COSTARRING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIMEAugust was admittedly a very quiet month in movie news, particularly when one limits the field to movie stories that one would consider “fresh developments.” Perhaps that’s a reflection of how August is itself perceived by Hollywood in terms of what movies are released in that month, as especially the later Fridays are often a “dumping ground” for movies that end up being “rotten.” One film that stood out in August was the announcement of Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, which appears to be as close to a complete “Oscar bait” movie as one could imagine getting made. The film will mark the first time that “America’s Sweethearts” Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock have ever costarred together, playing the parents of a 9-year-old child prodigy who goes on a personal journey through the five boroughs of New York City in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Director Stephen Daldry has only directed three movies (Billy Elliot, The Hours, The Reader) and all three earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The script was adapted from a novel by Safran Foer (Everything is Illuminated) by screenwriter Eric Roth, who won an Oscar for Forrest Gump, and was also nominated for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and for cowriting Munich and The Insider. Filming is scheduled to start in New York City in early January, and codistributors Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros are likely to try to get the movie in theaters in late 2011 in time for awards consideration.SEPTEMBER: MARTIN FREEMAN EMERGES AS THE TOP CHOICE TO PLAY BILBO BAGGINS IN THE HOBBITAdmittedly, the process of squeezing in twelve of the top “fresh” movie stories of the year to match all twelve months means that sometimes the date actually matches something more like the second biggest news item for a given movie. The question of who would star in Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit as Bilbo Baggins was officially confirmed in October ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hobbit-2010/news/1921059/weekly_ketchup_martin_freeman_cast_as_the_hobbit/ ). However, it was actually in September that we first heard ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stephen_king_dvd_collector_set/news/1920697/weekly_ketchup_ron_howard_takes_on_the_dark_tower/ ) about Martin Freeman. Martin Freeman is not a household name in the U.S., but he might be recognizable as Arthur Dent in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and supporting roles in Hot Fuzz and Love, Actually, and for the U.K. version of The Office. When Freeman was confirmed in October, his story also came along with the names of several of the actors who will be playing the members of Thorin’s Company of Dwarves. The large ensemble cast is still in the process of being fully cast, with the latest batch being announced two weeks ago ( http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hobbit/news/1921465/weekly_ketchup_blanchett_to_appear_in_the_hobbit/ ). That latest list of names included Cate Blanchett, who will have a significant returning role as the elf Galadriel, despite the character not actually appearing in the original novel at all. Filming of the two parts of The Hobbit is scheduled to start in New Zealand in February, 2011, in preparation for the release of the two movies in December of 2012 and 2013, respectively.OCTOBER: DARREN ARONOFSKY FINALLY GETS HIS SUPERHERO MOVIE: THE WOLVERINEThis story actually got its story in September. At that time, Darren Aronofsky was first mentioned as being one of the directors talking to 20th Century Fox about the sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, along with David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, 30 Days of Night). As fantastic as the idea of Darren Aronofsky finally getting to make a big budget superhero movie seemed, however, many fans (and rightly so) most likely took the story with a grain of salt so big Logan would have a hard time cutting it down to size. That’s why the official announcement in October is where the newly-titled The Wolverine actually falls on this countdown. Written by Chris McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects; cowriter of Valkyrie), The Wolverine is described as being a movie that returns the most popular X-Men member to his roots as a dark, somber, intense and obviously violent character. The Wolverine is also the movie that will depict Logan’s time in Japan, following the events of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It’s one thing to say that, but in hiring Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), 20th Century Fox accomplished the goal of sending that message to the fans. Martin Scorsese might be making kids movies now (well, one at least), but it’s unlikely Darren Aronofsky will be doing that anytime soon.NOVEMBER: DANIEL DAY LEWIS HELPS STEVEN SPIELBERG REVIVE HIS DREAM OF A LINCOLN MOVIEWhen Liam Neeson dropped out of Steven Spielberg’s long-planned Lincoln biopic this past July, it appeared at the time as if that might be the end of what has long been the director’s most cherished pet project. In November, however, another Irish actor joined the project, and it was an actor who’s appeared in less movies in the last 10 years than Liam Neeson has done in the last 10 months: Daniel Day-Lewis. Although Liam Neeson is also a talented actor, Daniel Day-Lewis is arguably in a completely different league (although being so picky about his roles undoubtedly helps Day-Lewis refine his reputation). Lincoln was adapted by playwright Tony Kushner (Angels in America) from the book Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Goodwin’s book is about “the political collision of Lincoln and the powerful men of his cabinet on the road to abolition and the end of the Civil War.” Steven Spielberg also announced this year and then filmed the World War I movie War Horse. That movie will be released by Touchstone Pictures on December 28, 2011, just five days after the December 23, 2011 release by Paramount Pictures of The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn. Steven Spielberg is expected to start filming Lincoln in late 2011 in time for a late 2012 release date through Disney’s Touchstone Pictures.DECEMBER: JAMES BOND 23 STILL HAPPENINGConsidering the post Thanksgiving lull and the fact that almost nothing happens for the last two weeks, December is for obvious reasons a month in which a lot less news emerges. The movie that lands in this spot actually had arguably “fresh” news in January and November as well, but well, December is the place where it fits best. The movie in question is the 23rd entry in the James Bond franchise. The December news is actually very similar to the news that first appeared in January, but the difference is everything that happened in between. In January, EON Productions announced that they had hired British filmmaker Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) as a “consultant,” possibly due to MGM’s financial straits at the time, and the question of whether they could officially announce him as the next director in the franchise. As positive as that news seemed, a week after Sam Mendes was confirmed by Barbara Broccoli as signing on to direct three months later, James Bond fans were struck a blow. EON announced in April that plans for the 23rd James Bond movie had been “indefinitely postponed.” Following that news, Daniel Craig signed on to star in director David Fincher’s English language remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. However, as MGM continues to emerge from its financial crisis in its new form, good news has returned to the Bond franchise. In November, a financial report listed the 23rd James Bond movie as being scheduled for a November, 2012 release date. This all leads to the recent December news that Kate Winslet has revealed that she plans to move back to England temporarily so that Mendes (from whom she is currently separated) can spend time with their children.So there you have them, twelve of the freshest developments of 2010.

Hollywood’s ongoing obsession with remakes is particularly evident, as remakes of Fantastic Voyage, Highlander, Jack the Giant Killer, Logan’s Run and Red Sonja are all covered this week. Finally, I should mention that this week marked my third anniversary at Rotten Tomatoes as the writer of the Weekly Ketchup. My very first column was published on February 8, 2008, which made Rotten Tomatoes my new online home after ten years as the creator and writer of Upcomingmovies.com.This Week’s Top StoryRYAN GOSLING GOES FOR A JOG IN LOGAN’S RUNOrdinarily, this column is a bit of a Negative Nancy when it comes to remakes. However, that’s usually because the original was a good movie to begin with. Such was not necessarily the case with the 1976 science fiction film Logan’s Run (regardless of its 70% Tomatometer, which seems to be viewed through rose-colored glasses). Logan’s Run was based upon a 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson about a future society where utopia was maintained by killing everyone when they reached a certain age (21 in the book, 30 in the movie). A look back at the original Logan’s Run trailer makes Star Wars, which came out just a year later, look even more amazing. Warner Bros has been trying to remake Logan’s Run for nearly a decade, including a time in which Bryan Singer was attached to direct, before eventually moving on to Jack the Giant Slayer (see below). Now, the Logan’s Run remake finally has not only a director, but a star (who is in talks). Director Nicolas Winding Refn (Bronson, Valhalla Rising) will reunite with Ryan Gosling, the star of his next film (Drive, due out September 16, 2011). Gosling will play the title role originated by Michael York. This is a career change for Ryan Gosling, who has mostly focused recently on non-studio projects, although he has appeared in a few like The Notebook, Remember the Titans and Murder by Numbers.Fresh Developments This Week#1 E (EINSTEIN) = M (MOVIE) TIMES C (COOLNESS) SQUAREDThe production company of producer Paul Schiff (Rushmore, Young Guns) has announced that filming is expected to start soon on Einstein, a biopic about famed German physicist Albert Einstein. Einstein will be directed by Wayne Wang (Smoke, Blue in the Face, Maid in Manhattan) from a screenplay by Academy Award winner Ronald Bass (Dangerous Minds; cowriter of Rain Man, Amelia). Here’s what one of the producers had to say about the movie’s scope: “People don’t know about his struggles with poverty, his dyslexia, his love for music, his relationships with the women in his life, his persecution by the Nazis and his battle to deal with living in the public eye and being under constant scrutiny. Ron’s screenplay peels back the layers and allows us to see past Einstein the scientist and Einstein the celebrity, showing us Einstein the man.” The casting search for the actor to play Albert Einstein will now start in the next few weeks. Einstein is expected to be filmed mostly in Germany and at other locations throughout Europe.#2 THE STAR OF ABOUT A BOY IS ALL GROWN UP AND READY TO DO SOME GIANT KILLINGThe star of one of my favorite movies of the last 10 years was in Clash of the Titans last year, and has been cast in X-Men: First Class as the Beast, and I didn’t even realize it until today. Nicholas Hoult, who starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant at age 12, is now 21 years old and barely recognizable (unless you’re looking for it, I would argue). Hoult has also now landed his first major starring role since About a Boy, and there’s a good chance it will be a high profile star-making movie. Nicholas Hoult will star as the title character in Jack the Giant Killer, the big budget Warner Bros adaptation of the Jack and the Beanstalk fairy tale that director Bryan Singer (X-Men, Superman Returns) has been trying to get made for a few years now. Stanley Tucci has also signed on to costar, playing an advisor to the (human) king of Jack’s kingdom, and the film’s main villain. Bill Nighy (Love, Actually) will play Fallon, the leader of the giants, who is also two-headed, with the other head being played by John Kassir (the voice of the Cryptkeeper from Tales from the Crypt). The IMDb lists six other previous movies called Jack the Giant Killer, with the most high profile adaptation being the 1962 film starring Kerwin Matthews, which featured stop motion animation that was not done by Ray Harryhausen, and is generally considered to be sort of awful. Mickey Mouse also starred in the short film Mickey and the Beanstalk, which was part of the Fun and Fancy Free anthology in 1947. Filming of Jack the Giant Killer starts in March, 2011.#3 DAKOTA FANNING JOINING THE ROYAL FAMILY IN GIRLS’ NIGHT OUTIn the same week that saw the release of the first image of Meryl Streep as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, another famous British Margaret has been cast. American actress Dakota Fanning (who will soon turn 17) will star in the British production Girls’ Night Out. The movie will be set during the original V.E. Day (Victory in Europe Day) in 1945, when teenage Princesses Margaret (Fanning) and Elizabeth were allowed out of Buckingham Palace for one night to join in the public celebrations. The role of Princess Elizabeth (AKA the current Queen) has yet to be cast. On May 8, 1945, Princess Margaret was 14, and Princess Elizabeth was 19, and she was 27 when she was coronated eight years later in 1953. Princess Margaret went on to suffer many years of illness, including having her left lung removed in 1985, suffering several strokes and eventually dying in 2002. Queen Elizabeth, on the other hand, has been reigning now for 59 years, and at age 84 appears to still be in remarkable health. Girls’ Night Out will be directed by British director Michael Hoffman (The Last Station, One Fine Day). Hoffman is currently working on the remake of the 1966 caper Gambit, working from a script adapted by the Coen Brothers, which will star Colin Firth and Cameron Diaz.#4 HARRY HOUDINI AND ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE TO HEAR VOICES FROM THE DEADThis writer discovered while working on this piece that two historical figures that he associated more with the 19th century actually lived well into the 1920s. Escape artist Harry Houdini died in 1926 and Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle died in 1930. Not only that, but the two were good friends (something else I didn’t know). That friendship is the basis for an original screenplay picked up by DreamWorks this week from screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski (Changeling; cowriter of Ninja Assassin), who also was the creator of the Babylon 5 television series. Voices from the Dead tells the (fictional) story of Houdini and Doyle teaming up with a psychic to solve a series of murders in 1920s New York City. One thing that is particularly interesting about this concept is that neither man was particularly young in 1920: Houdini was 46, and Doyle was 61. So, that gives an idea of who might be cast in Voices from the Dead (particularly Doyle), if DreamWorks is planning on being faithful to their ages. Two days after this story broke, it was revealed that the SyFy channel is also developing a series about Houdini and Doyle solving mysteries in 1920s New York City. Called Among the Spirits, the series will team the duo up with a female police officer and will feature them investigating mysteries that appear to be supernatural, but aren’t necessarily (tying in with Houdini’s second career as a debunker).#5 ZOMBIES ATE MY NEIGHBORS EYES MOVIE THEATERS FOR DESSERTIn recent months, several video game adaptations have made the Rotten Ideas list mostly because the original games had very little narrative to base a movie upon (i.e. Missile Command). By the 1990s, however, video games did indeed start to have well-defined stories. One such game was the 1993 Super Nintendo/Sega Genesis title Zombies Ate My Neighbors, which was a comedic homage to classic horror movies and the zombie genre in particular. Zombies Ate My Neighbors was not a commercial success, but the LucasArts/Konami collaboration was well reviewed, and with time (and nostalgia) has become a minor cult classic. The game followed two teenagers as they advanced through 50 levels of neighborhood terrain, fighting an assortment of movie-style monsters that included vampires and werewolves in addition to zombies. Now, screenwriter John Darko (who doesn’t yet have any produced theatrical releases to his credit) is working on finding financing for an independent adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors as a comedic horror movie in the style of Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead. This story was ignored by most sites this week, possibly because of its current independent status, but it’s being included here because this seems like the sort of potentially clever and cool videogame adaptation that should be encouraged.#6 STEPHENIE MEYER’S THE HOST BEING ADAPTED BY A TEAM TOO TALENTED TO BE LABELED ROTTENWith the last two parts of the Twilight Saga adaptations now being filmed, Hollywood is getting ready to move on to Stephenie Meyer’s other books, starting with the 2008 science fiction novel The Host. The book is set on a version of Earth where most people have been taken over by “altruistic parasites” (which seems like an oxymoron). There are a few “resistors,” including a young lady named Melanie Stryder who becomes involved in a love triangle that involves two people and an alien parasite. The premise of The Host arguably has some similarities to that of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, in which a werewolf falls in love with a telepathic baby. The Host will be directed by British director Susanna White, whose previous work includes Nanny McPhee Returns, the BBC mini-series Jane Eyre and the HBO mini-series Generation Kill. The Host was adapted by screenwriter and Academy Award nominee Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, Gattaca), who is currently the science thriller Now (which has a similar premise to Logan’s Run, see above). Unlike most stories about The Twilight Saga, The Host lands in the Fresh Development category because the novel actually did receive a lot of positive reviews, and both Susanna White and Andrew Niccol have promising resumes.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 COMEDY DIRECTOR SETS OFF ON A FANTASTIC VOYAGEFantastic Voyage, released in 1966, was a science fiction thriller about a submarine containing team of scientists that is shrunk to microscopic size so that it can fix a deadly clot in a scientist’s brain. James Cameron has been trying to get a 3D remake of Fantastic Voyage produced for quite a while now, but the problem of finding a director has kept it stalled until now. 20th Century Fox has hired comedy director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Date Night, The Pink Panther) to work on the Fantastic Voyage remake. This new Fantastic Voyage has been referred to as more of a “re-imagining” than a remake (although one could argue that the two mean the same thing these days), and now with the hiring of Levy, we get an idea of what sort of re-imagining is likely being done. The script was adapted by Shane Salerno (Armageddon, Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem) and was rewritten by Laeta Kalogridis (Pathfinder, Shutter Island). The screenwriters don’t seem to suggest a comedic approach, but it’s possible that Levy is being brought in to give the movie a comic touch that is more visual and transcends what is on the written page. The other possibility is that Shawn Levy is trying to move into non-comedic material, which his upcoming “boxing robot” movie Real Steel also appears to be doing. However, since we only know Levy’s comedic work, it’s difficult to discern how effective Fantastic Voyage will be, whatever he does with the premise. And it’s the premise that truly lands Fantastic Voyage in the Rotten Idea category. With nanotechnology getting more and more advanced, it would no longer really be necessary for actual scientists to be shrunk down, when there are already tiny robots that could be used to perform this operation. And if nanotech can’t do this specific operation now, they will probably be able to in a few years, certainly before anyone perfects a “shrinking ray.” That, however, wasn’t the only news that Shawn Levy and 20th Century Fox made this week. Levy will produce with Fox Animation an adaptation of the popular Mr. Men illustrated children’s books by British author Roger Hargreaves. Hargreaves wrote 48 Mr. Men books, and the colorful “smiley face” characters have been adapted into four different animated television series.#2 AMBER HEARD WANTED TO DON THE CHAIN MAIL BIKINI OF RED SONJARed Sonja is a chain mail bikini-clad warrior amazon who has her adventures in the same Hyborian Age as Robert E. Howard’s Conan, and she first appeared in the 1970s Marvel Comics adaptations of that character. Red Sonja was eventually adapted as a 1985 movie starring Brigitte Nielsen and Arnold Schwarzenegger (though not as Conan). In recent years, director Robert Rodriguez had been working on a new Red Sonja movie which would have starred his then-girlfriend Rose McGowan, but in 2010, Rodriguez’s project was put on hold. Now, producer Avi Lerner, who produced the upcoming Conan the Barbarian reboot, has announced that Red Sonja is still moving forward, and is expected to be produced in between Conan the Barbarian and its expected sequel. Lerner’s comments bring us two bits of news, the first of which is that Simon West (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Con Air) has been chosen to direct. The latest news about Simon West was that he was planning on reuniting with Nicolas Cage on an action movie called Medallion. As for who Lerner wants to cast as Red Sonja herself, the producer said, “we just finished a movie called Drive Angry with Amber Heard, and I want to see her. She’s my favorite for the role.” Amber Heard is possibly best known for starring in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, and she also had a small role in Zombieland. It’s also curious that she was in Drive Angry, which also stars Nicolas Cage, which ties this movie back to director Simon West again (which suggests, perhaps, that Cage could be recruited to star in Red Sonja as well… but that’s just speculation). Red Sonja is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas, however, mostly because Red Sonja seems like a low-grade sword and sorcery concept that would mostly be made for its T&amp;A appeal. Yes, chain mail bikinis are sexy, but can you imagine how uncomfortable that outfit is?#1 HIGHLANDER REMAKE PROVES THAT THERE CAN BE MORE THAN ONEBack in 2008, Summit Entertainment announced plans to remake the classic 1986 fantasy film Highlander. Highlander starred Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery and introduced the world to a supernatural struggle (set in the “real world”) between immortal warriors that is epitomized by the often-referenced tagline, “there can be only one.” Highlander went on to become a very prolific franchise, including six movies (one of them animated), three television series (one of them animated), a comic book and ten novels. There hasn’t been much to talk about the Highlander reboot in the last three years, but this week, the project came back out of obscurity with quite a bit of news to make up for lost time. Neal Moritz, the producer of such big action movies as I Am Legend and the xXx and Fast and the Furious franchises, is now producing the Highlander reboot for Summit Entertainment. Along with him, Moritz has hired director Justin Lin, who directed three of the five movies in that latter franchise: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, 2009’s Fast &amp; Furious and the upcoming Fast Five. One has to wonder if that means that Connor MacLeod will be spending a lot of time in souped-up race cars as well as wielding his head-chopping sword. However, it’s the screenwriter that really gives us an idea of what sort of Highlander reboot this might be. In addition to producing many episodes of The O.C., Dexter and Birds of Prey, Melissa Rosenberg is best known as the sole screenwriter of all five adaptations of Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight Saga (she also cowrote Step Up). Back when the Highlander reboot was first announced in 2008, it was described as having more of a romantic element than the original. The choice of Melissa Rosenberg as the screenwriter seems to back that up, and that’s why this is the week’s Most Rotten Idea. Does anyone really want to see Highlander rebooted and reshaped to appeal to Twilight fans, probably with scenes of Connor and Juan (Sean Connery in the original) moping about the stresses and romantic complications of immortality?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Academy, The, FXX, Box, foreign, hist, Annual, Lucasfilm, TV, Golden","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ryan-Gosling-to-Tackle-Logans-Run"},{"id":"47509220721340","title":"Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Justice League Movie in 2013?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: A Live Action Justice League Movie in 2013?Plus, Bill Murray as FDR, Hailee Steinfeld as Sleeping Beauty, and Jennifer Garner as Miss Marple.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 1, 2011 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes lots of news for DC Comics movies (Justice League, Green Lantern and the casting of Lois Lane), new movies for Jennifer Garner, Bill Murray, Hailee Steinfeld and the penguins from Madagascar.This Week’s Top StoryTHIS WEEK IN DC COMICS NEWS: JUSTICE LEAGUE 2013, AND AMY ADAMS AS LOIS LANEThis week gave us big news stories for three different DC Comics movies. The biggest story of the week was the revelation from Warner Bros’ new studio boss Jeff Robinov that the studio plans on releasing a live action Justice League movie in 2013. Back in 2007/2008, the studio was nearing production of a Justice League movie that would have been directed by George Miller (Mad Max, Happy Feet), but it was shelved because of the WGA strike. Warner Bros’ plans for Justice League appear to include at least five of DC Comics’ most popular superheroes: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and The Flash. It’s not yet known if other Justice League members like Green Arrow, The Atom, Aquaman, Hawkman and Martian Manhunter might also be included. Justice League is being seen as a potential launching pad movie for The Flash and Wonder Woman movies of their own. But the Justice League movie will not connect directly to Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies, or Zack Snyder’s Superman movie coming in late 2012. For Justice League, a new Batman and Superman will be introduced. What is not yet known is whether this will also apply to Green Lantern, or whether Ryan Reynolds might reprise his role in Justice League as well. Speaking of Green Lantern, we learned this week that Michael Clarke Duncan will be providing the voice of the gargantuan Lantern Kilowog, and that Geoffrey Rush will be voicing the bird-like Lantern Tomar-Re. When it comes to DC Comics movie casting, I am burying the lead, because Amy Adams has been cast to play Lois Lane in the tentatively titled Superman: Man of Steel.Fresh Developments This Week#1 HARRY POTTER TO GO BACK TO SCHOOLJ.K. Rowling may have closed the books on Harry Potter, but Warner Bros may not have. Although the studio has adapted Rowling’s seven books into eight movies, with every book, there was much that had to be left out to fit the 4,100 pages of stories to feature length. So, the studio is considering returning to Hogwart’s in a few years (with a new batch of kid actors) to adapt the remaining story elements that were skipped the first time around. The hope is that most of the adult actors will be able to return to reprise their roles. The plan, however, is not to make seven (or eight) more movies, but to condense two or three novels at a time, resulting in a new trilogy of Harry Potter movies. Because the last four novels were the ones that had the most unadapted material, the first film will be called Harry Potter: Years One, Two and Three. The new child actors will be cast to slightly older than Harry Potter is at the beginning, and CGI effects will be used to make them appear younger in the first half of the movie. The three new films will nearly be “sports movies” as it was often the details of Quidditch that were left out of the films.#2 BILL MURRAY’S LATEST CHARACTER IS FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT IN HYDE PARK ON THE HUDSONOver the course of his career, Bill Murray has created some of the most memorable screen characters in movies like Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, Ed Wood and Lost in Translation. However, Murray has spent the last several years mostly doing animated voice work (the two Garfield movies and Fantastic Mr. Fox), working with director Wes Anderson, and making cameo appearances (Zombieland). This week brought the news of a new role that will see Bill Murray portraying one of the most recognizable historical figures of the 20th Century, as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (AKA FDR) in the British production Hyde Park on the Hudson. The Focus Features production will tell the true story of FDR’s semi-incestuous love affair with his distant cousin Margaret Stuckley, set during the June 1939 weekend during which King George VI (the lead character in The King’s Speech) and Elizabeth become the first British royals to ever visit the United States. Hyde Park on the Hudson will be directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill, Morning Glory) from a script by newcomer Richard Nelson, adapting his own 2009 BBC radio play, aired to celebrate the visit’s 70th anniversary. Filming on Hyde Park on the Hudson is scheduled to start in July, 2011. There’s no word yet as to whether Colin Firth or Helena Bonham Carter might reprise their roles in The King’s Speech as King George and Queen Elizabeth.#3 ALAN MOORE FINALLY GETS HIS SAY IN THE MOVIES WITH MIRACLEMANBritish comic book writer (and eccentric) Alan Moore has long been outspoken about the way that his comics have been adapted to film, such as From Hell, V for Vendetta, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Watchmen. Moore will finally get his chance to see one of his earliest works brought to the movies the way he wants. Alan Moore is reportedly considering making the move to being a film director and screenwriter with Miracleman, an adaptation of the early 1980s dark comic book series about a family of superheroes similar to Captain Marvel. The move mirrors the transition that his 1980s “grim and gritty” contemporary Frank Miller made by codirecting Sin City and directing The Spirit. The Miracleman comics are historically significant for the level of graphic violence, gore and social commentary that Moore brought to the superhero genre. Miracleman will be an independent British production, and there is no word yet on who Moore hopes to cast as the key characters of Miracleman and his arch-nemesis Dr. Gargunza.#4 CAN SIR IAN MCKELLEN BRING US PEACE FOR OUR TIME?The success of The King’s Speech has proven that there is still an audience hungry for biopics about significant British historical figures. So, the latest project to be discussed is Peace For Our Time, about British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Chamberlain was Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940 and is most famous (or notorious) for his 1938 signing of the Munich Agreement, which conceded possession of the Sudetenland region of Czechslovakia to Nazi Germany. Chamberlain’s famous quote from that period was that he felt the agreement would result in “peace for our time.” That proved a diplomatic mistake when a year later Germany proceeded with an invasion of Poland, which led to Great Britain declaring war on Germany. There’s no word yet on who will direct Peace For Our Time, but the producers have already begun negotiations with Sir Ian McKellen to play Neville Chamberlain. Peace For Our Time is expected to be nominated in multiple Academy Award categories for whatever year it is eventually released in. It is, after all, a British historical biopic.#5 TRUE GRIT STAR HAILEE STEINFELD JOINS THE FAIRY TALE CRAZE WITH SLEEPING BEAUTYThe success of Alice in Wonderland last year started a gold rush of sorts that has resulted in over a dozen movies nearing production based on similar stories, most of which are public domain fairy tales like Snow White and Hansel and Gretel. One of Disney’s top priorities in this category is Maleficent, which will turn the focus on the studio’s 1959 animated classic’s evil villainess, with Tim Burton possibly directing, and Angelina Jolie sought to star. Disney now has competition, however, as a new Sleeping Beauty spec package is going to auction at the studios this week. This new adaptation of the 1697 French fairy tale by Charles Perrault is also revisionist (written by newcomer Lindsay Devlin), and True Grit star Hailee Steinfeld is already attached to star as Princess Aurora. The biggest difference in this version will be a focus on Aurora herself, as she finds herself trapped in a dream world from which she must try to escape. Although the Sleeping Beauty package has not been sold yet, the studio that is probably the most likely to pick it up is Paramount Pictures. Paramount distributed True Grit, and has already cast Steinfeld in the teen suspense thriller Forgotten, as the studio sees the young actress as a rising star they want to continue doing business with.#6 PEOPLE CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH ANIMATED PENGUINSThe last six years have been a very good time for penguins at the movies, even though most of them weren’t even real. In 2005, the documentary March of the Penguins was a surprise box office hit, and that year also saw the release of DreamWorks Animation’s Madagascar, in which a group of zoo penguins were supporting characters. DreamWorks also released the 12 minute short The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper later that year both in theaters and on DVD. Warner Bros released Happy Feet in 2006 (and Happy Feet 2 comes out 11/18/11), and 2007 saw the release of both Surf’s Up and the direct-to-video Face of the Penguins. The Madagascar penguins were featured even more prominently in 2008’s Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, and they will also return in Madagascar 3 in June, 2012. The DreamWorks’ characters are also a hit on TV, with the Nickelodeon series The Penguins of Madagascar now in its second season. All of that set up leads us to the unsurprising news that DreamWorks Animation has started development on a Penguins of Madagascar feature film about the paramilitary penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private and Rico. There’s no director or release date set yet for this Madagascar spin-off. Screenwriters Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons, who previously worked together on DreamWorks’ Megamind, have been hired to start working on the Penguins of Madagascar feature length script.Rotten Ideas of the Week#3 THE HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS GET THEIR OWN MOVIE, BUT THE WASHINGTON GENERALS DO NOTThe Harlem Globetrotters exhibition and comedic basketball team were a pop culture phenomenon in the 1970s, including two Saturday morning cartoons, a variety TV show and various guest appearances. Now, the team’s managers are talking to Warner Bros about how to revive the team’s popularity, inspired partly by the reception given to team members Flight Time and Big Easy on two recent seasons of The Amazing Race. The Globetrotters actually met with most of the Hollywood studios, but the reason that Warner Bros was quickest to jump at the opportunity is that three franchises most associated with The Harlem Globetrotters are all Warner Bros properties, and all three are in a position to be revived. The first movie will be a CGI/live action remake of Scooby-Doo Meets The Harlem Globetrotters, which will reboot the Scooby-Doo movie franchise, including new actors to play Shaggy, Velma, Fred and Daphne. That film is expected to be the first of a trilogy which (if successful) will be followed by adaptations of The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan’s Island and Scooby-Doo Meets Batman, featuring a version of the Caped Crusader that pays homage to the 1960s Adam West TV series.#2 LITTLE MISS MUFFET GETS THE RED RIDING HOOD TREATMENTAs Hollywood continues its love affair with adapting fairy tales (which are also public domain) into live action movies, the latest target for adaptation is one of the most famous: Little Miss Muffet. Summit Entertainment has begun talks about how best to adapt the 28-word rhyme into a feature film that can appeal to the young audience that are fans of their Twilight Saga movies. The movie is expected to start by exploring the lingering questions that Little Miss Muffet leaves us with. Where did Miss Muffet get her curds and whey? Why was she so frightened of spiders? What the %*#@ is a tuffet anyway? The actual encounter with the spider will come midway in the movie, as we are introduced to teen Prince Arachnos, who was cursed with having to live half of his life in spider form. After initially being revulsed by his condition, Miss Muffett eventually falls in love with the spider, but their new romance comes with a price, as her father threatens to deprive Miss Muffet from ever eating curds and whey again, leaving her with a very difficult choice. Summit is hoping to cast Andrew Garfield (The Social Network) as Prince Arachnos, but the casting of Miss Muffet is still ongoing.#1 38-YEAR-OLD JENNIFER GARNER MAKING ELDERLY DETECTIVE MISS MARPLE YOUNG AND HIP?This week obviously ended with April 1st, and we all know what that means. So, when this story hit the news cycle, it seemed like someone had jumped the gun. But nope, this story is 100% real. Walt Disney Pictures has acquired the rights to the elderly detective character Miss Marple, who appeared in twelve novels by Agatha Christie from 1930 to 1976, and was one of Christie’s most famous characters. Disney’s plan is to both modernize Miss Marple (moving the setting to the modern day), and make her much younger. Jennifer Garner, who is currently 38 years old, will play the much young Miss Marple, and Garner is also producing. As Agatha Christie wrote her, Miss Marple was an elderly spinster living in a tiny English village. Several Miss Marple novels have previously been adapted to film, including 1980’s The Mirror Crack’d, in which she was played by Angela Lansbury, who went on a few years later to star in Murder, She Wrote, playing the very similar (but Americanized) character of Jessica Fletcher. As if this story isn’t already strange enough, the writer that Disney has hired to reinvision Miss Marple is Mark Frost, who is most famous for being David Lynch’s cocreator of the bizarre early 1990s ABC TV show Twin Peaks. Mark Frost also cowrote Fantastic Four and its sequel. There’s no word yet which specific Agatha Christie novel will be adapted (or if a specific one will be adapted at all). This is usually the part where I would explain why a movie is the week’s Most Rotten Idea, but I think pretty much this entire story does that job for me quite nicely.P.S.One more thing about Harry Potter, Miracleman, Peace for Our Time, The Harlem Globetrotters, and Little Miss Muffet… April Fool’s!For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"quibi, travel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-A-Live-Action-Justice-League-Movie-in-2013"},{"id":"47509223238362","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mountains of Madness for Tom Cruise?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mountains of Madness for Tom Cruise?Plus new projects for George Clooney and Ryan Reynoldsby Greg Dean Schmitz | September 3, 2010 |  CommentsAs Hollywood types take off this last week of the summer season and possibly prepare for festival trips to Venice, Telluride and Toronto, movie news was particularly slow and sparse. The stories that did emerge include casting rumors for Guillermo del Toro’s next movie and the Fantastic Four reboot, a new World War II epic to be filmed in 3D (of course!), and new roles for Bradley Cooper, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pine and Ryan Reynolds. There’s also quite a bit of sequel news for titles like Clash of the Titans 2, Skyline 2 (already!), Unbreakable 2 (though not what you might think) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYWILL TOM CRUISE POPULARIZE “LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR” OR IS SOMEONE ELSE WANTED?The phrase “Lovecraftian horror” is used to describe movies with bizarre and creepy monsters, usually with a sense of doom and dread so intense that it causes psychological damage to those involved. Or when done poorly, they’re really just monster movies. The irony is that although there have been tons of horror movies/games/etc that build upon the formula created by early 20th century pulp writer H.P. Lovecraft, there has never been a major studio movie directly based upon one of his actual stories. Earlier this summer, we learned that Guillermo del Toro is using all this extra time that he won’t be using to direct The Hobbit movies to correct that with an adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness. Lovecraft’s novella described a scientific expedition into the mountains of Antartica. The explorers discover a lost city that was apparently built by terrifying ancient creatures (Elder Things and Shoggoths) that may not necessarily be quite extinct yet. James Cameron is also producing At the Mountains of Madness for Universal, and filming in 3D is expected to start in May, 2011. And so that leads us finally to this week’s news, which is the question of who will be starring, and who wants whom. Universal Pictures reportedly wants James McAvoy, who starred in one of the studio’s biggest hits in recent years, Wanted. Guillermo del Toro, on the other hand, is said to be more excited about working with the star with whom he briefly was considering rebooting the Van Helsing franchise: Tom Cruise. This writer has admittedly knocked Tom Cruise around in print a bit in previous columns, but I think Tom Cruise as the star to help bring the Lovecraft/Cthulhu mythos to the mainstream is particularly intriguing. Cruise may have had box office bumps in recent years (most recently Knight and Day), but he remains a much bigger name with most people than James McAvoy. Just imagine Tom Cruise going on a day time talk show and hopping around with excitement as he’s trying to explain what a Shoggoth is. Universal, please make that happen.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 REQUIEM FOR A MUTANT?Two weeks ago, news broke that 20th Century Fox’s search for the director of X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2 had narrowed down to either Robert Schwentke (next month’s Red) or David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, 30 Days of Night). Schwentke was considered the likely choice at the time, but now he has apparently dropped out, as another director has joined Slade in the running. And that director is surely a surprise, as Hugh Jackman (in his duty as producer) recently talked to Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) about directing the Wolverine sequel, which will depict Logan’s romantic ninja-fighting adventures in Japan. Aronofsky’s produced movies might make him seem like an odd choice for a Wolverine sequel, but a look at the movies he’s been formerly attached to (Batman: Year One and the Robocop reboot) show that Aronofsky has long wanted to do his own version of a superhero movie. Considering how disappointing X-Men Origins: Wolverine was, the involvement of someone like Darren Aronofsky might be the best way for the character’s new franchise to redeem itself. If Aronofsky does sign, however, the next question would be whether 20th Century Fox would allow the director to make the movie his way, or whether they would interfere, demand changes and generally leave us in the end with a messed up pile of cinematic trash. The last time Aronofsky worked with a studio (The Fountain), that’s sort of exactly what happened. In the meantime, Darren Aronofsky’s next film Black Swan premiered at Venice this week, and the critics are sort of going crazy over it with praise. So, that’s also good news, at least.#2 THE 3D TREND FLIES INTO THE BATTLE OF MIDWAYThe HBO miniseries The Pacific was nominated for an amazing 23 Emmy Awards, and won eight awards, including Outstanding Miniseries on Sunday night. The day before, the news broke that Warner Bros (corporate cousin to HBO) had picked up a pitch from The Pacific co-executive producer Bruce C. McKenna for a $200 million 3D action epic about The Battle of Midway. From June 4 to June 7, 1942, the United States Navy achieved a massive victory against the Japan, defending an attack against the Midway Atoll, a mere six months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Japan lost four aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser in the Battle of Midway, which seriously weakened the Imperial Navy’s strength in the Pacific. The battle was previously brought to the big screen in 1976 as Midway, which had an all-star cast including Charlton Heston, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Toshiro Mifune and Pat Morita. John Ford also directed a 1942 documentary called The Battle of Midway, which was quickly compiled by Ford and released to help muster morale at home for the war efforts in the Pacific. Warner Bros is fast tracking The Battle of Midway, and screenwriter Robert Schenkkan (cowriter of The Quiet American), who also cowrote four episodes of The Pacific, is expected to turn in the first draft within eight weeks. Akiva Goldsman (Jonah Hex, The Losers, I Am Legend) is producing The Battle of Midway for Warner Bros.#3 DEADPOOL AND FACEMAN TEAMING UP FOR A BUDDY COP MOVIETwo of the most wanted and busiest actors in Hollywood are Ryan Reynolds and Bradley Cooper, and now they are attached to costar together in an untitled buddy cop action movie. The project got its start five years under the title of Blowback as a potential starring vehicle for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The story follows two friends who are San Francisco cops whose fathers were also partners in the department, and who are forced out of retirement to help their sons crack a particularly tough case. There’s no word yet as to who will play their dads. The action comedy is said to have “an updated Lethal Weapon flavor that plays into edgier R-rated territory.” The new post-Dwayne-Johnson script was written by screenwriter Sheldon Turner, whose three produced movies couldn’t be much different from each other: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, the remake of The Longest Yard and (with Jason Reitman) Up in the Air. There’s no director for this project yet. There’s also no distributor yet, but it is being co-produced by Benderspink (A History of Violence, The Ruins) and Original Film (I Am Legend, the Fast and the Furious franchise), which has a first look deal at Columbia Pictures. In other Bradley Cooper news, the actor was also replaced this week in the next movie (The Grey) to be directed by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Smokin’ Aces) by his much older A-Team costar, Liam Neeson. The Grey is a survival drama about a leader (Liam Neeson) of an oil drilling team whose plane crashes in Alaska, forcing them to fight for their lives against a pack of vicious wolves.#4 GEORGE CLOONEY CASTS UP HIS NEXT MOVIE AS DIRECTORIn addition to being a charming actor and a human rights activist, George Clooney also has a side career as a director (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Good Night and Good Luck, Leatherheads). Clooney’s fourth movie as director will be Farragut North, an adaptation of an off-Broadway play about a fictional presidential campaign during the period leading up to the Iowa Democratic caucuses. The central character of Farragut North is a 20-something campaign worker who at one time Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to play. The word now is that Clooney plans to offer the role to Chris Pine (Star Trek). Brad Pitt had once wanted to play that character’s boss, but Philip Seymour Hoffman is now up for the role instead. Paul Giamatti has also been cast as their opponent’s campaign manager. Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei are also reportedly being offered roles (Wood as a teen staffer who has an affair with Pine’s character). George Clooney is planning on starting filming Farragut North in February, 2011.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#5 TWO MONTHS BEFORE SKYLINE, SKYLINE 2 ALREADY ON THE HORIZON?Universal Pictures isn’t releasing their alien invasion movie Skyline until November 12, but the producers are already trying to sell the world on a sequel. IM Global, an international distribution company, is seeking to sell Skyline 2 to foreign film distributors next week at the Toronto International Film Festival’s film market. This news comes only three weeks after the trailer first debuted in theaters (with Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World), revealing the premise of alien vessels appearing over Los Angeles, sucking people up into the sky in images that are very similar to the concept of The Rapture. There’s no word yet as to who is writing or would direct Skyline 2, or what the sequel might be about (though it’s probably a good bet that it would possibly involve people being sucked up by alien ships?). The first Skyline was directed by the Brothers Strause (Colin and Greg) (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem) from a script by newcomer screenwriters Liam O’Donnell and Joshua Cordes, who also has had a prolific recent career as an animation and visual effects supervisor on movies like Avatar, Iron Man 2, the two Fantastic Four movies and The Day After Tomorrow. When considering whether Skyline 2 is a “fresh” or “rotten” idea, one has to see the irony that the first trailer was attached to Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, a movie that unfortunately failed at the box office after over a year of high anticipation. Skyline might be a great science fiction movie (or not), and may or may not do well at the box office, and so it seems a bit premature to already be talking about Skyline 2. Skyline 2 is this week’s borderline Rotten Idea only for that reason.#4 CLASH OF THE TITANS SEQUEL MOVES CLOSER TO BATTLEDespite receiving mostly negative reviews, this year’s remake of Clash of the Titans was a huge international hit ($491 million) for Warner Bros, and so the studio is moving ahead with plans for a sequel. One improvement Warner Bros hopes to make with Clash of the Titans 2 is to film the movie in 3D rather than using the postproduction conversion which was a big part (though not the entirety) of why the movie was criticized. The director that Warner Bros has signed for the sequel is Jonathan Liebesman (Darkness Falls, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning), whose next film will be 2011’s Battle: Los Angeles. Sam Worthington and Gemma Atherton are among the actors from the first movie who are expected to return for Clash of the Titans 2. For the sequel, Warner Bros has hired three different screenwriters that the studio considers to be among their current top talent. Dan Mazeau (a new writer whose development credits include The Flash and Jonny Quest) and David Leslie Johnson (Orphan and 2011’s Red Riding Hood) will write the script, and Greg Berlanti (cowriter of Green Lantern) collaborated with the other two writers on the treatment. This story is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas both because of Liebesman’s lackluster resume (especially for a big budget mythological epic) and because the Clash of the Titans sequel seems to be getting a greenlight only because the first movie made a lot of money, and not because, you know… anyone actually loved it.#3 WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNBREAKABLE 2 IS NOW NIGHT CHRONICLES 3 INSTEADWhatever most movie fans might think of the majority of M. Night Shyamalan’s films, the movie that is probably most often singled out as being his most narratively successful is Unbreakable. That film of course starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in a reinvention of the superhero genre, years before that same thing was done (arguably not as well) repeatedly in shows/movies like Heroes, Hancock and Kick-Ass. At the time, M. Night said that he envisioned Unbreakable as the first part of a trilogy following Willis’ character, and for the last nine years, fans have been wondering when we might see Unbreakable 2. In the meantime, M. Night Shyamalan has made movies like Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender, and started producing The Night Chronicles in which he gives story ideas to new directors for them to make instead (this month’s The Night Chronicles: Devil being the first). Now, M. Night has revealed that he has actually taken the villain and idea for what would have been Unbreakable 2 and rewritten it to instead be the third Night Chronicles movie. The second Night Chronicles movie will be called Twelve Strangers and will be about a jury dealing with a case involving the supernatural. M. Night went on to say that originally this villain was supposed to be in Unbreakable, but he removed the character to avoid having too many villains in one movie (that old Batman/X-Men problem). This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it means Unbreakable 2, which might still have a chance of being a great movie, is now even further from happening. M. Night himself now says that he has to now come up with a different idea for the sequel. Although it’s possible the third Night Chronicles movie might turn out to be good, I’m not sure many fans will be as excited about it as they would have been about finally seeing a real sequel to Unbreakable.#2 DWAYNE JOHNSON IS NOT QUITE DONE WITH KIDS MOVIES YETThe news that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson was returning to action movies with Faster and Fast Five (the fifth movie in the Fast and the Furious franchise) was well received by movie fans who yearn to see Johnson stop making so many silly kids movies (Tooth Fairy being the latest one). This week, Dwayne Johnson signed on with New Line Cinema to star in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, effectively replacing Brendan Fraser (although as a different character). Like Journey to the Center of the Earth, this sequel is adapting and modernizing another novel by Jules Verne, The Mysterious Island, which is often cited as a primary influence on the hit TV show LOST. Mysterious Island has been adapted a few times before, most notably as a 1961 movie. In Journey 2, Josh Hutcherson’s character from the first movie will be the star, as he goes to a “mythical and monstrous island” searching for his lost grandfather, and taking his mom’s boyfriend (Johnson) along on the ride. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island will be directed by Brad Peyton (Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore) from a script by Richard Outten (Pet Sematary II) and brothers Brian and Mark Gunn (cowriters of the direct-to-video Bring It On Again). Filming of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is scheduled to start in late October at locations in North Carolina and Hawaii (perhaps not coincidentally also where LOST was filmed). This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it feels like a step backwards for Dwayne Johnson, but also because all of the creative people involved are best known for inferior sequels (Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore, seriously?).#1 MORE THAN FOUR RUMORS ABOUT A MOVIE THAT PROBABLY WON’T BE FANTASTICWhen this writer got started in the online movie news business in 1997 with Upcomingmovies.com, there were only a handful of sites out there, but today, there are dozens, and they’re all scrapping for their piece of buzz that will drive traffic to their URL. One such site is called ComicBookMovie.com, and recently that site has been publishing a constant barrage (ten in the last 16 days) about 20th Century Fox’s planned reboot of Fantastic Four. None of them have been confirmed by another news source yet, and at least one of them (the casting of Stephen Moyer as Doctor Doom) has been debunked. What is most likely happening here is that ComicBookMovie.com does indeed have some sort of inside source, although whether that source is reliable or not might be questionable. Within the studio system, there is often talk about dream casting, and an individual employee might know what names are being thrown around, but that doesn’t always translate into actual signed contracts and the actor eventually starring in the movie. Anyway, here’s the names that are being thrown out there: Adrien Brody or Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Reed Richards, Alice Eve or Amber Heard as Sue Storm, Kevin Pennington (90210) as Johnny Storm and Bruce Willis or Kiefer Sutherland as the voice of the CGI version of The Thing. CBM is also reporting that the directors possibly being considered for the Fantastic Four reboot are Joe Carnahan (The A-Team, Smokin’ Aces), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) and David Yates (the last four Harry Potter movies). The problem with all three is that they are all known to be either currently busy or soon to be busy with other projects (The Grey, The Raven and postproduction on the last two Harry Potter movies, respectively). This is the week’s most Rotten Idea for two reasons. First, this is yet another case of a big-budget sequel receiving a large number of stories that are basically rumors for the moment (quite common with the Batman franchise, for example). Secondly, there is the very concept of 20th Century Fox making another Fantastic Four movie. As long as the studio continues using these characters every few years, that only delays the possibility of Marvel Studios sometimes regaining the movie rights to characters that arguably deserve to be integrated in with the rest of the Marvel movie universe. That sentiment also of course applies to the Daredevil and X-Men rights at Fox and Spider-Man and Ghost Rider at Sony/Columbia.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"thriller, Teen, kaiju, drama, of, Ice, asian-american, romance, Islander, Comedy, Baby, universe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mountains-of-Madness-for-Tom-Cruise"},{"id":"47509223229142","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mickey Mouse to meet Jack Sparrow?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Mickey Mouse to meet Jack Sparrow?Plus, Christopher Nolan confirms that he'll direct the next Batman.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 1, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features news about two very different biopics, casting news for Sherlock Holmes 2, and the usual assortment of remakes, video game adaptations (though just one this week) and movies that continue ongoing trends like alien invasions and fairy tale reimaginings.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYMAGIC KINGDOM: MICKEY MOUSE, JACK SPARROW &amp; SNOW WHITE, TOGETHER AT LAST?In 2002, Disney teamed up with Square Enix (the videogame company behind the popular Final Fantasy franchise) for Kingdom Hearts, the first in a new franchise of role-playing games that teamed up classic Disney characters with Final Fantasy characters. Now, the studio has announced plans for Magic Kingdom, a movie project that would do something similar for Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, the various “Princess” characters and other favorites from their many movies and theme park attractions. And the somewhat bizarro theme that they would unite them is the idea of Magic Kingdom being like the Disney version of Marvel’s The Avengers or DC’s Justice League of America. It should definitely be mentioned that Marvel Studios is now under the corporate aegis of Disney, so it’s easy to see a corporate synchronicity there as well. The original Magic Kingdom script was written by Ronald D. Moore, creator of the TV shows Battlestar Galactica and Caprica (Moore also cowrote Star Trek: Generations and Star Trek: First Contact), and took place at Disneyland. Disney reportedly considers Magic Kingdom a “low priority” (meaning it’s probably a few years from happening), but the studio is currently looking for a new writer to build upon Moore’s original script. Other upcoming Disney movies that may tie into Magic Kingdom (or not) include Cinderella, Guillermo del Toro’s The Haunted Mansion, Jungle Cruise and Tomorrowland movies, Maleficent, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Snow White and the Seven.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 NOT A SURPRISE: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN TO DIRECT THE NEXT BATMAN MOVIEAlthough the news has shown up everywhere, it shouldn’t really be a surprise to anyone that Christopher Nolan is going to direct the next Batman movie. Speaking to Empire this week, he finally confirmed that it would be his next project, and that there is actually a script now (from Nolan’s brother Jonathan). Although the villain (or villains) in Batman 3 are not yet known, actor Edward Norton spoke out this week about his desire to work with Nolan on the project. Norton was asked about whether he would want to play a villain, or specifically the Riddler, and he was positive about either possibility. Edward Norton made news over his parting of ways from Marvel Studios over his starring role in The Incredible Hulk and the subsequent decision to recast Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner in The Avengers. Edward Norton’s enthusiasm for working with Christopher Nolan is also interesting, considering that the two were once competing for theater space when the two magician movies The Illusionist (starring Norton) and The Prestige (directed by Nolan) came out quite close to each other. In other DC her news, two more names emerged as potential directors for the Superman reboot. First, there is Ben Affleck, who has apparently already met with producers about the job and turned it down. Still in the running (in addition to other directors mentioned last week) is Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream). Aronofsky is an especially interesting candidate, as there was a point much earlier in his career where Aronofsky was actually adapting a Batman “reboot” project for Warner Bros, based upon Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One. That project was eventually shelved, and was eventually replaced by Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins. Now, it appears Aronofsky is back in the running to possibly reboot DC Comics’ other most popular superhero.#2 SAM RAIMI JOINING THE ALIEN INVASION FAD WITH EARTH DEFENSE FORCE?One of the hot new trends coming to theaters in the next few years is the “alien invasion” movie, which includes next month’s Skyline, as well as Battle: Los Angeles and the Battleship movie. Now, Sam Raimi, in his role as producer (not director), is in talks with Warner Bros for an alien invasion movie of his own, tentatively titled EDF, which stands for Earth Defense Force. The script has already been leaked, and the premise starts off with U.S. and Chinese fighter pilots engaged in a dogfight, who are then attacked by three alien ships that then go on to destroy various global landmarks and military installations. NASA soon discovers signs of a much larger invasion force coming from another galaxy in ten months, forcing the goverments of the world to band together to fend off the incoming invasion. The script by Andrew Marlowe (End of Days, Air Force One) is said to combine elements of Top Gun, Independence Day and The Last Starfighter. The next step for EDF will be for Sam Raimi to find a director who can tackle what is potentially a big-budget “event” movie.#3 CAPTAIN SULLY’S HIGHEST DUTY INSPIRES A BIOPICWhen Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger landed his passenger jet in the Hudson River in January, 2009, saving the lives of all 155 people on board, he was instantly hailed as a true American hero (and rightly so). Sullenberger has since penned his memoirs, entitled Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters, which was released earlier this year in May. Flashlight Films and the Kennedy/Marshall Company have now secured the rights to Highest Duty. The producers are eyeing Highest Duty as either a feature film or a TV movie. Sullenberger was hesitant about selling his life story rights was encouraged by fellow pilot Harrison Ford, who suggested “Sully” talk to producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. Their company’s credits include Munich, Seabiscuit and the Bourne movies, and their upcoming releases include Clint Eastwood’s Hereafter and Steven Spielberg’s War Horse. There’s no word yet as to any other creative people involved with Highest Duty, including a screenwriter, director or potential star (though one has to wonder if perhaps Harrison Ford might be in the running for the role).#4 THE MANKIND BIOPIC IS REALLY JUST ABOUT ONE WRASSLERMick Foley is one of the most successful professional wrestlers of the last 20 years, best known as “Mankind” (among other names he’s used) and for performing for several wrestling promotion companies, including the WWE, WCW, NWA, ECW and currently Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Foley has also written several books, including novels, children’s books and four memoirs. Now, Mick Foley is teaming up with producer Jeff Katz (Shoot ‘Em Up, Snakes on a Plane) for a biopic based upon his life story. The untitled biopic will be directed by extreme sports documentarian Christopher J. Scott (Snowblind) from a script Scott is cowriting with Mick Foley. There’s no word yet as to whether Mr. Socko will also make an appearance in the film.#5 BIG TIME HOLLYWOOD PRODUCERS SAY PLAY MYST FOR MELast summer, an independent production company called Mysteria Film Group announced that they had acquired the film rights to the 1996 science fiction novel Myst: The Book of Ti’ana, which was a prequel to the popular PC/Mac video game franchise Myst. Now, the Mysteria Film Group has found new film producers partners in the form of Hunt Lowry (Donnie Darko, The Last of the Mohicans) and Mark Johnson (Galaxy Quest and the Chronicles of Narnia franchise). Lowry and Johnson are also working together on the adaptation of the John Grisham novel The Testament. First introduced in 1993, the various Myst games are interactive puzzle games in which the player explores environments and unlocks the secrets of an extensive game mythology, which is expanded upon in the trilogy of prequel novels. Adapting Myst to the big screen is arguably a daunting challenge (especially since the game’s most popular days are now over 10 years in the past), but the involvement of two Hollywood heavy hitters like Hunt Lowry and Mark Johnson is a promising (and surprising) development for the project. The next step for the Myst adaptation is to find a suitable screenwriter.#6 SHERLOCK HOLMES SOLVES THE MYSTERY OF MORIARTY’S IDENTITYLast year, during the production of Sherlock Holmes, there were reports and rumors that Brad Pitt may have provided the voice of the detective’s great nemesis Professor Moriarty, which would then lead to Pitt costarring in Sherlock Holmes 2. There were also rumors that director Guy Ritchie was possibly trying to get Daniel Day-Lewis to sign on for the role. Now, the actor who will be playing Professor Moriarty has been revealed, and instead of a major film star, the role has instead gone to Jared Harris. Harris (who is also the son of the late actor Richard Harris) has had dozens of film and TV roles, which include appearances in Happiness, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and his supporting role as Lane Pryce in recent seasons of Mad Men. Additionally, this week Stephen Fry (Wilde, V for Vendetta) was also cast as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s older brother. Mycroft Holmes was depicted by Arthur Conan Doyle as a British government agent with superior detective skills to Sherlock, but lacking the ambition or interest in pursuing cases to the physically demanding extent that his younger brother does. Warner Bros has scheduled Sherlock Holmes 2 for a release date of December 16, 2011.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#3 ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER REVISIONIST FAIRY TALE MOVIE: SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMANSince the blockbuster release of Disney’s Alice in Wonderland earlier this year, 2010 has seen a new wave of plans for movies based on various fairy tales and classic children’s stories. The list is really too long to thumbnail at this point, but perusing the archives of The Weekly Ketchup will surely bring at least one up nearly every week. The latest such project is called Snow White and the Huntsman, and this live-action retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale will, as the title suggests, feature an enhanced role for the Huntsman. Not to be confused with a romantic role (which will still be Prince Charming, although not necessarily called that), the Huntsman will start the film as being ordered to kill Snow White in the woods, but he instead will end up chained to Snow White, on the run, and teaching her how to survive. There’s no word yet what role the seven dwarves will play in this version. Video game commercial director Rupert Sanders (Halo, X-Men Origins: Wolverine) will make his feature film debut, working from a script from Evan Daugherty, also a newcomer to feature films. Snow White and the Huntsman first made the news this week as the object of a studio bidding war, but Universal Pictures quickly emerged as the winner. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because, as mentioned above, it is just the latest of a wave of similar projects, and it’s not even the only revisionist take on Snow White in the works. Also, the “newbie” status of both the screenwriter and director makes their abilities to effectively reinvent a classic tale highly up in the air.#2 STAR WARS: SAME TIME, SAME GALAXY, BUT A NEW DIMENSIONGeorge Lucas has been talking for a while now about his plans to revisit the Star Wars movies with a conversion to 3D, but this week was when the announcement was made official. Releasing the six movies according to story chronology, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace will be the first 3D conversion, in theaters in 2012. The other five movies will follow at unspecified dates, with the frequency of the re-release of each film (once a year? every six months?, etc) not yet known. This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas, first of all because The Phantom Menace is considered by many fans to be a blemish to the reputation of the original franchise. There is also the very concept of 3D post-conversion, and the question of whether the technical problems (dim lighting, blurry objects or backgrounds) can be overcome by the benefit of 3D. Finally, there remains the spectre of potential changes that could be made by George Lucas and Lucasfilms as they revisit the original trilogy (yet again). Will Greedo shoot first at Han Solo twice the next time through?#1 TEEN REMAKE FEVER STRIKES ALFRED HITCHCOCKThe films of director Alfred Hitchcock have long been the subject of remakes. Notable examples include the 1998 films A Perfect Murder and Gus Vant’s Psycho remake, as well as 2007’s Disturbia, which was a remake of Rear Window. There have also long been plans to remake The Birds, and many other remake plans that were eventually abandoned. The latest project bears the particularly atrocious title of Teens on a Train, and it is (of course) a remake of 1951’s Strangers on a Train, which was itself an adaptation of the novel by Patricia Highsmith. The teen thriller will be produced by BBC Films and independent British company Slingshot Productions (Tormented, Sugarhouse). Like the source material, Teens on a Train will be about strangers that meet on a train and agree to murder someone for each other. Where this version will depart from the source material (besides the obvious ways) is that one of the two people will be a girl who is also a “raving psychopath.” Teens on a Train was written by Joshua St. Johnson (creator of the UK TV series Material Girl). Filming of Teens on a Train is expected to start in the UK in 2011. The reason for Teens on a Train being the most Rotten Idea of the week should be fairly evident in just the title alone. If there is any good news here, it is that as a British production, there is the possbility that it will never actually be released in the USA.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Paramount, canceled, series, thriller, books, 93rd, Emmy, Esquire, Schmidt, Spectrum, Sundance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mickey-Mouse-to-meet-Jack-Sparrow"},{"id":"47509223220947","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Martin Freeman Cast as The Hobbit","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Martin Freeman Cast as The HobbitPlus, Mel Gibson is in and out of The Hangover 2by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 22, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup is full of news about prequels, sequels and remakes. The prequels in the news this week are The Hobbit and X-Men Origins: Wolverine 2, and there’s also news for The Hangover 2 and Iron Man 3. Hollywood’s remake fever continues this week with revisits to The Day of the Triffids, The Forbin Project, The Thin Man and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYMARTIN FREEMAN AND MANY OTHERS ARE CAST IN THE HOBBITFollowing weeks of rumors, Martin Freeman, the star of The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and costar of the original, UK version of The Office, has been confirmed as being cast as Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson’s two movies based upon J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Martin Freeman is not the only actor to be announced this week, however, as most of the Company of Dwarves has also been cast. British TV actor Richard Armitage (who also has a role as a Nazi in Captain America: The First Avenger) will play Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the company. The selection of Armitage echoes the theme of the other actors playing dwarves; all are relatively obscure actors best known for working in British TV or film. They are: Aidan Turner (Kili), Rob Kazinsky (Fili), Graham McTavish (Dwalin), John Callen (Oin), Stephen Hunter (Bombur), Mark Hadlow (Dori) and Peter Hambleton (Gloin). The dwarf actors join the previously cast Sir Ian McKellen and Andy Serkis, who are reprising their Lord of the Rings roles as Gandalf the Grey and Gollum. Still yet to be cast are a number of human and elf roles, including Elrond (presuming Hugo Weaving is not returning), Beorn and Bard the Bowman. Among the actors who are reportedly in talks about unspecified roles are David Tennant (Doctor Who), Stephen Fry, and Saorise Ronan. Finally, there is Smaug the Dragon, for whom Bill Nighy is reportedly in discussions to provide the voice work. Filming is scheduled to begin on the two Hobbit movies in February, 2010, either in the UK or New Zealand (pending further announcement).FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 SEQUEL TO A ROTTEN MOVIE GETS A FRESH DIRECTOR: WOLVERINE 2The last few weeks have been full of stories about both who will direct the sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and what will be the next movie for director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) following this December’s Black Swan. More recently, those two stories started to come together, with word that Aronofsky was the seemingly unlikely frontrunner for the Wolverine 2 job. This week, Wolverine star Hugh Jackman confirmed that Darren Aronofsky has indeed signed on with 20th Century Fox. Jackman was effusive in his praise for Aronofsky, though he admitted, “well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different.” Jackman continued, “this is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He’s kind of dark… but you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that’ll give you a good clue. [Aronofsky’s] going to make it fantastic. There’s going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure.” Darren Aronofsky has long wanted to make his version of a superhero movie, going back several years before Christopher Nolan came aboard the Batman movie, when Aronofsky was developing an adaptation of Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One at Warner Bros. Another quasi-superhero project that Aronofsky was once developing (which has since been abandoned) was a reboot of Robocop at the now-struggling MGM.#2 DISNEY MAKES ANOTHER MARVEL DEAL AND SCHEDULES IRON MAN 3 FOR 2013When Walt Disney Studios acquired Marvel Studios several months ago, a lingering question was what exactly would become of the already announced movies Marvel had planned with Paramount Pictures. Marvel and Paramount had established a good relationship with the first two Iron Man movies, and it was to continue with Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers. This week, Disney paid Paramount $115 million for the transfer of the distribution rights to The Avengers and the planned Iron Man 3, with Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger remaining Paramount releases. Additionally, this announcement also included a May 3, 2013 release date for Iron Man 3, which may make it the first major Marvel Studios movie to be released after The Avengers on May 4, 2012. Other Marvel Studios projects currently in development include Runaways, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Black Panther and Luke Cage.#3 SPIELBERG’S NEXT MOVIE AFTER WAR HORSE WILL BE… ROBOPACLYPSESteven Spielberg is currently filming the World War I drama War Horse, but the acclaimed director has already chosen his next project, which will see him returning to the science fiction genre. Robopocalypse is an upcoming novel (June, 2011) by Daniel H. Wilson about the human race struggling against a robot uprising, which brings to mind movies like I, Robot and the Terminator franchise. Even as it was still being written, screenwriter Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), who also wrote several episodes of LOST, Alias, Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, worked in conjunction with Wilson, receiving novel pages and adapting them into the screenplay. Robopocalypse will be distributed by Disney’s Touchstone Pictures, and Spielberg expects to start filming in January, 2012 for a release in 2013. Although Robopocalypse will be Spielberg’s next film, the reason for the long delay in filming is that he’ll be busy with postproduction on War Horse, and he’ll also have the CGI animated movie Tin Tin: The Secret of the Unicorn in postproduction. Both War Horse and Tin Tin: The Secret of the Unicorn will be released in December, 2011, just five days from each other.#4 WILL JOHNNY DEPP LOSE WEIGHT TO PLAY THE THIN MAN?Although there’s no script yet for the project, Johnny Depp reportedly wants to star in a Warner Bros remake of the 1934 film The Thin Man. Depp’s idea includes recruiting director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha), who is currently directing Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The Thin Man was originally based upon a 1934 detective novel by Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon), and went on to inspire five more sequels, all of which also starred William Powell and Myrna Loy. There was also a Thin Man TV series on NBC from 1957 to 1959. The Thin Man tells the story of retired private investigator Nick Charles and his wife Nora who return to detective duty after the disappearance of a friend (who is actually the “Thin Man,” not Nick Charles). Since there’s no script for the Thin Man remake yet, the project is probably at least a few years away from happening. In the meantime, Rob Marshall is expected to start talking to Universal soon about possibly directing their planned movie adaptation of the hit musical Wicked.#5 SAM RAIMI EYES THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS REMAKEA few weeks ago, the news of a planned remake of The Day of the Triffids hit the Internet to a tepid reaction from fans. This week, the rights to that remake went up for auction, and they were won by Mandate Pictures, representing Sam Raimi’s Ghost House production company. Mandate reportedly paid more for The Day of the Triffids than for any other project they’ve ever purchased. The reason for the high bid is that Sam Raimi (Spider-Man, The Evil Dead franchise) hopes to direct this remake, as the original movie was one of his favorite films growing up. The Day of the Triffids was a British 1951 science fiction novel by John Wyndham about a bio-engineered species of intelligent plants that take over after a massive meteor shower blinds most of the humans on Earth. The Day of the Triffids was then adapted as a British movie in 1962, and also as two UK TV mini-series, in 1981 and then last year in 2009. When the remake was announced in September, there was talk about The Day of the Triffids being filmed in 3D, but there’s no word yet as to whether Sam Raimi also wants to film it in 3D.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 MEL GIBSON GAINS AND THEN LOSES A CAMEO ROLE IN THE HANGOVER 2Mel Gibson made the news twice this week, and both times, it was for the same movie, as his notoriety first helped and then hurt his career, once again. First, the news broke that Gibson was a “done deal” to have a cameo role in The Hangover 2 as a Bangkok tattoo artist. This cameo was to have been the sequel’s version of the cameo that Mike Tyson had in the first movie (as himself). However, this decision by director Todd Phillips did not apparently go over so well with his cast and crew. A few days later, Phillips had to announce that Mel Gibson would not be appearing in The Hangover 2 after all, saying, “I thought Mel would have been great in the movie and I had the full backing of [Warner Bros President] and his team. But I realize filmmaking is a collaborative effort, and this decision ultimately did not have the full support of my entire cast and crew.” As for who specifically in the cast might have objected, the word on the web is that it was Hangover star Zach Galifianakis who most loudly complained about Mel Gibson’s possible participation. This story is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because there’s no way it can possibly be seen as “fresh.” If Gibson had stayed in, that would have been a controversial choice, but announcing and then dropping him doesn’t look so good either. As Deadline writer Mike Fleming points out, this situation is in stark contrast to the cameo given in the first movie to Mike Tyson, who was convicted for rape, and served time in prison for the crime. In other words, Mel Gibson’s reputation for his repeated racist/sexist remarks and behavior now make him lower on Hollywood’s social ladder than a convicted rapist. This news also makes the future of The Beaver, the Jodie Foster-directed movie starring Mel Gibson as a man whose best friend is his beaver hand puppet, even more questionable.#3 M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN HITCHES HIS CAREER TO THE SMITH FAMILYA few months ago, director M. Night Shyamalan was reportedly working on a top secret project that would have starred Bruce Willis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Bradley Cooper. However, no studio apparently wanted to make that project, and so it has now been “quietly shelved.” That bit of bad news is not keeping Shyamalan from trying to find new work, however, and he has found a new friend in Will Smith. Smith’s Overbrook production company has come aboard a project called One Thousand A.E., which apparently has no connection to the animated science fiction film Titan A.E., although it is also a science fiction project. No story details have been revealed yet about One Thousand A.E., but the movie is being seen as a starring vehicle for Will’s son Jaden Smith. There is also an adult lead character, but Will Smith will not be taking that role. One factor that might be the difference between Shyamalan’s recently shelved project and One Thousand A.E. is that unlike that untitled project, One Thousand A.E. was not written by M. Night Shyamalan himself. Instead, One Thousand A.E. was written by screenwriter Gary Whitta, whose first produced film was this year’s The Book of Eli, starring Denzel Washington. One Thousand A.E. is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because of the decreasing reputation that M. Night Shyamalan now has after a string of critical flops to which his name was attached.#2 LET’S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN: A ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW REMAKE?This Tuesday, the FOX TV show Glee will be airing an episode called The Rocky Horror Glee Show, in which the high school characters put on a stage production of the original The Rocky Horror Show for Halloween. Before that episode even airs, Glee creator is already in talks with 20th Century Fox about possibly directing a remake of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Rocky Horror Show was a British 1973 play which was then adapted as the 1975 20th Century Fox film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The movie tells the story of two young lovers who find themselves stranded in the rain at a mansion populated by an assortment of strange characters, including aliens and a lingerie-clad mad scientist named Frank N. Furter. The long-running movie attracted a loyal following which included people who dressed up as the characters and acted out the movie as it ran. Audence members would also shout back sarcastic and double entendre lines based on what the characters in the movie were saying. The idea of a Rocky Horror Picture Show remake is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas for nearly the same reason that 20th Century Fox is considering remaking it. The studio looks at the $100 million that the original movie has made in its 35 year theatrical run, and wants to possibly double that potential revenue with an update. However, the fact that The Rocky Horror Picture Show can keep bringing in audiences is also the very reason it doesn’t need to, and shouldn’t be, remade.#1 MCG WANTS TO GIVE CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS THE 300 LOOKBritish industrialist Richard Branson and his Virgin brand name have tackled the music industry, record stores, airlines and soon are expanding into commercial space travel with Virgin Galactic Airways. Now, Richard Branson is also looking to get into the movie business with the news that he has acquired a script called Columbus about the famous discoverer’s voyage to and conquest of the Americas. McG (Charlie’s Angels, Terminator: Salvation) is attached to direct Columbus, which is described as doing for Christopher Columbus and his conquistadors what 300 did for the Spartans and the Battle of Thermopylae. The Columbus script was adapted by newcomer screenwriter T.S. Nowlin, who does not yet have any movies to his credit. Columbus is likely to be first major feature film based on Christopher Columbus since the early 1990s when Christopher Columbus: The Discovery and Ridley Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise both bombed at the box office, regardless of that year’s 500th anniversary status. Columbus is actually the second film project for Branson’s Virgin Produced company, following their currently untitled sketch comedy movie which has dozens of stars as its cast. Columbus is this week’s most Rotten Idea because McG and his bombastic visual style, especially if they’re setting out to be “300 style”, seems an odd choice for the tale of Christopher Columbus. Does the mentioning of 300 mean that the conquistadors will be filmed in slow motion action poses, for example?For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Book, toronto, TV, new, Acorn, Red, Us, Lifetime, guild, ITV, cancelled, Stephen, Masterpiece","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Martin-Freeman-Cast-as-The-Hobbit"},{"id":"47509224795883","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sam Jackson reveals Nick Fury plans","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sam Jackson reveals Nick Fury plansPlus, new roles for Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrellby Greg Dean Schmitz | May 14, 2010 |  CommentsThis week, the Cannes Film Festival got started, and as it does every year, that means that dozens of movies were either announced or had casting news. A few stars (including Brad Pitt, Colin Farrell, Jennifer Aniston) actually had multiple projects announced this week. There’s also news about movies based upon board games and video games, as usual, two biopics about Marilyn Monroe, and the surprising plans to send 19th Century adventurer Allan Quatermain… into the future.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 IRON MAN 2 FILMMAKERS TALK IRON MAN 3 AND A NICK FURY MOVIEThe movie season of the Summer of 2010 got its start last week with the opening of Iron Man 2, and as the stars did press for that movie, they dropped new information about related upcoming projects. First, there is Iron Man 3, which has been known to be pretty much a sure thing at some point after 2012’s The Avengers. Director Jon Favreau confirmed that in Iron Man 3, he hopes to finally bring the Mandarin, arguably Iron Man’s most iconic villain into the mix (after being hinted at in the first movie). What Favreau is currently struggling with is how to portray the Mandarin, who in the comics wears ten rings, each of which give him a different super power. Favreau calls them “magical,” but their Marvel Comics origin is actually from an alien spaceship. Samuel L. Jackson also revealed this weekthat there are plans, after The Avengers, for Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. to get their own movie. In addition to Jackson as Nick Fury, a S.H.I.E.L.D. movie might also feature Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson and Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow (and she’s also a strong contender to be a member of The Avengers as well). Jackson also said that War Machine (Don Cheadle) is “gonna show up a lot.” As for other movies based on Marvel characters (though not produced by Marvel Studios), there is X-Men: First Class. This week, we learned who the writers working on X-Men: First Class are. First, there is the writing team of Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz, who cowrote Agent Cody Banks, and have also written episodes of Fringe and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The details are unclear, but it appears that Miller and Stentz got the latest version of the script started, and they are now being joined in rewrites by Jane Goldman. Goldman’s involvement is unsurprising, as she cowrote (with director Matthew Vaughn) both Stardust and Kick-Ass. Vaughn might need Goldman’s help in getting the script done quickly, as Fox’s June 3, 2011 release date is only getting closer.#2 ADAM SANDLER WANTS TO TURN YOUR WORLD INTO A VIDEO GAMELast month, director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) tweeted about a video on YouTube called Pixels, and the video quickly became something of an Internet phenomenon. In the creative short film created by Patrick Jean, New York City is invaded and transformed by a variety of characters and images from the classic 1980s era of video games. Included in the invasion are Pac-Man, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Tetris, Space Invaders and the paddles from Breakout. And now, Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison is developing Pixels as a movie, with talks ongoing at Columbia, where Happy Madison has a first-look deal. There is no writer involved with Pixels yet, but the plan is to “make a Ghostbusters-style action comedy in which characters come out of a video game to wreak havoc in the real world.” This is a project that might have ordinarily ended up in the Rotten Ideas section, but Patrick Jean’s short film really is quite awesome, presuming Jean (if hired) can work the same sort of magic on a feature-length film.#3 COLIN FARRELL’S EYEBROWS TO LOOM ABOVE VAMPIRE FANGS IN FRIGHT NIGHTThis was a big week in casting news for Colin Farrell, with the Irish star announced for three different movies. First, there is the DreamWorks remake of 1985’s Fright Night, which is normally listed as a “Rotten Idea,” but Farrell’s involvement is a surprise, and possibly a sign that Fright Night might only suck blood. Farrell wil play vampire Jerry Dandridge who is investigated by his teenage neighbor, played by Anton Yelchin. Toni Collette is also costarring in an unspecified role (but I’m guessing she might play Yelchin’s mom). Fright Night will be directed by Craig Gillepsie (Lars and the Real Girl, Mr. Woodcock). Colin Farrell will also star (along with Marion Cotillard) in Cosmopolis, an adaptation of the novel by Don DeLillo. Cosmopolis tells the story of 24 hours in the life of a multi-millionaire as he loses all of his wealth during a long limousine ride across Manhattan. Cosmopolis will be directed by David Cronenberg (Eastern Promises, A History of Violence) on a budget of $20.5 million. Filming will start in March, 2011 in New York City and Toronto. Colin Farrell’s third new movie this week is Horrible Bosses, which you can read more about in the #7 spot.#4 THIS WEEK IN BRAD PITT NEWS: THE TIGER AND MONEYBALLFocus Features, Brad Pitt’s Plan B and Darren Aronofsky’s Protozoa Pictures are teaming up to adapt the upcoming non-fiction book The Tiger by John Vaillant. The Tiger tells the true story of the 1997 hunt for a man-eating tiger in Russia’s far east wilderness. The Tiger is being adapted by Guillermo Arriaga (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel), which may make it the first major film that Arriaga has written that will not be directed by his frequent collaborator, Alejandro González Iñárritu. Brad Pitt is expected to star in The Tiger, but it is unclear whether this would be a directing project for Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) or whether he will just be producing. Brad Pitt has also been confirmed as starring in Columbia Pictures’ Moneyball, based upon the baseball non-fiction bestselling book. Bennett Miller (Capote) is now attached to direct, following the departure of Steven Soderbergh last year just days away from the start of filming. Jonah Hill is also attached to star, and Robin Wright (no longer a Penn, by the way) and Philip Seymour Hoffman are in talks to to appear as well. Filming of Moneyball is now scheduled to start in Los Angeles in July, 2010.#5 MARILYN MONROE BIOPICS COMPETING FOR YOUR BLONDE BOMBSHELL-LOVING ATTENTIONHollywood has a long history of dueling projects, as competing producers race with each other to see who can get their project out first. This has even happened within the field of biopics, such as with Truman Capote (Capote vs Infamous), and the various continuing attempts to make movies based on the lives of Janis Joplin, Linda Lovelace and Jimi Hendrix. This week at Cannes, two different Marilyn Monroe biopics were announced, and both plan to start filming in the next several months. Naomi Watts will star in Blonde, an adaptation of the imaginary Monroe memoir by Joyce Carol Oates. Blonde will be directed by Andrew Dominik (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford). Filming of Blonde is scheudled to start in January, 2011 on a budget of $20 million. The Weinstein Company might get the jump on Blonde, however, as they plan on filming My Week With Marilyn in late September. Michelle Williams will play Marilyn in this story about the time Monroe spent in England filming The Prince and the Showgirl opposite Laurence Olivier. Scarlett Johansson had at one time been in talks to star before Williams signed on. My Summer with Marilyn will be the first feature film for British director Simon Curtis, who has worked mostly on TV projects like David Copperfield.#6 THE THREE MUSKETEERS 3D GETS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN THREE CAST MEMBERSNormally, a new movie directed by Paul W.S. Anderson would almost automatically get listed as a “Rotten Idea,” but The Three Musketeers 3D now has a pretty great cast. The title characters will be played by Ray Stevenson (Punisher: War Zone, Rome) as Porthos, Luke Evans (Apollo in Clash of the Titans) as Aramis and Matthew MacFadyen (the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood) as Athos. Luke Evans is also in talks this week to star with Jessica Biel in Vivaldi, a romantic biopic about the famed classical composer. Logan Lerman, who had been rumored to be a contender to star in the reboot of Spider-Man is instead in talks to play D’Artagnan, the “fourth” musketeer (which conflicts with the Spider-Man filming schedule). Also cast are Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds) as Cardinal Richelieu and Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale and Draco from Clash of the Titans) as Rochefort. An offer is also out to Orlando Bloom to play the film’s villain, the Duke of Buckingham. Finally, and to no surprise, there is Milla Jovovich, AKA Mrs. Paul W.S. Anderson and a frequent star of his movies, as Milady de Winter, a former lover of Athos, who is being described as a “17th century Bond girl.” Filming of Anderson’s project starts in August, which puts it in competition with another Three Musketeers project to be directed by Doug Liman (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) which also is aiming to start filming this fall. Also this week, soon after this casting announcement, Summit Entertainment picked up The Three Musketeers 3D, and the studio is aiming for a summer, 2011 release date.#7 THIS WEEK IN JENNIFER ANISTON NEWS: HORRIBLE BOSSES AND WANDERLUSTJennifer Aniston was announced in connection to two different comedies this week. First, there’s Horrible Bosses, a New Line Cinema comedy about a group of friends who agree each other’s mean employers. Jason Bateman and Charlie Day (It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia) will play two of the friends, and Jennifer Aniston signed and Colin Farrell in talks to play two of the bosses. With Fright Night and Cosmopolis, this is the third movie that Colin Farrell was connected to this week. Jamie Foxx also costars as a scam artist named “Motherf***er Jones” who gives murder advice to the three friends. Horrible Bosses will be directed by Seth Gordon (The King of Kong, Four Christmases) from a script cowritten by John Francis Daley, who as a teenager played Sam Weir in Freaks and Geeks. Jennifer Aniston’s second new comedy this week is Wanderlust, in which she and Paul Rudd play a couple who leaves the city to join a commune out in the country. Wanderlust is being produced by Judd Apatow, and will be directed by David Wain (Role Models, Wet Hot American Summer). Wain also cowrote Wanderlust along with fellow The State member Ken Marino.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#3 WILL TIM BURTON BRING FORTH A MONSTERPOCALYPSE?DreamWorks has acquired the screen rights to the board game Monsterpocalypse, and is talking to the already very busy Tim Burton about being “the creative catalyst.” Monsterpocalypse is a collectible miniatures game in which a variety of giant monsters fight in a large city filled with skyscrapers, as an homage to kaiju movies like Godzilla. DreamWorks’ development of Monsterpocalypse is especially interesting given the studio’s concurrent development of a movie based upon the novel Robocalypse, about a robot invasion. The similar titles suggest that DreamWorks might be envisioning the two movies as some sort of franchise, even though they come from two completely different sources and have no other connection other than their titles. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it’s yet another entry in Hollywood’s recent love affair with board game movies. And also because Monsterpocalypse is difficult to spell.#2 ROLLERCOASTER TYCOON TAKING AUDIENCES FOR A RIDESony Pictures Animation has picked up the rights to the Atari PC game franchise RollerCoaster Tycoon. RollerCoaster Tycoon is a game that simulates the management of an amusement park, with players designing their own roller coasters and other park attractions. The franchise has brought in over $300 million in sales for Atari and includes the third best-selling PC title of all time in the U.S. Harald Zwart (The Pink Panther 2, the Karate Kid remake) is producing with an eye towards possibly directing RollerCoaster Tycoon as a live-action/CGI hybrid movie. Screenwriters David Ronn and Jay Scherick (cowriters of Norbit, I Spy) have been hired to adapt RollerCoaster Tycoon after working on Sony’s upcoming The Zookeeper, starring Kevin James and a large cast of stars voicing the animals in a zoo. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it is comparable to the recent drive by Hollywood to adapt board games as movies. As a game, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a simulation game with no real narrative other than the idea of the player creating their own theme parks. This makes for a fun video game experience, but doesn’t seem like a particularly great idea for a movie that has to have a narrative element.#1 ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND KING SOLOMON’S MINES… IN THE FUTUREH. Rider Haggard’s Allan Quatermain was a 19th century Victorian era hero known mostly for his exploits in the wilds of Africa in books like King Solomon’s Mines. The character was also one of the key influences of Indiana Jones, and one of the members of Alan Moore’s League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. What Allan Quatermain was not was a futuristic adventurer from outer space, but that’s exactly what DreamWorks has in mind. Sam Worthington (Avatar, Clash of the Titans) has signed to star in Quatermain, which will be set in a future after humans have left Earth. The future version of Allan Quatermain will return to Earth on a King Solomon’s Mines-style adventure, but on a planetwide scale. This highly revisionist take on Quatermain was written by Mark Verheiden (Timecop, My Name is Bruce), and doesn’t yet have a director. Quatermain is this week’s most Rotten Idea because it is so completely different from the premise of H. Rider Haggard’s classic adventure character. Imagine if DreamWorks was announcing a new movie called Indiana Jones, but it would be an archaelogist from outer space exploring Earth in the distant future, and you get an idea of what they’re basically saying this Quatermain project is. The concept might have promise as an original story, but by calling it Quatermain, DreamWorks is twisting Haggard’s character completely out of context.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Studios, BET, BET, story, parents, Channel, Golden, Academy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sam-Jackson-reveals-Nick-Fury-plans"},{"id":"47509224764127","title":"Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron &amp; Guillermo Del Toro Collaborate","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron &amp; Guillermo Del Toro CollaboratePlus, an Alien prequel, a reboot of The Crow, and casting news for Denzel, Streep, and Worthingtonby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 30, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes news about the latest entries in the Alien, The Crow and Total Recall franchises, more news about what people associated with Lost and Star Trek have in the works, and new roles for Russell Brand, Tina Fey, Meryl Streep, Justin Timberlake, Denzel Washington and Sam Worthington.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES CAMERON HELPING GUILLERMO DEL TORO REACH THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESSSince Guillermo del Toro left the Hobbit prequels, it seems that nearly every week has had news about the director’s future. Last week, the big news was that he was writing and producing a new Haunted Mansion movie for Disney. That, however, is not del Toro’s next film as director, which is probably what fans are most excited to discover. This week, James Cameron came aboard to produce (for Universal Pictures) one of del Toro’s long-planned dream projects: H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness. The 1931 novella is widely considered to be the core story of Lovecraft’s “Cthulhu Mythos,” as it depicts an expedition to Antarctica that discovers a bizarre, ancient city created by an ancient race of creatures that worshipped terrifying gods, the mere knowledge of which can turn a human being insane. Lovecraft’s stories have had a huge influence on pop culture (especially in recent years), but there has never been a major, big-budget studio movie based directly upon one of his Cthulhu stories. Guillermo del Toro’s At the Mountains of Madness will be a 3D production, and Guillermo del Toro will start pre-production soon, and plans to start filming in the summer of 2011. At the Mountains of Madness has long been one of several projects vying to be GDT’s next after The Hobbit. One of the other projects is a Frankenstein film for which makeup tests are already being prepared (even though it won’t be his next film). Del Toro has also revealed that the recent talks about him possibly working on a new Van Helsing movie never went anywhere, and that project won’t be happening.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 LOST‘S DAMON LINDELOF REWRITING THE ALIEN PREQUELProducer/writer Damon Lindelof has taken his first new job since wrapping up the six seasons of Lost, and it’s another high-profile project that joins two others already in the works (he’s cowriting Cowboys &amp; Aliens and Star Trek 2. Lindelof signed a deal with 20th Century Fox to do rewrite work on the Alien prequel that Fox hopes will be Ridley Scott’s next project as director. The meeting in which Lindelof discussed his Alien ideas also produced a concept that could end up being a “free-standing science fiction film” (ie, a movie that’s not a sequel/remake/adaptation, gasp!). Many fans credit Lindelof as being the real brainchild behind what made Lost work, and those fans are most likely very excited to see whatever Lindelof will deliver on the big screen next. Michael Bay also made alien-related news this week, picking up a spec script pitch that is being referred to as the Confidential Alien Project. Bay’s Platinum Dunes will produce the project, the premise of which is being kept secret. Confidential Alien Project was sold on the strength of a treatment and a two-minute teaser trailer by screenwriting newcomer Bobby Glickert.#2 THE CROW REBOOT IS GETTING A REWRITE FROM HAPPY-GO-LUCKY NICK CAVENick Cave is primarily known as a singer/songwriter with a penchant for dark and sometimes depressing lyrics about themes like murder, violence, death and religion. However, Cave is also getting more and more involved with film, having written The Proposition, cowritten Ghosts… of the Civil Dead and writing the scores for movies like The Road and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Nick Cave’s latest screenwriting project will be the rewriting of the planned reboot of The Crow, based upon the comic book by James O’Barr, and which has also inspired four previous movies. Nick Cave will be rewriting the existing script by director Stephen Norrington (Blade, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). The reboot of The Crow is currently an independent project being produced by Ed Pressman (American Psycho, Thank You for Smoking, Wall Street), who also produced the previous four movies.#3 J.J. ABRAMS TO TELL US THE STORY OF HISTORY’S FIRST GREAT ROBOT, BOILERPLATEJ.J. Abrams and Bad Robot (Lost, Star Trek) have picked up the rights (with Paramount Pictures) to the recent picture book Boilerplate: History’s Mechanical Marvel by Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett. Boilerplate tells the story of the world’s first robot who, in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, went on a series of adventures and military missions. During those travels, Boilerplate met and fought alongside figures like Teddy Roosevelt, Pancho Villa and Lawrence of Arabia. Except, of course, that Boilerplate is completely fictional, so this is very much a work of alternative history. There is already a trailer for the book, which does a great job of giving you an idea of what the adventures in the movie will most likely involve.#4 DENZEL WASHINGTON MIGHT BE THE WHITE HOUSE’S BUTLERDirector Lee Daniels (Precious) has spent much of 2010 preparing the civil rights drama Selma, but problems finding financing appear to be leading Daniels to finding another similarly-themed project. Daniels has signed a deal with Sony Pictures to rewrite and direct the true story drama The Butler. Denzel Washington has also been approached about starring. The Butler is based upon the true story of Eugene Allen, a White House servant who served under eight different presidents (Truman to Reagan) during his 34-year career. Allen died earlier this year at the age of 90, but not before living to be invited to Barack Obama’s swearing in, which was symbollic of the civil rights changes that have happened since Allen first started working at the White House under segregation. The first draft of The Butler was written by Danny Strong (HBO’s Recount).#5 TINA FEY WILL BE CALLING MERYL STREEP MOMMYSony Pictures has picked up the rights to Mommy &amp; Me, a comedy starring Meryl Streep and Tina Fey as a mother-daughter pair in an unrevealed premise. Actor Stanley Tucci will be directing Mommy &amp; Me, which will be his fourth film as director after Big Night, The Impostors and Blind Date. The Mommy &amp; Me treatment was written by Joby Harold (2007’s Awake). Stanley Tucci has previously costarred with Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada and Julie &amp; Julia, but there’s no word yet as to whether Tucci will also be appearing in Mommy &amp; Me, or if he will just be directing. Both Tina Fey and Meryl Streep have had a string of comedy hits in recent years, and so the pairing of the two actresses in the same movie has a great deal of potential.#6 JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS BRINGING MORTAL BACKJustin Timberlake’s acting career is continuing along nicely, with four upcoming movies (The Social Network, Yogi Bear, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits) now joined by a fifth, and a starring role at that. Timberlake has been offered the lead role in the science fiction action film I’m.mortal by 20th Century Fox. I’m.mortal is set in a future where people can live forever as long as they can afford it. Timberlake would play a man who is on the run, trying to avoid his death, and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!) is already attached to play a woman that he kidnaps along the way. I’m.mortal was written by and will be directed by Andrew Niccol, who directed Gattaca, S1m0ne and Lord of War, and also wrote The Truman Show. Gattaca and The Truman Show in particular seem to suggest the type of “thinking man’s genre movie” that I’m.mortal might be.#7 SAM WORTHINGTON IS THE MAN ON A LEDGESam Worthington is steadily accruing new roles, including Dracula Year Zero, Quatermain and Dan Dare, in addition to Avatar 2 and Clash of the Titans 2. The latest job for Worthington is the starring role in Man on a Ledge, a police thriller about a former NYPD officer who threatens to jump to his death, and the female psychologist who tries to talk him out of it. The premise suggests a movie like Phone Booth that is set primarily in one place, but perhaps much of the movie will be told in flashbacks (or something similar). Man on a Ledge was written Pablo Fenjves, whose filmography to date consists of several TV movies like Trophy Wife and The Devil’s Child. The Summit Entertainment release will be directed by Asger Leth, codirector of the 2006 documentary Ghosts of Cite Soleil.#8 RUSSELL BRAND MOVES ON FROM DUDLEY MOORE TO ERROL FLYNNAfter playing the same character twice in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek, Russell Brand recently began filming the remake of Arthur, no doubt reinventing the classic Dudley Moore character with his own style. Now, it appears that Russell Brand wants to do the same with the type of old-school swashbuckling swordsman characters once popularized by actors like Errol Flynn, Douglas Fairbanks and more recently, Johnny Depp. Russell Brand is in talks to star with 20th Century Fox in Hawkwood, an action comedy about 14th century mercenary John Hawkwood. Hawkwood and his White Company achieved fame and notoriety primarily in Italy by fighting for various factions, repeatedly switching sides to whomever paid the highest price. It was Russell Brand who first heard about John Hawkwood, and it was his suggestion that got the project started. The Hawkwood script is being written by Jared Stern, who contributed story material to Disney’s Bolt and The Princess and the Frog.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 UNDERWORLD DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR THE TOTAL RECALL REMAKEHollywood’s recent remake frenzy includes several arguably unnecessary projects, and one of them is Total Recall, since Paul Verhoeven’s original 1990 film still holds up and is considered by many to be one of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s best films. Len Wiseman (Underworld, Live Free or Die Hard) is in advanced talks with Columbia Pictures to direct the Total Recall remake. Total Recall was based upon the Philip K. Dick novella We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, and involves a man whose attempt to have memories of a visit to Mars implanted reveals that he is actually an undercover government assassin. The Verhoeven movie differed from the novella by having the character actually travel to Mars. The remake is being written by Kurt Wimmer (Salt, Equilibrium, Ultraviolet), and is being described as a “contemporized” adaptation of Total Recall. Since neither memory implants nor the colonization of Mars are particularly “contemporary” (yet!), this is most likely intended to mean that the movie will feel like one made in the 2010s rather than in 1990. This is this week’s most Rotten Idea because Total Recall simply does not need to be remade. The success of Inception might have some influence in Columbia Pictures’ decision to proceed with this remake, but there are still plenty of other Philip K. Dick stories (and those of other, similar authors) that could be adapted, rather than just remake a movie that still works.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"romance, HBO, fiction, Logo, jurassic, Awards, SDCC, Pictures, Walt, dogs, television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-James-Cameron-and-Guillermo-Del-Toro-Collaborate"},{"id":"47509224790760","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Guillermo del Toro gives up on The Hobbit","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Guillermo del Toro gives up on The HobbitPlus casting news for a new Avenger.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 4, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes big news for the two movies based upon J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, casting news for Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, biopics about the lives of Tupac Shakur and Rush Limbaugh, and news about potential third movies in the Sex and the City and Three Men and a Baby franchises.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYTHERE AND BACK AGAIN: WHY GUILLERMO DEL TORO LEAVING THE HOBBIT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A GOOD THINGThe big news this past weekend, which continued to reverberate through the week, was the announcement by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan’s Labyrinth) that he is stepping down as the director of the upcoming two movies adapting J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit. Del Toro has spent two years getting the movies ready, but ongoing delays mostly due to MGM’s financial woes appear likely to push the start of filming back even further. Del Toro will, however, continue working on the scripts with Lord of the Rings cowriting partners Philippa Boyens, Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh. The next step is for Jackson and Del Toro to meet with studio executives as the search begins for a replacement director. Although we will never see what The Hobbit as directed by Guillermo del Toro himself would have looked like, his stamp will undoubtedly remain on the projects, as a great deal of preproduction has been completed under his supervision in New Zealand. The resulting news for movie fans, however, is not all necessarily negative. Over the last few years, Guillermo del Toro has also accumulated a massive movie development slate, and leaving The Hobbit means that some of those movies are now more likely to be made soon, rather than in something like 2013 as would have previously been the case. In addition to potential “personal projects” (like Pan’s Labyrinth and The Devil’s Backbone), Guillermo del Toro’s slate includes adaptations of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five and the Dan Simmons novel Drood, which is about Charles Dickens’ secret life as a Victorian Era detective.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 THIS WEEK IN MARVEL SUPERHERO MOVIE NEWS: HAWKEYE MAKES HIS MARKAfter months of rumor and speculation, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) is now in final negotations with Marvel Studios to costar in The Avengers as the archer superhero Hawkeye. Renner’s casting as Hawkeye is significant because it is the first casting for the movie for a character who won’t be seen in another Marvel movie beforehand. Other Avengers members that will have appeared in other movies by the time that The Avengers is released on May 4, 2012 include Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). Samuel L. Jackson will also have an important role in The Avengers as S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury, who brings the group together. Neal McDonough (HBO’s Band of Brothers) is also in talks to join the cast of Captain America: The First Avenger this week as Dum-Dum Dugan, who fans may remember as both a cigar-chewing, bowler-wearing member of Nick Fury’s Howling Commandos and after World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. That, however, was in the original comics, where there wasn’t such a big gap between World War II and the 1960s. It’s not yet known whether Dum-Dum Dugan will just be seen in the World War II story, or if he will somehow appear in modern times as well. Finally, the Internet nerd community greeted this week the arrival of our first full glimpses of the costumes of both Captain America and Thor. It should be noted that these images are technically costume concept art, and the finished product may look different. This is especially true of Captain America, who is known from earlier script reviews to undergo at least one major costume change in Captain America: The First Avenger, and there may be a third costume later in the script as well. Having said that, the Thor image at least seems to match the previously released first official image.#2 THIS WEEK IN WB COMIC BOOK MOVIES: NO JOKER IN BATMAN 3; GIANT PLANS FOR 3 STORYAlthough we don’t yet know which villain(s) will be in Christopher Nolan’s next Batman movie, Nolan let the world know which one won’t be: The Joker. The obvious reason, of course, is that Heath Ledger sort of defined the role for this generation. Warner Bros has also picked up the rights from Dark Horse Comics to the independent graphic novel called 3 Story: The Secret History of the Giant Man by Matt Kindt. 3 Story is a “modern fable, exploring the life of a giant man, Craig Pressgang, whose strange medical condition causes continuous growth… from birth to his eventual three-story height.” The screenwriter tasked with adapting the “arty” and “downbeat” story is Dustin Lance Black, who won the Oscar for original screenwriting for Milk, and whose Hoover biopic will be directed by Clint Eastwood. Black made his directorial debut with the independent drama What’s Wrong With Virginia (starring Emma Roberts and Jennifer Connelly), and he is also signed to direct 3 Story.#3 DANIEL CRAIG MIGHT INVESTIGATE THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOOWith his Facebook drama The Social Network not yet released, director David Fincher (Zodiac, Fight Club) is already preparing his next movie. Daniel Craig is reportedly in talks with Fincher to star in his English-language adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first in a trilogy of Swedish detective novels. The Millennium Trilogy, written by Stieg Larsson (and published posthumously after his 2004 death), details the cases of an unlikely investigative team of a middle-aged journalist and an eccentric female computer hacker with a photographic memory. In addition to Daniel Craig, Brad Pitt has also reportedly expressed interest in the reporter role. The casting of the young computer hacker is still underway, but the actresses who are interested reportedly include Carey Mulligan (An Education), Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman. David Fincher plans on starting filming in October, 2010, and Columbia Pictures is already planning on a December, 2011 release.#4 TUPAC BIOPIC GETTING RESURRECTEDPlans for a biopic about slain rapper Tupac Shakur have been in the works for several years now, but it appears the movie will finally start filming this September. That’s the word, at least, from director Antoine Fuqua (King Arthur, Training Day). Just last week, Fuqua had been revealed as the director of an upcoming Bruce Willis prison escape movie called The Tomb, but that movie will apparently have to wait. Tupac Shakur was, of course, a rapper who got his career started as a member of Digital Underground before going solo as 2Pac and then Tupac. Shakur was also shot five times in 1994, then served 11 months in prison for sexual assault, and was finally shot again in Las Vegas, this time fatally. Tupac Shakur has also already been the focus of over a dozen (!) documentary films, including the Academy Award nominated 2003 film Tupac: Resurrection.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 RUSH LIMBAUGH: THE (UNAUTHORIZED) MOVIEOnce upon a time, when you said “Rush,” people thought you were talking about an awesome Canadian rock group who did that song about Tom Sawyer. Today, people are more likely to follow a word association game of Rush with… Limbaugh. Love him or hate him, Rush Limbaugh’s impact on political talk radio over the last 20 years is indisputable. And now, a producer/screenwriter named James Sclafani has optioned the rights to the unauthorized biography The Rush Limbaugh Story: Talent on Loan from God from author Paul Colford. Sclafani has no produced credits, but he did sell his script Counter Kid to Bill Murray’s production company. Sclafani is now shopping his Rush Limbaugh script around for financing. Sclafani says that his script is a “close cousin” to Oliver Stone’s W. about George W. Bush, and include the contradictions between Rush’s stances on the military and drugs and Rush’s own personal experiences. Sclafani put it this way, “This is Citizen Kane meets Private Parts, where you have a man who always had trouble relating to people in the outside world, but does it effortlessly in the booth.” This project is only marginally in the Rotten Idea category, mostly because what someone thinks about an unauthorized biography of Rush Limbaugh probably depends upon well, lots of things. If you’re one of Rush’s Dittoheads, then you probably see this as yet another liberal attack on the right. If you don’t care for Rush, then perhaps this is a movie that you would like to see. Regardless of all that, Sclafani is also an unproven talent at this point, and so that’s just enough to push this story into the Rotten Idea category.#3 THE MYSTERIOUS CASE OF THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO A CLOSEIn three years since Veronica Mars went off the air after three years on UPN and The CW, there has been regular talk about a possible movie spinoff. Kristen Bell starred in the TV series as the titular Veronica Mars, a high school/college student who was also a private investigator. And now, producer Joel Silver has come forward to explain why the Veronica Mars movie most likely will never happen. Silver says that he and series creator Rob Thomas talked to the Warner Bros home video people, and that the Veronica Mars DVDs did not sell particularly well. And it’s also worth noting that when it was on the air, Veronica Mars only averaged 2-3 million viewers per episode. Silver says that the video market would have been the reason to make a Veronica Mars movie, and so the audience is perceived as not being there for a theatrical movie either. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas on behalf of the show’s fans, who were capable of creating the impression of a larger fanbase through their avid support of the show. This writer didn’t watch Veronica Mars, but I know some people really enjoyed it, so I’m guessing that some fans will be disappointed to learn that Veronica Mars won’t continue sleuthing on the big screen.#2 THREE MEN, A BRIDE AND A PIZZA PLACETom Selleck confirmed this week that Disney has plans to revive the comedy franchise that started with 1987’s Three Men and a Baby and continued in 1990 with Three Men and a Little Lady. Doing the math, that means that the original baby would this year be turning 23. And that leads directly to the title, which Selleck revealed is tentatively Three Men and a Bride. There’s no word yet as to who exactly wrote the script, but Selleck says that a script does exist, although he hasn’t read it yet. Who would be directing Three Men and a Bride is also unknown. What is known is that Disney has checked the availability of Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg, which suggests a plan to start filming sooner rather than farther down the road. As for what it’s about, well, the title pretty much tells the story, presuming that you know that the “Three Men” who collectively raise the daughter of one of the men (Ted Danson). Three Men and a Baby was also an American remake of a French comedy called Three Men and a Cradle, which itself had a sequel called 18 Years After. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas mostly just because of how long ago it was that moviegoers cared about the Three Men movies. Back then, for example, Steve Guttenberg actually was a major movie star, and Selleck and Danson both had hit TV shows. Will audiences still show up to see what these guys are doing 23 years later?#1 SEX AND THE HIGH SCHOOLSex and the City 2 opened in theaters last weekend, and did particularly less box office than many prognosticators expected. That, however, does not appear to be deterring New Line Cinema and Warner Bros from continuing to explore future possibilities for a third Sex and the City movie. This week, two different stories broke, and they both suggest differing approaches. First, there was this story that was mostly analyzed the reasons Sex and the City 2 didn’t do well as expected. Included in it is word that Warner Bros is waiting to see what sort of “legs” the sequel has before entirely ruling out a third film, which that story seems to suggest would be another movie starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon. Or, perhaps, that’s not what they’re intending at all. New Line Cinema has begun talks about adapting Candace Bushnell’s latest book The Carrie Diaries as a movie. The book is a prequel which centers on Carrie Bradshaw’s life as a high school student in Connecticut. Bushnell is also already working on a second book that would be about the young Carrie’s first year living in New York City. When asked in 2008, Candace Bushnell said that she imagined the young Carrie being played by Miley Cyrus. That particular bit of dream casting would probably also require a lot of accent training for the young actress/singer sort of famous for her southern twang. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because the response to Sex and the City 2 is probably a reminder that what might have worked as a HBO series doesn’t necessarily translate into something that can hold up to a series of movies about the same characters.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Bros., Netflix, archives, Pride, Masterpiece, Anna, HBO, sequel, FX, Box","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Guillermo-del-Toro-gives-up-on-The-Hobbit"},{"id":"47509224776419","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Bonds’ License to Kill May Be Revoked","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Bonds' License to Kill May Be RevokedPlus more casting news for X-Men: First Classby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 9, 2010 |  CommentsThis shortened week (following the 4th of July weekend) would normally be a bit light on movie news anyway, but movers and shakers are also holding back their big announcements until San Diego Comic-Con later this month, so this week was even lighter on news. However, a few tidbits still managed to stand out, including plans for movies based upon The Little Mermaid and TV’s The Fall Guy, and new movies for Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kevin Bacon and Billy Crystal. And hey, if Hollywood’s decisions this week (or lack thereof) get you down, you can always check out the trailer for Indonesia’s hottest new movie, Little Obama, which is exactly what you might think it would be.THIS WEEK’S TOP STORYJAMES BOND’S LICENSE TO KILL MAY BE REVOKEDAs movie fans continue to recover from the possibility that MGM’s financial woes may prevent us from ever seeing two awesome The Hobbit movies, there was a lot of news this week about MGM’s other hugely popular franchise: James Bond. It was just a few months ago that we were hoping to soon see the third Daniel Craig-starring Bond movie directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) from a script by Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon). And now, not only is that project on hold (as reported a few months ago), “James Bond 23” might be totally scrapped altogether. Now, EON will probably eventually find some way to revive James Bond, but the real immediate issue is that the longer this particular version of James Bond is delayed, the less likely it will be that we ever see it happen. And that includes the very idea of Daniel Craig as our current leaner, meaner Bond for the 21st century. By the time Bond gets revived, we might be hearing stories about younglings like Robert Pattinson being considered for the role (I mostly kid, but a big part of me knows that’s not entirely impossible). If there was good news on the James Bond front this week, it came from Inception/The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan who said on the red carpet this week that he’d “love to do a Bond film.” That doesn’t mean that he will direct one, but it’s nice to know that one of the directors most in a position to get dream projects made has an interest. Meanwhile, in other MGM franchise news, the company is reportedly considering the possibility of selling off its rights to The Hobbit to New Line Cinema and Warner Bros for the extra cash to help the studio recover as a whole. Of course, in Monopoly terms, that would sort of be like auctioning off Boardwalk so that you can build houses on Baltic.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS THIS WEEK#1 LEE MAJORS MIGHT NEED TO REWRITE THE FALL GUY LYRICS FOR MORE CURRENT NAMES THAN CHERYL TIEGS AND BO DEREKThe relatively so-so box office results for TV remakes like MacGruber and The A-Team don’t appear to have intimidated Hollywood producers away from mining 1980s TV show nostalgia for movie ideas. DreamWorks and producer Walter Parkes (Minority Report, Men in Black, Gladiator) are currently working on a movie version of the 1981-1986 ABC action drama The Fall Guy, which starred Lee Majors as a Hollywood stuntman who moonlighted as a bounty hunter. There’s no word yet on any creative types involved with The Fall Guy, including a writer, much less a director or a star. Although I would generally consider the whole TV-show-remake trend a bit on the “Rotten Idea” side, I was also a big fan of The Fall Guy back in the day, and I think that it could potentially be adapted as a pretty cool movie (maybe). One thing that is vastly different in the 2010s than thirty years ago is what exactly being a “stuntman” entails in this age of CGI and motion-capture technology. Today’s stuntmen often have more in common with Andy Serkis and Doug Jones than the rugged archetype that Lee Majors’ Colt Seavers character represented, but there are still some guys out there in the mud swinging around swords and guns, only to then be CGI’ed from a handful of guys into thousands.#2 THERE’S SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT THE NEWEST FAIRY TALE MOVIE: THE LITTLE MERMAIDHans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid is such a classic and well-known fairy tale that it is a little surprising to discover that there has actually never been a live-action, English-language movie version. Obviously, the 1989 Disney animated version is a beloved modern classic (and a big part of Disney’s rejuvenation after the fallow 1970s and 1980s), but 20+ years later, now might be a good time to revisit the legend. And at least, it’s a better idea than say, someone remaking Splash. The director behind this new Little Mermaid is Joe Wright, whose first three films have been 2005’s Pride &amp; Prejudice, the Oscar-winning Atonement and last year’s The Soloist. Wright also has the teenage assassin thriller Hanna, starring Cate Blanchett, Eric Bana and young Saorise Ronan, wrapped up and readying for an April release next year. Working Title Films is producing The Little Mermaid, which was written by Abi Morgan, who has mostly written British TV and the movie Brick Lane, as well as being announced last week as writing the Margaret Thatcher biopic The Iron Lady, starring Meryl Streep. Wright’s vision for a live action The Little Mermaid is also reportedly inspired by a children’s puppet theatre production staged by London’s Little Angel Theatre Company.#3 MAD MAX ACTUALLY RETURNING AND THEN RETURNING AGAINAustralian director George Miller has been trying to get the long-awaited Mad Max reboot going so long that he has apparently decided that when filming finally starts, he will make the most of it and produce two movies. In addition to Mad Max: Fury Road, Miller will reportedly also be making a sequel right away called Mad Max: Furiosa. There’s no word yet about what Furiosa might be about though. Tom Hardy (Shinzon from Star Trek: Nemesis) will be starring as the new Max, and Charlize Theron will also be costarring. For those who don’t know, the Mad Max movies previously starred (a much younger) Mel Gibson as a “Main Force Patrol” police officer in a post-apocalyptic Australia who had to regularly deal with the sort of villainous scum that remained behind after civilization crumbled. George Miller will be filming the two Mad Max movies back-to-back in Australia using 3D cameras (ie, not post-conversion), and hopes to then have them released fairly close to each other in 2012. The start date for this big Mad Max dual production has also been pushed back from this November until February, 2011. Weta Digital has been confirmed as handling the designs, make up FX and costuming.#4 THIS WEEK IN X-MEN: FIRST CLASS ENSEMBLE CASTINGAn interesting theory has surfaced this week in regards to the casting process for 20th Century Fox’s X-Men: First Class, which Matthew Vaughn (Kick-Ass) will start filming in August. Basically, people are now talking about the strong possibility that many of the roles that are being reported as being cast are actually cover roles for the real characters. In other words, if a young actor is supposedly up for an obscure character like Bird Boy (and yes, there really is a Bird Boy in the Marvel Mutant comic books), he might actually be in talks to play Angel. With that as my lead, please consider pretty much everything you’ve heard, or will hear, about X-Men: First Class casting with some caution, because we might be totally “punked.” One rumor this week was that Kick-Ass star Aaron Johnson might be playing Cyclops. That story was quickly debunked, and replaced by the news that Lucas Till (Hannah Montana: The Movie) is in the running to play Cyclops’ brother Havok. Except, if the “fake casting” concept is true, perhaps the role Till is *really* in talks for is Cyclops himself. Who knows?! The same story confirms last week’s story about the casting of Banshee and also breaks the news that Hank “Beast” McCoy (who was recently rumored to be going to another young actor) will instead be played by Nicholas Coult (Clash of the Titans, A Single Man). Finally, the latest breaking news as I write this today is that someone who was actually alive back before the All-New, All-Different X-Men were even thought of might actually be in X-Men: First Class. That star is Kevin Bacon, who at 52, is over 20 years older than the actor who has been as Charles Xavier (31-year-old James McAvoy). Kevin Bacon is reportedly up for the role of the big, bad villain of X-Men: First Class, but we don’t know who that villain might actually be. One wild guess that I will throw out there is the early X-Men villain The Vanisher (whose power was teleportation), mostly because many other early X-Men villains just don’t seem like characters you would cast Kevin Bacon as, but since the Vanisher is an older guy with a penchant for heists and such, Kevin Bacon could be a pretty good choice. The Vanisher is legitimately old-school X-Men, making his debut way back in Uncanny X-Men #2 in November, 1963, making him the team’s second villain ever after Magneto. Or I might be totally off base with this guess. Who might you predict Kevin Bacon could play?#5 DENZEL WASHINGTON SPENDING TIME IN A SAFE HOUSEDenzel Washington is in talks with Universal Pictures to star in the action thriller Safe House. The original script by David Guggenheim (who as yet has no produced scripts to his credit) was the subject of a bidding war between studios in February. Safe House is the story of a young CIA agent who must escort a dangerous prisoner (Washington) to a new safe house after the first one has been destroyed, resulting in all of the other agents being killed. Safe House will mark the Hollywood debut of Swedish director Daniel Espinosa (Babylonsiukan and the upcoming Snabba Cash). Denzel Washington’s next movie will be this November’s Unstoppable, directed by Tony Scott, but the actor otherwise doesn’t have much else work lined up, so it seems likely Safe House will happen sooner rather than later.#6 JOHN LE CARRE’S VERY BRITISH CLASSIC GETS A VERY BRITISH CASTThat headline was written before this writer realized that Michael Fassbender is actually German-Irish, but it still basically gets the point across, even if it’s only 75% correct. Ralph Fiennes, Colin Firth, Gary Oldman and Michael Fassbender have signed on to star in the upcoming adaptation of John Le Carre’s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The Working Title/Studio Canal coproduction will mark the English-language debut of director Tomas Alfredson, whose vampire drama Let the Right One In still stands as one of the best foreign-language imports of recent years. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is the story of George Smiley, a prematurely-retired intelligence expert who is brought back to service to help find a spy who is working within the upper tiers of the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service. Le Carre’s novel, which was previously adapted as a 1979 British TV series starring Sir Alec Guinness, was adapted by screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon), who has also recently worked on the next James Bond project (see above). Filming of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy will start in London in October.#7 LEONARDO DICAPRIO’S WALL STREET PROJECT MIGHT NOT BE YET ANOTHER COLLABORATION WITH MARTY SCORSESEIn addition to being a Hollywood A list star and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio also has his hand deeply in the producing game via his Appian Way company. One of the projects that he had been hoping to work on with his now frequent directing partner Martin Scorsese was an adaptation of Jordan Belfort’s stockbroker memoir The Wolf of Wall Street. The duo nearly made the movie two years ago but the deal fell apart in a “tug of war” between Warner Bros and Paramount (leading to them making Shutter Island together instead). Now, DiCaprio is talking to Ridley Scott (American Gangster, Black Hawk Down) instead, who would also produce as well as direct, although at issue is whether he could squeeze it in before starting work on the Alien prequel for 20th Century Fox. Ridley Scott reportedly is especially attracted to the script by Terence Winter, who has written and produced several episodes of HBO’s The Sopranos and the upcoming Boardwalk Empire (also a Scorsese project), as well as the movies Brooklyn Rules and Get Rich or Die Tryin’. What’s particularly interesting about Scott possibly directing The Wolf of Wall Street is what it might say about his involvement in the languishing board game adaptation Monopoly. Might whatever economic commentary Scott has to say with Monopoly potentially be addressed instead in a more serious, adult drama like The Wolf of Wall Street?#8 YOU DON’T KNOW BROTHER JACK EITHERColumbia Pictures has attached director Barry Levinson (Bugsy, Rain Man, Wag the Dog) to their planned biopic of human rights activist Jack Healey entitled Brother Jack. Barry Levinson is riding quite a bit of publicity good will following the 15 nominations that his Jack Kevorkian HBO biopic You Don’t Know Jack received this week. Harley Peyton (Less Than Zero, 2001’s Bandits), who also cowrote more than half the episodes of Twin Peaks, wrote the first Brother Jack draft, and it is now being rewritten by Kelly Masterson (Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead). Brother Jack benefits from this being a slow news week (both because of Monday being a holiday and because Comic-Con is coming up), so it gets a Weekly Ketchup slot that probably would normally have gone to some superhero, unneeded remake or a movie involving teen vampires, werewolves or both.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 BILLY CRYSTAL’S LATEST ROLE WILL REQUIRE A LOT LESS OLD GUY MAKEUP THAN HE DID IN THE PRINCESS BRIDEIt feels like a long time ago, but there was once a time when Billy Crystal was a major Hollywood movie star, appearing in movies like When Harry Met Sally… and the two City Slickers movies. Whatever goodwill those movies might have garnered Billy Crystal, he also made movies like Mr. Saturday Night and much of what he did during his run on Saturday Night Live was (in this writer’s opinion) unforgettably corny and hamfisted. Lately, however, most of what Billy Crystal’s been doing is animated voice work in movies like Cars, Monsters, Inc and Howl’s Moving Castle. 20th Century Fox and Walden Media, however, want to see Billy Crystal return to a leading role in a family comedy called Us &amp; Them. Billy Crystal will star in and produce Us &amp; Them, which is a generational comedy (based on an original idea by Crystal) about a grandfather forced to take care of his three grandchildren following the “21st century rules of his daughter, their mother, who has gone on a weeklong work vacation.” Yep, that’s right, Billy Crystal is now stepping into the cranky-but-loveable grampa role previously inhabitated by guys like Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. In addition to likely jokes involving cell phones and video games, Crystal’s character will have to deal with “Little League games where everyone gets a hit, tailored meals and ‘feelings,'” before ultimately using “an old-school-justice style of discipline.” Crystal’s story idea was adapted by married couple Joe Syracuse and Lisa Addario (cowriters of 2007’s Surf’s Up). Us &amp; Them will be directed by Andy Fickman, who has worked with kids before on Race to Witch Mountain and The Game Plan, but this time, he will (probably) have to do so without the help of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Us &amp; Them is this week’s most Rotten Idea mostly because this is sort of a slow news week. In a typical Ketchup, Us &amp; Them might only come in as second or third most rotten.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cancelled, 4/20, Amazon, spinoff, TV, Pictures, Spectrum, the, impossible","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Bonds-License-to-Kill-May-Be-Revoked"},{"id":"47509226537710","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith in Bad Boys and MIB Sequels","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Will Smith in Bad Boys and MIB SequelsPlus, casting news for Kristen Stewart and Benicio Del Toro, and Bond 23 is postponed.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 23, 2010 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings us potentially good news for fans of Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr, Cameron Diaz and Kristen Stewart, along with news about James Bond, Friday the 13th, the Arthur and Escape From New York remakes and the I Dream of Jeannie movie.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 THIS WEEK IN WILL SMITH TRILOGY NEWS: BAD BOYS III AND MEN IN BLACK IIIWill Smith has only starred in two sequels, and this week brought fresh news about the continuing plans for third movies in both franchises: Bad Boys III and Men in Black III. First, there was Martin Lawrence, who revealed this week that he’s met with both Smith and director Michael Bay (Transformers, Pearl Harbor) about making a third movie about Miami police detectives Lowrey and Burnett. It’s sort of obvious that if a Bad Boys III movie were to be made, Will Smith would have to be involved, but the news about Michael Bay also returning for a third try is the bigger deal. Bad Boys III is being written for Columbia Pictures by newcomer screenwriter Peter Craig, who wrote and directed a comedy short film called The Climactic Death of Dark Ninja. Will Smith’s other would-be trilogy also got buzz this week with director Barry Sonnenfeld (RV, Wild Wild West) also confirming that he will be returning for his third Men in Black movie, along with a few other details. Sonnenfeld confirmed that not only will Will Smith reprise his role as alien-investigating Agent J, but that Tommy Lee Jones will also return as Agent K. Jones’ involvement had previously seemed questionable, in light of news that Josh Brolin was being considered to play a younger version of Agent K. Finally, Sonnenfeld also mentioned that Men in Black III will be filmed in 3D, continuing the hot new trend. Columbia Pictures is reportedly interested in getting Men in Black III going in time to fill the 2011 Memorial Day weekend spot that opened up when Spider-Man 4 was cancelled in favor of a reboot of the franchise with a new star. All of the films in both Smith franchises, with the exception of the oringinal Men in Black, have been poorly received by critics, which would normally land this news as a “Rotten Idea.” However, both franchises are fan favorites, and it’s always possible that the third time could be a charm. Bad Boys II also benefits from being one of the movies paid loving homage in Hot Fuzz, if that counts for anything.#2 PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE IRON MAN BEHIND THE CURTAINFollowing the success of Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, there are at least five different projects that are eyeing L. Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz for a similar revisit. One of them is Oz the Great and Powerful (formerly known as Brick), a Walt Disney prequel that Robert Downey Jr. is reportedly interested in starring in as the Wizard. Disney has a notable director in mind for the project as well: Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition). Mendes’ schedule now appears to be open, considering the news (see down below) that the 23rd James Bond film is indefinitely postponed. Oz the Great and Powerful will be a prequel which tells the story of how the Wizard, a “charlatan who’s part of a traveling circus,” ended up in Oz in the first place. The script was written by Mitchell Kapner, whose most recognizable credit is the 2000 hitman comedy The Whole Nine Yards. The aforementioned other four Oz projects are Universal’s adaptation of the musical Wicked, an animated movie to be directed by John Boorman (Excalibur, Deliverance) and two different projects at Warner Bros (one from the producers of Twilight and the other a dark sequel starring Dorothy’s granddaughter).#3 IS THE MOVIE VERSION OF JOAN JETT WANTED TOO?Kristen Stewart may have a “bad reputation” with many movie fans because of her continuing involvement with The Twilight Saga, but her performance as Joan Jett in The Runaways is being hailed by many critics as surprisingly convincing. So, like her Shark Boy costar, her latest movie news is getting the benefit of the doubt and is avoiding the “Rotten Idea” tag. The word in Hollywood this week (well, mostly the Internet, but same difference, really) is that Kristen Stewart is being considered to replace Angelina Jolie in Wanted 2. The story started the week as a rumor, but it’s now been confirmed that Kristen Stewart has indeed met with director Timur Bekmambetov about possibly playing a “young ass-kicking assassin in the Fraternity” (in other words, not the same Fox character that Jolie played). Whether the movie will happen is still up in the air, however, but if Stewart does sign on, the project has at least a year to come together anyway. Kristen Stewart does, after all, have the two Breaking Dawn movies yet to film, and giving birth to a lycanthrope-loving psychic half vampire baby might require plenty of recuperation time.#4 FORGETTING STRETCH ARMSTRONGThis column has been a bit hard on Taylor Lautner, the star of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D, whose legions of young female fans (AKA “sharkgirls”) have made him an Internet sensation. One of Lautner’s most rotten of “Rotten Idea” entries was Universal’s Stretch Armstrong, based on the nearly forgotten 1970s-1980s Hasbro action figure toy with elastic arms and legs. However, this week brought news that might just force us to consider what might have been previously unfathomable: Stretch Armstrong could actually be… good? Universal has announced a director and a new screenwriter who suggest something like that could actually happen. Director Rob Letterman (Monsters Vs Aliens, Shark Tale) has signed on, and Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek; director of Forgetting Sarah Marshall) will be doing a rewrite of the script. This isn’t the first time that Letterman and Stoller have worked together, as Stoller also cowrote Gulliver’s Travels, the 2010 Jack Black fantasy comedy that marks Letterman’s live action debut.#5 DIAZ AND DEL TORO HAVE AN EX TO GRIND20th Century Fox has acquired the rights to the Jane Heller novel An Ex to Grind, with Cameron Diaz and Benicio Del Toro attached to star. The romantic comedy will be about an ex-athlete (Del Toro) who supported his waitress wife’s (Diaz) dreams. When the now successful wife wants to divorce him because he’s become a couch potato in retirement, he files for alimony to maintain the lifestyle he’s been accustomed to, leading her to find a new wife for him. There’s no director attached to the project yet, but this one escapes being a “rotten idea” because of its stars. First, Cameron Diaz has shown that she really can shine in comedies (see: There’s Something About Mary and the Charlie’s Angels movies, of which she was the funniest star, arguably). Even more intriguing is the idea of Benicio Del Toro expanding into the comedy genre. He’s long been attached to play Moe in the Farrelly Brothers’ reboot of The Three Stooges, but with that project apparently delayed for now, An Ex to Grind might just be the movie in which he makes his comedic semi-debut instead. Del Toro has had comedic roles in the past (notably Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), but this would appear to be his first “mainstream” comedy role since becoming a bigger name star with more dramatic parts.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#5 DAME HELEN MIRREN TO BRING A FEMININE TOUCH TO THE ARTHUR REMAKEHollywood’s fascination with remake fever doesn’t get much more baffling than the remake of Arthur, starring Russell Brand. At issue really is exactly how funny anyone really finds the British comedian, whose first real starring role in a Hollywood movie (Get Him to the Greek) hasn’t come out yet. And yet, Brand still gets starring roles (including the 2011 Easter Bunny movie I Hop). Warner Bros’ Arthur remake is indeed ramping up for production in July in New York, and the first real sign of that came this week. Dame Helen Mirren is in talks to costar as Arthur’s longtime nanny in what is basically a gender switch of the butler character in the original film as played by Sir John Gielgud. Arthur is of course the story of a British alcoholic heir to a massive fortune who falls in love with a working class girl rather than the type of woman that his family approves of. The latest version of the script was rewritten by Peter Baynham, who was one of the cowriters of both Borat and Brüno, which probably gives us an idea of the type of humor Brand’s Arthur is going for. Jason Winer, who is the co-executive producer and director of ABC’s Modern Family will be making his feature film debut directing the Arthur remake for Warner Bros. Although Dame Helen might be able to do something funny playing against her reputation as Arthur’s nanny, this story still gets one of this week’s Rotten Idea slots because Arthur just doesn’t feel like a movie that needs to be remade, and especially not starring Russell Brand. Get Him to the Greek opens just a few weeks before Arthur starts filming, and so it should be interesting to see what becomes of this remake if that movie flops disastrously.#4 TOMORROW NEVER DIES FOR JAMES BONDWith MGM in continuing financial jeopardy and the recent attempt to sell the studio ending fruitlessly, EON Productions has announced that plans for the 23rd James Bond movie have been “indefinitely postponed.” The project has previously been eyed as a possible 2011/2012 release, with Daniel Craig again reprising his version of James Bond, which made Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace blockbuster hits with audiences worldwide. Daniel Craig is still attached to star, but with the plug pulled, it may now be 2013 before another James Bond movie gets made. This also frees director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) to move onto other projects (see the above story about Oz the Great and Powerful). This is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas because this latest reboot of the Bond franchise has been exactly what the character needed for the 21st century, and it’s our loss that we’re not going to get a third one anytime soon. Another reboot sequel that got bad news this week is Friday the 13th Part 2. The 2009 reboot opened to an astonishing $43 million opening weekend, so it is surprising that producer Brad Fuller says the sequel is now “dead – not happening.” New Line Cinema and Warner Bros had previously been aiming for an August 13, 2010 release for Friday the 13th Part 2. This news isn’t quite as “rotten” as the news of James Bond 23 being postponed, but it’s still surprising and newsworthy.#3 THE UNITED STATES OF DREAMING OF JEANNIEHollywood has had a fascination with adapting old TV shows into movies since the late 1980s, and the results have been mostly negative. Some of the oldest projects in development are based upon 1960s sitcoms, like I Dream of Jeannie, the story of a male astronaut who keeps a sexy magical female slave who calls him “Master” in a bottle in his apartment. Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman starred in the original series, which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970. Columbia Pictures has had I Dream of Jeannie in development since the 1990s, and are still moving ahead with it even years after the box office disaster ($63 million domestic after a budget of $85 million) that was their 2005 adaptation of the similiarly themed Bewitched. The latest writer to try modernizing I Dream of Jeannie is Sheila Callaghan, an intellectual New York playwright who wrote two episodes of Showtime’s The United States of Tara. Over the years, the people (formerly) involved with I Dream of Jeannie have included Lindsay Lohan and director Gurinder Chadha (Bend It Like Beckham). The hiring of a non-comedic screenwriter with some literary cred (Callaghan adapted James Joyce’s Ulysses) is an interesting move, but I Dream of Jeannie is still one of this week’s Rotten Ideas, just based on the fact that the time for that movie, if there ever was one, seems way, way in the past.#2 ROTTEN IDEAS ARE FROM MARSBestselling novels are a natural source for narrative movies. Best selling self help books, however, since they have no actual story or characters, wouldn’t seem to be quite as wise an idea. That’s not stopping Summit Entertainment, as they have acquired the TV and film rights this week to John Gray’s Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus franchise of books. Since the first book’s publication in 1992, relationship counselor John Gray has written over a dozen Mars/Venus books, all of which approach relationships based on the idea that men and women have very different personalities. John Gray has also been a frequent, predictable guest for shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show for nearly twenty years now. Summit hasn’t yet revealed their film plans for Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus yet, but it is expected that it will take the form of “high-concept ensemble comedy along the lines of the hit 2009 release He’s Just Not That Into You. This is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because it’s yet another example of Hollywood attempting to build an entire movie around a property with a catchy title and a large audience that otherwise doesn’t have anything that would make instant sense as a movie with an actual story. Yes, there are stereotypes about how men and women can be different, but basically, a project like this is not far removed from being the adult equivalent of a movie based on a board game.#1 CRAZIES REMAKE DIRECTOR REMAKING ESCAPE FROM NEW YORKDespite John Carpenter’s Escape From New York remaining one of the director’s best movies, and one that still holds up as a highly recommended futuristic action movie, New Line Cinema is still continuing with their plans for an unnecessary remake. This week, the studio started talks with director Breck Eisner (Sahara, The Crazies) about taking on the project. At one point, Gerard Butler was attached to star as the new Snake Plissken, the bad ass renegade bank robber who is forced to rescue the president when his plane crashes in a future Manhattan that has been turned into a massive penal colony. Butler eventually dropped out of the project (smart, Gerard!), but New Line’s still pursuing the remake, having hired several screenwriters to work on it. Breck Eisner is very into remakes, as, besides The Crazies, he has also worked on a possible remake of The Creature From the Black Lagoon and is currently developing a remake of Flash Gordon. This is the week’s most Rotten Idea because Escape From New York is simply a classic movie that doesn’t need to be remade at all. Snake Plissken is arguably the best example of Kurt Russell at the height of his career, as it was a character he completely made his own. Any actor who attempts to replicate what Kurt Russell did in Escape From New York is on a fool’s errand.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Rocketman, dark, 20th, Competition, drama, know, docudrama, HBO, Ghostbusters, critic, Skip","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Will-Smith-in-Bad-Boys-and-MIB-Sequels"},{"id":"47509226556150","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Ian McShane sails to Stanger Tides","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Ian McShane sails to Stanger Tides\n                        Plus more news about Captain America\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | February 26, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                This week’s Ketchup includes casting news for Pirates of the Caribbean 4, news of a Zoolander sequel and a Speedy Gonzalez movie and new projects for Angelina Jolie, Matt Damon, Ryan Reynolds and director Kevin Smith.  And happily, this is a week with zero remakes (well, there is sort of one, but we’ll let Doc Savage slide by) or movies based on kids’ toys or games.  Progress!\n\n\nFRESH DEVELOPMENTS\n\n\n\n#1 BLACKBEARD IN PIRATES 4: NEXT BEST THING TO A SWEARENGEN MOVIE?\nIan McShane, the popular star of Deadwood (as antiquated potty mouth Al Swearengen) is in talks with Disney to costar in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Ian McShane will play the villain of the film, and it’s a famous (and real life) pirate at that: Blackbeard, AKA Edward Teach.  Already cast are Johnny Depp (of course) as Jack Sparrow and Penelope Cruz, who was announced a couple of weeks ago. The franchise is getting a new director for the fourth film in the form of Rob Marshall (Chicago, Nine).  The script, which involves a search for the legendary Fountain of Youth, was written by Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot, who also worked together on the first three films. The title appears to come from the book On Stranger Tides by Tim Powers, which Disney owns the movie rights to.  Powers’ book is also about a pirate named Jack, the search for the Fountain of Youth, and it also features Blackbeard.  Filming of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides starts later this summer in Hawaii, and Disney has scheduled the film for a May 20, 2011 release date.\n\n\n#2 THIS WEEK IN CAPTAIN AMERICA NEWS\nAs reported previously, The First Avenger: Captain America is currently in the screen testing stage, part of the process of finding the young star that will play World War II super soldier Steve Rogers. There are seven guys that are currently being considered, which is a long list, but here you go (alphabetically): Michael Cassidy (Privileged), Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl), Patrick Flueger (Brothers), Garret Hedlund (Eragon), John Krasinski (The Office), Scott Porter (Friday Night Lights) and Mike Vogel (Cloverfield).  Absent from that list are Robert Buckley (Privileged) and Jensen Ackles (Supernatural), both of whom have scheduling conflicts, and that’s why they’re not screen testing. Of those seven, the one that really stands out as a “wtf?” choice is John Krasinski, who does not seem to fit the Steve Rogers “type” at all, except that perhaps he fits in director Joe Johnston’s idea of making Rogers more of a Peter Parker-style “underdog” character.  Of everyone that’s been considered, I think Jensen Ackles seems like the best choice, so his scheduling conflict is unfortunate.  As for these other guys, this writer is not familiar with a lot of these shows or their stars, honestly. Part of the reason you’re not seeing any big names in that list is that the offer for the first film is only $300,000, and it includes an option for up to NINE movies that include The Avengers, sequels, and any other movies that Marvel wants to put Captain America in.  Finally, I should note that there is a rumor swirling around, which Marvel publicists are being quick to quell, that Joe Johnston is being replaced, and The First Avenger: Captain America delayed, because of the poor performance of The Wolfman.  I’ve always thought that Johnston was a weak choice for the movie anyway, as the potential World War II epic seems perfect for a director with a bit more critical heft.  Joe Johnston did direct October Sky, but mostly his movies have been of the blockbuster-wannabe mediocrity stamp.  RT editor-in-chief Matt Atchity and I have bandied about dream directors, and our list includes Steven Soderbergh, David Mamet, Martin Scorsese and Philip Kaufman.  Who’s your dream Captain America director, and from that list, who do you think Marvel should pick?\n\n\n#3 BEN STILLER TO BRING BLUE STEEL BACK TO THE THEATERS WITH ZOOLANDER 2\nZoolander is a very funny comedy that didn’t do as well at theaters as its cultural popularity would suggest.  The simple reason (I believe, anyway) is that it was released two weeks after September 11, and the world wasn’t quite ready yet for that type of movie.  If it had been released at a different time, Zoolander might have been a very big hit.  Ben Stiller apparently still believes in the male fashion model parody that was Derek Zoolander, and so does Paramount Pictures, as they are moving ahead with plans for Zoolander 2.  Justin Theroux, who cowrote Tropic Thunder with Ben Stiller (and Etan Cohen), and also wrote this year’s Iron Man 2, is working on the Zoolander 2 script.  Theroux, who made his directing debut with 2007’s Dedication, is also attached to direct (and the guy is also an actor, very busy!).  Everyone involved hopes that Owen Wilson will also return as Zoolander’s rival model, Hanson, but no deal is in place yet.  The villain for the sequel is likely to be played by Jonah Hill, who is in talks for the role. Zoolander 2, however, isn’t the only new project for Stiller this week, as he is attached to star in Brett Ratner’s Tower Heist, which was formerly known as Trump Heist.  Back when the movie was expected to be like a “black Ocean’s 11,” it would have featured stars like Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker, but Tower Heist is being rewritten to better suit guys like Ben Stiller.\n\n\n#4 TRAINED MOVIE ASSASSIN ANGELINA JOLIE KILLS CHANCES OF A WANTED 2\nAnyone who’s seen Wanted knows that the idea of a sequel has always seemed sort of odd, as the movie sort of ends perfectly.  The idea of somehow shoehorning Angelina Jolie’s character for continuing assassin highjinx only adds to the incredulity of the proposed sequel. The good news, therefore, is that Angelina Jolie has definitively pulled out of the Wanted sequel, and as a response, Universal Pictures has pulled the plug on the movie.  That brings up the subject of what is next for Jolie, who is currently filming The Tourist with Johnny Depp (as anyone who’s stood in line for groceries recently knows).  It’s looking like her next project may be a Warner Bros space thriller called Gravity, which is about the last survivor of a space mission who is desperately trying to get back to Earth and her daughter.  Like this year’s overlooked (by the Oscars) indie hit Moon and the way it was all about Sam Rockwell, Gravity will be a movie that features almost entirely Angelina Jolie for the entirety of the film.  The director of Gravity is very promising, as it’s Alfonso Cuaron, who has pleased movie fans with Children of Men and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and also delivered a great road movie story with Y Tu Mama Tambien. Cuaron cowrote the Gravity script with his 28-year-old son, Jonas.\n\n\n#5 WAR OF THE GODS RECRUITS\nHollywood is slowly returning to Greek mythology, following Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief and the upcoming release of the remake of Clash of the Titans.  The next big project in that mold is War of the Gods, which will be directed by Tarsem Singh (The Fall, The Cell).  War of the Gods tells the story of Theseus, a Hercules-like hero most famous for his encounter with the Minotaur in the labyrinth, which was just one of his many adventures. Theseus will be played by the already announced Henry Cavill, one of the stars of Showtime’s The Tudors.  Joining Cavill this week is Freida Pinto, the costar of Slumdog Millionaire, who will play Phaedra, an oracle priestess.  Another casting possibility is Mickey Rourke, who would play King Hyperion, but the timing of filming is forcing Rourke to choose between War of the Gods and Conan, in which Rourke would play Corin, the barbarian warrior’s father.  War of the Gods isn’t currently attached to a distributor, but is instead being co-produced by a few different companies.  Filming of War of the Gods is scheduled to start on April 7th, 2010.\n\n\n#6 DOC SAVAGE TO BE A LETHAL WEAPON\nHollywood has been trying to bring the classic pulp hero Doc Savage back to the silver screen since the 1980s, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was being considered for the role. Now, the project seems to actually be going somewhere with the news that Lethal Weapon creator Shane Black will direct Doc Savage, following his first movie as director, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.  Black is being assisted on writing Doc Savage by the writing team of Anthony Bagarozzi and Chuck Mondry, who have no produced films to their credit, but are working on Black’s Cold Warrior, which Mel Gibson is attached to star in.  Doc Savage is a pulp hero who has appeared in novels, radio, comic books and the 1975 movie Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze.  Doc Savage is a classic renaissance man who combines physical brawn with brains, and he is helped by a diverse group of specialists.  The character has been referenced (and mostly spoofed) in things like The Venture Bros and The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension, and the classic cartoon Johnny Quest also has very similar elements to Doc Savage. \n\n\n#7 KEVIN SMITH MAKES STIFLER WANT TO HIT SOMEBODY\nLike most famous directors, Kevin Smith always has a few different movies that might be his next movie (which in his case include Ranger Danger and the Danger Rangers, the horror movie Red State and a possible Clerks 3).  This week, Smith added another project to his slateby announcing that he wants to make a hockey movie called Hit Somebody, starring his Cop Out star Seann William Scott.  Smith, displaying loyalty to his favorite sport, chose to announce this movie not via the trades, but through NHL.com. Scott has starred in many comedies in the last ten years, but he remains most closely associated with Stifler from the American Pie movies.  Kevin Smith sees Hit Somebody as Scott’s chance to graduate to a higher level as a star, comparing him to Tom Hanks, who also started off with comedies. Calling Hit Somebody “big, epic in scale,” Kevin Smith also clearly sees this hockey story, which will span 30 years, as something that will potentially stand out from his usual fare as well.\n\n\n#8 MATT DAMON TO YET AGAIN PLAY SOME DUDE FROM MASSACHUSETTS\nMatt Damon has signed with New Regency (which mostly distributes through 20th Century Fox) to star as Robert F. Kennedy in a planned biopic about the slain politician.  Damon’s deal depends, however, on his approval of the script, which will determine whether the movie ever actually gets made.  The screenwriter that has to pass Damon’s muster is Steven Knight, whose three produced movies to date are Eastern Promises, Amazing Grace and Dirty Pretty Things.  Knight is working from the RFK biography His Life by Evan Thomas.  Steven Knight is also working on adapting Dan Brown’s The Lost Symbol, the third to feature the Robert Langdon character from The Da Vinci Code. As for RFK himself, for those who aren’t familiar with him, he was of course the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, served controversially as JFK’s attorney general, was elected as a New York Senator in 1964, and ran for president himself in 1968.  The day of Kennedy’s assassination was adapted to film by Emilio Estevez in 2006 as Bobby, but Kennedy himself was not one of the central characters of the ensemble drama.\n\n\n#9 THE BROKEN LIZARD GUYS RETURN WITH ROGUE SCHOLARS\nThe Broken Lizard comedy troupe has signed with Universal Pictures to produce two movies, the first of which is called Rogue Scholars. None of the Broken Lizard guys (Jay Chandrasekhar, Kevin Hefferman, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhankse) are stars in their own right, but their five films to date include Beerfest and Super Troopers, which was also a Sundance hit, and has become something of a fan sensation. Their latest movie, The Slammin’ Salmon, was ill-received by critics (33% RT score), and did very little at the box office in December.  Universal still has faith in the guys, however, and has signed the troupe for both Rogue Scholars and an untitled movie that no details have been revealed for yet.  Rogue Scholars will revolve around five unruly professors, but part of Universal’s scheme to bring Broken Lizard to a wider audience lies in the rest of the cast.  A younger generation of comedians will be cast as the students, and older comedians will be cast as the administration. So, that three different age ranges will be represented in this very generational comedy.  \n\n\n#10 GHOST RIDER AND DEADPOOL TO GET ANIMATED\nDreamWorks Animation has announced their 3D CGI animated release for March 30, 2012, and it’s called The Croods.  Nicolas Cage and Ryan Reynolds will provide the lead voice roles in the comedy set in prehistoric caveman times.  Cage will play Grug, the leader of a caveman family, and Reynolds will play an “outsider whose new ideas challenge the patriarch’s authority.”  The story also revolves around a violent earthquake that forces Grug and his family to search for a new home, and Grug also has a daughter who falls for Reynolds’ character.  The Croods was written by Chris Sanders (cowriter of Mulan, How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (cowriter of Space Chimps), based upon a screenplay originally written by DeMicco and John Cleese (of Monty Python fame).  Chris Sanders is also directing The Croods, which marks his first solo project, after codirecting Lilo &amp; Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon.  In other animated CGI news, CHUD is reporting on an unconfirmed rumor that Pixar may have scrapped plans for Newt, their amphibian adventure, leaving its 2012 slot open for Monsters, Inc. 2 instead.\n\n\nROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK\n\n\n\n#1 THE FASTEST MOUSE IN ALL OF MEXICO GETS HIS OWN MOVIE\nNew Line Cinema has announced plans to bring the classic Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzalez to the big screen.  Voicing the energetic Mexican speedster mouse will be comedian/actor George Lopez (one guess as to what his sitcom was called).  Speedy Gonzalez is being written by Alec Cohen and Alec Sokolow, who are best known as the writing team behind the two Garfield movies. Here’s how producer Ann Lopez describes the movie version of Speedy Gonzalez, “Speedy’s going to be a misunderstood boy who comes from a family that works in a very meticulous setting, and he’s a little too fast for what they do. He makes a mess of that. So he has to go out in the world to find what he’s good at.” There’s no denying that there was a lot about the original cartoons that was borderline racist.  However, Speedy Gonzalez was still one of my favorite Looney Tunes, as those cartoons were just so energetic, with a suitably fast pace and a lot of fun.  So, I really want to be optimistic about a Speedy Gonzalez movie.  However, the involvement of the Garfield guys, and the general tone of recent CGI cartoon adaptations like Alvin and the Chipmunks makes me have to predict that this movie is probably going to disappoint a lot of Speedy’s older fans.  And that’s why it’s this week’s Rotten Idea.\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"live, sports, Mindy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Ian-McShane-sails-to-Stanger-Tides"},{"id":"47509226566394","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Sam Worthington takes on Dracula, George Lucas takes on fairies","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Sam Worthington takes on Dracula, George Lucas takes on fairiesPlus \"Weird Al\" Yankovic talks about his next movieby Greg Dean Schmitz | January 29, 2010 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features stories about new roles for Sam Worthington, Robert De Niro, Mel Gibson, Zac Efron and Miley Cyrus, as well as new movies for the director of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and musician-turned-director… “Weird Al” Yankovic!FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 SAM WORTHINGTON: TERMINATOR, JAKE SULLY, PERSEUS AND NOW… DRACULA?With Avatar now the top grossing worldwide release of all time, Sam Worthington is in talks with Universal Pictures to continue his impressive big-budget career with Dracula Year Zero, to be directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow). Unlike the Vlad movie that Brad Pitt is producing, Dracula Year Zero is more of a fantasy story that mixes elements of the real Vlad the Impaler with Bram Stoker’s Dracula character. That means you can probably expect many of the obligatory vampire aspects that we associate with Dracula, like turning into a bat or mist, though all that Proyas would confirm in 2008 was that the movie would feature “stakes and teeth… (and) …lots and lots of blood!” Dracula is, of course, one of Universal’s classic monsters, and this will be the first Universal movie to feature Dracula since 2004’s disastrous flop Van Helsing. Dracula Year Zero was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who are also working together on the Flash Gordon reboot. Sam Worthington will also next be seen in the Clash of the Titans remake, John Madden’s The Debt and Last Night, with Keira Knightley. In other Sam Worthington news, SlashFilm is reporting on a rumor that James Cameron is already signing up technical crew members for 3- to 5-year contracts to start work on (the previously reported) Avatar sequel.#2 GEORGE LUCAS TO REVEAL FAIRIES GET THEIR MAGIC FROM MIDICHLORIANS?George Lucas is venturing forth into the world of musicals with an untitled CGI animation film that is currently in preproduction at Skywalker Ranch. The only details that are currently known is that the musical involves fairies, and the music will come from a variety of sources. Kevin Munroe (TMNT and the upcoming Dead of Night) is directing from a script by David Berenbaum (Elf, The Haunted Mansion), and George Lucas is of course producing, and may have also come up with the movie’s original story idea. This CGI musical joins Lucas’ other current project that he is producing (but not directing), which is Red Tails, the story of the Tuskegee Airmen, starring Terrence Howard, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Method Man.#3 THIS WEEK IN 3D: GREMLINS 3, GHOSTBUSTERS 3, HARRY POTTER 7 &amp; 8,CLASH OF THE TITANSAlthough Avatar may have been a huge success even without it, much credit is being given to 3D for its box office records, and Hollywood is going crazy with ideas on how to make their next big movies jump on the 3D bandwagon. First up, there is the unconfirmed rumor via MarketSaw that the long-in-development Gremlins 3 project might be getting new life as a stereoscopic 3D project, as might Ghostbusters 3. In the more confirmed realm, there’s also Warner Bros, which has moved the release date of Clash of the Titans back a week to April 2 to facilitate an adaptation to 3D. The studio is also now planning on releasing the two parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in 3D when the movies are released on November 19, 2010 and July 15, 2011.#4 MEL GIBSON: FROM ROAD WARRIOR TO COLD WARRIORWith his latest film as an actor, Edge of Darkness, opening in theaters today, Mel Gibson was revealed this week to be in talks with Universal Pictures to reunite with Lethal Weapon screenwriter Shane Black on a project that Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) is directing. In Cold Warrior, Gibson would play an old-school spy who has to come out of retirement to deal with a domestic terrorism threat originating from Russia, and he has to team up with a young agent in the process. Shane Black didn’t write Cold Warrior, however, which comes from a new screenwriter named Charles Mondry. There’s no word yet on when Cold Warrior will film, but it is likely to be after this summer’s filming of How I Spent My Summer Vacation, and Gibson also has plans to direct Leonardo DiCaprio in an untitled Viking project. Before any of that, in addition to Edge of Darkness, Gibson has also already wrapped filming of The Beaver, the Jodie Foster-directed comedy about a guy whose best friend is a beaver puppet on his hand.#5 WEIRD AL’S NEXT MOVIE IS PROBABLY NOT GANDHI 2This week comedic musician and sometime actor “Weird Al” Yankovic revealed that he has signed a deal with Cartoon Network in which he agreed to provide all sorts of possible content for them, including TV series, animation and a live-action feature film, which is the first thing he’s doing. Yankovic hasn’t really revealed too many details about the movie, except that it is not a sequel to UHF, it’s a comedy and the star will be a teenager. Weird Al will make an appearance in the movie, and a big part of this story is that it’s the first time he’s going to direct a feature film (he’s directed lots of TV stuff already).#6 ROBERT DE NIRO TO REGAIN HIS CAPE FEAR ACCENT AS GEORGE WALLACE IN SELMA?In a story about Robert De Niro switching agencies, Deadline Hollywood also broke the news about two new projects (in addition to a few others that had previously been announced). The first bit of news concerns Selma, the new project from Precious director Lee Daniels about desegregation, with De Niro reportedly in line to play infamous Alabama Governor George Wallace. The other new role that is a bit unexpected is a sequel to Midnight Run, the very funny 1988 fugitive comedy with Charles Grodin, in which De Niro played a bounty hunter escorting an accountant who’s embezzled money from a Las Vegas gangster. Among De Niro’s other upcoming roles are Little Fockers (the third in the Meet the Parents series), Stone (with Edward Norton) and Robert Rodriguez’s Machete (all of which are wrapped) and a role in the awesomely-titled Another Night in Suck City.#7 ZAC EFRON PICKS UP NEW SPY AND TIME TRAVEL MOVIESZac Efron is looking to make the transition from being a teen TV sensation to being an actual grown up movie star with the news this week of two new projects. First up, at Universal there is Fire, an adaptation of a graphic novel by Brian Michael Bendis (Ultimate Spider-Man) about a college student who is recruited by the CIA, only to discover that he is being trained for a program that creates expendable field agents. Bendis is adapting his own comic. Meanwhile, at Warner Bros, Efron has signed on for an untitled time travel movie that is in the vein of Back to the Future, and which blends together a project called Algorithm with an untitled pitch.#8 OMG! MILEY AND DEMI LOLMiley Cyrus and Demi Moore are in talks to star as a daughter-mother pair in the English language remake of the 2008 hit French comedy LOL: Laughing Out Loud. Cyrus will play a 15-year-old who is dumped by her boyfriend, so she pursues his best friend, while her recently divorced mother struggles to “maintain a civil relationship with her daughter.” Lisa Azuelos, who wrote and directed the original French movie (starring Sophie Marceau) will also write and direct this English-language remake.#9 WOLVERINE DIRECTOR HEADING BACK NORTHGavin Hood, the director of Rendition and X-Men Origins: Wolverine, is in talks with Walden Media (Tooth Fairy, The Chronicles of Narnia) to direct an untitled adaptation of the non-fiction book The Cruelest Miles: The Heroic Story of Dogs and Men in a Race Against an Epidemic. The book tells the true story of the 1925 journey that is now commemorated each year by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. In 1925, 20 men and 200 dogs rushed across a 674 mile distance of wilderness to deliver an emergency shipment of diptheria antidote to Nome, Alaska, braving temperatures of minus 60 degrees. The book was adapted by Sean O’Keefe and Will Staples, who haven’t yet had a feature film produced, but did cowrite together the video games Lair and Pursuit Force. The project, which was formerly known as Ice Bound (when it was in development at the now defunct Miramax Films), is tentatively scheduled to start filming this summer.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 EAT, SLEEP, POOP, DREAM, WORKJust two weeks after Lionsgate put an adaptation of the pregnancy self help book What to Expect When You’re Expecting into development, DreamWorks has also stepped in with a similar project. They’ve picked up the rights to Eat, Sleep, Poop: A Common Sense Guide to Your Baby’s First Year by Beverly Hills pediatrician Scott W. Cohen, which will be first published on March 30, 2010. Eat, Sleep, Poop is being adapted as a comedy by screenwriters Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson (cowriters of Four Christmases). This story gets the Rotten Idea tag for the same reason that What to Expect When You’re Expecting did, which is that non-fiction self help books don’t seem like the best source for movie material, since there is no inherent story in them other than a loose concept and a catchy title.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"YouTube, CNN, mockumentary, critic, Musicals, Rocketman, name, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Sam-Worthington-takes-on-Dracula-George-Lucas-takes-on-fairies"},{"id":"47509228181249","title":"Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron Plans a Fantastic Voyage","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: James Cameron Plans a Fantastic VoyagePlus disturbing rumors about Spider-Man 4by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 11, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes a remake of Fantastic Planet, a crazy Spider-Man 4 rumor, new roles for Natalie Portman, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston and yet more movies riding the coattails of The Twilight Saga.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 JAMES CAMERON PRODUCING MUCH SMALLER MOVIE THAN AVATAR: A REMAKE OF FANTASTIC VOYAGEAlthough he hasn’t picked his next movie as director (it may be either Battle Angel or an Avatar sequel), James Cameron did announce this week that he will be producing a remake of the 1966 science fiction adventure Fantastic Voyage. He’ll be producing for 20th Century Fox, who has had this planned for a long time. Fantastic Voyage told the story of a team of scientists who are shrunk down to microscopic size and sent into a tiny submarine into the body of a dying scientist. The movie was also adapted as a novel by Isaac Asimov (making many people, including myself, think that it was actually an Asimov story first). Although Cameron won’t be directing Fantastic Voyage himself, he’s on board as a producer so that Fox can take advantage of Lightstorm Entertainment’s new technology (created for Avatar) to create the “world” of the inside of a guy’s body. The Fantastic Voyage remake was written by Shane Salerno (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem; cowriter of Armageddon).#2 JOSH BROLIN PUTTING ON TOMMY LEE JONES’ SUIT IN MEN IN BLACK 3?The Los Angeles Times is reporting that Josh Brolin is being considered for a role in Men in Black 3. He’d be playing the young version of Tommy Lee Jones’ Agent J when Will Smith’s Agent K character travels back in time. It’s not yet known if Tommy Lee Jones will be returning, or if Brolin will completely be his replacement as the character. Sony hopes to get Men in Black 3 in production in 2010, filming at least partly in New York, with Barry Sonnenfeld (the director of the first two movies) in talks to direct from a script by Etan Cohen (cowriter of Tropic Thunder, Idiocracy).#3 PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES AND NATALIENatalie Portman has signed on to star as Elizabeth Bennet in Lionsgate’s adaptation of the popular mash-up novel Pride and Prejudice and Zombies by Seth Grahame-Smith (and Jane Austen, sort of). The concept of the book is that Grahame-Smith took Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice and then added his own material to the book, so that Austen’s mannerly romantic novel because a book about zombie hunting (and still some romance as well). The same publisher (Quirk Books) recently followed it up with Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters. Although this new sub-genre runs the risk of inspiring tons of really awful imitators, for now, I’m staying hopeful. Natalie Portman will also be producing the project, which doesn’t yet have a screenwriter or director.#4 YOU’VE JUST KILLED A BUNCH OF VILLAINS, DEADPOOL. WHAT’S NEXT? I’M GOING TO ZOMBIELAND!Although this hasn’t been published in the trades yet, this story from CHUD sounds legitimate, and so I’m running with it. The site is reporting that the writers that 20th Century Fox has found for their highly-anticipated (by comics fans, at least) Deadpool movie are none other than Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, AKA the guys behind this year’s comedy hit Zombieland. Although I didn’t think Zombieland was a perfect movie, it was certainly a lot of fun, and it’s quite easy to see the connection in tongue-in-cheek tone between Zombieland and Deadpool. For those unfamiliar with the character, the “Merc with a Mouth” specializes in over-the-top assassinations of minor Marvel Comics characters, accentuated by frequent comments “through the fourth wall,” directly to the reader. In movie form, this has the potential of feeling like a superhero version of Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, and so Deadpool has the potential to be quite awesome. If CHUD’s story pans out, it sounds like 20th Century Fox may have found the right guys for the job.#5 ADAM SANDLER AND JENNIFER ANISTON PLAYING PRETENDColumbia Pictures is in talks with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston to star in Pretend Wife, a romantic comedy previously known as Holiday in Hawaii. The premise of the story is unknown, but it appears to possibly involve a honeymoon in Hawaii for a couple that’s only pretending to be married (just guessing, based on the two titles). The top contender to direct is Dennis Dugan, who has worked with Sandler several times before (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, You Don’t Mess with the Zohan). Sandler’s Happy Madison is also producing, and the script is by Allan Loeb (cowriter of 21) and Tim Dowling (cowriter of Role Models). Columbia is hoping to start filming in early 2010 and is eyeing a pre-Valentine’s Day release date of February 11, 2011.#6 DIRECTOR SAM MENDES GOES BUFFALO HUNTING AT BUTCHER’S CROSSINGWhile The Road is depressing audiences across the country, the film’s writer, Joe Penhall, is taking advantage of the its current buzz to find his next project. Next up for Penhall is Butcher’s Crossing, a Western with a premise that sounds a bit like Heaven’s Gate (which was Michael Cimino’s legendary bomb blamed for ending the 1970s run of Hollywood by auteur directors). The similarity is that Butcher’s Crossing is about a young man who drops out of Harvard to pursue his dream of heading West, which takes him to a small Kansas town where he joins the search for a large buffalo herd. Butcher’s Crossing, which is based upon a 1960 novel by John Williams (not the composer) is being developed by Focus Features, who are hoping that Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) will direct.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#4 TWILIGHT STUDIO TAKES ON THE ORIGINAL YOUNG VAMPIRESummit Entertainment is continuing to look for ways to stretch out the audience for its Twilight Saga franchise, and now that includes going all the way back to the guy that started it all. Along with Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment, Summit is developing Vlad, a script by actor Charlie Hunnam (Nicholas Nickleby) about Vlad the Impaler, the Transylvanian prince that inspired the story of Count Dracula, focusing on his ascent to his land’s throne as a young man. Although there’s little evidence that Vlad the Impaler was actually a vampire, he did build a nasty reputation as someone who came up with particularly gruesome ways of torturing and executing people. Anthony Mandler, a music video director, is in talks to direct. Interest in Mandler is based on Summit’s executives being impressed with a reel of his past work (which includes 10 Rhianna videos). This story is a Rotten Idea because although it might be cool to see Hollywood tackling Vlad the Impaler, the obvious connection to The Twilight Saga suggests that this is likely to be the sort of teen-girl-friendly glossing over of his legend that isn’t exactly what most of us were expecting from a Vlad movie.#3 THE MASTER OF THE TEEN DANCE MOVIE IS SKIPPING ROPEDuane Adler, the screenwriter for Step Up and Save the Last Dance, is now working on Jump Around, a teen dance drama that will address the exciting world of competitive high school jump roping. Yes, as in the childhood pasttime of skipping rope. And this time around, Adler will also be directing. Seriously, Hollywood, you make my job of coming up with fake stories for April Fools’ Day harder every year! The script is about a group of teenagers who form a “Double-Dutch jump roping team,” at their high school to compete in an international competition. There’s no word yet on when the independent production will start filming.#2 DISNEY BETTING ON FALLEN ANGELSJust as the young adult book market has been following the Twilight model for a few years, Hollywood is now also trying to copy that franchise’s success by optioning as many of those subsequent series as possible. The latest example is Disney, which has optioned rights to Fallen, a book by Lauren Kate that was published this week and is part of a planned four-book series. Fallen tells the story of a teenage girl who finds herself torn between “two charismatic young men, unaware that they are fallen angels who have battled over her for centuries.” In other words, instead of immortal vampires and werewolves, this girl’s love interests just hew closer to a more family-friendly Christian/Biblical mythology. Now that angels are taken, I can’t wait to see what mythological characters get pegged into the format next. I’m still betting on Smurfs.#1 WILL SPIDER-MAN 4 TOTALLY CHANGE ONE OF PETE’S CLASSIC LOVE INTERESTS?Okay, right up front, this writer wants to let you know that he thinks this story is total bunk. However, it involves Spider-Man 4, and so I can’t really ignore it either. Movieline is reporting that John Malkovich is in talks to costar in Spider-Man 4 as the Vulture, one of Spidey’s original villains (debuting all the way back in The Amazing Spider-Man #2 in 1963). Okay, that right there is not the ridiculous part, and Malkovich could indeed be a pretty great choice to play the Vulture. No, the really strange part of the story is that the magazine is reporting that the character of Felicia Hardy, who Anne Hathaway is the top choice to play, won’t be the Black Cat as she’s always been in the comics. Nope, they’re saying that instead she will be a completely new character, made up just for the movies, called the Vulturess, who is obviously some sort of sidekick for the Vulture. The article caps it by saying that the Lizard won’t be in the movie at all, because the “suits” don’t want an odd-looking enemy, preferring villains whose faces you can see (the Vulture doesn’t wear a mask). Okay, I know Sam Raimi didn’t do a great job with Spider-Man 3, but I really can’t see this being the route he’d go with Spider-Man 4. Why completely change Felicia Hardy into being a different villain rather than just introduce a new character for the role? And why create a goofy-sounding character like the Vulturess at all? I think someone seriously yanked Movieline’s chain on this one, but I’d also be remiss if I didn’t report on it, even if I think it’s totally fake. And if it’s not fake, expect Spider-Man 4 to quickly become the most fan-mocked superhero movie since Catwoman.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Channel, Bowl, batman, casting, Exclusive, Schedule, cooking, of, medical","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-James-Cameron-Plans-a-Fantastic-Voyage"},{"id":"47509228201738","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Threequels for Kill Bill, Transformers","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Threequels for Kill Bill, TransformersPlus, Fox teams with EA to evolve Spore into a filmby Greg Dean Schmitz | October 2, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes new movies for Leonardo DiCaprio and Hugh Jackman, sequel news for Kill Bill and Transformers, two CGI animated movies about the weird twists and turns of evolution and a surprising amount of news of English language remakes of foreign movies most of us didn’t see (and one that a lot of us did, and loved).FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 QUENTIN TARANTINO CONFIRMS HIS PLANS TO KILL BILL ONE MORE TIME… IN 2014Entertainment Weekly reports that while talking to an Italian television show, director Quentin Tarantino confirmed that he plans to revist Uma Thurman’s character in Kill Bill 3. Tarantino wants to have a ten year gap between the release of Kill Bill 2 and Kill Bill 3 (some sites are mentioning a rumored title of Kill the Bride), and that would put the release some time in 2014. That would still give QT time to make another movie before then. In 2014, Uma Thurman will have aged to 44, and her daughter from the first two movies will have aged as well. There are several rumors about what exactly the third movie’s plot could be about, most of which involve characters from the first two movies getting revenge against The Bride for the violence she inflicted on their lives.#2 THE MILLIONS OF WORLDS OF SPORE CRAFT20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios are teaming up with Electronic Arts to adapt their hit 2008 PC game Spore. The film would be a CGI animated “creature feature” directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots). This news comes just a week after Wedge was also announced as director of another new movie for Fox and Blue Sky, and adaptation of the children’s book Leaf Men. In Spore, players create and evolve life, beginning at a a microscopic level and eventually evolving into the dominant race of a planet, and ultimately exploring space and interacting with races created by other players. The game designer of Spore was Will Wright, famous for his work in creating previous “world building” games under the Sim brand, including SimCity, SimEarth and of course, The Sims. EA already has some 100 million unique creatures created by players registered in their database. In addition to the original PC game, Electronic Arts has also extended the growing franchise to other platforms. The job of adapting Spore, which does not have anything resembling a single storyline is going to screenwriters Greg Erb (cowriter of Senseless, RocketMan) and Jason Oremland, who are also two of the writers of this December’s Disney release The Princess and the Frog.#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO PLAY TRAVIS MCGEE IN THE DEEP BLUE GOODBYE20th Century Fox is developing an adaptation of the 1964 mystery novel The Deep Blue Goodbye by John D. MacDonald, with Leonardo DiCaprio attached to star. DiCaprio would play Travis McGee, a character that went on to appear in 21 novels, each with a title featuring a color. McGee is “a self-described beach bum who lives aboard the 52-foot houseboat The Busted Flush, and alleviates his cash flow problems by hiring on as a salvage consultant… recover(ing) property for clients, taking a hefty percentage and getting into a lot of danger and romance in sun-drenched Florida.” The script was adapted by Dana Stevens (City of Angels, For the Love of the Game), and is currently out for consideration by several directors. DiCaprio will also be producing via his Appian Way company, and if The Deep Blue Goodbye is a hit, with 20 other books in the series, the star could find a reliable source of movies for the foreseeable future.#4 WARNER BROS THINKS THE FUTURE IS WILDWarner Bros has struck a deal with Vanguard Animation (Space Chimps, Happily N’Ever After) to produce a movie version of the Animal Planet documentary-style animated series, The Future Is Wild. The series speculates on how life might evolve on Earth over the next 200 million years. As climate changes and the continents move, many of today’s dominant animals, such as mammals, birds and reptiles eventually go extinct, leading to a future where descendants of squids and octopi come to land to become the new dominant races, along with evolved worms and insects. This deal is especially timely considering that the concept bears a resemblance to the mix of animation and evolution in the plans for a movie based upon Spore, also announced this week. The timing also fits in with the news that a second season of The Future Is Wild will be announced next week. The exact details of how The Future Is Wild will be adapted are not yet known, but the phrasing of the announcement seems to suggest that the movie will keep the series’ documentary-like style, rather than say, a dramatic interpretation of the material. The often bizarre evolutionary concepts in The Future Is Wild bear a close resemblance to the works of author Dougal Dixon, who also wrote the companion book, and whose own book, After Man: A Zoology of the Future, was at time being developed as a feature film of its own (but those plans have long since been scrapped).#5 THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE AND FRIENDS CHUGGING BACK TO THE BIG SCREENAlthough his 2000 film debut, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, was not a commercial success, the popular children’s book and televison character Thomas the Tank Engine is once again being developed as a feature film project. Thomas the Tank Engine is, of course, an anthromorphic steam locomotive train who has several friends who are also trains, and together they have adventures on the rails. Josh Klausner (next April’s Date Night, one twelve credit screenwriters for Shrek the Third) has been hired to start work on adapting Thomas &amp; Friends for the big screen. 2010 marks the 65th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, and that year will also see the launch of a new CGI animated TV series that will provide voices for several characters that were previously mute. That series will then lead to the release of this feature film, scheduled for the spring of 2011. Alec Baldwin, who narrated many episodes of the original series, and appeared in the 2000 film, will not be involved with this version.#6 SAM RAIMI MAKING SPOOKY PICTURES FOR THE KIDSJust a few weeks after Guillermo del Toro announced plans for his Double Dare You partnership with Disney, Sam Raimi is also getting into the game of producing scary movies aimed at family audiences. Raimi’s Spooky Pictures is a subsidiary of his Ghost House horror label, and has a deal with Columbia Pictures. Spooky Pictures will get started with The Substitute, an English language remake of a 2007 Danish thriller about a sixth grade class who try to warn their parents that their new substitute teacher is actually an evil alien. Director Scott Derrickson (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) has started work on adapting the screenplay along with Paul Harris Boardman, who previously cowrote The Exorcism of Emily Rose and Urban Legends: Final Cut with Derrickson.#7 500 DAYS OF SUMMER DIRECTOR AND COSTAR BOTH MOVING ON TO ADAPTING FOREIGN MOVIESOne of this year’s biggest arthouse hits was the romantic dramedy 500 Days of Summer, and now both the movie’s director and one of its costars are moving on to projects in which they will be tackling English language remakes of recent European movies. Director Mark Webb (who is also developing a Jesus Christ Superstar movie) is in negotiations to produce and direct Just Another Love Story, a remake of a 2008 Danish thriller about a crime photographer who pretends to be the boyfriend of a woman suffering amnesia, which goes terribly wrong when the real boyfriend shows up, and he’s distinctly not pleased. And then there’s young 12-year-old Chloe Moretz, who in addition to playing the sister in 500 Days of Summer, also stars in next year’s dark superhero movie Kick-Ass. Moretz has this week landed the lead role in Let Me In, the English language remake of last year’s arthouse hit Let the Right One In, which starts filming later this fall in New Mexico. Chloe Moretz will be joined by Kodi Smit-McPhee (The Road), who will play the lead boy, and Richard Jenkins (The Visitor, HBO’s Six Feet Under), who will play her character’s adult guardian (sort of).ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK#1 MICHAEL BAY ANNOUNCES TRANSFORMERS 3 FOR THE SUMMER OF 2011Director Michael Bay announced on his website this week that development of Transformers 3 formally started this week, with the Paramount targeting a release date of July 1, 2011. Both Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox (in spite of her recent complaints around Revenge of the Fallen) are both expected to return. Screenwriter Ehren Kruger (The Ring; cowriter of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and Michael Bay met with Hasbro this week to discuss which new Transformers the toy company would like to see introduced in the next movie. That is, after all, what is most important to telling a Transformers movie’s story: what toys can the movie sell? Michael Bay also promised that his “little movie,” Pain and Gain, about two Florida body builders who get involved with extortion and kidnapping, will be his next project after Transformers 3. This news is therefore bad news for anyone who was awaiting Bad Boys 3 or Bay’s X-Men-like teen literature adapation I Am Number Four. If you figure a possible 2012 release for Pain and Gain, that means that any other Michael Bay movie is unlikely to happen before 2013, and that’s presuming that Bay doesn’t in the meantime sign on for Transformers 4. All of this news gets the “Rotten Idea” tag because Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was pretty awful, regardless of how much money it made. But, the rosy side of the news for those who dread any news of a Michael Bay movie is that this means a few more years of Bay not being able to direct any other movie, such as whatever favorite potentially big budget genre movie you as a fan might in particular cherish.#2 LAUREN CONRAD’S BOOK ABOUT A REALITY TV STAR TO BECOME AN ACTUAL MOVIE?Temple Hill Entertainment, the production company of one of the producers of Twilight has secured the movie rights to L.A. Candy, the recent bestselling novel by Lauren Conrad, the star of MTV’s “reality” shows The Hills and Laguna Beach. In L.A. Candy, a 19 year old girl moves to Hollywood where she finds fame as a “reality” series star, forcing her to deal with being a big star. Conrad has plans to follow L.A. Candy with two more novels. The project is currently looking for a screenwriter to adapt the book. This one is a Rotten Idea for what I think are pretty obvious reasons. MTV’s “reality” shows obviously have good ratings, so someone is watching them, but the idea of a movie based upon what is basically a fictionalization of the experience of one of the stars of one of these shows is basically opening the Pandora’s Box on all sorts of potential cross pollination between reality shows and movies. Will people pay $10 to see what is basically a dramatized two hour episode of a reality show that they can already watch on TV for free? And even if they actually would, should they?#3 HUGH JACKMAN TO ROCK ‘EM SOCK ‘EM ROBOTS IN REAL STEELHugh Jackman is in talks with DreamWorks to star in Real Steel, a futuristic sports movie set in a time when robots have replaced human fighters in the ring. Jackman would be playing a human ex-boxer who becomes a Robot Boxing promoter who finds a discarded robot that always seems to win. Jackman’s character also discovers he has a 13-year-old son that he bonds with as the scrappy robot fights his way to the top. Real Steel is based upon a short story by Richard Matheson (I Am Legend, What Dreams May Come) that was also the inspiration for an episode from the 5th season of The Twilight Zone, starring Lee Marvin as the ex-boxer. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen) will be directing Real Steel from a script he is working on with screenwriter John Gatins (Hardball; cowriter of Coach Carter). DreamWorks hopes to start filming in May, 2010. Real Steel is one of this week’s Rotten Ideas because the box office seems to be mostly saying that audiences do not have an instant love with big screen robots, and the saccharine sweetness of this sports story just seems to put it over the top as a likely schmaltzy movie that might feel like Bicentennial Man crossed with Rocky V.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"SXSW, CMT, dramedy, FX, Kimmy, Vudu, live, Fresh","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Threequels-for-Kill-Bill-Transformers"},{"id":"47509228187396","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Idris Elba cast in Thor, more Spider-Man 4 rumors","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Idris Elba cast in Thor, more Spider-Man 4 rumorsPlus, Brian Cox may get cast in The Hobbitby Greg Dean Schmitz | November 21, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup includes casting news and rumors for Thor, Spider-Man 4, The Hobbit and Guardians of Ga’hoole, new sequels in the Jackass and Underworld franchises and potential new movies for Brad Pitt and Eddie Murphy.FRESH DEVELOPMENTS#1 THOR FINALLY FINDS HIS WARRIORS THREEDirector Kenneth Branagh has lined up four of the remaining roles in Thor, and three of them make up classic comic book trio: the Warriors Three. Branagh’s choices, however, are not without potential controversy. Let’s start with the least controversial, which is pretty boy Stuart Townsend as pretty boy swashbuckler type, Fandral. Then, there’s the role of Volstagg, which undoubtedly had every chubby actor in Hollywood calling his agent, hoping to get a reading (Chris Farley would have had to gain some weight to portray Volstagg the way he’s drawn in the comics). But nope, instead, Branagh went with the decidedly non-obese Ray Stevenson (Punisher: War Zone, and Titus Pollo from HBO’s Rome). So, will Stevenson be wearing a massive fat suit like Kevin Durand did as the Blob in X-Men Origins: Wolverine? Finally, there is Hogun the Grim, who will be played by Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano. Asano would seem like an odd choice to be playing a god in a movie about Norse mythology, but Stan Lee, way back in the early 1960s, was apparently thinking ahead, because there is a loophole here, in that Hogun is not a member of the Aesir (the race of gods that everyone else in Thor belongs to). So, if Hogun isn’t an Aesir, he can be played by… basically anyone (and Hogun does indeed look sort of Asian-ish in the comics). That, however, doesn’t explain the other casting news this week, which is who will be playing Heimdall, the guardian of the rainbow bridge that leads into Asgard, and who (if we’re sticking to the Hogun argument) is indeed a member of the Aesir. Heimdall will be played by Idris Elba, the African-American actor who is best known for costarring in HBO’s The Wire. Perhaps the thinking with casting Elba as Heimdall is that he spends most of his time wearing a massive helmet covering his face, so his race doesn’t really matter. Although that argument is sort of a slippery slope, as it could lead to Robert Downey Jr. losing his job on Iron Man 3, right?#2 THIS WEEK IN SPIDER-MAN 4 CASTING RUMORSLast week, it was reported that Rachel McAdams was a top contender for the role of Black Cat (AKA Felicia Hardy) in Spider-Man 4. That didn’t mean she had actually landed the role, but Entertainment Weekly apparently didn’t get the memo, so they went to the actress to ask if she had been cast, and she said she hadn’t. I suppose it’s more fun to shoot down a rumor that doesn’t exist, rather than to try to dig up some new facts. I don’t know if either of the following are hard facts, but here we go, as McAdams is not the only name being bandied about to play Hardy this week. First up, UGO reported that Julia Stiles had met for the role, and then Deadline.com reported the same about Anne Hathaway. While all this is going on, there’s another completely different casting call for the movie going on, which is the search for a 2-3 year old boy with red hair. The hot speculation is that the toddler could be playing a potential baby boy for Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, but really, couldn’t Mary Jane just as likely have a little nephew or something in the movie? They better just not ask Rachel McAdams to babysit.#3 ELROND, FARAMIR, BARBOSSA AND DAMIEN WILL BE GUARDIANS OF GA’HOOLEDirector Zach Snyder’s next movie after Watchmen is the CGI animated adventure Guardians of Ga’hoole (scheduled for 9/24/10), and the voice cast now appears to be firmed up. And it’s got an impressive number of actors known for roles in genre movies that Snyder is probably a fan of. The latest additions are Sam Neill (Jurassic Park), Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean), Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, Lord of the Rings) and David Wenham (Lord of the Rings), and they join a cast that includes Helen Mirren (The Queen), Emilie de Ravin (LOST), Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) and Abbie Cornish, who will also be costarring in Snyder’s next film after this, Sucker Punch. Guardians of Ga’hoole is an adaptation of a series of children’s fantasy novels about heroic owls who are involved in an epic battle for control of their forest.#4 MIGHT BRIAN COX SOON BE SPORTING A +5 BEARD?This one is just a rumor for now, but it’s also concerning Guillermo del Toro’s two-movie adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, so (as with Spidey’s girlfriends) even rumors get noted here. This week’s AICN Down Under report has heard that casting is starting to get underway for the many actors that will be needed to portray the 13 dwarves that accompany Bilbo Baggins on his adventures. The top contender is… Brian Cox, the prolific Scottish actor whose many film roles include Agamemnon in Troy, Stryker in X2: X-Men United and Jason Bourne’s ex-boss in The Bourne Identity (and he was also great in HBO’s Deadwood). AICN doesn’t know exactly what role Cox is up for, but he seems a likely choice to be playing Thorin Oakenshield, the leader of the company of dwarves. There had been speculation at one point that John Rhys-Davies, who played the dwarf Gimli, might return to play a dwarf in The Hobbit as well, but recently Rhys-Davies has stood by his promise after wrapping Lord of the Rings that he would never play a dwarf again, as the makeup played havoc with his skin (which you can see in the DVD extras, as his face got all red and swollen and generally painful looking).#5 JACKASS 3-D: FULL ON RIGHT IN YOUR FACEParamount Pictures has updated their slate for 2010, and one of the new titles pretty much says it all: Jackass 3-D. That’s right, Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera and the rest of the wacky Jackass crew are coming to your local theater once again, and this time it’ll be in 3-D. Filming starts in January, 2010 at locations around the world, including Finland, Mongolia and South Africa. That’s pretty much all that is known right now.#6 BRAD PITT WANTS TO TAKE YOU INTO A DARK VOIDBrad Pitt’s Plan B production company has signed a deal to develop a movie based upon the upcoming video game Dark Void, which comes out in January, 2010 on various platforms (and yet Variety calls it a “computer game”). The story of Dark Void follows a pilot who crashes in the Bermuda Triangle and finds himself in a parallel world where aliens with superior technology have taken over Earth, and then he has to, you know, shoot at and blow up bad guys. Dark Void is being seen as a starring vehicle for Pitt, as well as a potential franchise, although one would expect that the possibility of multiple movies probably would depend upon whether the game itself is popular enough to warrant sequels.#7 JERRY BRUCKHEIMER JOINS THE ALIEN LEGIONJerry Bruckheimer is producing an adaptation of the 1980s comic book series Alien Legion for Disney. It’s currently being rewritten by Derek Haas and Michael Brandt, the writing team responsible for cowriting Wanted, 3:10 to Yuma and next summer’s The A-Team. Alien Legion was published by Epic Comics, a creator-owned imprint of Marvel Comics, and followed the adventures of a group of intergalactic soldiers from many different alien species who operated as a sort of outer space version of the French Foreign Legion. Alien Legion is unusual for Jerry Bruckheimer, who has traditionally not ventured into true science fiction very often (not counting stuff like Armageddon). For Disney, meanwhile, Alien Legion fits right into the studio’s current efforts to do exactly that, with the studio currently in production of both John Carter of Mars and Tron: Legacy.#8 EDDIE MURPHY MAY GO ON THE MISADVENTURES OF FLUFFYOne of the things that critics often opine about when reviewing Eddie Murphy’s latest crappy kids’ movie is that they wish he would return to the “blue” material that got his career started, back when he was the hottest thing in Hollywood. Well, here’s a possibility. Eddie Murphy is attached to produce (and possibly star in) a R-rated comedy for Paramount Pictures called The Misadventures of Fluffy, which is described as being a talking animals “road trip” movie through the streets of New York that also has “an element of social comedy reminscent of Murphy’s 1980’s hit Trading Places.” The Misadventures of Fluffy doesn’t currently have a director, and the script (which was sold on spec) is by newcomers Sam Pitman and Adam Cole-Kelly. So, is the world ready for an Eddie Murphy talking animals movie that is NOT suitable for minors?#9 JENNY TO PLAY WINNIEJennifer Hudson (Dreamgirls) has signed to star in Winnie, a drama about the life of Winnie Mandela, the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela. Based upon the biography Winnie Mandela: A Life the film will depict Mandela as both a wife who was a steadfast supporter of her activist husband during his years in prison, her later association with a bodyguard who tortured and murdered a 14-year-old, and her 2003 conviction of fraud. Winnie will be directed by Darrell Roodt, whose 2004 film Yesterday was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category, and who also directed the 2004 direct-to-video horror sequel Dracula 3000. Production is scheduled to start on May 30, 2010 in South Africa at locations in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Transkei and Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was a prisoner for 18 years.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK#1 UNDERWORLD 4: VIC MACKEY VS GOTH VAMPIRES AND THEIR SCRUFFY WEREWOLF PALSScreen Gems is starting development on a fourth movie in their Underworld franchise by hiring writer John Hlavin, who has no feature films to his credit, but he did write two episodes of The Shield. Neither Kate Beckinsale, who starred in the first two movies, or Rhona Mitra, who starred in the third, have signed on for a fourth movie, and there’s no director yet either. The details of the story this time around are currently being kept secret, but what writer Hlavin has revealed is that it’s not a prequel (like the third film in the series). As for what else the movie might entail, that’s anyone’s guess, but my hunch is that the nights will be awfully well-lit, and that nearly everyone will wear black. Oh, and werewolves will probably fight vampires. This one is a Rotten Idea just based upon the RT averages of the first three movies (30%, 12% and 32%).For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"finale, Shudder, what, romance","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Idris-Elba-cast-in-Thor-more-SpiderMan-4-rumors"},{"id":"47509230583577","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Conan Gets a New Austrian Bodybuilder","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Conan Gets a New Austrian BodybuilderPlus Tom and JJ return for another Mission: Impossibleby Greg Dean Schmitz | June 19, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup brings you the usual news about sequels (James Bond, Mission: Impossible) and remakes (Conan, Bride of Frankenstein, Meatballs) as well as a refreshing number of original concepts, including news about fan favorite directors Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler), John Carpenter (The Thing) and Andrew Stanton (WALL-E).#1 THE NEW CONAN HAS BEEN FOUND, AND HE’S A LOT LIKE THE OLD ONELionsgate and Nu Image/Millennium have apparently settled upon their choice for the star of the new Conan movie, and he bears a lot of similarities to the original movie Conan, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Roland Kickinger is a 41 year old Austrian bodybuilder-turned-actor, whereas Arnold Schwarzenegger was a 35 year old Austrian bodybuilder-turned-actor when he starred in 1982’s Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in the first three Terminator movies, and Roland Kickinger played a T-800 robot in Terminator: Salvation. Also, Roland Kickinger actually played Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 2005 A&amp;E made-for-cable biopic See Arnold Run. The casting of Roland Kickinger seems to be an attempt to hew as closely to Schwarzenegger’s films as possible. Hopefully this reboot will attempt to bring in more elements of the awesome sword &amp; sorcery lore and mythology of Robert E. Howard’s original stories (though many fans feel the movies were quite unfaithful to Howard’s stories). Filming of Conan begins in the fall of 2009 in Bulgaria, and will be directed by Marcus Nispel (the remakes of Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) from a script by Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer (cowriters of Sahara and A Sound of Thunder). The Hollywood Reporter ends their article with a zinger that I have to repeat: “No word on whether Arnold will make a cameo — or on whether Kickinger will run for governor.”#2 FROM GAMBIT TO JOHN CARTER OF MARSBefore casting the live action adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter of Mars novels, someone at Walt Disney Pictures apparently had just seen X-Men Origins: Wolverine, as the studio has cast Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins (that movie’s Gambit and Silver Fox) as John Carter, the title character of the franchise and Dejah Thoris, the title character of the first novel, Princess of Mars. John Carter of Mars is the story of a Civil War veteran who finds himself mysteriously teleported to Mars, where the lower gravity makes him a superman of sorts, capable of great strength and heroic leaps into the air. Carter quickly finds himself a pivotal player in the wars between the various races, allying himself with Dejah Thoris, the princess of the city state of Helium and with Tars Tarkas, a fierce green-skinned, four-armed insectoid warrior. TThomas Haden Church (Sideways, Spider-Man 3) also revealed this week that he has been cast in John Carter of Mars in an unknown role. John Carter of Mars is the live action debut of director Andrew Stanton, who has helmed six of Pixar’s most popular movies, including Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Filming will start in November, 2009 and last until July, 2009 (at nine months, that’s quite a long shoot) and will happen at various locations in Utah, a state that has has provided the exotic desert settings for movies like Planet of the Apes and the latest Star Trek (it posed as Spock’s home world of Vulcan). It’s interesing to know that as Burroughs wrote the John Carter books, the inhabitants of Mars did not wear any clothing except for the odd bits of jewelry. Somehow, I don’t think Disney is going to give us a big fantasy epic showcasing thousands of naked guys and gals running around in the desert (though maybe that will happen in the inevitable porn knock off, John Holmes of Mars).#3 JAMES BOND ONLY LIVES TWENTY-THRICEMGM and EON Productions have hired three writers to work on the 23rd entry in the James Bond franchise. The film (as yet unnamed) will be the third movie featuing Daniel Craig as the legendary British spy. Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon) will be working with the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who also cowrote the two previous Daniel Craig Bond films, as well as Die Another Day, The World is Not Enough and the spy spoof Johnny English. There are no details on the plot yet, but there is a rumor about the villian, although the source is a British tabloid (which makes it highly questionable). According to The Daily Express, Michael Sheen, who starred Frost/Nixon and The Queen, is being considered as one of 007’s most classic villains, Ernst Blofeld (the head of the evil SPECTRE organization). Blofeld appeared in six classic James Bond films, and was portrayed by four different actors. Blofeld is also famous for being the obvious inspiration for Mike Myers’ Dr. Evil character in the Austin Powers franchise (in particular, Donald Pleasance’s performance in 1967’s You Only Live Twice). On the other hand, the Blofeld rumor could be completely untrue, and the Sheen rumor just based on Peter Morgan’s involvement. MGM is hoping to have the script written and the movie produced in time for a 2011 release.#4 TOM CRUISE AND J.J. ABRAMS TAKING ON ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE MISSIONTom Cruise and Star Trek director J.J. Abrams have agreed to co-produce a fourth entry in their Mission: Impossible franchise for Paramount Pictures, and they’re aiming for a 2011 release. Although 2006’s Mission: Impossible III (directed by Abrams) earned $134 million, it was considered a disappointment relative to the first two movies. That disappointment was cited as part of the reason that Paramount ended their 14 year partnership with Cruise. 2011 is the target year for Star Trek 2, which J.J. Abrams will direct, so it’s unlikely that he’ll be directing M:I IV. There is no writer attached yet, and as such, no word on what the premise this time around might be. The plans to revive Mission: Impossible are apparently due to Viacom chief Sumner Redstone’s interest in repairing his relationship with Tom Cruise, whom he now calls “a great actor and a good friend.”#5 HERE COMES THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEINUniversal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment are in talks with Neil Burger (The Illusionist, Interview with the Assassin) to write and direct their long-in-development remake of the classic 1935 monster movie Bride of Frankenstein. Although 1931’s Frankenstein has been remade several times (since Mary Shelley’s book is in the public domain), Bride of Frankenstein was only remade once, as 1985’s The Bride, starring Jennifer Beals and Sting. In James Whale’s original film (which many, including me, consider superior to Frankenstein), the Monster convinces the retired Dr. Frankenstein to create a female mate who ultimately rejects the Monster’s advances, leading to a disastrous ending. Previous attempts by Universal to remake Bride of Frankenstein had a modern setting, but there’s no word yet as to what Burger’s setting or take will be. Bride of Frankenstein is just one of several projects at Universal trying to revive old monster franchises, in addition to this fall’s The Wolf Man, and revivals of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon.#6 HAPPY TRAILS FOR THE KING OF THE COWBOYS821 Entertainment, a Nashville-based production company (that includes “redneck/hillbilly comedy” in its list of target genres), has acquired the film rights to all intellectual properties of the Roy Rogers Family, announcing plans for a “King of the Cowboys” film trilogy. In an unusual twist, the “characters” of Roy Rogers, his wife and partner Dale Evans and Rogers’ trusty steed Trigger will star in the King of the Cowboys movies, which will not be biopics, or traditional cowboy Westerns, but instead belong to the “family fantasy adventure” genre. Variety describes Roy Rogers as the “top Western box office star from 1943-1954,” who starred in “more than 88 films with Evans and Trigger; produced and starred in 100 episodes of his own TV show; and appeared on more than 400 licensed items, with 120 million comic books sold.” So, who does the RT community think would be a good choice to star as the new Roy Rogers and Dale Evans?#7 NATALIE PORTMAN TO DANCE FOR ARONOFSKY IN BLACK SWANNatalie Portman is now attached to star in Black Swan, a supernatural thriller being developed by director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream). Black Swan started as a project at Universal Pictures, but was put into turnaround before the success of The Wrestler (d’oh!), so Aronofsky’s Protozoa Pictures is now shopping Black Swan to other distributors. In Black Swan, Portman would play a veteran New York City ballet dancer who finds herself locked into an increasingly competitive situation with a rival dancer. Leading up to a big performance, she starts to wonder if the other dancer is actually a “supernatural apparition” or perhaps just a figment of her imagination. Mark Heyman, coproducer of The Wrestler, has rewritten the original draft by John McLaughlin (cowriter of the 2005 comedy Man of the House). It is unclear if Black Swan will be Aronofsky’s next project, since he is also developing the reboot of Robocop, which MGM reportedly is now pegging as a 2011 release instead of the previously announced 2010.#8 LEONARDO DICAPRIO CLICKS ON “DOUBLE DOWN” FOR ONLINE CASINO MOVIELeonardo DiCaprio will produce and star in an untitled project for Paramount set in the shady world of online casino sites based in Costa Rica. With this movie, the writing team of Brian Koppelman and David Levien are establishing somewhat of a reputation for stories set in the world of gambling, following Ocean’s Thirteen and 1998’s Rounders. Koppelman and Levien are also working with DiCaprio and his Appian Way production company on Beat the Reaper. That script is based on a crime novel about a former hitman who enters witness protection and takes up a new career as a medical resident at a hospital where he encounters a mobster whose life he must save. In other DiCaprio news, this week Bloody Disgusting broke the news that the two-part live action remake of the classic sci-fi anime film Akira is “dead as a doornail” at Warner Bros.#9 ADRIEN BRODY, FOREST WHITAKER AND ELIJAH WOOD SUBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENTAdrien Brody (The Pianist), Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland), Elijah Wood (Frodo in Lord of the Rings) and Cam Gigandet (Twlight, Never Back Down) have signed to star in the English language remake of the chilling 2001 German psychological thriller, Das Experiment. Inspired by the true story of the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, Das Experiment was the story of a reporter who goes undercover as a participant in a psychological study in which men are given the roles of either “guards” or “inmates” to determine how social roles determine morality and choices. As you might expect, the experiment goes horribly wrong. Paul Scheuring, the creator, producer and writer of Fox’s somewhat similarly-themed Prison Break is making his directorial debut with The Experiment. Adrien Brody will be playing the leader of the inmates (which might be the reporter role) and Forest Whitaker will be playing one of the “prison” guards. The Experiment is an independent production and is scheduled to start filming in Iowa in July, 2009.#10 DANIELLE PANABAKER AND AMBER HEARD CHECKING INTO JOHN CARPENTER’S THE WARDFan-favorite horror and thriller director John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) hasn’t made a movie since 2001’s Ghosts of Mars, but he’s returned from an 8-year hiatus, and will start filming a psychological horror thriller called The Ward next month in Spokane, Washington. This week, the production found more of its cast, mostly young actresses. Amber Heard (Never Back Down, Pineapple Express) is starring in The Ward as Kristen, a young woman who is committed to a psychiatric facility, where she meets other patients, as well as a mysterious girl who roams the halls of the ward at night. Danielle Panabaker (Friday the 13th, Sky High) will be playing a flirtatious and snobbish patient who is facing the threat of electoshock therapy, and Mamie Gummer (Stop-Loss) will play another patient. The original script was written by Michael and Shawn Rasmussen (cowriters of 2005’s direct-to-video thriller Long Distance), and was rewritten by Jim Agnew and Sean Keller, the writers of Dario Argento’s latest film, Giallo.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: PARAMOUNT ORDERING SECONDS OF MEATBALLS1979’s Meatballs is a modern comedy classic, basically inventing the “summer camp” subgenre that spawned three inferior sequels in the 1980s and 1990s, other usually awful summer camp movies like Camp Nowhere, Heavyweights and American Pie Presents: Band Camp and ultimately the 2001 homage comedy, Wet Hot American Summer. Meatballs still stands up today as a very funny movie, and was also the first film for Bill Murray (who had just replaced Chevy Chase on Saturday Night Live). Meatballs was also the first hit for director Ivan Reitman, who went on to work with Bill Murray again in Stripes, Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. Unfortunately, it might just be the strong legacy of Meatballs that has led Paramount Pictures to revisit the franchise. The new Meatballs is expected to be a remake, with hopes that it will inspire a new series of Meatballs movies. Hollywood’s obsession with remaking, rebooting and revamping favorites of the past of the past continues, and now not even Meatballs is safe from reimagining.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TLC, show, Netflix, BBC, Star, Spectrum, hispanic, doctor, Films, universal, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Conan-Gets-a-New-Austrian-Bodybuilder"},{"id":"47509230549777","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Bryan Singer takes on Battlestar Galactica","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Bryan Singer takes on Battlestar GalacticaPlus WB announces a LEGO movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | August 14, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup features the usual smorgasbord of movie concepts.

Bryan Singer’s career got started with the award-winning The Usual Suspects, but most fans might best know him as the director of the first two X-Men movies and 2006’s Superman Returns. Years ago, Singer had been developing a new Battlestar Galactica TV series, but reportedly plans were scrapped after the events of September 11, 2001, when it was felt a TV show about a city being attacked and destroyed wouldn’t be well received. A few years later, Ronald Moore produced his own take on a Battlestar Galactica relaunch, and the show just went off the air after 73 episodes. It is unknown if Moore will be involved at all with this new Galactica movie, and it’s being produced by Glen Larson, creator of the orginal 1970s show. Since Singer’s approach is being called a “complete re-imagination,” it’s expected that there will be no direct ties between Moore’s recent series and this new movie, which will relaunch the concept for a second time. There’s no word yet as to who will be writing the script for this new Battlestar Galactica either. My hunch is that we can probably expect Singer’s Galactica to have a lighter tone than Ronald Moore’s rather dire and dark TV series. I’m basing this upon a suspicion that Singer’s inspiration will be the actual original 1970s series (as opposed to Moore’s version). That would gel with a lot of what we know about Singer’s tastes, as he’s long talked about developing a Logan’s Run remake, and his Superman Returns slavishly paid homage to 1978’s Superman. So, Bryan Singer definitely likes 1970s science fiction properties, which suggests he might like the original Battlestar Galactica more than the 2000s remake, right? Having said that, here’s hoping he doesn’t include the cute little kid and his robot dog.#2 WARNER BROS BUILDING A LEGO MOVIE ONE CGI PLASTIC BRICK AT A TIMEWith Transformers 2 and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra both being big hits this summer, Hollywood’s newest fascination with toy-inspired movies continued this week with the news that Warner Bros is developing a movie based on the building bricks of LEGO. Screenwriting brothers Dan and Kevin Hageman (the upcoming CGI animated Hotel Transylvania) are said to be writing a family comedy that will be a mix of live action and CGI animation. The exact details of the plot are being kept secret, but it’s described as being an adventure in a world of LEGOs. The Danish toy company has worked with Hollywood before, on the Bionicle direct-to-DVD movies, but this project is much more ambitious. Although the news of this project seems inspired by the recent successes of toy-inspired movies, Warner Bros has actually been already been developing the LEGO movie for the past year. That makes sense, considering that Warner Bros has worked with LEGO in the past, allowing characters like Batman, Harry Potter and Speed Racer to be adapted as LEGO game sets, as well as collaberating on the LEGO Batman video game.#3 HITMAN AND KANE &amp; LYNCH PRODUCER NEXT TAKING ON A JUST CAUSEAdrian Askarieh, producer of the Hitman and Kane &amp; Lynch projects at Lionsgate, has acquired the rights to another Eidos videogame property, the 2006 hit, Just Cause. In Just Cause, players take on the role of The Scorpion, a CIA black ops assassin who specializes in using base jumping and grappling hooks for high-altitude action adventures. The developers have described the character as “as a mix of Jason Bourne, James Bond, Wolverine, and Rambo, with a touch of Enrique Iglesias.” Eidos is currently preparing for the release of Just Cause 2 in 2010. Askarieh is looking to make Just Cause an independent production, and is rounding up a budget of $30 million, which seems a bit on the low side for an action thriller. While Just Cause is being developed, Askarieh also expects filming of Kane &amp; Lynch, which will costar Bruce Willis, to start in 2010.#4 HAMLET 3D: TO BE OR NOT TO BE… IN YOUR FACE!In order for Hollywood’s fascination with 3D to evolve into something other than a cheap trick, the technology will have to eventually be used for something a bit more upscale than say, Space Chimps 3D. A British producer may have figured exactly what that might be, with news of plans for a series of 3D movie musicals based upon the works of William Shakespeare. Based upon the musical adaptations produced by a company called Shakespeare 4 Kids, the first movie will be Hamlet, with the other titles in the series being Romeo and Juliet, MacBeth, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Twelfth Night and The Tempest. The movies will be produced at a fast pace, with the first three expected to be finished within a period of 18 months. Simultaneously, the producers will also launch Movie Quest: A Romeo 4 Juliet, a competitive reality show that will seek young British talent to star as the starcrossed lovers. As for Hamlet, here’s some examples of what the producers expect to wow people with in 3D, “a ghost that hovers in front of the audience’s eyes, cannon fire that flies into the auditorium and a sword fight that appears to happen all around viewers.” What, no floating skull in our laps during Hamlet’s “Alas, poor Yorick” monologue?#5 DAVID MAMET TO APPLY HIS UNIQUE SENSE OF LANGUAGE TO THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANKScreenwriter and playwright David Mamet, who is known for both his loose use of obscenities in movies like Glengarry Glen Ross and Homicide and for a style of dialogue that is heavy on pauses and short, often interrupted sentences, has found strange bedfellows for his latest project. Walt Disney Pictures has acquired the rights to David Mamet’s adaptation of The Diary of Anne Frank, the frequently-adapted memoir left behind by a young Jewish girl who did not survive the Holocaust. Mamet’s script will reportedly be a hybrid of Frank’s diary, the stage adaptation and Mamet’s own take, which reframes the story as a young girl’s rite of passage (although that’s what I was taught it was in school some 25 years ago). It’s worth noting that David Mamet has indeed gone outside what might be considered his comfort zone in the past, most notably with his adaptation of The Winslow Boy a drama set in the early 20th Century. Anne Frank was, of course, a 15 year old girl who died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945 after living with her family in hiding in Amsterdam, where she wrote her famous diary. A 1959 big screen adaptation of The Diary of Anne Frank earned Shelley Winters an Oscar, and the memoir has since been adapted for television several times.#6 NASHVILLE TO HANK WILLIAMS BIOPIC: HEY, GOOD LOOKIN’Nashville-based 821 Entertainment Group and Strike Entertainment have teamed up to develop a biopic about the life of country music legend Hank Williams. Growing up poor in Alabama during the Great Depression, Hank Williams rocketed to country stardom in the 1940s, releasing 11 #1 hits, before his addiction to alcohol and morphine led to his death at just 29 on New Year’s Day, 1953. Williams’ hit songs included “Hey, Good Lookin'”, “Lovesick Blues,” “Moanin’ the Blues,” “Long Gone Lonesome Blues,” “Your Cheating Heart,” “Cold Cold Heart,” “Take These Chains From My Heart,” and “I’ll Never Get Out of This World Alive.” Williams’ children and grandchildren have also followed him with careers in country music, with the most obvious one being Hank Williams, Jr., who many people know as the “Are You Ready for Some Football?” guy. Strike Entertainment partner Marc Abraham, who wrote some episodes of Moonlighting and 21 Jump Street, will adapt the Colin Escott book, Hank Williams: The Biography. 821 Entertainment has been on a bit of a run recently; they are also developing a trilogy of King of the Cowboys Roy Rogers movies and an adaptation the 1999 John Grisham novel The Testament.#7 FRANKENSTEIN SAYS: LET’S DO THE DEATH RACE AGAINPaul W.S. Anderson is producing a prequel to his 2008 remake of Death Race, which grossed $74 million in the U.S. Death Race was a futuristic action thriller about inmates who are forced to drive destructive vehicles against each other. The prequel, which is based upon an idea by Anderson and is being written by Tony Giglio (who may direct) will focus on the origin story for the racer who became known as Frankenstein. Frankenstein was the character played by the late David Carradine in the original 1975 film, and was also voiced by Carradine in the 2008 movie. Paul W.S. Anderson is currently busy on pre-production of Resident Evil: Afterlife, but after that film wraps, he will move on as producer to focus on development of this Death Race prequel.#8 MEET THE NEWEST VAMPIRE HUNTER IN CRIMINAL MACABREUniversal Pictures has acquired the rights to Criminal Macabre, a Dark Horse comic book mini-series by Steve Niles, whose 30 Days of Night was adapted as a horror movie in 2007. Criminal Macabre follows the daily adventures of a hard living private detective named Cal McDonald who uses a network of friendly ghouls on his own personal mission to take out the worst of the vampires, ghosts and other supernatural monsters that plague Los Angeles. Kyle Ward, who is also working on screenplays for Hitman 2 and the videogame adaptations Kane &amp; Lynch and Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune, has been hired to adapt the script.#9 ALEXANDER PAYNE’S FOLLOWING THE DESCENDANTS TO HAWAIIDirector Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt) and Fox Searchlight are reteaming again on Payne’s next movie, The Descendants, his first as director since 2004’s Sideways. Payne expects to start filming The Descendants in Hawaii in late 2009 or early 2010. Payne is currently polishing the script by comedians/actors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, adapted from the novel of the same title by Kaui Hart Hemmings. The Descendants is about a trip from Oahu to Kauai that an affluent attorney (who’s related to Hawaiian royalty, hence the title) takes with his two daughters to meet their mother’s lover after she falls into a coma following a boating accident. Payne had been expected to direct a comedy called Downsizing, which Paul Giamatti, Reese Witherspoon and Sacha Baron Cohen are signed to star in, but Payne has decided to direct The Descendants first. That will allow for more prep time for Downsizing, as it is a more involved production (since it involves shrinking Paul Giamatti).#10 ED HELMS JOINS THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCYUniversal Pictures has acquired a spec script called Central Intelligence as a starring vehicle for Ed Helms, star of NBC’s The Office and this summer’s The Hangover. Written by Ike Barinholtz (MadTV) and newcomer Dave Stassen, Central Intelligence is the story of an accountant who becomes involved in the world of international espionage and intrigue after reconnecting with an old friend via Facebook. Helms’ next movie will be Cedar Rapids, in which he plays an insurance agent trying to save his friends’ jobs, and in the fall of 2010, he will start filming The Hangover 2.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: SPACE CHIMPS PRODUCER ADAPTING THE OZ WARSThis week’s Rotten Idea is a doozie. First, the set up: Vanguard Films is the animation company responsible for Space Chimps, Valiant and Happily N’ever After. They’re currently preparing for the release of Space Chimps 3D, which will wisely go direct-to-dvd in the United States (but the rest of the world won’t be as lucky), and something called Alien Band: The Battle of the Bands Just Got Ugly. But wait, I haven’t even gotten to the Rotten Idea yet. Last month, Vanguard’s boss John H. Williams was at the San Diego Comic-Con, which is increasingly where Hollywood types with a lot of cash in their pockets go, looking for a cool new movie idea. At Comic-Con, Williams saw a gallery for an upcoming graphic novel called The Oz Wars, which was written by an “established screenwriter,” writing under the pseudonym of Dorothy Gale. The Oz Wars is the story of a war between the Witches and the resistance fighters led by Wizard of Oz. I suspect that really, the producer of Space Chimps was just excited that this would give him an excuse to use CGI flying monkeys (although the movie itself will apparently be one of Vanguard’s first live-action movies… it’ll still probably have CGI flying monkeys). Vanguard also picked up a graphic novel called Circus Galactus, which is unfortunately not about the great, purple Devour of Worlds attending and enjoying a three ring circus. That, I would produce myself. Going back to the concept of someone, anyone, making a new movie based upon L. Frank Baum’s Oz, I think that would be fine, perhaps, but if you’re going to do it, do it right. Actually adapt one of the many great books that Baum actually wrote, not some comic book you found at Comic Con. Hey, I love comic books, but like any medium, they’re not all Watchmen, Hellboy and Kingdom Come. In fact, plenty of comic books are pretty crappy. And the same is true of video games or toys or whatever Hollywood decides will be their next hot new thing. Keep that in mind, producers, the next time you feel the urge to throw money at an idea.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"worst, movies, Photos, BET, Year, YouTube, comedy, sag","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Bryan-Singer-takes-on-Battlestar-Galactica"},{"id":"47509230567189","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Paramount Toying Around with Max Steel","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Paramount Toying Around with Max SteelPlus casting news for Willem Dafoe, Natalie Portman, and Hugh Jackmanby Greg Dean Schmitz | July 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup includes the requisite toy movie, but thankfully there are no remakes (although there is one movie based on an old TV show and two different movies based on young adult book series). Included in the original concepts are two comedies about today’s economic hard times, a biopic about a classic children’s book author, a historical epic about King Henry V and a time travel sci-fi action movie called Arena.#1 PARAMOUNT IS TOYING AROUND WITH MAX STEELWith Paramount just a couple of weeks away from releasing G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, the studio has found another action figure franchise in the form of Mattel’s Max Steel. Max Steel started as an action figure in 1999 and starred in an animated TV series from 2000-2002. It’s apparently proven to be much more successful in Latin America, where Max Steel is the #1 action figure property. For those not familiar with the character, Max Steel is a 19-year-old extreme sports enthusiast who is injured in an accident that infects his body with nanobots that make him superhuman. This leads to him being recruited by a secret agency, where he is of course teamed up with lots of other action figure-friendly characters. Mattel hopes that a major motion picture will help relaunch the toy line in the United States and other regions outside of Latin America. There is currently no writer or director attached to Max Steel, or word on when Paramount plans on releasing this latest toy property, which now joins the toy-to-movie ranks at Paramount, alongside Hasbro’s Transformers and G.I. Joe franchises.#2 BRIDGET JONES TO OBSESS ABOUT HER WEIGHT AND LOVE LIFE ONE MORE TIME?Variety is reporting that it is “rumored” that Working Title is developing a third movie in the Bridget Jones series. This would follow the two movies based upon books by Helen Fielding, despite there not being a third novel to adapt for a third movie. Instead, it is expected that this third movie will be based upon columns that Fielding wrote in 2005 for the British newspaper The Independent, in which Bridget, now in her 40s, attempts to have a baby before it’s too late. Renee Zellweger did just turn 40 this past April, so the timing is quite on the mark. Another bit of news for Working Title this week is that the British production company has hired Cate Blanchett to star in Indian Summer, a drama set in 1947 in the final days of British rule of India. That film has been written by William Nicholson (Shadowlands, First Knight) and will be directed by Joe Wright (Atonement, The Soloist).#3 BARELY REMEMBERED 1960S WESTERN THE BIG VALLEY HEADED TO THE BIG SCREENIn quite unexpected news, the 1965-1969 ABC family western TV series The Big Valley is being developed as a movie scheduled to start filming in April, 2010 in Michigan and New Mexico. The Big Valley was the story of a widowed matriarch (Barbara Stanwyck) of the prosperous Barkley ranch in central California, and her three sons (including an illegitimate half-brother played by Lee Majors) and a daughter (Linda Evans). The show was very similar to the long-running Bonanza, if you switch Lorne Greene out for Barbara Stanwyck, and use a less dusty setting. The concept for this Big Valley movie was developed by the show’s creators, and is being produced by Kate Edelman Johnson, the daughter of original show runner Louis F. Edelman. The Big Valley was written and will be written by Daniel Adams, who also directed this year’s independent drama The Golden Boys, starring David Carradine, Bruce Dern and Rip Torn. There’s no word yet about who will be cast in the movie’s five major roles.#4 THIS WEEK IN CASTING: JOHN CARTER OF MARS, THOR, I HOP, STRAW DOGSRather than take up four slots on the list that could go to new projects, this entry will cover this week’s major bits of casting news. First up is the announcement that Willem Dafoe has joined the cast of John Carter of Mars as Tars Tarkas, the four-armed giant green warrior that befriends Carter when he arrives on Mars. It’s not known how exactly Dafoe will portray Tarkas, but my best guess would be some sort of motion capture CGI animation. Then there is is the confirmation that Natalie Portman will be costarring in Thor as Jane Foster, but this news actually first appeared online a few months ago. What’s new is that the movie’s version of Jane Foster will not be a nurse (as portrayed in the comics), but rather a sort of doctor/scientist. This change is most likely due to Thor’s Dr. Donald Blake alter ego from the early comics not being an element in the movie adaptation. Next up is British comedian Russell Brand (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) who will be starring in I Hop, one of the competing Easter-themed movies that is being raced through development. I Hop is the story of a slacker who runs over the real Easter Bunny, breaking his leg so that he can’t hop, and so the guy has to take on the Bunny’s duties. Finally, Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard (HBO’s True Blood) will costar with James Marsden in the remake of Straw Dogs, which moves the story of rape and revenge from England to Mississippi. Bosworth is playing Marsden’s wife, and Skarsgard is playing her high school boyfriend, a former football hero. The changes to the story’s setting and some character elements make this Straw Dogs a hard project to predict, but like most remakes, the real question is… why bother remaking a movie that was already great?#5 DISNEY GIVES MILEY CYRUS WINGSWalt Disney Pictures has acquired Aprilynne Pike’s bestselling young adult novel Wings as a starring vehicle for their Hannah Montana star Miley Cyrus. The first installment of a planned four book series, Wings is the story of a 15 year old girl who discovers that she is actually a faerie. Sent to live among humans as a guardian of the gateway to the magical land of Avalon, she learns about her heritage when a bump on her back blossoms into a giant flower and eventually becomes wings. The faerie falls in love with another faerie as she learns that she is destined to be caught between a war between faeries and trolls over control of the gateway to Avalon. Published in May, Wings has been a success but has also garnered expected comparisons to the popular Twilight franchise, and it just so happens that the producers of Wings also coproduced the first Twilight movie. So, are you looking forward to seeing Miley Cyrus running around with giant flower-like wings bouncing around her shoulders?#6 ED HELMS RECOVERS FROM HIS HANGOVER IN CEDAR RAPIDSWhile two of the leads in this summer’s surprise comedy hit The Hangover, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, have been lining up their next movies over the last few weeks, that left Ed Helms, who played the dentist, with a big question mark as to how he would follow up such a major success. Helms, who was a longtime correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and is now on NBC’s The Office has chosen to go the indie comedy route, rather than sign on for another big studio movie just yet. In Cedar Rapids, Helms will play “a sad-sack insurance agent who goes to an industry convention to try to save the jobs of his colleagues.” Cedar Rapids was developed by Helms, written by newcomer writer Phil Johnston, will be directed Miguel Arteta (The Good Girl, Chuck &amp; Buck) and is being produced by director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways). Filming of Cedar Rapids will start in October, 2009 while Ed Helms is on hiatus from The Office. Several distributors are currently looking at Cedar Rapids, with Fox Searchlight considered to be the frontrunner after having handled many of Payne’s movies. Ed Helms is also writing, and will costar in, an untitled Civil War time travel comedy for Warner Bros, the studio behind The Hangover.#7 PREPARE FOR THE EPIC 15TH CENTURY BATTLE OF AGINCOURTLondon’s Independent Film Company has hired writer and producer Michael Hurst, creator of Showtime’s The Tudors and writer of 1998’s Elizabeth, to adapt the 2008 bestselling novel, Agincourt (also known as Azincourt), by Bernard Cornwell. Agincourt, as you might guess from the title, tells the story of the landmark Battle of Agincourt, which was also the central battle of William Shakespeare’s Henry V. In Cornwell’s novel, the central character is an archer named Nicholas Hook, who earns recognition from King Henry V of England and fights alongside him against the French army in a 1415 battle that proved the superiority of the English longbowmen, in what is considered one of the bloodiest battles in European history. Agincourt will be a $35 million production, with filming expected to start in the spring of 2011.#8 MR. FANTASTIC IS BANKING ON MR. TOADIoan Gruffudd, who is best known for playing Reed Richards in the two Fantastic Four movies has signed on to star in the British biopic Banking on Mr. Toad, with Samantha Morton (Minority Report, In America) in talks to play his character’s wife, Elspeth. In Banking on Mr. Toad, Gruffudd will play 19th century author Kenneth Grahame, who made the transition from a career as a secretary for the Bank of England to the author of The Wind in the Willows, the classic children’s book about anthromorphic animals, including Mr. Toad, Mr. Badger, Ratty and Mole. Banking on Mr. Toad will be helmed by acclaimed director Bruce Beresford (Driving Miss Daisy, Tender Mercies, Breaker Morant) from a script by producer Timothy Haas and Wendy Oberman, both of whom are first-time screenwriters. Production is scheduled to start in Ireland later this year.#9 WARNER BROS HIRES DIRECTOR FOR POST-HARRY POTTER BOY WIZARD PROJECT SEPTIMUS HEAPAs filming continues on the two Deathly Hallows movies to wrap up the Harry Potter movie franchise, Warner Bros is apparently looking at how they can continue on in the lucrative boy wizard business. David Frankel (Marley &amp; Me, The Devil Wears Prada) has been hired to direct Septimus Heap: Magyk, an animated adaptation of the first book of a seven part series by Angie Sage, with newcomer Rob Lieber working on the script. Magyk was the first book in the series, published in 2005, and it was followed by Flyte, Physik, and Queste. The fifth book, Syren, comes out this September, with two more books to follow. Septimus Heap is a young wizard who was the seventh son of a seventh son and who must spend seven years studying magic under a powerful wizard before he can eventually take her place. Specifically, Magyk is the book in which 10 year olds Septimus and his adopted sister discover their destinies, which include his sister eventually becoming a princess. Septimus Heap: Magyk is described as an “animated fantasy project,” but it’s currently unknown what company will be handling the animation.#10 NEVER BACK DOWN DIRECTOR READY TO ENTER THE ARENASummit Entertainment is looking to stay in business with Jeff Wadlow, the director of 2008’s Never Back Down (and also 2005’s Cry_Wolf). Wadlow had been attached to direct a prison escape movie called The Tomb, but when that project stalled, the fledgling studio (Twlight, Knowing, Push) has instead switched Wadlow over to a sci-fi action movie called Arena. First time writers Toby Wagstaff and Darren Howell wrote Arena, which is about a group of modern soldiers who find themselves transported to a strange shifting landscape where they are pitted into gladiator-style combat with warriors from throughout history. Although Summit’s output so far hasn’t been spectacular, it’s nice to at least see that this new studio is mostly focusing on original concepts, rather than all of the remakes and other tired concepts that the major studios are currently obsessed with. Arena might turn out to be awful, but the concept is at least sort of awesome.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: HUGH JACKMAN IS AVON MANEconomic hardship is so funny, right up there with Nazis (Life is Beautiful, The Producers) and race relations (Soul Man, White Chicks). And so, there are a lot of movies in the works about people down on their luck (including #6’s Cedar Rapids), and following the intense action of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Hugh Jackman has lined one up as well. In the comedy Avon Man, Jackman will play a recently laid off car salesman who takes a job as an Avon cosmetics salesperson, which is “initially emasculating”, until the story eventually takes on a “Full Monty vibe when the car salesman sets out to save his financially strapped family and town by conscripting his buddies into the makeup business to win a regional contest.” 20th Century Fox acquired the Avon Man pitch in a high six figure deal from Hitch writer Kevin Bisch. Here’s guessing that the Avon Man trailer will feature a scene where Jackman’s girlfriend/wife walks in on him fully made up in the sort of dated makeup women haven’t worn since Maude was a hit.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"on, psycho, The, Arrowverse, Bros., Red, documentary, Nickelodeon, facebook, BBC, Awards, rt, Series","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Paramount-Toying-Around-with-Max-Steel"},{"id":"47509230569238","title":"Weekly Ketchup: T.J.

Hooker Film in DevelopmentPlus a cornucopia of comic book movie news this week.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 10, 2009 |  CommentsThe film development news leading up to the 4th of July was relatively slow, but this week’s Ketchup is overflowing hot news items, including several superhero movies, two TV show adaptations, the requisite relaunch of a 1980s movie, a SNL skit-turned-movie and new projects for Will Smith, George Clooney, Mel Gibson and Jason Statham.#1 T.J. HOOKER TO RIDE A WINDSHIELD RIGHT INTO YOUR LOCAL MOVIE THEATERAlthough Hollywood is still mostly infatuated with remakes, the industry hasn’t forgotten old TV shows, with the latest wave coming mostly from the 1980s (The A-Team, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.), following the previous batch of TV show adaptations that was mostly from the 1970s (Charlie’s Angels, Starsky &amp; Hutch, The Dukes of Hazzard). The latest 1980s TV show to get put into development as a movie is the 1982-1986 ABC (and then CBS) cop drama, T.J. Hooker, which gave William Shatner the opportunity to be known for playing someone other than Captain Kirk (not that it really turned out that way). Shatner played T.J. Hooker, a 15 year veteran uniform cop, as brave and cocksure, becoming famous for frequently jumping on speeding cars or tackling and beating up bad guys. The show also memorably costarred Heather Locklear in a tight cop uniform, and less memorably gave Adrian Zmed his one decent shot at fame. The T.J. Hooker movie plot introduces a new element, focusing on T.J.’s relationship with his father. This gets me to wondering whether the father character might in fact be a role for William Shatner to play, and taking that idea a bit further, could it be that the movie T.J. is actually… T.J. Junior? Anyway, Chuck Russell (Eraser, The Scorpion King) is in talks to direct the currently independent project from a script by Brent Maddock and S.S. Wilson, the writing team responsible for Short Circuit and Tremors (and they also cowrote Wild Wild West). So, who do you think should play the new T.J. Hooker? Think Chris Pine is interested?#2 THIS WEEK IN SUPER HERO MOVIE NEWS: GREEN LANTERN, GREEN HORNET, SUPERMAN, SPIDER-MAN 4With Comic Con just two weeks away, the media buzz for hot superhero movies really revved up this week, with four stories that all could have stood alone in this week’s Ketchup. First up, there is Green Lantern, which is expected to start filming soon, in order to make a late 2010 release date. Warner Bros has reportedly narrowed their choices to play Hal Jordan down to three actors, who were brought in to put on the Green Lantern costume and do some screen shots. And your three possible Hal Jordans are Bradley Cooper (The Hangover), Ryan Reynolds (who also has Deadpool in development) and, perhaps in the category of the most unexpected choice, pop singer Justin Timberlake, who has quietly been doing movie work in movies like Black Snake Moan and Alpha Dog. The reasoning for each seems pretty obvious. Warner Bros is trying to keep most of the guys involved with The Hangover working within the studio. Ryan Reynolds was also once the top choice to star in another Warner Bros superhero project, The Flash, which the studio is still actively developing. And as for Justin Timberlake, well, he’s shown that he can indeed actually act, and he does have an engaging and charismatic personality that could actually work as Hal Jordan (I have to admit!). Previous actors that Warner Bros had been considering were Michael Fassbender, Henry Cavill and Jared Leto. Staying within the realm of Green heroes, another bit of news that escaped this week is that Cameron Diaz is in talks to possibly play the female lead in The Green Hornet, the comedic superhero movie that will star Seth Rogen next summer.Moving on to two of the biggest movie superheroes, next up is news about the next Superman movie. First, this week, Brandon Routh revealed that his holding contract with Warner Bros has expired (which the studio could have renewed), which seems to suggest that the studio will be going with a new actor the next time around. Soon after, a U.S. District Court judge ruled in Warner Bros’ favor in a case filed by the heirs of Superman creator Jerry Siegel. However, the ruling stated “if Warner Bros. does not start production on another Superman film by 2011, the Siegels will be able to sue to recover their damages,” with WB’s Alan Horn saying “that no script had been written and that the earliest another Superman pic could be released would be in 2012.” It should be noted that as long as WB starts production in 2011, aiming for a 2012 release, they would apparently be in the clear. So, with 2011 less than two years away, we can apparently expect to start hearing more about the next Superman soon. Finally, there was also news again this week about Spider-Man 4 getting a new writer, Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Seabiscuit; cowriter of Big), following drafts by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac; cowriter of The Rundown) and David Linsday-Abaire (Inkheart; cowriter of Robots). What is quite interesting about Sony picking Gary Ross is that the star of the two movies that Gary Ross has directed just happens to be Tobey Maguire. Although we still don’t yet know who the villains might be next time around, Sony currently has Spider-Man 4 scheduled for a May 6, 2011 release date.#3 SERIOUS TV DRAMA BAYWATCH BEING TURNED INTO A BIG SCREEN COMEDYThe long-running (11 seasons) beach lifeguard drama Baywatch is moving ahead at Paramount with a new spin being put on the concept: they’re turning it into a comedy. Although one could argue that it was often tricky to take Baywatch seriously, the show was in fact basically a fairly standard TV drama that borrowed elements from both cop and doctor shows, except it was set on a beach and the cast didn’t wear much. For this comedic revamp, Paramount has hired screenwriter Jeremy Garelick (cowriter of 2006’s The Break-Up) to rewrite an older script (that was more of an action movie) by the cowriters of I Spy, and also come aboard to make his directorial debut. Garelick, who had never actually seen Baywatch when he started work on his comedic rewrite, describes his version thusly, “It felt like the template to do a movie that was similar to Stripes and Police Academy, the comedies I loved growing up,”, with the premise now revolving around “two unlikely lifeguard candidates trying to catch on alongside the buff bodies that will be as abundant in the film as they were in the TV series.” So, what do you think, movie and TV fans, are you okay with Baywatch getting turned into a comedy, or being made into a movie at all?#4 MACGRUBER FINDS HIS CAST JUST IN THE NICK OF… (BOOM)Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels is eager to get back in the business of making movies based on his show’s sketches, with the MacGyver spoof MacGruber quickly lining up its cast, in the hopes of beating New Line Cinema’s actual MacGyver movie to theaters. To be distributed by Universal, MacGruber will of course star Will Forte as the inventive adventurer, with SNL‘s Kristen Wiig playing his assistant, Val Kilmer in talks to play the villain Cunth, and Ryan Phillippe in talks to play an Army officer forced to team up with MacGruber. Here’s the premise: “The legendary, much decorated MacGruber is pulled out of retirement as a monk in Ecuador by a colonel, who needs him once more to fight on behalf of his country. This time the mission involves going up against the evil Cunth, who has a nuclear warhead; the mission is personal because Cunth killed MacGruber’s bride.” MacGruber will be directed by Jorma Taccone (Extreme Movie), who created the original SNL skits, from a script by the trio responsible for writing the skits: Will Forte, Taccone and John Solomon, a SNL writer who also cowrote Extreme Movie. The production start date hasn’t been announced yet, but with a cast lined up and the movie on the fast track, it appears likely that it will happen this summer, before Saturday Night Live starts its new season this fall.#5 THE DESTROYER, AKA REMO WILLIAMS, IS READY FOR ACTION ONCE AGAINOne of the most popular pulp novel series of the 1970s and 1980s was Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir’s The Destroyer, who has been featured in over 140 books. The world at large, however, probably knows the character by the name Remo Williams, thanks to the 1985 movie Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, starring Fred Ward. Now, producers Charles Roven (Twelve Monkeys, The Dark Knight) and Steve Chasman (the Transporter franchise and The Bank Job) are teaming up to bring The Destroyer back, setting the project up at Columbia Pictures. Charles and Vlas Parlapanides, who are also working on a Theseus-starring action movie called War of Gods and the Manga adaptation Death Note, have been hired to adapt The Destroyer. The concept of The Destroyer is centered around Remo Williams, a New Jersey cop wrongly convicted of murder, and whose execution is staged, so that he can start a new life as a secret agent and assassin, trained by the humorous Asian martial arts trainer, Chiun. I read at least a dozen Destroyer novels as a teenager, and I can attest that they were economical (and quickly written) but frequently awesome adventure stories that saw Remo travelling the world and getting involved in all sorts of spectacular action sequences and challenges, with dialogue that was often quite humorous and wry. The Destroyer is a great concept for a new action movie franchise, as fans of Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins might remember, even if they never actually read the books.#6 WILL SMITH MAY REUNITE WITH HIS I AM LEGEND DIRECTOR FOR CITY THAT SAILEDWill Smith may reunite with Francis Lawrence, the director of Constantine and Smith’s 2007 hit, I Am Legend on a modern day fantasy film called City That Sailed. This is the second project that may reunite Francis Lawrence and Will Smith, as Lawrence is also developing a prequel to I Am Legend, which would presumably once again feature Smith’s Robert Neville character. City That Sailed, written by Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show, Gattaca) is the tale of a young girl in London who misses her father, a New York City street magician (Smith), and upon discovering a room of magic candles in a lighthouse, makes a wish that sends the entire island of Manhattan ripped from North America and sailing across the Atlantic towards England. It’s a rather spectacular concept for a family fantasy with the potential for a lot of visual spectacle, and Will Smith’s name above the title would probably guarantee it a good bit of box office. Lawrence is also producing City That Sailed, which is one of three projects that he is developing for 20th Century Fox.#7 THE HANGOVER‘S DIRECTOR TO RETEAM WITH ZACH GALIFIANAKIS FOR DUE DATEFollowing the success of The Hangover, everyone involved with it is seeing their careers take off. In addition to The Hangover 2, which Warner Bros smartly put into development before the movie was even released, director Todd Phillips and Hangover star Zach Galifianakis are now signed to reunite on a comedy called Due Date. The comedy is about a soon-to-be father who has to race across the country with an “unlikely companion” (Galifanakis) in hopes of getting home in time to see the birth of his first child, which brings to mind elements of the classic comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Due Date was written by King of the Hill writers Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland, with a rewrite by Adam Sztykiel (cowriter of Made of Honor). The plan is for Phillips to first make Due Date, and then move on to The Hangover 2. Additionally, Zach Galifianakis is also in talks to star in Man Witch, a fantasy comedy that Jack Black was formerly attached to (and that Phillips was also formerly going to direct), about a man who discovers he has magic abilities, which lands him a job at a school for young female witches. Another possible comedy for Galifianakis is Say Uncle, about a sportscaster who must spend the weekend taking care of three nieces and nephews. All four of these movies (Due Date, The Hangover 2, Man Witch and Say Uncle) are Warner Bros projects, which shows that the studio is wisely attempting to keep their potential new star, Zach Galifianakis, in their good graces for as long as possible.#8 GEORGE CLOONEY MIGHT BE THE NEXT JACK RYAN, PLUS TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY NEWSMilitary/espionage novel author Tom Clancy’s secret intelligence expert, Jack Ryan, has been played on the big screen now by three different actors (Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck), and now there is word that one star that may be interested in becoming the fourth is George Clooney, who following the ending of the Ocean’s Eleven series, currently doesn’t have the sort of film franchise that Jack Ryan could potentially be. Paramount is currently waiting on a new Jack Ryan script by Hossein Amini (The Wings of the Dove, Killshot) which is an original concept not based on any particular Clancy novel. There had been rumors that Paramount was looking to go with a younger Jack Ryan, but if this newest script does indeed feature a more seasoned Jack Ryan, and Clooney likes the script, maybe the long wait for the next Jack Ryan adventure will eventually be over. In other spy movie news, the British production company Working Title has hired Swedish director Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) for their new movie version of the classic John Le Carre spy novel, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The story is being adapted by Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost/Nixon), who is also cowriting the next James Bond movie. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which was also adapted as a popular 1970s British TV show starring Alec Guinness, is the story of a retired British intelligence officer who is brought back to track down a double agent who is hiding somewhere within the highest ranks of the nations’s intelligence community. Filming is expected to begin in 2010, probably in the United Kingdom.#9 UNLIKELY PAIR MEL GIBSON AND JODIE FOSTER TEAM UP AGAIN FOR THE BEAVEROne of the hottest screenplays around is newcomer Kyle Killen’s The Beaver, ranking at #1 on 2008’s “Black List” of unproduced scripts. The project has now found a director and star; Jodie Foster will be behind the camera directing her Maverick costar… Mel Gibson. Previously, both Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey had been in talks for the lead role, which will now see Mel Gibson playing a depressed man who finds solace in talking to his best friend, a beaver hand puppet, ala Mr. Garrison from South Park. Mel Gibson is a rather inspired choice for the role, considering his notorious reputation for bizarre behavior following his 2006 DUI. Jodie Foster will costar as Gibson’s wife, in addition to directing, which will make The Beaver her third produced film as director, after Little Man Tate and Home for the Holidays. Filming of the $18-19 million independent production will start in New York in September.#10 JASON STATHAM TO PLAY A BIGOT COP IN BLITZJason Statham and Paddy Considine (In America) have signed on to star in Blitz, based on a crime novel by Ken Bruen. Bruen’s London Boulevard is also currently in production, starring Keira Knightley and Colin Farrell. In Blitz, Statham will play Brant, a “rather crude, un-pc, borderline sociopath of a cop,” with Considine playing his openly gay cop who works with Statham’s homophobe. Brant is on the trail of a serial killer called “The Blitz” who is killing cops all over London. Elliott Lester (Love Is the Drug) is directing from a script by Nathan Parker, who made his debut with this summer’s indie sci fi sensation, Moon. Filming starts on August 10th in London.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: DREAMWORKS TRYING TO MAKE A VIEW-MASTER MOVIEToys and board games are becoming more frequent subjects for movie projects, but they often have nearly no inherent plot or characters attached with the property, which both makes them completely open to interpretation, but also just generally odd subjects for “adaptation.” This week, DreamWorks announced big plans for one of the stranger such projects, taking on the View-Master, a classic toy that has allowed kids to see images in 3-D for nearly 70 years. DreamWorks has hired Brad Caleb Kane, writer of three episodes of FOX’s Fringe, with Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, the writers of Star Trek and Transformers (and cowriters of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) serving as producers. No specific plot details have been announced yet, but it’s likely that View-Master will be a 3D project, taking advantage of the current new wave of popularity for the format, and Kane revealed via Twitter that he envisions View-Master as being in the same vein as The Goonies and Young Sherlock Holmes. Perhaps Kane will come up with a great script, but View-Master gets this week’s Rotten Idea tag because it represents the trend of making movies based on concepts that don’t really lend themselves to adaptation. If Hollywood wants to “adapt” non-narrative inanimate objects as movies, why even bother with licensed concepts? Just walk around your house, pick a random item, and voila, I bet you could come up with a movie based on it. Hey, look, there’s a spork on my desk from my lunch. I can see it now… SPORK is caught between two rival factions, the forks and the spoons in a war over control of my silverware drawer, belonging to both sides, but not really truly belonging with either, in an exciting 3D animated adventure. And you don’t even need to pay anyone for the license rights to a “spork”, though Hollywood can send my check for that awesome pitch to me via Rotten Tomatoes.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"New, TV, reboot, love","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-TJ-Hooker-Film-in-Development"},{"id":"47509232194338","title":"Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: First Class characters confirmed","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: X-Men: First Class characters confirmedPlus a full slate of remakes, sequels and adaptations this week.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 17, 2009 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup has news about sequels to Nanny McPhee, remakes of Piranha and Little Shop of Horrors, a movie version of Father Knows Best and new movies for Kristen Bell, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Megan Fox.#1 X-MEN: FIRST CLASS TO STAR CYCLOPS, JEAN GREY AND BEASTX-Men franchise producer Laura Shuler-Donner clarified this week one of the big mysteries and confusions about the upcoming X-Men: First Class project, although given the title and source material, it shouldn’t have been a mystery at all. The confusion started when Variety a while back speculated that the movie would focus on the young mutants from the previous movies, like Kitty Pryde, Rogue, Iceman, etc. However, the actual X-Men: First Class comic specifically focuses on the five canon characters who were actually Charles Xavier’s first students: Cyclops, Marvel Girl (Jean Grey), Beast, Iceman and Angel. Anyway, Ms. Shuler-Donner said, “It is the first class of Xavier’s school, way back when, so it’s young Scott, young Jean, young Beast, and that’ll be really fun.” Given that we know from the many commercials that Cyclops is a character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, it appears that X-Men: First Class could be designed to stay within in the existing franchise’s continuity, since what Laura Shuler-Donner did not say is that Angel or Iceman will be appearing in the movie (since they were retconned into being much younger in the movies). So, the question I would have now as a fan is whether X-Men: First Class will just focus on those three characters, or might other mutants be brought in as Xavier’s earliest students? Some possibilities that I might suggest are Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch (who would tie in nicely to the upcoming X-Men Origins: Magneto), Mimic (the first character added to the team after the original five) and perhaps some of the 1970s X-Men who haven’t yet appeared in the movies, like Banshee, Sunfire and Thunderbird.#2 FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA AND FRIENDS GET THE LXG TREATMENT?Although the graphic novel it’s based on isn’t even out yet, a monster movie called I, Frankenstein is in development, setting classic monsters like Frankenstein’s Monster, Dracula, Quasimodo and the Invisible Man in a modern film-noir setting (think Sin City). I, Frankenstein (both the graphic novel and the movie) was written by Kevin Grievoux, cocreator of the Underworld franchise, and Patrick Tatopoulos (Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) is on board to direct. Ryan Turek, AKA Ryan Rotten of ShockTilYouDrop.com is producing, along with Death Ray Films, the company behind War Monkeys. In I, Frankenstein, the classic monsters are reimagined, with Frankenstein’s Monster being a private detective, Count Dracula being a criminal mastermind, and the Invisible Man being a secret agent.#3 FATHER KNOWS BEST, BUT DOES 20TH CENTURY FOX?Although it’s seemed over the last few years that the once prolific practice of Hollywood adapting old TV shows into movies had abated a bit, it looks like 20th Century Fox may not have gotten the memo, as the studio is developing a movie version of Father Knows Best, the 1954-1960 show starring Robert Young. What makes this remake seem particularly odd is that the premise doesn’t seem to be based on Father Knows Best at all, as it focuses on a father whose own father moves in with the family, and the two men’s parenting styles conflict, comedically no doubt. The problem there is that from what I remember of Father Knows Best, there was no grandfather character, and so that really wasn’t the point of the show at all. Anyway, the script is being worked on by Chad and Dara Creasey, who previously wrote episodes of Pushing Daisies and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. It’s also worth noting that the idea of a Father Knows Best has been around since the mid-1990s, when Universal hired the writers of Brokeback Mountain to work on a script (consulted by Robert Young himself), and then in 2003, Paramount and Nickelodeon were developing a movie that would have starred Tim Allen.#4 MAGGIE GYLLENHAAL JOINS THE NANNY MCPHEE FRANCHISEAlthough it’s doubtful that there are many Nanny McPhee fanboys, the 2005 Mary Poppins-ish fantasy film starring Emma Thompson actually did quite well internationally, so pre-production is underway on Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang, which moves the story ahead a hundred years (her being all magical-like) to World War II England. In addition to Emma Thompson reprising the role, Maggie Gyllenhaal will also be starring in this sequel, which focuses on the conflict between war evacuee children from the city and from the country, as their cultures and backgrounds clash, and the magical nanny no doubt steps in to settle things. Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay for this sequel, but it’s unknown who will be directing. Also, Rhys Ifans and Ralph Fiennes are rumored to be costarring as well, but that hasn’t been confirmed yet. Filming is scheduled to start in May, 2009 at Shepperton Studios in England.#5 THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF JOHN CARTER OF MARSMichael Chabon’s Pulitzer Prize-winning superhero deconstructionist novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, is still stuck in nearly a decade of development, but the author has found a new job: he’s been hired by Disney to work on their big budget movie version of Edgar Rice Burrough’s John Carter of Mars. Chabon actually wrote a script in 1995 called The Martian Agent, as a reaction to his lifelong desire to write something inspired by Burrough’s Barsoom saga, so this appears to be a perfect fit for all involved. John Carter of Mars will be a 2-hour, FX-filled action movie that will mark the live-action debut of Pixar director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E, Finding Nemo). As someone who grew up devouring the John Carter books (I think I read each one faster than possibly any other book at the time, I was so engrossed in his adventures), the idea of Barsoom being brought to the movies by people who “get it” has always been near the top of my cinematic wish list. At one point, Robert Rodriguez was working on a John Carter of Mars project, but Andrew Stanton’s Pixar work is top notch, so he will definitely do.#6 MEGAN FOX TURNS DRUG SMUGGLER IN THE CROSSINGA few years back, the drug smuggling drama Maria Full of Grace was a big Sundance hit, and now Megan Fox has signed to star in a similar thriller, as a woman forced to become a drug smuggler to save her husband’s life in Screen Gems’ The Crossing. Megan Fox has been lining up lots of roles lately, starring with Mickey Rourke as an angel in Passion Plays, playing the female lead in Jonah Hex, playing the Aqua-Girl lead in the comic book adaptation Fathom, starring in the Diablo Cody-written Jennifer’s Body, and of course returning for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The Crossing doesn’t yet have a director, but filming is expected to start in July, 2009. The Crossing was written by Philip de Blasi and Byron Willinger, who is also working on the movie version of Milton’s classic Paradise Lost, about Adam and Eve’s fall from grace.#7 KRISTEN BELL SAYS, YOU AGAIN?Kristen Bell, star of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and TV’s Veronica Mars and Heroes, will star in the Disney comedy You Again, about a woman who finds out her brother is engaged to the girl who made her life miserable in high school. You Again is the next project for director Andy Fickman, who is coming off two Dwayne Johnson-starring family comedies for Disney that both did quite well at the box office for the studio: The Game Plan and Race to Witch Mountain. You Again is also Kristen Bell’s second comedy for Disney, following this August’s When in Rome, costarring Josh Duhamel. It’s good to see Bell signing on for lots of comedic roles, because although her TV work wasn’t really specifically “comedic”, I’ve been really impressed by Kristen Bell’s natural comedic flair, which I think is what made Forgetting Sarah Marshall as good as it was. Filming is scheduled to start this summer, 2009.#8 ELIZABETH SHUE TO GO SWIMMING WITH PIRANHA 3-DElizabeth Shue, costar of such movies as Hollow Man and the two Back to the Future sequels, is in negotiations to star in the horror remake Piranha 3-D. Directed by Alexandre Aja (High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes remake), this is actually the second remake of the 1978 horror spoof (following a 1995 remake for Showtime), so rather than the 3 referring to a sequel, it could also be interpreted as referring to this being the third version of the original story. Shue will be starring as the small town sheriff (and mother of three) of Lake Victoria, where some nasty people-munching piranha have recently settled in. Now age 45, Elizabeth Shue has apparently firmly made that transition in her career from being “the girl” to being… “the girl’s mom”. Although Shue’s character does have a daughter, it is her teenage son, Jake, who is more central to the story, but still you get what I mean, right? Casting is underway for the various teenagers who will make up most of the fishies’ diet, and filming starts soon after.#9 CAMERON CROWE’S ROCK STAR OBSESSION CONTINUES WITH PEARL JAMAnyone who’s seen Almost Famous, or who is familiar with Cameron Crowe’s background as a young Rolling Stone music journalist (and husband of Heart’s Nancy Wilson), knows that few film directors are into the whole rock thing as Crowe. So, it’s not surprising that Cameron Crowe has been spending the last few years hanging out with Pearl Jam, in preparation for an upcoming retrospective movie that to be released in 2011 to tie in with the band’s 20th anniversary, although really that’s the anniversary of their first album Ten, since the band actually formed in 1990. Most of the big screen music movies of the last few years have been understandably gearing younger (The Jonas Brothers, Hannah Montana, etc), and Martin Scorsese’s Rolling Stones concert film Shine a Light, represented a completely different generation, so it’s sort of nice to see one of Generation X’s contributions to music being recognized by a big league director. Even if at the time, I thought Pearl Jam were a bunch of poseurs ripping off the alternative scene (I was one of those anti-Seattle backlash snobs), I’ve since come to really dig them. Time truly does heal all wounds.#10 ACTION DIRECTOR MCG TO ADAPT… A BROADWAY MUSICAL?Director McG is the sort of guy who, well, doesn’t use his real name (Joseph McGinty Nichol). He’s also associated with action movies filled with cinematic bombast, mostly because of the visuals of the two Charlie’s Angels movies, and what we will no doubt see in the upcoming Terminator: Salvation. Another type of movie, however, that McG’s flair for all things big, Big, and BIGGER might also work is… musicals? McG is in talks to adapt the Broadway musical hit Spring Awakening, which won four Tony’s, including Best Musical. Spring Awakening is a rock musical adaptation of a 1891 German play, and is set in late 19th century Germany, focusing on teenagers who are discovering their sexuality, with a plot that includes masturbation, abortion, rape and suicide. McG actually does have a background in music, having directed many videos, produced Sugar Ray’s first album and cowriting songs on their second.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS REMAKEAlthough I’m perfectly okay with the idea of Piranha 3-D, the third version of an old horror movie, a similiar project that does not pass muster is the idea of a Little Shop of Horrors remake. In this case, the objection is so much based on how awesome the 1960 Roger Corman original was, but has more to do with how perfectly Frank Oz’s 1986 musical version, starring Rick Moranis, Steve Martin and Ellen Greene, nailed the concept. The mastermind behind this remake idea is director Declan O’Brien, who has no big screen experience, but did direct the direct-to-video sequel Wrong Turn 3. O’Brien is coproducing with Roger Corman and Andrew Tennenbaum (the Bourne series), with an eye towards the remake being a “studio feature,” and says, “I have a take on it you’re not going to expect. I’m taking it in a different direction, let’s put it that way.” Here’s hoping the only direction this Little Shop of Horrors remake takes is cancellation, and the reputation of Frank Oz’s musical classic can be preserved.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.

Yet to be cast are “Howling Mad” Murdock and B.A. Baracus. The film’s director, Joe Carnahan (Narc, Smokin’ Aces) teamed up with video game voice actor Brian Bloom to “polish” the script by Skip Woods (Swordfish; cowriter of X-Men Origins: Wolverine), which was of course based upon the popular 1980s TV show about four escapees from a military prison who become a band of altruistic mercenaries. The studio hype about this movie version of The A-Team is that it is not going to be “campy” like the show, but is aiming more for a feel like the Mission: Impossible and Ocean’s Eleven movies, which seems to overlook the fact that the Ocean’s Eleven movies were, you know, sort of campy. The A-Team starts filming in August, and has a June 11th, 2010 release date.#2 CHAINSAWS, MACHETES AND NOW THE SAVAGE SWORD OF CONANMarcus Nispel, who has made a career out of remaking old slasher franchises (Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) will next work on a reboot of a different type of hack and slash anti-hero: Lionsgate and Nu Image/Millennium’s Conan. In addition to the works of the character’s creator, Robert E. Howard, Nispel (who also directed the viking movie Pathfinder) is reportedly finding inspiration for Conan from the artwork of Frank Frazetta (right) and “viscerally violent period films” like Mel Gibson’s Apocalypto. The two movies that the writing team of Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer currently have to their credit, Sahara and A Sound of Thunder, were both critical and box office flops. Can they do better with Conan? Filming is expected to start in late 2009 in Bulgaria and South Africa, so expect casting of the title character to happen soon.#3 CAMERON, SNYDER, VERBINSKI AND JACK BLACK TO TAKE THAT RIDE ON HEAVY METALTalking to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator Kevin Eastman, who is also the current owner and publisher of Heavy Metal (the magazine), Film School Rejects this week landed the scoop of four of the big, Big, BIG name directors who will be contributing segments of the upcoming $50 million third movie in the Heavy Metal franchise. For the uninitiated, Heavy Metal is an adult-themed comic book magazine that got its movie start in 1981 with a sex ‘n violence-drenched anthology of science fiction and fantasy shorts, all set to a soundtrack of classic rock and roll. First up: we already knew that David Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) was producing and likely to direct, but Eastman reveals that another producer is none other than James freakin’ Cameron (Aliens, Terminator 2: Judgment Day), who will also direct a story. In addition to Fincher and Cameron, Eastman has also recruited Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Gore Verbinski (the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) and Mark Osborne (Kung Fu Panda), who will direct a comedy segment starring Jack Black (Eastman name-drops Tenacious D, so there might be a connection there). Finally, Eastman teases that there are three other directors who “have agreed, but we haven’t signed them, but they’re equally as jaw-dropping.”#4 ELI ROTH WANTS TO TRAP YOU IN HIS REMAKE OF THE FUNHOUSETalking to horror magazine Fangoria, director Eli Roth has revealed that he’s talking to Universal about plans to remake the 1981 Tobe Hooper movie The Funhouse, about a group of pot-smoking teens who are trapped in a darkride house of horrors and are stalked by a grotesque mutant killer. Roth, however, plans not so much on remaking the entire movie, but wants to build upon the film’s first half, which introduces a cast of carnival characters, and then show how the teens all get killed in creative ways by traps in the funhouse. “It should be about the kids getting killed in horrible ways, put in different contraptions in the funhouse and the final girl being strapped into the ride and sent into the tunnels to be confronted by terrifying tableaux of her dead friends. A smart remake could be so much fun. Kill the kids in fabulous ways and continually reuse the bodies by making them freaks in the freak museum, sew their eyes shut, waxworks… That’s the stuff I want to do in a remake of The Funhouse.” In the same interview, Roth also talks up another horror project, Psycho Killer, which is a slasher movie from the perspective of the maniac being written by Andrew Kevin Walker (Seven, Sleepy Hollow) and which Roth says MGM wants to release.#5 MARK MILLAR ALREADY PLANNING TO KICK MORE ASSSure, the deconstructionist teen super hero movie Kick-Ass might not even have a distributor yet, but that’s not stopping its creator, comic book writer Mark Millar (Wanted, American Jesus) from already working on… Kick-Ass 2. “Kick-Ass 2 is already being plotted out,” Millar told Sci Fi Wire. “We’re planning it, because all the actors are quite young and we have to make it relatively quickly. So we’ll definitely do that inside the next 18 to 24 months. Wanted made a fortune. It made a ton of money, and it was a property nobody had ever heard of. And I think Kick-Ass is going to be even bigger. Everybody who’s seen bits of it were rubbing their hands together with excitement because they think they’ve stumbled onto something very big.” Kick-Ass is the story of a teenage loser who is inspired by his love of comics to actually make a costume and go out fighting crime, to often disastrous results.#6 LANCE ARMSTRONG BIOPIC: RACING LIKE SEABISCUIT TO THE SCREEN?Columbia Pictures’ plans to make a biopic about bicyclist Lance Armstrong and his seven consecutive Tour de France wins are moving forward after years of development. This week we heard news that the studio has hired director and screenwriter Gary Ross (Seabiscuit, Pleasantville) to work on adapting Armstrong’s first book, It’s Not About the Bike. That book (which he co-wrote) “traces his story from his difficult Texas upbringing, his cancer diagnosis in 1996, his relationship to first wife Kristin, the birth of their child and his remarkable comeback from illness that saw him first win the Tour de France in 1999.” At one point, Jake Gyllenhaal was interested in starring as Armstrong, and spent time hanging out with Lance as research before ultimately dropping out. Now, Matt Damon is a possibility, but there is not yet any “official casting.” Coincidentally, this news of a Lance Armstrong movie comes the week after Universal greenlit the Stretch Armstrong movie. Maybe the two studios should team up and make a movie about a super flexible bike riding superhero.#7 THREE DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT ABOUT THE LIFE OF CAR MOGUL JOHN DELOREAN?Just months after the first film was announced, there are now three different biopic projects in development about the life of the late John DeLorean, the former GM executive who is credited with designing the Pontiac GTO and who later launched his own car company (which made only 9,000 cars, one of which was immortalized in the Back to the Future movies). (DeLorean was also arrested in 1982 by the F.B.I. on drug charges for which he was later found not guilty due to entrapment.) The first film is from producer David Permut (Captain Ron, Face/Off) and is actually based on the life rights to DeLorean’s attorney. Then there’s director Brett Ratner (who’s also developing a Hugh Hefner biopic), who is co-producing with Robert Evans and has hired James Toback (Bugsy, The Pick-Up Artist) to write a DeLorean script. Finally, there’s Time, Inc. and XYZ Films, which has the most legit-sounding rights to materials that include articles from both TIME and Fortune, the DeLorean biography Grand Delusions, and an unpublished autobiography by DeLorean himself. Even if none of these movies actually happen, we will get at least one DeLorean movie, however, because there is also a fourth movie — a documentary — also in the works. So, why all the sudden rush for DeLorean attention? Perhaps it’s because in the time when GM has filed for bankruptcy, the DeLorean era can be looked at fondly, as he helped usher in the era of the muscle car back when American car manufacturers dominated the industry. Ah, sweet, sweet nostalgia.#8 IS JAIME KING’S HUSBAND A BRIGITTE BARDOT FANBOY?From the not-always-reliable world of Australian newspapers comes the unconfirmed news that Kyle Newman, director of Fanboys and the upcoming War Monkeys, may also be developing a Brigitte Bardot biopic that would star his wife, Jaime King (Sin City). Now 74, Bardot is the French actress and singer who has appeared in over 80 films, including …And God Created Woman, and has also in recent years been convicted five times in France for “inciting racial hatred” for her anti-Islam statements. If the news of the project is true (and King can pull off a French accent), this is certainly one of the most interesting biopic projects I’ve heard of lately, and Jaime King does indeed look a bit like the young Brigette Bardot. A bit of trivia to consider also is that “I love Jaime” in French is… “J’aime Jaime.”#9 THE INCREDIBLE MR. LIMPET REMAKE GETS ENCHANTEDWarner Bros has been trying to remake the 1964 animated/live action hybrid The Incredible Mr. Limpet for well over a decade now, and this week the project got new life in the news that the studio has hired frequent Disney director Kevin Lima (Enchanted, 102 Dalmatians). The original Incredible Mr. Limpet starred Don Knotts as a mild-mannered schlub who is transformed into a talking fish and uses his newfound form to help the United States Navy fight Nazi U-Boat submarines. There’s no word yet as to how (or whether) the premise of this remake will be updated. In the long development process, two stars that were once in talks to star were Robin Williams, and then Jim Carrey. Like the original movie, The Incredible Mr. Limpet is expected to be a combination of live action and (CGI this time) animation.#10 MASI OKA’S BIG NERDY MMORPG MOVIE: THE DEFENDERSMasi Oka, star of NBC’s Heroes, has sold to DreamWorks a story idea called The Defenders, about a group of teenagers from around the world who are all friends in a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online… ah, you probably know the rest) video game and come together in real life for an adventure that forces them to live up to the expectations of the characters they play in the game. Oka came up with the idea for The Defenders with his friend Gary Whitta (writer of the upcoming The Book of Eli and the live-action Akira remake), who is also one of his friends in World of Warcraft. D.J. Caruso (Disturbia, Eagle Eye) is in talks to direct The Defenders, a project that’s being compared to a modern day version of The Goonies — which makes sense, in a way, given today’s video game generation (presuming one buys into stereotypes about who plays MMORPGs). Now, this would all get very interesting if Marvel decided next week that they would like to make a movie based on The Defenders, their long-running superhero team that features characters like the Incredible Hulk, the Silver Surfer, Doctor Strange and the Sub-Mariner…ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK: SIMON COWELL THREATENING TO REMAKE SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?First off, I should note that this particular story comes from the British tabloid, The Sun, which means that it might be completely bogus. That paper, for example, enjoys publishing every once in a while fake stories about Batman casting that are completely and intentionally ridiculous. However, even The Sun occasionally stumbles into real news, so I’m taking this one with that requisite bit of salt.The story this week is that British TV and music producer Simon Cowell (American Idol) is reportedly in talks to secure the rights to a remake of the iconic 1977 disco film, Saturday Night Fever, with Timbaland remixing the Bee Gee songs and Zac Efron starring as Tony Manero — the role that helped make John Travolta a movie star. Something to consider is that Efron recently dropped out of the Footloose remake, supposedly to separate his career from High School Musical stereotyping, so it seems unlikely he’d sign on for a different remake. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it might not be true that Cowell wants Efron to star; just that it might be unlikely that Efron actually would. Anyway, although Saturday Night Fever is not a particularly great movie, it certainly doesn’t need to be remade either. Saturday Night Fever was a perfectly timed phenomenon of the disco era, and not something that needs to be revisited.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.

Although still at Universal Pictures, Jay Roach, director of the first two movies will not be returning for Little Fockers. Screenwriter John Hamburg, who frequently works with Ben Stiller (the first two Meet the… movies, Zoolander, Along Came Polly) is working on the script, which as the title suggests, will be a comedy about Gaylord Focker and his wife Pam (Ben Stiller and Teri Polo) learning to deal with their young children. Robert DeNiro and Owen Wilson are in talks to return as well, but the status of the many other past costars, like Blythe Danner, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand is currently unknown. Among the candidates to replace Jay Roach as director are Peyton Reed (The Breakup, Bring It On), David Wain (Role Models, Wet Hot American Summer) and Paul Weitz (About a Boy, American Pie). Filming is expected to start sometime later this year.#2 THE WORLD ACCORDING TO TOM CRUISEAnyone who reads this column regularly knows that Tom Cruise appears here more often than not, it seems, which means that he has aligned himself with many, many, many movies. This week, Variety ran a piece listing the many projects that are currently on Cruise’s slate. The top three contenders are listed as The Materese Circle (a spy thriller with Denzel Washington), The Tourist (an international intrigue thriller with Charlize Theron) and Motorcade, a thriller in which Tom Cruise would play a President whose motorcade is highjacked by terrorists, ala Air Force One (“Get off my… car !”). Other possibilities are Lost for Words, a romantic comedy about an actor (Cruise) who becomes involved with a romantic triangle between a Chinese director and her jealous translator; an undercover agent romantic comedy called Witchita with Cameron Diaz; Hardy Men, a comedy about the adult Hardy Boys, with Ben Stiller; and the Guillermo del Toro-produced movie version of the 1960s British superhero/spy series, The Champions. It’s interesting to note that five of these seven movies somehow involve government agents, ala Cruise’s Mission: Impossible franchise.#3 DC COMICS SIGNING UP THE COMEDIAN TO STAR IN THE LOSERSWarner Bros is doing the smart thing with one of their Watchmen stars, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian), and signing him up to star in another movie based on a comic from their DC Comics property, The Losers. Although most of the Watchmen cast are relative unknowns (except Billy Crudup), many of them are likely to see their careers take off, so it’s smart of WB to keep Morgan in house. Although The Losers was also a long-running DC Comics title set during World War II, this movie will be based on the Vertigo Comics version that re-launched in 2003, reimagining The Losers as a modern day Special Forces unit that was betrayed by their C.I.A. operative, and put on a government hit list. Morgan will play Clay, the group’s leader, and Jeremy Renner (28 Weeks Later) is also reportedly in talks for a role. Sylvain White (Stomp the Yard) is directing from a script by James Vanderbilt (Zodiac; cowriter of The Rundown), with filming expected to start later this year.#4 ZAC EFRON AND THE ROCK TO STAR IN JONNY QUEST?First off, I should note that this particular story is still in the rumor file, but I’m getting just enough truth from this one to report it here anyway, and it concerns the movie version of Jonny Quest, the 1960s adventure cartoon which very directly inspired The Venture Bros (to give younger readers an idea of what Jonny Quest was like). According to IESB, the take on Jonny Quest that Warner Bros is currently going with is to age Jonny from 11 so that 21 year old Zac Efron can star. The other actor in talks is Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson as Jonny’s personal bodyguard, Race Bannon, and IESB includes an interview segment where they discuss Jonny Quest with Johnson. As noted there, Jonny Quest was one of the scripts included in the most recent version of the Black List, a survey of the best unproduced screenplays floating around in Hollywood. A 1990s version of Jonny Quest did indeed age the character to be a teenager, so the idea of casting someone as old as Zac Efron is not as strange as it might seem.#5 PRIDE, PREJUDICE, PREDATOR AND ZOMBIESThe latest example of movies with similar concepts dueling their way through development definitely covers an odd subject: mashing up Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice with monster movies. The two movies are Pride and Predator, which Elton John is both producing and writing songs for, and Pride, Prejudice and Zombies, based on an upcoming novel which is reportedly currently at the center of a studio bidding war. Pride and Predator is about alien who crashes near Netherfield Park and begins slaughtering the various 19th Century Brits, and is expected to start filming in London later this year. Despite the title, it’s likely that the alien in question won’t actually be a Predator, as in the movie franchise. Pride, Prejudice and Zombies has nearly the same concept, except it’s about Darcy and the Bennets being surrounded by brain eating zombies. It sounds like Pride and Predator has a headstart, but I think Pride, Prejudice and Zombies sounds like the more potentially hilariously awesome concept of the two mashups.#6 MARTIN LAWRENCE HEADED BACK TO AFRICAIn what sounds like the premise of Eddie Murphy’s Coming to America in reverse, Alcon Entertainment (Racing Stripes, Dude Where’s My Car?) has acquired a spec pitch from comedian Martin Lawrence called Back to Africa for him to also potentially star in. Lawrence’s pitch is about a working class guy in Queens, NY who discovers that he is the heir to the throne of an African country, and so he travels there to claim his title. No director is attached yet, and it’s unknown if Lawrence or someone else will be writing the script.#7 ROBERT RODRIGUEZ’ NEXT MOVIE TO BE A REAL NERVERACKERAlthough the world is still waiting for projects like Sin City 2, Red Sonja and The Jetsons, director Robert Rodriguez has signed with Dimension Films to make his next movie the long-in-development, Nerverackers. Rodriguez also wrote the science fiction thriller set in 2085, which is said to be in the same vein as Blade Runner. The main character, Joe Tezca, will be part of an elite police force assigned to stop a crime wave in what is supposed to a theoretically perfect society. Filming is expected to start later this year in Texas, aiming for an April 16th, 2010 release date.#8 REESE WITHERSPOON ASKS OWEN WILSON AND PAUL RUDD, HOW DO YOU KNOW?Owen Wilson and Paul Rudd are in talks with Columbia Pictures to join Reese Witherspoon in the next romantic comedy from writer/director James L. Brooks (Broadcast News, Spanglish), which is officially untitled, but has the working title of How Do You Know? Wilson and Rudd would play men competing for the heart of the same woman; Wilson as a professional baseball pitcher and Rudd as a corporate executive. Filming is expected to start in the summer of 2009. Rudd and Witherspoon recently worked together (though probably not even in the same room) as voice cast for next month’s Monsters vs Aliens.#9 WHO IS HALLE BERRY?Halle Berry has signed on to star in Who is Doris Payne?, based upon the true story of an international jewel thief whose escapades went on for over five decades. The independent production doesn’t have a director yet, but the script is being written by TV show writer Eunetta T. Boone, who’s written 10+ episodes of UPN’s One on One, as well as episodes of Living Single and The Parent ‘Hood.#10 THIS WEEK IN ASHTON KUTCHER AND FOOTBALL COMEDIESThis was a very busy week for both Ashton Kutcher and the sub-genre of football comedies. First, there is the football comedy, Traded, which is a “body switching” comedy about a NFL quarterback (Kutcher) who switches bodies with a 12-year-old geek, and learns valuable life lessons, from two of the cowriters of this summer’s alien invasion kid comedy, They Came From Upstairs. This week’s other football comedy (really more of a dramedy) is Warner Bros’ The Blindside (based on a true story and a book), which will star Sandra Bullock as a woman who takes in a homeless teenager, Michael Oher, who goes on to be one of the top NFL draft choices. Going back to Ashton Kutcher, Katherine Heigl (Grey’s Anatomy) signed on this week with Lionsgate to costar with Kutcher in Five Killers as a couple who moves into a new house only to discover that their neighbors are apparently assassins hired to kill them, making it sound like a less funny The Whole Nine Yards. Robert Luketic (21, Legally Blonde) is directing Five Killers, which is expected to start filming in March, 2009 in Atlanta and France.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Awards, 2018, Diego, shows, actors, james, Skip, E!, Fox, blockbusters, cancelled, CMT, Lifetime, rt, Cosplay","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Meet-the-Little-Fockers"},{"id":"47509232206632","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Fantastic Four to Get Reboot","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Fantastic Four to Get RebootPlus more Marvel updates, including Iron Man 2, Thor and Moreby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 13, 2009 |  CommentsThis Week’s Ketchup leads off with lots of big news for three of Marvel Comics’ biggest properties (Thor, Iron Man and Fantastic Four), followed by sequels for Taken, Hard Boiled and Journey to the Center of the Earth, a revival of a Stephen King favorite, a N.W.A. biopic and more.#1 FANTASTIC FOUR ALREADY GETTING A REMAKEIESB.net broke the exclusive news this week that 20th Century Fox, which is developing reboots of Marvel’s Daredevil and their Planet of the Apes franchise, now also has plans to reboot Fantastic Four completely from scratch. This means none of the same cast will return, and most importantly (I think) neither will director Tim Story, who arguably exaggerated the lighter aspects of the classic Marvel Comics title, so much that it became just plain goofy and basically a kids movie. Both recent movies were hits ($290 million and $330 million), but they were also critically reviled (26% and 35% on the Tomatometer), and are generally unpopular with comics fans. IESB.net says that Fox wants the new version to be “less bubble gum” and more like Iron Man. No writer or director has been hired yet. Although I am very much in favor of Fantastic Four getting a fresh start at the movies (because I’ve been a lifelong fan and didn’t see the comic I love in the movies) it’s regrettable that the reboot will apparently not be done in conjunction with Marvel Studios, and that means that the Fantastic Four won’t be able to rejoin the rest of the Marvel Universe in any upcoming Marvel productions. As for what I hope the next version of Fantastic Four is like, here are some thoughts: A) we don’t need another origin story; B) Doctor Doom can also take a break for a while; and C) the emphasis should be on the quartet having strange adventures around the world, because to me those were always the best stories (i.e. Atlantis, Wakanda, Monster Isle, Attilan and the Inhumans, etc.)#2 MARVEL CASTS TWO OF ITS MOVIES, AND DELAYS MOREThere was a good deal of casting news this week for Marvel Studios’ next two movies. First, there was confirmation of the lingering rumors regarding Mickey Rourke and Scarlett Johansson, who will be playing Whiplash and Black Widow in Iron Man 2. Clearing up some confusion, it was revealed that the movie version of Whiplash will be based on the villain from the comics, but also incorporate elements of the Crimson Dynamo (probably mostly the Russian part). I’m totally okay with Whiplash being reimagined for the movie, because it’s hardly like he’s one of those untouchable characters; he’s actually borderline obscure to most comics fans. As for Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanov, AKA the Black Widow, that casting choice is a lot more curious, because really she looks nothing like most depictions of her, and she’ll have to pull off a sultry Russian accent. Also getting casting buzz is Thor, with word that director Kenneth Branagh had lunch recently with Alexander Skarsgard (Stellan’s son), who is best known for his work in HBO’s Generation Kill and as a viking vampire in True Blood. Standing 6′ 4″, with blonde hair, a great build, Swedish good looks and acting chops to boot, Skarsgard seems almost too good to be true for the role of the Son of Odin. For that matter, his father Stellan could even be a pretty good choice for that role of Odin. There’s also news that Branagh is looking for Thor’s brother Loki, the God of Mischief, with Josh Hartnett reportedly being his top choice. Hartnett is interested in it as a chance to prove his chops, Heath Ledger style, which is a pretty good call considering that both Loki and the Joker are villainous “prankster” archetypes. Finally, Marvel Studios also announced a revision to their schedule this week, which bumps several movies back a year. You can check that link for the specific dates, but basically Iron Man 2 is alone in 2010 now, with 2011 having Thor, The First Avenger: Captain America and (Sony’s) Spider-Man 4, and The Avengers as one of the first major movies to claim a summer, 2012 release date.#3 JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH 2: MYSTERIOUS TRAVELSNew Line Cinema, Walden Media and ContraFilm are reuniting for a sequel to the 3-D hit, Journey to the Center of the Earth. The plan is to adapt a pre-existing script entitled Mysterious Journeys: The Lost Map of Treasure Island by screenwriter Richard Outten (Pet Sematary II) as another adventure for the character played by Brendan Fraser. The concept of Mysterious Journeys centers around an island that was the inspiration for three different classic novels: Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, Mysterious Island by Jules Verne and Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift (which is also being filmed this year as a movie starring Jack Black). From that, we can gather that the movie might involve pirates, giant insects, and either really tiny people, really big people or talking horses (or all three). Eric Brevig, who made his directorial debut with Journey to the Center of the Earth, has not yet committed to return for this sequel, and neither has Brendan Fraser. Here’s hoping Mysterious Travels doesn’t also feature a smoke monster.#4 WARNER BROS BRINGING PENNYWISE THE CLOWN TO THE BIG SCREEN WITH ITHot off the success of Watchmen, Warner Bros has acquired the movie rights to another 1986 novel with a large fanbase: Stephen King’s It. Also made into a 1990 ABC mini-series starring John Ritter, Richard Thomas and Tim Curry, It is the story of a group of childhood friends from the 1950s who reunite in the 1980s when one of the members of their “Losers Club” dies, ultimately teaming up to fight a strange monster that lives in their hometown’s sewers and takes the form of a creepy clown named Pennywise. For the movie version, the decades are being bumped up a bit, so they will be kids in the 1980s (or maybe even 1990s?) and adults in the 2010s (by the time the movie gets made). Dave Kajganich, writer of the Warner Bros flop The Invasion, is working on the script. Tim Curry did an incredible job being creepy on a John Wayne Gacy scale as Pennywise, so it should be interesting to guess who might take on the role next.#5 TAKEN SEQUEL IN THE WORKS… TOOK?Although it’s buried at the bottom of the article, The Los Angeles Times broke the news this week that producer Luc Besson and frequent collaborator and screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen are already at work on a sequel to Taken, the surprise hit thriller starring Liam Neeson which has currently earned $108+ million in the U.S. No other details, such as whether Liam Neeson or director Pierre Morel would be returning, or what the premise might be about, but it’s probably a good bet that it would involve a kidnapping and someone getting very angry about it.#6 N.W.A.’S STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON: THE MOVIERappers Ice Cube and Dr. Dre have joined together with Tomica Wright, widow of Eazy-E, to produce a movie for New Line Cinema based upon their group N.W.A., which popularized gangsta rap from 1986 to 1991, despite limited radio airplay. Taking its title from their 1988 breakthrough album, Straight Outta Compton will chronicle the group’s meteoric climb to fame and controversy (best represented by the 1988 single, F*** Tha Police), their five short years together, the tumultous break up and feuds, and finally, Eazy-E’s death from AIDS complications in 1995. The trio is currently looking for a director comparable to Curtis Hanson, director of the Eminem movie 8 Mile.#7 HARD BOILED VIDEOGAME SEQUEL BECOMING A MOVIE SEQUELJohn Woo is producing a movie adaptation of the 2007 video game, John Woo Presents Stranglehold, which was billed as a sequel to Woo’s 1992 Hong Kong cop action film Hard Boiled. That would effectively make this movie both a sequel and a videogame adaptation. The game featured the likeness of Chow Yun-Fat, reprising his role as Officer Tequila Yuen. The adaptation is being written by Jeremy Passmore (the Red Dawn remake) and Andre Fabrizio, both of whom are also working on the direct-to-DVD remake of Chuck Norris’ Missing in Action.#8 A MOVIE VERSION OF CHARIOTS OF THE GODS?Paradox Entertainment, the production company behind the reboot of Robert E. Howard’s Conan, has picked up the rights to make a science fiction movie based upon the bestselling 1968 book Chariots of the Gods? by Erich von Daniken. Chariots of the Gods?, which was also adapted as a 1970 documentary feature film, claimed to present evidence from ancient cultures around the world that mankind had been visited frequently by extraterrestrials, who were then the inspiriation for the gods of the local religions. Ancient astronaut theories predate Chariots of the Gods?, but the book certainly popularized the notion, and science fiction of all forms has been informed by the concept for the 40 years since. Paradox has not yet lined up any talent for the movie version.#9 SEAN PENN IN TALKS TO JOIN A CARTELSean Penn is in talks with Universal Pictures to star in Cartel, his first action movie since 1998’s The Thin Red Line. Loosely a remake of the 1993 Italian film La Scorta, Cartel is the story of a man trying to protect his son after his wife is brutally killed by a Mexican drug cartel. Documentary filmmaker Asger Leth will make his dramatic directorial debut with Cartel, based on a script by Peter Craig, who is also working on the Cowboy Bebop movie. Latino Review is reporting that Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) is also in talks to play a district attorney. Universal hopes to start filming this summer, but that will depend upon ongoing negotiations with Penn, who is also in talks to star as Joe Wilson in the Valerie Plame biopic Fair Game.#10 DANNY DEVITO’S MAKING A CRAZY EDDIE MOVIE? THAT’S INSANE!Danny DeVito (Death to Smoochy, The War of the Roses) is producing and will direct a biopic about electronics retail entrepeneur Eddie Antar, cofounder of the Crazy Eddie store chain, who was eventually sentenced to eight years of prison on fraud charges. Although just based in four states in the New York area, Crazy Eddie stores became famous nationwide for their commercials featuring a local DJ who yelled “Crazy Eddie, his prices are insane!”, which inspired stores of all stripes around the country to use similar commercial gimmicks. In Wisconsin, for example, we had “Crazy TV Lenny.” Peter Steinfeld (Be Cool; cowriter of 21) is working on the script.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"TV, dogs","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Fantastic-Four-to-Get-Reboot"},{"id":"47509233865528","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Howard Out, Cheadle In for Iron Man 2, Plus Brad Pitt’s Odyssey in Space","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Howard Out, Cheadle In for Iron Man 2, Plus Brad Pitt's Odyssey in SpaceAlso, movie project cancellations galore! \"Goonies never say die!\"by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 17, 2008 |  CommentsShockingly, we’ve gone two weeks in a row without hearing any new remakes announced, but there are some interesting-sounding projects for a few popular and/or talented directors. This week also saw an unusually high number of ambitious titles being cancelled. Read on for the Weekly Ketchup!#1 TWO MORE POSSIBLE BRAD PITT MOVIES: THE ODYSSEY IN SPACE, MONEYBALLBrad Pitt‘s name was mentioned this week in articles about two different movie projects. First, Warner Bros. is looking to follow up on Troy with an adaptation of Homer’s The Odyssey, which takes the story to…outer space (yes, really). The epic poem about a ship of Greek war heroes on their long way home has been loosely adapted before, with O Brother, Where Art Thou? described as an Odyssey adaptation, although you have to sort of squint to see the connections. Depending upon how it’s done, I can see The Odyssey working as an outer space project, although I’d much rather have a movie more in the style of Clash of the Titans that actually handles the ancient Greek mythology rather straight forwardly. Warner Bros is hoping that George Miller (Mad Max, Babe), with whom they had been working on the Justice League movie, will direct. The other movie that Brad Pitt is being courted to star in is a Columbia Pictures adaptation of the book, Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, about the efforts of Oakland A’s manager Billy Beane to build the perfect baseball team using computers and projections (imagine it as being a bit like creating a fantasy baseball team, only for real). David Frankel (The Devil Wears Prada) is expected to direct, from a script by Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List, American Gangster).#2 THIS WEEK IN SHOCKING (RE)CASTING NEWS: TERRENCE HOWARD OUT OF IRON MAN 2Last May’s Iron Man was a gift to fans of both comic books and superhero movies in general: a tight, humorous-when-appropriate adventure movie that managed to simultaneously be an origin story and bounce through a few other short stories as well. Iron Man was also well cast, with Terrence Howard hitting just the right notes as Tony Stark’s friend, James “Rhodey” Rhodes, a military man destined to get his own suit of armor as the weapons-packed War Machine. This week, however, brought us surprising and disappointing news, as Terrence Howard has been replaced by Don Cheadle (Boogie Nights, Hotel Rwanda) over what are being called “financial differences.” It’s pretty easy to interpret what probably happened: Howard’s agent tried to play hard ball on salary, and Marvel and Paramount called his bluff. This has got to be seen as a crushing blow to Howard, a rising star and acclaimed actor who just got his first big hit, and could have solidly followed up with this sequel, in which War Machine is expected to be a major character. A bit more perplexing is the choice to go with Don Cheadle, who is a fine actor, but does not have the physical heft and presence associated with Rhodey Rhodes and War Machine. A female friend pointed out that Cheadle’s not “sexy” like Terrence Howard, either, though I can’t attest to that. It’s not like there’s a shortage of talented black actors today… how about Blair Underwood, Mekhi Phifer, Omar Epps, Djimon Hounsou, etc.?#3 KEVIN SMITH’S BIG SPACE COMEDYDirector Kevin Smith announced this week that his next project after Zack and Miri Make a Porno and the horror movie, Red State, will be an untitled “space comedy” that is not the long talked about Ranger Danger and the Danger Rangers (seen on a t-shirt in Clerks II). The budget for this space comedy is estimated to be in the $45-50 million range, which will be Smith’s largest ever. The exact status of Ranger Danger isn’t completely known, and sifting through what Kevin Smith’s said about his upcoming projects is a bit confusing, as it’s hard to tell if what he says is about Ranger Danger, or this new outer space comedy, which is said to be a “father/son” story that references many other previous sci-fi movies (Star Wars, for sure). For example, Kevin Smith has expressed interest in working with Seth Rogen in a science fiction “superhero” comedy, but is it this one or Ranger Danger? Ranger Danger was once described as being an homage to Flash Gordon, and was expected to costar Smith’s pal Jason Mewes.#4 BRETT RATNER TAKING ON YET ANOTHER PROJECT WITH CONAN?Director Brett Ratner already has an insanely tight development slate that is only rivaled, perhaps, by Guillermo del Toro and Ridley Scott; Beverly Hills Cop 4, Rush Hour 4, Playboy, God of War and Harbinger are all reportedly top priorities. And yet, his name is being bandied around this week as the top choice for Lionsgate’s long-in-development adaptation of the Robert E. Howard barbarian fantasy, Conan, which reportedly strives to be closer to the source material than the 1980s movies starring the current governor of California. This story isn’t being run (yet) in any of the trades, but Harry Knowles’ AICN is saying Ratner’s involvement is “official,” and so it’s got to be true, right? Brett Ratner is a capable director known for working reliably and within budget, but a chief criticism of him is that he lacks a certain artistic flair. You’d be hard pressed to identify a movie as being “Ratnerian,” for example. And Conan probably would be best served by someone who brings something special to the project, I think. What thinkest thou?#5 TATTOO TO LIVE AGAIN IN MY DINNER WITH HERVEWith a title that references My Dinner with Andre, Steve Zaillian’s (American Gangster) production company (which has a first-look deal with Sony) has picked up rights to My Dinner with Herve, based upon a 1993 interview done just before the death of actor Herve Villechaize, most famous for playing Tattoo on the classic 1970s TV show, Fantasy Island. Writer-director Sacha Gervasi (cowriter of The Terminal) will be working from his own script. It sounds like the movie will tell Herve’s story in flashbacks, with that final interview providing the starting points for each. While Fantasy Island was on, Herve Villechaize was one of TV’s biggest stars, but his life after the show ended also kept him in the headlines, including incidents involving guns, violence, alcohol and a reportedly well-earned reputation as a womanizer. Villechaize was a French-Filipino “little person,” so casting him may prove quite challenging: do they cast a little person and try to make them look like Herve, or do they go for looks (and acting talent), and then shrink that person using Hollywood movie magic?#6 STEVE CARELL TO GET ALL NAPOLEONIC IN THE ADVENTURES OF BRIGADIER GERARDOh, no, yet ANOTHER comedy set during the Napoleonic Wars? Hollywood, get some original ideas! I do, of course, kid. Steve Carell has signed to star in The Adventures of Brigadier Gerard, about a brave but stupid soldier in Napoleon’s French army who is there for every step of the conqueror’s career, from his rise to his finish in exile. This is the type of comedy that Hollywood used to make much more often (Little Big Man, Love and Death, History of the World Part 1), but teen sex comedies and idiotic spoofs have since come to dominate. The production company is hoping for a spring 2009 start, from a script by John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (cowriters of Blades of Glory), but they have to compete with a couple of other possible Carell projects like Get Smart 2 and Date Night, with Tina Fey.#7 RIDLEY SCOTT’S OTHER SCI-FI NOVEL PROJECT: THE FOREVER WARLast week, director Ridley Scott (Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator) talked at length about his work with Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company on an adaptation of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Now this week, it’s being reported that Scott has also signed with Fox 2000 to helm a movie version of The Forever War by Joe Haldeman, which Variety says Scott had originally wanted to adapt way back in the 1980s. The Forever War is an intergalactic science fiction war story, as Earth fights an alien race called the Taurans (not the cow people from World of Warcraft), and a new race of cloned humans that is created to fight the war. This type of story is extremely common in sci-fi novels and TV shows, but there’s been a surprising lack of big screen movies with this premise (probably because movies of this scale tend to be very expensive). Ridley Scott’s always got a full schedule, and often ends up making movies that weren’t even on his previously-announced slate, but if this ever happens, it sounds like the next big space epic after James Cameron’s Avatar.#8 PETER WEIR FINDING THE WAY BACKAustralian director Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) has signed to work next on The Way Back, a globetrotting survival-adventure drama, with filming set to start in March of 2009 in Bulgaria. Based upon a true story, from Weir’s own script, The Way Back is about six prisoners (3 Poles, a Latvian, a Lithuanian and an American) of a Soviet gulag in Siberia who make their escape in 1940 — but that is only the beginning, as they then must make their way across Asia, which takes them through Russia, the Gobi Desert in Mongolia, the Himalayan Mountains and into Tibet and India. I’m not sure how well Bulgaria can feasibly stand in for all of those places, but maybe other locations will be used as well. Peter Weir has one of the most consistent records of quality of any director, so this is definitely an intriguing project to keep an eye on.#9 TAYLOR HACKFORD TAKING HIS POUND OF FLESH WITH MERCHANT OF SHANGHAIThe next project for director Taylor Hackford (Ray, An Officer and a Gentleman), AKA Mr. Helen Mirren, AKA Mr. Lucky Bastard, will be Merchant of Shanghai, which is not an adaptation of a Shakespeare play, but rather a biopic about one Silas Hardoon. Mr. Hardoon’s life story couldn’t be much more interesting: Jewish, but born in Baghdad, he made his way to Shanghai, China, where he worked as a debt collector before getting into real estate, cotton and the opium trade. His business dealings helped Shanghai grow into a modern city, fueled by the tens of thousands of Jews who fled there from Germany in the 1930s. Oh, and he also became a Buddhist later in life. I’m going to take a wild guess here, adding up ties to Buddhism and Taylor Hackford, and speculate that this might end up being a role for Richard Gere? Filming of Merchant of Shanghai is scheduled to start in Shanghai and surrounding areas in the fall of 2009 from a script rewrite by Timothy J. Sexton (cowriter of Children of Men).#10 A BIG WEEK IN CANCELLED MOVIE PROJECTSThis week saw an unusual amount of potential movie projects being announced or mentioned by key players as being cancelled, kaput, dead. Director Richard Donner is responsible for two, saying that both Goonies 2 and Lethal Weapon 5 are no more. Efforts are being put forward to turn The Goonies into a Broadway musical, and Lethal Weapon 5 reportedly fell apart because Mel Gibson turned it down. Director David Fincher has given up on the George C. Clarke adaptation, Rendezvous with Rama, ostensibly because its producer Morgan Freeman is in such poor health following his near-fatal car accident. Finally, there is the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe adaptation known as Grayskull, which Latino Review reports is “dead” at Warner Bros following the departure of the execs who were most vocal in shepherding the project through development. With so many projects being announced this week, but only a few movies actually in wide release each week, it stands up to reason that movies do get cancelled. We just so rarely actually hear confirmation about it.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"venice, hidden, a, Television, deadpool, Character, of, Spectrum, National","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Howard-Out-Cheadle-In-for-Iron-Man-2-Plus-Brad-Pitts-Odyssey-in-Space"},{"id":"47509235553081","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Steve Carell to Get Smart again.","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Steve Carell to Get Smart again.Plus, studio production dates for dozens of movies for 2009.by Greg Dean Schmitz | October 10, 2008 |  CommentsThis week saw the announcement of a couple of sequels, some casting news/rumors for two big DC Comics titles, two new biopics and adaptations of some classic English lit. Thankfully, no remakes this week!#1 GET SMART 2: GET SMARTERFollowing the success this past summer of Get Smart, Warner Bros has both signed Steve Carell to return in a Get Smart sequel, and signed the comedian-actor to a three picture first look production deal (which doesn’t include Get Smart 2). No writer or director has been announced yet, and there’s no word yet on any returning cast besides Steve Carell, such as Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson or Anne Hathaway. Considering Johnson’s continuing love affair with kiddie movies, maybe Get Smart 2 will prove too mature and sophisticated to come back to.#2 KEVIN COSTNER IS FULL OF BULL (DURHAM)The New York Post is reporting that Kevin Costner has been in Los Angeles, talking to Bull Durham director Ron Shelton (Tin Cup, White Men Can’t Jump) about reteaming once again on Bull Durham 2, which would also see the return of Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, whose characters now own a MLB baseball team that Costner’s character Crash Davis manages. Kristen Kerr, costar of Showtime’s Dexter, is expected to costar as Crash Davis’ latest romantic interest. The idea of a Bull Durham 2 seems a bit out of left field, but if Stallone can come back with Rocky Balboa and Rambo, why not?#3 STUDIO MOVIES FILMING IN MID-2009 EXAMINEDAs negotiations continue with the Screen Actors Guild, Variety published an overview this week of the 40+ movies that the studios are aiming to start production on in the spring or summer of 2009, and there are some interesting titles. We’ve heard that most of the titles in the article were in development, but it’s an entirely different thing to actually see that a production start date has been decided upon. The movies the studios hope to start filming by next summer (see the article for the full list) include: The A-Team, Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, Beverly Hills Cop 4, Bioshock (videogame adaptation), Clash of the Titans, Footloose (starring Zac Efron), Gears of War (videogame adaptation), The Green Hornet, Iron Man 2, Jonah Hex, Mars Needs Moms (Robert Zemeckis-produced CGI), A Nightmare on Elm Street, Ramona (Beverly Cleary’s), Robocop, Sex and the City 2, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice (Fantasia spin-off starring Nicholas Cage), Thor, Tr2n and Wild Hogs 2.#4 DC COMICS MOVIES CASTING UPWith W. opening next week, Josh Brolin is already in talks to star in what is being seen as a potential franchise starter, Jonah Hex, based upon the long-running DC Comics title from the 1970s (and in other titles in the 30 years since), about a scarred former Confederate soldier turned Western bounty hunter. Jonah Hex would go on to spend his second series, published in the 1980s, in the future, but the latest script review suggests this first movie is set entirely in the 19th century. Jonah Hex is being written and will be directed by the team of Mark Neveldine Brian Taylor (Crank). That’s not the only DC casting news, however, as Latino Review is reporting that Warner Bros’ top choice to play Hal Jordan in the fast-tracked Green Lantern movie is Ryan Gosling (The Notebook). Gosling continues to show himself to be a really top notch young actor, but he doesn’t really look like Hal Jordan to me (something about his eyes, they’re too… squinty?).#5 RIDLEY SCOTT AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO’S BRAVE NEW WORLDEarlier this year, Ridley Scott made a comment that his next film after Nottingham would be an adaptation of a sci-fi novel, which led to online speculation that it might be Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Well, the trades haven’t picked up on this yet, but the talented director of Alien and Gladiator has confirmed in this interview that yes, indeed, Brave New World is his next project! Scott says that the project was brought to him by Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company, Appian Way (The Aviator, the upcoming Atari biopic), and that the director feels that DiCaprio would be “perfect for it.” Brave New World is set in a future governed by a world “utopia” where everyone does drugs and sex is purely for recreation, because the government uses “hatcheries” to create test tube babies. The script is still being worked on, so that does put a bit of a question mark about whether it will really be Scott’s next after Nottingham, but this is still very exciting news.#6 HELEN MIRREN TO STAR IN A FEMINIZED VERSION OF THE TEMPESTDirector Julie Taymor (Frida, Across the Universe) made her debut with the flamboyantly designed Shakespeare adaptation Titus, and now she’s returning to the Bard’s work with The Tempest, one of his most mysterious and mystical plays, but with a twist: the magician Prospero will now be Prospera, and played by Helen Mirren. The Tempest is set on a magical island inhabited by the sorceress and Duchess, Prospera, her daughter Miranda (Felicity Jones), her mystical servant Ariel (played by Ben Wishaw, another gender switch) and the deformed slave, Caliban (Djimon Hounsou). The story is propelled by the arrival of the passengers of the royal ship (wrecked by a storm caused by Prospera) of Prospera’s brother, King Alonso of Naples (Jeremy Irons), which include Gonzalo, a former advisor of Prospera’s (Geoffrey Rush, in talks), a butler (Alfred Monlina) and a jester (Russell Brand). The Tempest, which is scheduled to start filming in Hawaii in November to capture the appropriate island atmosphere (maybe they will bump into the Lost crew?), will be distributed by Miramax.#7 ROSE MCGOWAN TO TAKE ON DEEP THROAT STAR?Following Anna Faris’ recent departure from the project, Fox News is reporting that Rose McGowan is now in talks to star as 1970s porn star Linda Lovelace in the biopic about the actress, titled Inferno, and being produced by Brian Grazer, who also produced the Inside Deep Throat documentary. Inferno is being directed by relative newcomer Matthew Wilder (Your Name Here), with that movie’s star, Bill Pullman, reportedly costarring as Hugh Hefner and Josh Lucas playing Lovelace’s abusive first husband.#8 LOUIS ARMSTRONG BIOPIC: WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLDCharles S. Dutton announced earlier this year that he has a deal with HBO to develop a six hour mini-series about the life of famed jazz trumpeter (and singer) Louis Armstrong. So, actor/director Forest Whitaker (First Daughter, Hope Floats) has signed a deal with a French production company to direct and star in What a Wonderful World, a theatrical biopic about Armstrong, from a script by Ron Bass (Dangerous Minds, What Dreams May Come), who also cowrote Whitaker’s directorial debut, Waiting to Exhale. This will be Whitaker’s second run at portraying a jazz great, following his turn as Charlie Parker in Bird. What a Wonderful World is scheduled to start filming in the summer of 2009 in Louisiana.#9 TOM THUMB: THE NEXT BIG LITTLE THING?With Marvel prepping their Ant-Man movie for sometime in the next few years, Warner Bros. has fast-tracked a potential tentpole project based on the English folklore character Tom Thumb, with Kevin Lima (A Goofy Movie, Enchanted) directing and Red Wagon Productions (Stuart Little, Bewitched) producing. Revamping the tiny character’s origin story (which was often connected to Merlin and King Arthur), the script by Robert Rodat (The Patriot, Saving Private Ryan) is about an arrogant knight who is shrunk to 6 inches tall while assigned to protect a princess.#10 HOLLYWOOD TO MAKE ANOTHER HINDU MOVIE AFTER THE LOVE GURUGood news, Hindus, followers of the 3rd largest religion on the planet: Mike Myers did not kill all future hopes of your faith getting attention on the big screen with this summer’s atrocity, The Love Guru. The newly renamed Liquid Comics (formerly Virgin Comics) has signed a deal with producer Mark Canton (300, Land of the Dead) and Mandalay Pictures (Sleepy Hollow) to make a movie version of their comic title, Ramayan 3392 A.D., which is a futuristic sci-fi series inspired by the blue-skinned Hindu prince, Rama (an avatar of Vishnu), and his battle against the evil demon, Ravan. The comic series was created by self-help author Deepak Chopra and film director Shekhar Kapur (Elizabeth, The Golden Age), as part of Liquid/Virgin’s mission to publish comic book titles written by celebrities like directors, actors and musicians. Sony Online Entertainment is also developing a MMO video game (like World of Warcraft) based upon Ramayan 3392 A.D. John Collee (cowriter of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World) is working on the script.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"japanese, twilight, Tomatazos, cults, Returns, critic, Company, Netflix, Opinion, Classic, Toys, King, thirty, BBC, york","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Steve-Carell-to-Get-Smart-again"},{"id":"47509235624762","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Branagh directs Thor, Seagal vs. aliens?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Branagh directs Thor, Seagal vs. aliens?Plus news about Warner Bros' Yogi Bear movieby Greg Dean Schmitz | October 3, 2008 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup sees the announcements of two movies with ties to the JFK conspiracy theories, the obligatory 1980s remake project, and lots of news for comic book projects.#1 VERILY! KENNETH BRANAGH DOTH VALIANTLY PLEDGE TO HELM YON THOR FOR THOU!If there’s one thing that always made Thor stand out as a character and a comic to me, it was his vaguely-Shakespearean way of speaking. I don’t know if Stan Lee intended it, but he basically educated generations of kids about antiquated words like “thou”, “thee” and “doth”, and it made Thor seem even more “bad ass” along the way. Thor putting his big stone hammer beatdown on some troll, yelling something like “Verily, thou will not stand!”; you just don’t get better than that in classic comics. Walt Simonson’s 1980s run was also great at that. And so, it makes a brilliant kind of perfect sense that Marvel is negotiating to put the job of directing Thor in the hands of Kenneth Branagh, who has built his reputation on his adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays. With a script full of Thor-speak, Branagh will be the guy to make sure that the actors are able to speak that way without sounding, you know, really lame. And now, I will do a little of speculating. Might Marvel also have an eye on getting Branagh to also play Thor’s human alter-ego, the meek, crippled Dr. Donald Blake? Branagh obviously doesn’t have the frame or stature to play Thor himself, but he seems like a very good choice to play Blake, but again, that’s just me guessing. Like Robert Downey, Jr., Kenneth Branagh is an actor who seems ripe for breaking out from the B list into being a major star. Branagh’s got the second star spot in Valkyrie coming next year (presuming that Tom Cruise-pirate-looking-Nazi movie doesn’t flop), and if he were to star in Thor, that might just do the trick for his career.#2 YOGI BEAR: STEPHEN COLBERT, WATCH OUT!Warner Bros has apparently given up on their Scooby-Doo film franchise, but they have another Hanna-Barbera classic cartoon in mind as their next animated/live action smash up: Yogi Bear. Although the actual 1961 Yogi Bear cartoon only ran for one season, there was a previous Yogi Bear (animated) movie in 1964, and Yogi starred in several follow-up series, usually ensemble pieces like Yogi’s Space Race (yes, a bear in space), most of which were kind of low rent, IMO. Despite not technically being a hit character, Yogi Bear is definitely a cultural icon, with phrases like “smarter than the average bear” and “pic-a-nic basket” being instantly identifiable. Yogi Bear will be a combination of CGI animation (Yogi and Boo Boo) and live action (Ranger Smith and Jellystone Park), to be directed by Ash Brannon (co-director of Surf’s Up) and written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia (cowriters of Surviving Christmas).#3 SCORSESE/DE NIRO PROJECT #9 ANNOUNCEDYou would be challenged to come up with a director/actor match that has produced more classic films consistently than Martin Scorsese and Robert de Niro (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, Goodfellas, etc). So, it is very good news this week that they are reteaming for #9 with I Heard You Paint Houses, an adaptation of a book about Frank “The Irishman” Sheeran, a labor organizer who claimed to have killed Jimmy Hoffa, and to have been involved in the Bay of Pigs and having knowledge about the assassination of JFK. The title is an allusion to a mobster slang of “painting houses”, referring to blood splatter on walls. The mobster tell all aspect of this movie feels a lot like Goodfellas, but with a bigger scope. Paramount is the studio behind I Heard You Paint Houses, from a script by Steven Zaillian (Schindler’s List, American Gangster).#4 JACK BLACK: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERYJack Black is reteaming with the writers of Kung Fu Panda for Universal Pictures on an untitled live-action spy spoof that is basically a take-off of the Jason Boune series. Black is to play a character who wakes up on a beach in Cuba with amnesia, so he assumes that he is really a deadly secret agent, ala the Bourne movies. The best thing about Kung Fu Panda was arguably the writing, and Jack Black has done this sort of physical comedy before (Tropic Thunder, Nacho Libre), so there might be promise here. That Universal is the studio behind the Bourne series can’t possibly be a coincidence.#5 GEORGE A. ROMERO CONTINUING HIS LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE CREEPING DEADAlthough this year’s Diary of the Dead was a certified corpse at the box office, director George A. Romero started filming this week in Ontario on an untitled project which reportedly has the production working title of Blank of the Dead (the “blank” to be filled in later, obviously). The movie is set on an island, so I’m just going to guess here that maybe the title will be Island of the Dead (regardless of the previous movies with that title). Romero wrote and is directing the movie, about the residents of a remote island whose relatives are rising from their graves, and there’s not a single person in the cast I’ve ever heard of.#6 THIS WEEK’S REMAKE: ANGEL HEARTHow could a week go by in Hollywood in 2008 without a remake of a 1980 movie being announced? This time, it’s the Mickey Rourke/Robert de Niro Southern-fried voodoo/magic-infused movie, Angel Heart, which is being produced by former New Line Cinema big shot, Michael de Luca (Blade, Boogie Nights). This is an interesting remake, because my initial reaction is “ah, come on, stop with the remakes, already!”, but then I remember my Remake Rule. Which is: remakes are okay if the original movie was flawed. And, Angel Heart, although nostalgia wants to remember only the best (Lisa Bonet sex scenes, Robert de Niro being all evil), was definitely a flawed movie. It was over long, and borderline boring/pretentious. So, I’m going to give the Angel Heart remake the benefit of the doubt, and allow that the basic concept could result in a better movie.#7 NEXT SPRING: THE SEASON OF DC?This week, three separate stories about DC Comics superhero movies all strangely touched upon the same subject: filming starts in 2009, two of which are specifically in the spring of 2009. Tying all three together, I have to wonder if this is a direct result of the recent Warner Bros/DC Comics conclave about how best to take on Marvel. Movie people in Chicago are being told to get ready for the third Christopher Nolan Batman project. Kevin Spacey is saying that he’s prepping for another Superman in 2009. And producer Donald De Line (The Italian Job) says Green Lantern is being fast-tracked for a spring, 2009 production start. Of those, the most exciting news is the Green Lantern greenlight, because that is a character with a lot of big screen promise. The most interesting is the Kevin Spacey news, because it runs a bit counter to things we’ve heard, such as the possibility of a post-Singer reboot that probably wouldn’t include Spacey as Lex Luthor. All three are huge titles, and if they all really did film in 2009, would give Warner Bros (which also has some Harry Potter movies) probably the largest 2010/2011 schedule, even bigger than Paramount’s Marvel slate of Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and The Avengers (which was confirmed this week as going to that studio).#8 UNDER SIEGE 3: IS THAT AN ALIEN IN MY SOUP?The slow creeping doom of age and impending death is closing in on Steven Seagal, age 57, and so he is trying to get Hollywood to pony up some cash to make Under Siege 3. But oh, being a surprisingly limber chef on a train or a boat won’t be enough time around. Talking to MTV, Seagal says he wants Under Siege 3 to be “more mystical, or maybe extraterrestial in nature.” That’s right, Seagal wants to beat up aliens. MTV speculates that he means something like Under Siege in Space, but I think it probably be more like he’s a chef on a boat, and then it turns out there’s aliens on the boat. Personally, I think what Seagal should do with Under Siege 3 is just have his chef working at a restaurant, and he’s constantly thinking there’s bad guys attacking, but it’s really just, you know, the shrimp delivery guy. That could be comedy gold.#9 300 SEQUEL DETAILS REVEALED: 300 BOATS?Talking to IESB.net, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen) gave us our first insight into what the planned 300 sequel will be about: the year of Spartan battles inbetween the Battle of Thermopylae depicted in 300, and the Battle of Plataea, from which the film’s narrator was seen in the flash forwards. What Snyder and Warner Bros have to wait for, for more details, is for Frank Miller to actually write the graphic novel sequel to 300, for them to adapt. So, what happened in that year? From what I can tell, the biggest event was a month later, in the naval Battle of Salamis, which involved fleets from dozens of Greek cities, just one of which (and not one of the larger) was from Sparta. So, will Miller’s new book focus on sea battles more than naked dudes with shields?#10 JFK Part Deux?Producer John Davis (The Firm, I, Robot), through his deal with 20th Century Fox, has procured the rights to an upcoming expose book called Good Night, Dorothy Kilgallen, about a journalist, Dorothy Kilgallen, who died mysteriously in 1965 following her attempts to investigate the conspiracy theories about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, who was also a personal friend of Kilgallen. It’s been a long time now since movies like JFK and Ruby delved into the same subject matter, and people are still fascinated with the subject.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cats, jamie, Holidays, elm, Tarantino, satire, Academy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Branagh-directs-Thor-Seagal-vs-aliens"},{"id":"47509235703618","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Pitt to be a Bastard, Riggs &amp; Murtaugh returning?","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Pitt to be a Bastard, Riggs &amp; Murtaugh returning?Plus casting news for Natalie Portman and Julia Robertsby Greg Dean Schmitz | August 8, 2008 |  CommentsHey gang, welcome to another Weekly Ketchup. This week’s word is “obligatory.” How many times can you spot it?#1 QUENTIN TARANTINO RECRUITS THE FIRST OF HIS INGLORIOUS BASTARDSThis was a big week for the casting of Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Bastards (AKA Inglorious Basterds, which is how the script spells it), with nearly every day bringing a new name, but the biggest is Brad Pitt, who will be playing the goy soldier who brings the ragtag bunch of Jewish troops together for their special mission. So far, three names have surfaced to play those soldiers: Cabin Fever director Eli Roth, Numb3rs star David Krumholtz and from The Office, B.J. Novak. It appears that Tarantino’s initial plans of making this an all-star affair were scrapped, and further evidence of this was the revelation that QT is looking to cast a German actor to play the main Nazi baddie instead of the rumored Leonardo DiCaprio. Also in talks to star are Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) as a British officer and 1980s hottie Natassja Kinski (Cat People) as one of Germany’s most famous actresses, who represents the obligatory “hey, remember them?” portion of a typical QT movie’s cast (see also: Darryl Hannah, Michael Parks, Pam Grier, Jeff Fahey, etc).#2 BELIEVE ME, YOU REALLY ARE GETTING TOO OLD FOR THIS SH*TWhen Lethal Weapon 4 failed to do the same sort of blockbuster business that the first three movies did, producer Joel Silver and the two stars (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) were quoted by various sources as saying that the franchise was pretty much done. No Lethal Weapon 5. Forget it, nuh-uh. Right, well, that was ten years ago, and Mel Gibson’s star is not as glittering as it once was, so… Lethal Weapon creator, screenwriter Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) has taken two old scripts, merged them together to form one new Lethal Weapon script, and producer Joel Silver, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are apparently all excited about doing it. The plot this time around would involve nearly-retired Riggs getting his old partner Murtaugh to come out of retirement for… just… one… more… case. The funny thing is that at the rate Hollywood is going remake crazy these days, yet another sequel to a tired, basically dead franchise actually feels refreshing (in comparison) somehow. Speaking of that…#3 2008’S OBLIGATORY GOONIES 2 RUMORWe’re almost two thirds through another year, and we haven’t had any decent Goonies 2 rumor mongering going on. Gasp! Rumors of a Goonies sequel are to the Internet what swallows are to Capistrano. A year cannot pass without their return. And so, here’s your link to AICN . Warner Bros is interested, yada yada yada. In a sort of sick, evil way, I hope they end up going with a godawful CGI “Sloth” monster so that all the Generation X fanboys who have been clamoring for this will end up feeling cheated and betrayed. A theatrical Goonies sequel is just a bad, bad idea IMO.#4 SHOULDN’T A THEATRICAL 24 MOVIE BE CALLED JUST 2?The producers of TV’s 24 are currently making a DVD movie in South Africa called 24: Exile, and apparently the 20th Century Fox execs are impressed enough that their “enthusiasm” for making a feature film version of 24 is being stoked. Now, when such a movie would be made is up for debate: probably not until after the show wraps, but the scheduling of the series is such that perhaps it could happen next year. My hunch as to what else is making Fox “enthusiastic” about a 24 movie? That the X-Files feature film franchise appears to be pretty much dead (regardless of what Chris Carter hopes), and so Fox is looking for another TV show to take its feature film place. Again, just a hunch.#5 THIS WEEK’S OBLIGATORY HORROR REMAKE IS: SUSPIRIAThe concept of a remake of Suspiria, the creepy Dario Argento horror flick about a coven of witches living (and killing) in an European ballet school, has been known of for a while, but Bloody Disgusting got the news this week that Natalie Portman is apparently interested in producing and starring, with David Gordon Green (Undertow, Pineapple Express) the top choice to direct. Now, I normally DESPISE the current trend of remakes, but like Darren Aronofsky’s Robocop, this is sounding like a remake that might actually turn out to… you know, not be a travesty.#6 V: THE SERIES: THE MOVIE?I don’t know if this will ever actually happen as a theatrical movie, but Kenneth Johnson, the creator of the 1980s sci-fi TV series, V: The Series, has taken the time to write up a script for a theatrical remake of the original two-part mini-series (which then inspired the TV series as a spin off), and Latino Review took the time to do a review. The concept of the show was actually pretty great: evil lizard people come to earth in disguise, conning the human race into thinking they’re our friends, so they can systematically take over the planet and start eating us. It would probably, however, be better served by getting the sort of treatment that Battlestar Galactica got, as a new TV series. As a two hour movie, might this not just feel like a remake of John Carpenter’s They Live? That reminds me, I’m out of gum.#7 THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS MOVIE IS YOUR MOVIE…Mimi Leder, a director who once directed such big budget extravaganzas as Deep Impact and The Peacemaker, has not been getting as high profile work as lately, as CHUD reminds us. To go with her new lower profile, she is lining up a project that seems like it might be rather intriguing, which is Remember Their Names, about the time that folk singer Woody Guthrie spent as a merchant marine during World War II.#8 JACKIE CHAN TO BASICALLY REMAKE ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTINGOh, Jackie Chan, must it come to this? You were Drunken Master. You were the star of more Police Story movies than I can count off hand. You were, basically, the “new Bruce Lee.” And now, you’re a little bit older, and you’re doing… The Spy Next Door, a kids movie about a babysitter who has to fight off secret agents when one of the kids downloads super secret software. Directed by Brian Levant (the two Flintstones movies), this movie will undoubtedly cement Chan’s descent into becoming a cartoon of his former ass-kicking self. Admittedly, this is a path he’s been on for a while, but that still doesn’t make it, you know… right.#9 THIS WEEK IN GRAPHIC NOVEL ADAPTATIONSDisney has picked up rights to Monster Attack Network, yet another graphic novel that I’ve never heard of, with plans to make it into a Men in Black type sci-fi action comedy, about the team that’s called in when the giant monsters living on an island (full of giant monsters) get out of hand. If Will Smith signs on, is it okay if I don’t report it?#10 OH PLEASE, LET THIS MOVIE GET MADE WITH THAT TITLE INTACTWarner Bros has picked up rights to the book, Drink Play F**k, which is apparently the male answer (although officially unrelated) to a previous book, with more of a female angle, called Eat Pray Love, which Paramount has picked up the rights to, with Julia Roberts expected to star. I’ve got no interest in the Julia Roberts movie, but the Warner Bros movie, whatever it’s actually about, has sort of got me sold just on the title alone.

Joe!Plus rumors that Clint Eastwood may return as Dirty Harryby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 23, 2008 |  Comments20TH CENTURY FOX LOVES IT WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHERLong in development, the A-Team movie’s imminent production got a bit of a backdoor announcement this week in the form of 20th Century Fox adding the title to its release calendar, aiming for a summer date of June 12th, 2009. The adaptation of the 1980s adventure TV series about a foursome of Vietnam vets on the run who travel around helping people as classifieds-advertising vigilantes has for years been the subject of thousands of “dream casting” type web sites and posts. If someone is beefy, famous and and black, then someone else somewhere has suggested they’d be perfect to play B.A. Barracus. The same goes for wacky comedian types and Murdock. Regardless, no official casting has been announced yet. What we do know, however, is that the current director is John Singleton (Shaft, 2 Fast 2 Furious) and the script will be by his writing team (Michael Brandt and Derek Haas) from 2 Fast 2 Furious (and also, 3:10 to Yuma). So, join the fun… who do *you* think would be best for each of the show’s iconic characters?SNAKE-EYES: ALMOST AS LIFELIKE AS THE ACTION FIGUREAin’t It Cool News, by way of USA Today and G.I. Joe comics writer Larry Hama, was the source this week for our first glimpse of Ray “Darth Maul” Park in costume as Snake-Eyes in the G.I. Joe movie. I’m just a bit too old to have been a fan of the toys or the cartoon (my G.I. Joes were about 3 times bigger and vaguely resembled a bearded Lee Majors), but I do know what Snake-Eyes looks like, and… I believe that is it. Going a bit off-subject, looking at this picture of a completely costumed guy wielding a sword and sometimes a gun, I got to wondering how they will handle Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, who has a similar look (but with a lot more red). Snake-Eyes is mute, so they can easily get away with a look that is basically faceless, but Deadpool is actually quite gabby. Unless they want Deadpool’s scenes to come off like those Spidey/Green Goblin scenes in that first movie, I’m guessing then we won’t get as faithful a look as what the G.I. Joe costume designers did with Snake-Eyes.JACK RYAN: BALDWIN, FORD, AFFLECK AND NEXT…?Paramount Pictures announced plans this week to revive military/adventure author Tom Clancy‘s character of Jack Ryan’s career as a movie character, following the four movies in which he has been played by Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October), Harrison Ford (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger) and Ben Affleck (The Sum of All Fears). What’s probably most interesting, however, is that the director they are in talks to bring Clancy’s C.I.A. consultant back is Sam Raimi (Spider-Man series, Evil Dead series). Reportedly, the decision hasn’t yet been made about whether the next film would be an adaptation of one of Clancy’s books, or just an entirely new story, which means that there’s no script (or writer) yet, but even so, Paramount wants to get the movie done and ready for release in the summer of 2010. Raimi’s currently working on his return to horror, Drag Me to Hell, and when you fit the development and production of a big budget spy/military thriller in there, that doesn’t allow much time for a lot of Raimi’s other projects, like say, the possibility of a Spider-Man 4 (though I sort of didn’t think he’d be returning for that one either).GO AHEAD, PUNK, MAKE THIS MOVIEWith another movie he’s directed already in the can and scheduled for this November (The Changeling, a thriller starring Angelina Jolie), Clint Eastwood is wasting no time or worrying about competing with himself, signing with Warner Bros to direct and star in a project called Gran Torino that has really set the Internet buzz wagons afire. Where this gets *really* interesting is the scoop/rumor that Ain’t it Cool News is running with, which suggests that the lead character of Gran Torino is none other than one Harry Callahan, AKA Dirty Harry, which would make it the “Dirty Harry 6” many people probably gave up on ever thinking we’d ever actually see get made. If AICN’s source is right, the story involves Dirty Harry coming out of retirement when his son, also a cop, is killed by a killer whose only known trait is the 1972 Ford Torino he drives (which as AICN concurs, was a very cool late model from the last days of the classic street muscle car). Anyway, the secrecy about the plot in the Variety article makes me think that AICN is probably right, and that makes me a happy camper, because as a kid in the 1970s and early 1980s, the five Dirty Harry movies were one of the signatures of “cool.” Yeah, Harry Callahan was a violent and arguably morally blackish-grey guy, but he was still, you know, awesome.JONAH HEX AND THE CRANK TRILOGYNever really a comic book superstar, Jonah Hex was still one of DC Comics’ most consistent titles for over a dozen years, telling the story of a “bad ass” cowboy in the style of Clint Eastwood’s cowboy movies. This week, two separate pieces were published online about the planned movie adaptation of the series, in the form of a script review and an interview with Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the writers/directors of the Jason Statham film, Crank, and Hex. The interview was done in conjunction with the release of Pathology (which they wrote but didn’t direct), and brings the news that they have plans for two more Crank movies, in a schedule that sounds like their next movies would be Crank 2, then Jonah Hex, and then Crank 3. Now, I wonder what Jason Statham would look like with his face half scarred, in a nasty old Confederate uniform, and six guns in his hand?PUTTING THE SPICE BACK INTO DUNEPeter Berg, whose career as a director has been quite varied (The Rundown, Friday Night Lights, this summer’s Will Smith superhero movie, Hancock), has attached himself to lots of projects over the years, but this week brought confirmation of a remake/adaptation project that could arguably be his most ambitious yet: Dune. Written in the 1960s by Frank Herbert, starting off what would become one of the most popular science fiction “space opera” novel series ever, Dune is the epic tale of a struggle on the desert planet Arrakis, home to giant worms, a drug-like substance called “The Spice” (which also grants super powers of a sort), and not much water. David Lynch made a big budget movie of Dune in 1984, which I personally *love*, but the sentiment was not universal, and the movie is still considered a flop by most. So, that actually makes Dune a good candidate for being re-done, as most people would probably consider the chances of getting a “better” movie on the upside. Paramount Pictures no doubt sees this not only as a “tentpole” project, but potentially the first of many films, with plenty of books by Frank Herbert (and his son, Brian) yet to adapt.SHAKING THE REST OF THE KETCHUP OUT OF THIS WEEK’S BOTTLEGeorge Lucas talked quite a bit this week to the guys over at ComingSoon.net, which gives us the news that he might start filming Red Tails, his project about the Tuskegee Airmen, later this year, for a 2009 release. His 2008 release, Star Wars: The Clone Wars also gets a lot of attention in an interview there.The title character of the TinTin trilogy to be directed by Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and either another director or one of those two, has been cast in the form of 17-year-old British actor Thomas Sangster, who is possibly best known for playing Liam Neeson‘s young son in Love, Actually.The voice cast for the DreamWorks 3D CGI fantasy comedy, How to Train Your Dragon has been announced, and it includes Gerard Butler (300), America Ferrara (Ugly Betty) and Jonah Hill (Superbad). The story of a scrawny kid in a Viking village who must capture and train a dragon, is scheduled for a release on March 26th… 2010.The first two really great official images of Benicio del Toro in full-on Wolfman makeup appeared online this week, via “Entertainment Weekly.” Makeup guru Rick Baker has done an *amazing* job, both of creating a terrifying creature, but at the same time keeping true to the classic features of the original 1930s/1940s Wolfman makeup.The first on-location images of Johnny Depp as mobster John Dillinger in Michael Mann’s Public Enemies are now online. Depp appears to be enjoying hanging out in Columbus, Wisconsin, which is just one of a few different Dairy State towns he’ll be visiting in coming weeks, in a rare situation where a place like Wisconsin plays itself, instead of, you know, being filmed in… Canada.Robert Downey, Jr. goes where few other actors could dare (and whether *he* can is still up for debate) in the fairly funny/awesome trailer for Tropic Thunder.Mad Max series director George Miller (who’s currently working on the Justice League America movie) revealed quite a bit of details about Fury Road, the (not made yet) fourth Mad Max movie, which sounds like it may not get made, and if it does, it probably won’t be with Mel Gibson (though it would have, at one time).Similarly, based on what Chris “Human Torch” Evans is saying, it sounds like 20th Century Fox may have changed its collective studio mind about making a third Fantastic Four movie, as he’s not heard anything on the subject in the year since the second movie’s release.Director Matthew Vaughn, who’s attached to adapt Marvel’s Thor, may actually direct another comic adaptation, Kick Ass (which is still not completely published yet) first, according to a scoop over at AICN.Greg Dean Schmitz can be contacted via his MySpace page, there’s a RT Forums thread devoted to him, and his IMDb discussion thread is currently a very lonely place.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Action, YouTube, criterion, harry, VICE, nature, obituary, Paramount, action, Reality, football, vampires, doctor, composers","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-The-ATeam-Gets-a-Release-Date-Plus-Pics-from-GI-Joe"},{"id":"47509237224271","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Toy Story 3 , Cars 2, &amp; more from Pixar","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Toy Story 3 , Cars 2, &amp; more from PixarPlus more casting in Oliver Stone's George Bush biopic.by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 11, 2008 |  CommentsTHE FUTURE OF PIXAR“Quint” from Ain’t it Cool News attended a recent big publicity event hosted by Pixar and Disney Animation, and so they’ve posted a very nice summary of what Pixar has planned for the next four years or so. The piece starts with their next two, Wall-E and Up, but the movie fandom at large has been fairly aware of those two, so I’ll concentrate on what was “newer” news in the piece. For 2011, Pixar is working on Newt (Summer, 2011) and The Bear and the Bow (December, 2011). Newt is a romantic comedy about two newts (the moist four legged amphibians often confused with salamanders) that are the last of their species, one male and one female. The male has spent his life in captivity awaiting company, while the female is a fierce adventurer from the wild, and when put together, they don’t quite hit it off (partly because the male’s view of a diagram explaining newt mating patterns is blocked by a coffee machine). At first glance, it sounds a little bit like a more land-based Finding Nemo with a romantic angle, but Pixar does animated animal comedy like on one else, so it’ll probably be all awesome and stuff. The Bear and the Bow is a fairy tale in the style of the Brothers Grimm, from one of the writer/directors of The Prince of Egypt, and it tells the story of a Scottish royal family and their involvement with a witch. The project already has its core cast, which includes Julie Walters as the witch, Billy Connolly (an awesome voice actor) as the king, Emma Thompson as the queen and Reese Witherspoon as their heroic archer princess of a daughter. Whereas Newt is sort of old hat territory for Pixar, this one is sort of exciting because Pixar has never really gone into fantasy territory like this before.Finally, there is news of plans for a Cars 2 (aiming for the summer of 2012), which will take the automobile antics overseas, and plans for the first Toy Story movies to be re-released in digital 3-D, leading up to the release of Toy Story 3 (on 10/2/09, 2/12/10 and 6/18/10 respectively). The press conference also included Disney Animation projects, most of which were already known about, but the new title, revealed as a Christmas, 2012 release is King of the Elves. King of the Elves is based on a Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner) short story about a man in Mississippi whose assistance to a group of elves living there leads them to proclaim him their king, which leads him to fighting off an evil troll that threatens the elves.THE LAWS OF ROBOT MOVIESProduction has started in New Orleans on Robosapien: Rebooted, a movie adaptation of the little white robot toy you’ve probably seen in toy stores, directed by Sean McNamara, “hot” off another toy adaptation, Bratz: The Movie. Hollywood movies have long been a very expensive way of promoting toys (thank George Lucas and Star Wars for that), and now the concept is apparently just being accepted (by financiers) as not needing any contrivance. The movie can be a direct adaptation of the toy (like, say G.I. Joe and Transformers) and people are apparently okay with that. So, I guess, I should be. And yet, it still feels crass to me. Ah well, I’m also not one of the kids who these movies are marked towards. I also can’t help but notice that this project is being revealed just a week after Dimension announced their remake plans for Short Circuit, and both of *these* movies seem a lot like Pixar’s Wall-E (especially Short Circuit, but this one as well). It feels like Hollywood types are seeing that Wall-E will be a huge hit, and they are getting their Wall-E-ish projects in quick order to ride the robotic wave. So, by that logic, expect Marvel Comics to announce a H.E.R.B.I.E. movie next?DUBYA’S INNER CIRCLE EXPANDSCasting continued this week on Oliver Stone’s W, about the rise and political success of George W. Bush, with Rob Corddry (The Daily Show) landing the role of press secretary Ari Fleischer, Fantastic Four star Ioan Gruffudd to play Tony Blair and Thandie Newton signing on to play (the much older) Condoleeza Rice. Yet to be cast are some of the biggest names, including Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (despite early word that Robert DuVall had been approached). These casting announcements are sort of overshadowed, however, by the publication online of actual pages from the script, which paint a very specific picture of the approach that Stone is taking with this project. Read them yourself, a review of the entire script at Slate.com or see what some experts think.HOW TO BE CYNICAL ABOUT LOVE BY 30This week saw two different studios pick up movie rights to articles about love and relationships, which I always find kind of odd. But, I guess it worked for Sex and the City (which was also a book, I know), so maybe that’s where they’re coming from. How to Get Divorced by 30, picked up by Universal from an article in L.A. Weekly, suggests that it’s best to get your first marriage out of the way early so you can find love the second time around. How modern. Tobey Maguire and Warner Independent have likewise picked up the rights to Marry Him! Finding Mr. Real, an article which is becoming a book (changing the subtitle to Mr. Good Enough), which encourages women to drop their standards low. So, basically, it’s going to be a feature-length version of that old MAD TV sketch, Lowered Expectations? Changing the subject a bit, but still related to Maguire, Endgame Entertainment this week picked up rights to a thriller script called Hungry Rabbit Jumps, for Maguire to star in, which they are saying is similar to David Fincher’s The Game, starring Michael Douglas.MORE LIKE THE PRINCE OF PEORIADisney’s live-action adaptation of the Prince of Persia video game series was the focus of a good deal of casting buzz this week, starting with the (quickly debunked) rumor that the Prince might be played by Orlando Bloom, followed by Latino Review’s story that the role might instead now be offered instead to Jake Gyllenhaal. Never mind, I guess, that he isn’t you know… Persian, or even Middle Eastern. He’s got dark hair though, which I guess Disney figures is close enough.On the next page: the rest of the “Ketchup”…SHAKING THE REST OF THE KETCHUP OUT OF THIS WEEK’S BOTTLEThe trailer for the ensemble drama (Charlize Theron, Ray Liotta, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Rodriguez), Battle for Seattle, telling the stories of people from all sides of the 1999 World Trade Organizatin riots in Seattle, is now online.Apparently inspired by the success of Cloverfield, Columbia Pictures and producer Neil Moritz (XXX, I Am Legend) have picked up the script, Battle: Los Angeles, about a platoon of Marines fighting off an alien invasion in the streets of Los Angeles and Santa Monica, with plans to fast track the project in time to start filming in the next six months.MGM has acquired the rights to Bobism, a comedy about a teenager who discovers that his blog is the basis for a utopian socity 1,000 years in the future.Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway will costar in Bride Wars, about two friends who both pick the same wedding date, with Candice Bergen playing a famous wedding planner, and Gary Winick (13 Going on 30, Pieces of April) directing.The independent comedy, Divorce Ranch, will star Chloe Sevigny as a World War II-era actress who moves to a ranch in Nevada (along with her assistant, played by Zooey Deschanel) in the hopes of securing a quickie divorce.The CGI animated version of Gatchaman has apparently hit a bump, as its director, Kevin Munroe (who did TMNT for the same company) has dropped out, so that he can work on an adaptation of the graphic novel, Dylan Dog, instead. Dylan Dog is an Italian series that sort of does for a “traditional” monster hunter what Constantine did for a hunter of more demonic origins. I haven’t read it but Dylan Dog also appears to take more of a surreal/humorous approach.With no other information known about it other than it being a “sci fi epic”, Universal won a bidding war against three studios for the rights to produce Earth vs Moon, from the creators of The Joe Schmoe Show, that fake reality show from a few years back about a guy who didn’t realize the show was fake. The best guess I can come up with is that maybe this movie will likewise deal with subterfuge, and be a sort of Wag the Dog, but with (fake/staged) attackers from the Moon instead. Again, please note, just a guess.Jane Austen’s Emma, which was also the inspiration for Clueless, has been targeted by Screen Gems (Sony) and one of the screenwriters of Menace 2 Society, as the basis for a hip hop musical called Emme, which is expected to have at least 15 song and dance numbers.After doing two documentaries about Iraq, famed filmmaker Errol Morris is returning to more eccentric subject material (like the guys featured in his Fast, Cheap and Out of Control) with The End of Everything, which will reportedly include coverage of flightless birds, a volcano, the author of Gone with the Wind and Laura Bush.ThinkFilm has acquired U.S. rights to The Escapist, a British prison drama starring Brian Cox and Joseph Fiennes, that premiered in January at Sundance.Robert de Niro, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell are headlining Everybody’s Fine, an English-language remake of the 1990 Italian film of the same (English) title, about a widower (de Niro) who goes on a road trip after his wife’s death to reconnect with his three children, only to discover that their adult lives are really screwed up. The remake was written and will be directed by Kirk Jones, whose first film was the very funny and touching Waking Ned Devine.Walt Disney Pictures has picked up rights to a comedy script called Family Dude, about a successful executive who hires a family to pose as his own while he meets with clients at a cowboy ranch in Montana, in a story that in no way resembles City Slickers. The producer is Walt Becker, who directed Wild Hogs, and is currently filming its sequel, Old Dogs, starring John Travolta, Bernie Mac and Robin Williams.The trailer for horror master Dario Argento’s next film, The Mother of Tears, starring his daughter Asia Argento (and Udo Kier!), is now online, just as the news has come out of his next project, Giallo, which will star Adrien Brody as an Italian investigator who teams up with a flight attendant who fears that her sister has been abducted by a serial killer named Yellow (which Giallo is Italian for).Rogue Pictures has recruited hot genre screenwriter Justin Marks (Voltron, Masters of the Universe and Supermax, starring DC Comics’ Green Arrow) to adapt Hack/Slash, a comic book series (and series of one-shots and mini’s) about Cassie Hack, a seductively dressed woman who travels the country, killing serial killers and other such bad guys. Todd Lincoln, who worked on the special effects for From Dusk Til Dawn will be making his directorial debut.Even though High School Musical 3 won’t be hitting theaters until this fall, Disney is already working on plans for High School Musical 4, which may see the series return to the small screen (like the first two), and will probably not feature all of the returning cast. If #3 is a huge, super hit like many expect, however, expect that some of the variables mentioned in that article to possibly change.Jim Carrey, Ewan MacGregor and Leslie Mann are signed on to star in I Love You, Phillip Morris, about a prison inmate (Carrey) who falls in love with the prisoner in the cell next to him. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the writing team behind Bad Santa and Cats &amp; Dogs, will be making their directorial debuts on this comedy.Two clips of Iron Man appeared online this week, at SciFi.com and Apple.com.The giant shark movie, Meg, which has been struggling through film development for over a decade now, appears to have gotten a new chance at actually getting made, according to an article in the L.A. Times which is worth reading not just for that news, but for the extension that it covers this project’s many twists and turns through the Hollywood blockbuster system.Even as his Supernatural costar, Jared Palecki, is starring in the Friday the 13th remake, Jensen Ackles has himself signed on to star in a horror remake, My Bloody Valentine.Production of the 12 shorts that will make up New York, I Love You is in full swing in that city, with lots of famous stars and directors at work. Check out the coverage at Variety, The Hollywood Reporter or IGN Movies for some extensive lists and coverage.Davis Entertainment (Eragon) has picked up the rights to North Wind, an indie comic book about a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles.Director Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man, Rescue Dawn) has signed on with Focus Pictures to rewrite and direct The Piano Tuner, an adaptation of a 2002 novel about a British piano tuner in the 1800s who travels to Burma to fix an eccentric military officer’s piano, where he falls in love with a local woman, and inspires people with music.Barry Josephson, one of the producers of Enchanted, has acquired the rights to the spec script, Smash, which basically sounds like Footloose, but in the “world” of rural demolition derbys.Rapper 50 Cent will star in the independent drama, Spectacular Regret, directed by Joshua Leonard (one of the three stars of The Blair Witch Project), as a famous death row inmate awaiting his execution.Ving Rhames has joined the cast of The Surrogates, in which Bruce Willis plays a cop who investigates crimes through a robot (his “surrogate” in the real world. Rhames will play the leader of a cult devoted to ending the prevalance of mankind’s use of surrogates.Ernie Cline, the screenwriter behind the long-awaited (and apparently quite troubled) Fanboys, sold a script this week called Thundercade, which aims to do for old school video games what Fanboys did for fans of Star Wars, as an old school high scoring gamer discovers that his long-standing record has been broken, and so… he sets out to do something about that.The very large robot called Devastator (which is made up of 6 smaller Transformers, ala Voltron) is reportedly going to be making an appearance in Transformers 2, which is set to start filming soon in Pennsylvania. IESB.net has that news, and lots of character casting descriptions as well.Colin Farrell, Paz Vega and Christopher Lee have signed on to star in Triage, the next drama from Danis Tanovic, the Bosnian director of No Man’s Land.David Goyer’s horror project, Unborn, isn’t due to hit theaters until next year, but he’s already talking up his plans for Unborn 2.Producer Will Packer (Stomp the Yard) has acquired the rights to the life story of Kimba Smith, a college student who was charged with conspiracy to sell crack cocaine, and was ultimately pardoned by President Clinton.Production starts this month in Connecticut on the as-yet-untitled next project for Sam Mendes (American Beauty, and the upcoming Revolutionary Road, starring Leonardo DiCapro and Mendes’ wife, Kate Winslet). Written by novelist couple Dave Eggers (A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius) and Vendela Vida, the movie will star Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski as a couple looking all over the country for the best place to raise their child, with Toni Collette and Cheryl Hines also costarring.There’s a very nice video over at SuperHeroHype, giving us lots of glimpses at the sets of Watchmen, which sort of debunk the idea that the movie is a completely CGI affair like 300.Natalie Portman has signed on for the lead female role of Catherine Earnshaw in the new version of Wuthering Heights, which was adapted by Olivia Hetreed (Girl with a Pearl Earring) and will be directed by John Maybury (The Jacket).Greg Dean Schmitz can be contacted via his MySpace page, there’s the RT Forums thread devoted to him, and his IMDb discussion thread is currently a very lonely place.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Competition, italian, psychological, FX, Tumblr, Syfy, Mirror","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Toy-Story-3-Cars-2-and-more-from-Pixar"},{"id":"47509237232468","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Green Lantern and Ant-Man News, and a Discussion of the Hulk Trailer","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Green Lantern and Ant-Man News, and a Discussion of the Hulk TrailerPlus news of a possible Robocop refreshby Greg Dean Schmitz | March 14, 2008 |  CommentsLET THOSE WHO WORSHIP EVIL’S MIGHT, BEWARE MY POWER… GREEN LANTERN‘S LIGHT!Greg Berlanti, the TV wunderkind behind shows like Dirty Sexy Money, Brothers and Sisters and Eli Stone is eyeing to make his first big budget feature film with a project that is decidedly unlike any of his TV shows (with the possible exception of the Eli Stone dream sequences), cowriting and directing the long-awaited Green Lantern movie. With several different human character having worn the Green Lantern ring since the characters 1940s roots, what and who exactly Green Lantern is depends upon the individual fan, and what their exposure has been. For kids who mostly know the recent Justice League cartoons, it might be John Stewart (being played by rapper Common in the JLA movie, a separate project). The classic hero, I think, however is pilot Hal Jordan, and from what I’ve heard, that is who Berlanti is focusing on for this movie. Hal Jordan’s tenure as Green Lantern is the longest, and with a later career as a destructive villain, the darkest and most interesting character arc that could be played out over a few movies, potentially. Berlanti sounds like he really loves the Green Lantern property, so I’m excited to see what he comes up with.HEAVY METAL IIIDirector extraordinaire David Fincher is teaming up with Paramount Pictures to develop a third animated Heavy Metal anthology project, which will feature the contributions of eight or nine of today’s most visually creative directors (we hope), including one directed by Fincher himself. For the unitiated, Heavy Metal is a fantasy/sci-fi magazine that is mostly a showcase of European artists who specialize in the bizarre, erotic and visually bold. Its popularity peaked in the 1970s and 1980s (but it’s still going), and inspired two previous animated anthology movies, a fairly high profile 1980 release, and a less well known 2000 movie. This is exactly the sort of project that I honestly wouldn’t have predicted (since the 2000 edition came and went with so little notice, but with someone like David Fincher involved, all of a sudden, it seems like such an obviously potentially awesome project. Woo. Of course, David Fincher is also the kind of creative person who seems to attach himself to a lot of stuff over the years. This one, though, being an animated short, probably does have a chance of him getting it done sooner than say, any one of his other 11 or 12 projects in development. Fincher’s next live-action film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, starring Brad Pitt, will be released late this year.REMAKES! THEY’RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER… BABY, YOU’LL REMEMBER THEIR NAMESMGM announced this week that they’ve hired a 23-year-old MTV dance choreographer, Kevin Tancharoen, to direct a feature film remake of Fame, that 1980 chestnut about the lives of students at a New York performing arts high school. Gosh, a “high school musical”, what an original concept for the early 21st century youth market! Someone like Disney should get right on this… maybe do a couple of made-for-TV projects first, and then make a third movie for a theatrical release. Anyway, there’s no word yet about whether the remake will be literal enough to actually include the original movie’s songs, if there will be all new music, or really, how much singing there will be (the dancing is a given, though).MGM isn’t stopping there, however. AICN found a press release today that includes references to other film franchises that the studio is planning on focusing on, and in the remake department, the list includes The Outer Limits, Deathwish and Robocop. I’m fairly ambivalent about The Outer Limits and Deathwish, with the first just being a nice umbrella title for a new anthology series, and Deathwish being a fairly formulaic 1970s series that I never really invested much interest in, besides just enjoying Charles Bronson being a badass. Robocop, however, as the AICN guys points out, is a trickier concept to bring into the 21st century and really do justice to the first movie better than its sequels did. Robocop was violent nearly to the point of satire, but it was done more of a social message than just for the sake of exploitation.HOW MANY BIG BUDGET DISASTER MOVIES ARE DIRECTED BY TWO TIME OSCAR WINNERS?After winning two Oscars for The Incredibles and Ratatouille, one of Pixar’s top directors, Brad Bird, has signed to return to work for Warner Bros, the studio that majorly botched the release of The Iron Giant, back in those grey days when animation was not seen as being particularly financially promising theatrically. Bird is giving the studio a second chance on his live-action debut, a disaster movie called 1906 set during the San Francisco earthquake and the resulting fires that destroyed most of the city. The story revolves around a college student whose investigation of his father’s death leads him to uncover a conspiracy that makes San Francisco vulnerable to the impending disaster. Bird is reworking a script by John Logan (The Aviator) which has been kicking around in development for quite a while, I seem to remember (dating back to the post-Titanic time when every studio wanted their own big budget disaster movie). Just another example of how long projects take to get produced in Hollywood sometimes, if they get made at all.TODAY, WE CELEBRATE OUR…Wolfgang Petersen (Troy, Poseidon) has signed on with Columbia (Sony) to direct Uprising, a sci-fi action movie about humanity’s attempt to fight back after an alien race has successfully invaded and taken over Earth, which of course, sounds a lot like Independence Day, but that was also now over 10 years ago, so I guess it’s fair game to have its concept redone by another big budget event movie. It’s not like alien invasions are some sort of super original thing that hasn’t been done in some way or another dozens of times (just that this particular byline does sound a lot like ID4, or Battlefield Earth, I suppose). The script is being worked on by Charles Leavitt, who also wrote K-Pax, which also had an alien-related themes (sort of).TETROOOOOO!!!!!Francis Ford Coppola’s (Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now) is set to start filming in late March in Buenos Aires on his next film, Tetro. Reportedly based on Coppola’s own experiences, Tetro is the tale of the conflicts that arise between the male members of a family known for its creativity, focusing on a multigenerational family of Italian-Argentinians. The cast is led by Vincent Gallo (Buffalo 66) (replacing Matt Dillon who had been previously announced), Javier Bardem (No Country for Old Men) and Maribel Verdu (Y Tu Mama Tambien), and you can probably expect Tetro to be released in Oscar season, late 2009 or so.ANT-MAN, ANT-MAN, DOES WHATEVER AN… ANT CANShaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright revealed recently that he’s working on the second draft of the Ant-Man adaptation, which promises to be a slightly less comedic film than what he’s known for (but not humorless, I would guess), including the news that the story will actually involve both men who have called themselves Ant-Man in the comics: Dr. Hank Pym and criminal-turned-good-guy, Scott Lang. I think it’s very interesting that both are included, because Ant-Man is probably one of the “Avengers Prelude” movies (along with Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, etc), I can’t help but wonder if this movie might not actually produce more than Ant-Man. If Scott Lang comes out of the movie being Ant-Man, that could leave room for Hank Pym to become Giant-Man/Goliath in the Avengers movie (really big guy instead of a really tiny guy). Anyway, I can’t say I’ve been super-fascinated with movies about teensy-tiny people (The Incredible Shrinking Man, etc), but the idea of a superhero who ride around on a flying ant is inherently cool on some level. He’s got a massive white helmet too.HULK SMASH… RHINO-LOOKING GREY CGI MONSTERIf you’ve turned on your computer this week, you probably know that the Incredible Hulk trailer debuted Wednesday on MTV. The good news, no… awesome news, is that the Hulk himself looks pretty much perfect. Understandably, the CGI work is not done yet, so there may be some shading (or whatever) issues, but just to compare this Hulk with the Ang Lee version, he looks much more like the Hulk I’ve read about for thirty some years now. Not faring as well, however, is the Abomination, a classic Hulk villain who has had *some* revisionism applied to his look over the years, but basically, his classic look is a very tall reptilian monstrosity with big triangular ears, all sorts of ugly bumps on his face, and huge teeth. The Abomination of the comics is taller, and less dense than the Hulk, and has his super strength all the time, whereas the Hulk has to “Hulk out” by getting angry to fuel his strength. Anyway… the Abomination in this trailer looks pretty much nothing like any comic form I’ve ever seen for him, and instead looks a bit like the Spider-Man villain “Rhino”. Anyway, director Louis Leterrier has done a text commentary for the trailer, and he defends the Abomination’s look, but I’m not really buying it. The action still looks great (a 26 minute Hulk vs Abomination destruction fest at the end!), but I’m just frustrated that a movie that seems to have so much going for it flaked out on something that should be so obligatory as getting a classic villain’s look at least close.YOU WILL BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY… AGAINDirector Bryan Singer confirmed this week that he will indeed be returning for the sequel to Superman Returns (probably to be titled Superman: Man of Steel), and addressed concerns about how he adapted the character the first time around. Singer says the goal for the second movie is to up the ante, with a higher body count and “unrelenting terror.” So far, the world has seen five big budget Superman movies, and it is true that none of them (except maybe Superman II) really pitted the Big Blue Boy Scout against a danger that was truly, emotionally frightening enough to warrant the abilities of such an unstoppable hero. Yes, the challenges were “big”, but not you know, “Doomsday” big (I speak of the villain). Not that I would necessarily want to see the “Death of Superman” storyline done (actually, I specifically don’t), but something like that would be preferable to the Lex Luthor storylines, especially considering what a lame villain he has been in the movies. I’ll give Bryan Singer free advice right here… an awesome Superman movie villain would be: DARKSEID.A HARBINGER OF X-MEN-ISH MOVIES TO COMEParamount acquired the rights this week to Harbinger, a relatively now-forgotten 1990s comic book series published by Valiant Comics, and created by former Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. I never read Harbinger, but what I gather is that its story involved young people with amazing abilities, in a (non-costume-wearing) spin on the X-Men, Marvel mutants, etc. That’s also a concept that NBC’s Heroes basically does as well. Anyway, if this movie gets made, the director that Paramount has in mind is Brett Ratner, who came aboard for the third X-Men movie, and turned out a loud, sloppy mess of an ensemble hero movie. Well, at least with Harbinger, it’s a superhero movie that not even most die-hard comic book fans have a whole lot invested in. So, he can basically do whatever he wants, and with low expectations, maybe we can only come out winners. Except, on a grander scale, whenever $100 million or so goes to a big budget superhero movie you don’t care about, that’s potentially one that a fan would really love, that doesn’t get made.TINTIN PLANPLANSA recent interview with Andy Serkis revealed some more details about the upcoming trilogy of motion capture movies based on the classic “TinTin” adventure comics being produced by Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg. Namely, that Spielberg’s movie will come first, Jackson’s will be second, and the director of the third is still unknown (and the list of rumored candidates is legion, including James Cameron, I’ve heard). Serkis also confirmed his own role in the movies, as Captain Haddock, the persistently cranky and blustrous bearded sailor who is one of TinTin’s most frequent companions.That’s it for this week.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

There are plenty of those, too, but the series, hosted by Bear Grylls, focuses on how six different environments — mountains, oceans, grasslands, jungles, deserts, and polar — are increasingly more punishing on the animals who live there.Grylls executive produces the show alongside Oscar-winning cinematographer Guillermo Navarro, BBC natural history grads Martha Holmes and Tom Hugh-Jones, and Grylls’ collaborator Delbert Shoopman — which means there is plenty of talent behind the camera too. They employed approximately 245 crew members during their 82 shoots, which covered more than 1300 days of filming and approximately 1800 hours of footage on all seven continents.The star, who’s bringing back his popular Running Wild series on Nat Geo later this year and is hosting the interactive series&nbsp;You vs. Wild on Netflix beginning April 10 — talked to Rotten Tomatoes about why Hostile Planet is different from other natural history shows.“I grew up on all the classic BBC Planet Earth, Blue Planet [series],” he said. “It was and still is incredible TV, but I suppose what we’re trying to do is really going to give it a really strong, powerful refresh and make it really powerful for a young generation of people who maybe have never experienced wildlife, natural history programming before.”He also told us what he’s watching on TV when he’s not camping out in the wilderness somewhere, and his answers might surprise you.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by National Geographic/Tanja Bayer)To be honest, I’m not a great TV watcher. But I think the things I end up watching are things that involve friends. Over the years I’ve got a few great friends who do TV, so I’ll watch other survival stuff and adventure-y stuff when they have things coming out. The landmark natural history stuff is always in my heart.What’s in your streaming queue?(Photo by ABC)I’m married and have a family and a lovely wife and children, so I end up watching things that they really like. [My wife] Shara at the moment is knee-deep in Netflix’s Money Heist. Because we’re traveling, she’s going, “Make sure you’ve watched up to episode 12, so when we get back we can watch the finale together.” So I’m on the plane catching up on this. I quite enjoy a bit of escapism like that. And actually, what I don’t enjoy is: I find long series that don’t conclude really annoying. And I think in the early days all these streaming services with hundreds of episodes, everyone would plow through it to get to episode 24 and then it still wouldn’t end. You’d think, “that was such a waste of time.” Shara did that with Nashville the other day. We watched the first 15, and I was hooked. We all loved it. It was great. And then I go, “There’s another series?” She goes, “Oh, there’s another seven series.” I go, “How many episodes?” She goes, “130 or so.” We’re not waiting 130 episodes. So I said, “Do me a favor, go to the last episode of season 6 or 7, watch it, tell me if I’ve missed anything.” She watched it, she went, “You didn’t miss anything.”What shows are on your DVR?We’re actually big fans of Amazon and Netflix stuff.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?(Photo by National Geographic/Holly Harrison)Nashville season 7. [Laughs]I really do think the natural history stuff is a strong one for us. I have quite a savvy family who are quite hard to please on TV stuff, but they watched the Hostile Planet trailer, and the boys have been texting me, and Shara has been going, “This looks insane!” They almost didn’t really know what I was doing, you know? They knew I was hosting it, but they hadn’t seen any of the footage, and just seeing a bit of it, they’ve all separately been texting me, “OK, this show looks insane.” So from a heart perspective, I’m really excited about that one, and I hope that there’ll be millions and millions of fans around the word. I think traditionally with natural history you’re meant to be wowed. Hostile Planet you go to be almost shocked, because it is hard reality of what a lot of animals are going through. I don’t often cry in programs, but there were definitely tears involved. I mean, we were doing the voiceover yesterday and just even doing the voiceover, it was quite emotional — when the elephants die in the drought and that whole thing.I am excited about Running Wild, because that is coming back to Nat Geo. We’re moving it from NBC after five seasons. It’s a really good pairing with Hostile Planet, and we’re signing some of the biggest guests we’ve ever had. I don’t know why it’s suddenly happened this year, but it’s been amazing. We’re in the middle of filming at the moment. That’s a big one. A lot of my TV focus at the moment is what we’re juggling. We’re finished Hostile Planet and now we’re rolling on to that.Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: How is Hostile Planet different from other natural history shows?I think a lot of these other ones that we all grew up with were celebrating the beauty of the world, but sometimes it’s almost like you’re looking at a picture, but you’re not seeing the reality of the hard stuff. Hostile Planet really shows that raw, difficult, heartbreaking, painful, hostile end of what wildlife are going through. And I think animals that have been on the edge already, climate change has now pushed them over the edge, but yet these creatures have this incredible resilience and adaptability and survival instinct. Under that pressure is this really amazing and beautiful and heartbreaking [spirit that is] powerful to see. Sometimes it’s a triumph and a lot of times it isn’t. But that is what Hostile Planet is showing: just how hostile the conditions are and what the wildlife are having to go through. It will make you cry. The other ones maybe made you cry because it was so beautiful, if you’re that way inclined, this one, even if you’re not that way inclined, you will cry because it’s very powerful.How do you tackle death on the show?Head on — but the thing is the animals tell that story, actually. And I think, again, beforehand maybe the genre just showed the animals, but now it really follows that journey, and often from different perspectives. So instead of celebrating the lion killing whatever, now it’s a story of the little fawn who, you know, 99 percent of the fawns are dead within their first hour because they’re so vulnerable on these plains. So now this flips it on its head and follows the little fawn deer, and how can they survive when they’re surrounded by hyenas? And that’s why it’s like, “Oh my God” when you watch it.So it’s different from a show like Nat Geo’s&nbsp;Savage Kingdom, for example, which just focuses on the predators. Right?This turns it on its head. This is about the survivors. How do these animals survive when they’re battling climate change, the terrain, and the predators?(Photo by National Geographic/Adrian Seymour)How deeply do you go into climate change and how do you talk about it on the show?We just show how finely balanced so many of these ecosystems are and the change that has happened over the last 150, 20, 10 years and the effects it’s having on animals. So when you see baby elephants dying in the drought after walking hundreds and hundreds of miles to their traditional watering holes and there’s nothing there, it’s pretty heartbreaking when you see it.Is there a call to action at all, or are you just hoping people will be inspired by the message?I think the call to action is awareness, if you can show people [what’s happening]. We live in a cynical world and we’re always battling apathy and cynicism, and the animal stories battle that the best.For Running Wild, you’ve had an insane list of people on the show. Who do you think coped the best with their surroundings?I always resist singling people out as the best or worst, because I never think that’s a particularly good vibe. But what I always say is that people often really surprise you, and I think I’ve learned not to judge books by their cover — especially with some of the ladies, who have just been remarkably resilient and strong and tenacious. I think it’s inspiring because they often don’t expect it themselves because they’ve never done anything like this before. And it’s a reminder that the wild doesn’t care what color you are, what gender you are, how big or small your bank account is. It rewards character and tenaciousness and facing your fears. So that’s always been an inspiring thing for me.Which current celebrities would you love to have on the show?I’ve always had three that I’ve really dreamt of getting on the show. We haven’t got them for five seasons, but I think we’re going to get them in this season. So that’s pretty cool. But we’re not going to say who it is.Is there any pie in the sky person you want?Three of them, and we’re getting them.(Photo by National Geographic/Oliver Clague)Why do you think people are drawn to shows about nature?I think because it’s real and it’s often about families. I think we all relate to that. We all care about our families and then you see it in the wildlife sense, and it’s often so heartbreaking when families are separated and then worse than that when babies lose their lives. And that’s why Hostile Planet is so powerful. It shows warts and all. I think there’s always going to be a hunger in all of us for natural things. You can’t fight hundreds of thousands of years of DNA in us and to think in 50 years suddenly we’re not going to be interested in the wild or adventure or things of the heart because it’s deep in our DNA, that’s [silly]. I think that’s why people love Running Wild. There is something about starting a fire. Why is that exciting for people? But if they’ve never done it before and they’re cold and they’re shivering and they’re desperate and it’s a really powerful moment.What was something that surprised you about producing Hostile Planet and not having to be out in the field as much?Well, I still am out in the field. The only thing that’s changed is now we’re executive producing as well. The privilege of doing that on all of our shows is that it means we pick where we go when we go and the people we go with. And when you spend the amount of time away as we do as a team, it makes a huge difference to be able to have the control to say, “I want to work with great friends and the people that have been alongside me through many adventures.” So for me, executive producing is a privilege of that. And also making sure the stories are told right and truthfully rather than leaving that power to someone else.Hostile Planet airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on National Geographic Channel.Like this?

After stints in between as a wife of Henry VIII on The Tudors and Glinda in NBC’s dark Wizard of Oz retelling Emerald City, she returns this Sunday on The Rook.Richardson plays Linda Farrier, the head of a top-secret government agency for people with paranormal abilities. And while the series is based on a book of the same name, the show quickly diverges from Daniel O’Malley’s work into its own story — one with three potential endings, Richardson told Rotten Tomatoes when we caught up with her ahead of the premiere.That’s one reason why the star told us she’s excited to actually watch the series. We also discussed what she’s been watching recently — she was a big fan of Fleabag, and watched it weekly while it was airing in the U.K. (it was released all at once on Amazon Prime Video in the U.S.). Ahead of The Rook’s premiere on Sunday, June 30, find out more about Richardson’s streaming queue and what to expect from her new series.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by Steve Schofield/Amazon Prime)I tend to watch more in the evening, when it gets dark. The last two things I watched in completion were Fleabag, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Ricky Gervais’&nbsp;After Life, and I just loved both of them. With Fleabag, I watched it weekly. And also, I happened to be in one place in London at the time that it was showing, and I watched season 2, and then I went back and watched season 1.What’s in your streaming queue?Usually I catch up with things later. After Life, I watched later, and I watched that pretty much back to back.What shows are on your DVR?(Photo by Netflix)Right now I’m on the move constantly, so I have yet to crack into a new series. So, I’m tending to watch one-off films. I still want to watch Black Mirror. I’m late to the game on that. I think it’s fantastic that we live in the time where we hit this golden age for television, where there’s just such a high standard.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?I’m excited about seeing The Rook too, because having not watched it. Even though, obviously, part of the story is what I had imagined based on the script. I don’t know the ending. So, honestly, hand on heart, it’s The Rook — just because I like the people that were involved so much, and I’m really curious to see that next.(Photo by Ed Miller/Starz)Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: I’ve watched a couple of episodes of the show, but I have to confess I’m still not 100 percent sure what’s going on.Richardson: Sometimes I feel like that. When I start a new book, I’m like, “Oh, I don’t know if I understand this well.” But I just trust it, and then it all becomes clear. It all will become clear in the series. To me, obviously, it’s clear. It’s a government agency, a secret service. They have very subtle superpowers, but we don’t know what’s going on in the bigger picture, and it [eventually] reveals itself and the character motivations. Someone at the premiere said they really loved the way each episode wasn’t all wrapped up. Lots of elements are left hanging, and I like that too, because it’s too easy if you know exactly what’s going on.Did you read the book on which the series is based?We were told not to. Immediately after I signed on, I thought, “Great. Time to read the book.” And then everyone said no. Although it’s the same premise, this is different. It will be misleading. So I didn’t read the book.And like all series television — because I remember this from Nip/Tuck — you never know what the next episode’s going to be. It’s so exciting as an actor to look forward to getting the next script. As an actor doing a TV series, you live episode by episode, because you don’t know what’s going to happen to your character in the next one. Will they be good? Will they be bad? You need to cover your bases at all times.Speaking of Nip/Tuck, what you think of Ryan Murphy’s success? What was it like working on that show?I think Ryan Murphy is quite spectacular. I was watching the French Open and Rafael Nadal won his 12th, I think, and the commentators were saying there’s just some extraordinary thing he has. He’s not normal. And although Ryan is normal, he does have superpowers in terms of his output in writing and directing and producing. He’s just a phenomenal talent, basically. And not just in terms of his creative output, but I know that he was one of the first to implement the 50/50 in terms of diversity and female employment, and in terms of crew members. He also does that too.The Rook was very heavy on the 50/50 crew as well — in fact, we had far more female directors than we did male. And Ryan, I think, was very much part of initiating that. The Rook, it was fantastic. It wasn’t just in terms of directors were women. It was also — speaking selfishly for a moment — these great female characters.(Photo by Steffan Hill/Starz)What was it like to work on such a female-centric show, particularly in a genre that isn’t necessarily known for that?When I received the script, I thought, “Oh, this is really interesting. It’s going in a new direction,” with Myfanwy losing her memory. Everyone is completely intrigued by the secret service and spy world. In terms of playing Lady Farrier, I looked at the tapes of Stella Rimington, who, surprisingly, as a woman, was the head of MI5. Margaret Thatcher as first female Prime Minister. These women did have positions of great authority and it’s important that that’s represented.What’s your character like? How does she fit into the mystery?Well, she’s the king in terms of chess pieces. The premise of the show is obviously everything I just said, but also, in episode 1, Myfanwy touches the chess board, and that’s quite a key moment. And then it reveals a secret room that she has, and Farrier’s the king, and Grantchester, Adrian Lester, is the queen, and everyone has their positions. It’s multi-layered. It’s a spy thriller, but playing on many different levels.So although I’m set up as the king, most people within the agency are fighting for that position. In an ambitious world, people want the top jobs. Then there’s Myfanwy, who has this extraordinary ability and is, in some respects, the chosen one. Having not seen it, I don’t know quite how it plays out, but Linda Farrier is sort of the backbone. She’s very much the structure of the agency.(Photo by Warren Orchard/Starz)You’ve only seen the premiere so far, but what can you say how the season ends?I don’t even know what the exact ending is. We definitely shot two, but there was a third in the script. So I don’t even know what the ending is! I have a very good idea. Obviously, I’m not going to say. But you see why I said I wanted to watch The Rook? Because I don’t know the ending.Will it open new questions for a potential season 2, or is it closed-ended?I don’t know the end of it, so I can’t say. I think we just scratched the surface on it, actually. There are so many potential storylines to play out. But who knows? The viewers will answer that question.The Rook premieres Sunday, June 30 at 8 p.m. on Starz.Like this?

She also talks about moving from acting to directing, aliens and reboots, and the new episode of Roswell, New Mexico she directed.by Sophie-Marie Prime | March 19, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Noam Galai/WireImage)Shiri Appleby has been&nbsp;on TV since&nbsp;before she was a teenager.&nbsp;Early on,&nbsp;she guest-starred in&nbsp;shows like&nbsp;7th Heaven and&nbsp;Baywatch, and more recently,&nbsp;she headlined&nbsp;Lifetime’s acclaimed Bachelor-skewering drama&nbsp;UnREAL. But the actress’&nbsp;game-changing role was the lead in 1999’s&nbsp;Roswell&nbsp;— a sci-fi&nbsp;drama series that began with her character, New Mexico high-schooler Liz, being shot and brought back to life by an alien.Now,&nbsp;Appleby is stepping behind the camera — and returning to one of her most iconic roles to do so.&nbsp;She’s directing the Tuesday, March 19 episode of&nbsp;Roswell, New Mexico, a reboot of her late ’90s series. Both iterations of&nbsp;Roswell feature aliens, romance, and feelings of otherness, but in the new series, the characters are 10 years older and their conflicts are much more contemporary.“You know, [in] our show, these kids were in high school and the alien theme was about how everyone felt in high school — you felt out of place and you didn’t feel like you belonged,” Appleby told Rotten Tomatoes of the original Roswell. “In today’s story, these kids are in their late 20s and the alien is about illegal immigration. It feels very timely and very relevant.”Her&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;Roswell, New Mexico&nbsp;episode, “Songs About Texas,” will be&nbsp;a first for Appleby.&nbsp;In the past, she’s directed TV episodes in which she also starred. This time, she’s staying behind the camera, but that doesn’t mean she’ll stop acting — she says she’s&nbsp;just “taking a minute” to find the right long-term role.Ahead of the episode, Appleby&nbsp;told us about what she’s been bingeing lately and what’s coming soon&nbsp;for her career — both in front of and behind the camera.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by Byron Cohen / Touchstone Television / Courtesy Everett Collection)The last time I did that I was watching Felicity… That should tell you how many years it’s been. I used to love that show. It was my absolute favorite. There was nothing better than Keri Russell. Right?What’s in your streaming queue?(Photo by Hulu)Right now I’m watching Russian Doll. I love Russian Doll … I have been watching Light as a Feather on Hulu. I’m going to direct two episodes of it, so I’ve been really bingeing on that show. I think it’s so charming and wonderful. I was also watching a lot of Pretty Little Liars because I just directed an episode of The Perfectionists. And, I am going to go — which is so funny — to my Netflix account right now so I can tell you what else I’ve been watching.I love to watch a lot of documentaries. I was watching, let’s see, I watched the Fyre documentaries on both Hulu and Netflix. I still watch Stranger Things… I like watching My Next Guest [Needs No Introduction] with David Letterman. I love that.What shows are on your DVR?(Photo by Courtesy of Netflix)I don’t watch real TV anymore! I watched Tidying Up with Marie Kondo, and I’ve been cleaning out my closet obsessively since then.What’s coming soon that you’re excited for?(Photo by ABC/Eric McCandless)The Fix. My best friend, Robin Tunney, has a new show premiering on Monday night on ABC, so I cannot wait to watch every single episode of that.Sophie-Marie Prime for Rotten Tomatoes: Did you go back and watch any of the original Roswell&nbsp;while preparing to direct your episode?Well, I had made every single episode, so I felt very confident that I didn’t need to watch it again and see myself as a 20-year-old. I was just going to let myself go and be immersed in the world that they’ve created.Have you been in contact with any of the original cast at all? I know Jason Behr sent you flowers on your first day.Yeah, Jason and I are still in touch. I’ve been actually texting with Katherine Heigl a lot. Colin Hanks I see, and he’s texted. Majandra [Delfino] lives maybe three blocks away from me so I run into her. It’s such a small, little, tiny community. When you think about that experience, it’s like friends from high school. You know, you kind of pick up right where you left off.We all came from such different backgrounds and we’re going through this really out-of-body experience together. It’s kind of fun to get back to each other and see each other. Everyone has kids now, and [it’s fun] to see what’s happened with their lives and their careers.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. / Courtesy Everett Collection)What do you and the rest of the original cast think of the reboot?It’s like building a legacy. It’s a complete compliment. I just feel incredibly flattered.What was your first impression when you saw the pilot for the new series?I thought they did an incredible job of having some very iconic moments that we share: like Liz getting shot in the Crashdown Café and Max coming over and saving her life&nbsp;— those really big moments that were very much a big thread of the original series. Then very quickly it becomes its own show, which I thought was so smart, and it tackles these bigger topics.You know, our show, these kids were in high school and the alien theme was about how everyone felt in high school. You felt out of place and you didn’t feel like you belonged. In today’s story, these kids are in their late 20s and the alien is about illegal immigration. It feels very timely and very relevant.(Photo by Lewis Jacobs/The CW)How is it working with Jeanine Mason as the new Liz?I just couldn’t pick someone better to take over the role. She is so impressive as both an actress and a human being. We really had a great time finding ways to get creative with the performance and doing different things. She was just really up for it all. I had a really wonderful time. It felt very much like passing the baton forward. I love what she’s created with this new Liz.What role did the original Roswell play in your career as an actress?Well, it’s so funny, it’s playing a similar role as a director. It really changed my life. I went from a girl that was in high school and I had worked since I was a young kid, but it gave me a career. It really was like everything was “before Roswell” and “after Roswell.”Now I’ve been making this transition into directing, and Roswell is the first show that’s given me a job directing where I’m not acting. Because they gave it to me, Marlene King felt more comfortable giving me an episode directing&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars, and now Hulu is giving me two more episodes of Light as a Feather. It’s just continuing to build. Again, Roswell has come in and just been an incredible, huge part of my journey as a director.(Photo by Lifetime)You’ve had such a diverse career on TV. Do you have any favorite roles that you’ve played?I have this wall in our house where I have my costumes in frames. I have the Roswell gunshot [costume] framed and my mic from Life Unexpected, and then I have Rachel Goldberg’s T-shirt that says “This is What a Feminist Looks Like” with a green coat and her little fanny pack [from UnREAL].&nbsp;Those were definitely my iconic roles.And Girls was an incredible part for me. It really pushed the envelope. To be on a show that was so culturally relevant was really game changing.&nbsp;I think working on Mike Nichols’ movie&nbsp;Charlie Wilson’s War with Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams and Emily Blunt&nbsp;— to be surrounded by all of these incredible talents and feel like I had a real seat at the table — that really changed things for me as well.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. / Courtesy: Everett Collection.)How and when did you decide to jump from acting to directing? Did you always know that was something you wanted to do?When I did Roswell, there weren’t female directors. We had 61 episodes and we had one female director on the last episode. I didn’t grow up seeing an image of a female director, so I never thought it was something that I could have. I definitely spent my time in editing during Roswell and asked a lot of questions and paid attention, but during my 20s, you just didn’t see it.Then when I was on Life Unexpected they brought on a female director, Liz Allen, and it really kind of rocked my world. Through my relationship with her, she was like, “You can do this.” I started shadowing a lot after I got off Life Unexpected. That’s where I was like, “OK, this is something that I can do.”By the time I did UnREAL, I came to them right away, and I was like, “I have done my homework. I am prepared. I would really love an opportunity.” I’m really grateful to them that in the second season they gave me an episode to direct. I ended up doing four during the course of the series.What has your experience been like directing a show that you’re also acting in, versus something like Roswell, New Mexico&nbsp;and Pretty Little Liars where you’re not appearing on screen?The difference is that you’re not really splitting your focus, but at the same time when you’re directing and acting, it’s pretty powerful. You know, you’re really in it and you can really command the energy of a scene because your acting is putting that out. So, you can really craft how you want it to be.When you’re not acting in it, when you’re sitting back, you can take a breather and really see the scope of the piece. I think it’s incredibly rewarding to work in this space. All this information that I’ve learned and all of these tricks of the trade, of crafting an episode of performance and an episode of TV — to be able to push that information forward and share with these young actors and watch their performance blossom, it is so gratifying. It’s a way of giving back in some ways, and I am just really relishing it.(Photo by Lewis Jacobs/The CW)It’s mentorship from a totally different angle.Absolutely. You know, there are directors that come through your career that really give you these little nuggets that change the way you work. I try to give it as much as I can, because I want to have an impact in the few days that I’m with them.Do you think that there will be an opportunity for you to appear on screen in Roswell, New Mexico?Carina MacKenzie&nbsp;— she’s so talented — if she wants to figure out a way, I’ll do it.&nbsp;Can you share anything else about your upcoming projects? Do you have any on-screen appearances planned?I did an episode of Law &amp; Order: SVU and Lucy Liu was directing it. That was really fun. I just did an episode of Drunk History that aired. But, quite honestly, following up Rachel Goldberg on UnREAL, there are big shoes to fill. I’m just kind of taking a minute to find the right thing… because I really want to give it my all and find the next right character and the next right story.Roswell, New Mexico episode “Songs About Texas” airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. on The CWLike this?

I’m on episode 4 [of season 3], and I love it. Olivia Colman!&nbsp;I mean:&nbsp;The Favourite, Fleabag. She was amazing in Fleabag. So, that’s what I’m into right now:&nbsp;The Crown. Oh, and I’m watching Succession, which I’m obsessed with. Every single actor on that show delivers. I am glued to every single performance. I think they are all so brilliant; they have incredible chemistry, all of them. I love that show. I think there’s also something very juicy about it. You hate to love watching these people. It’s very Shakespearean.WHAT IS COMING SOON THAT YOU CAN’T WAIT FOR?(Photo by Ursula Coyote/Netflix)Messiah!Aaron Pruner for Rotten Tomatoes: This isn’t the first time you’ve starred in a series about a religious figure’s following, and the fears and suspicions that can arise from such a movement. Once The Path was over, were you looking to continue in this realm?Michelle Monaghan: Honestly, I was just coming off The Path and I had no intention of going back to work. And then James McTeigue, who’s the director, whom I’ve known personally for several years, he contacted me and said, “I’m going to send you this script. We’re doing this thing at Netflix.” And I was like, “Listen, I don’t think this will work.” And then I saw the title and I was like, “I’m definitely not [interested].” I had just come off The Path, this isn’t my thing. I’m an actor into a lot of different genres, you know? And then they sent me the 10 episodes, and I spent an afternoon reading it, and I was hooked. The equivalent to binging — binge-reading — I did it. At the end of the day, I was like, “Man, I gotta do this!”(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix )It also feels like you’re flipping the proverbial coin on the “Is it a religious movement or cult” theme, here.Monaghan:&nbsp;The Path had a very insular perspective. You had one sort of leader, and it took place on a compound. When I did read this and saw the juxtaposition of those ideas, I was like, “Oh, wow, this is really interesting to explore.” And the characters are so very different, as well.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)Other recent streaming shows have presented their stories on a global scale — for example, Amazon’s Hanna filmed all over Europe and Netflix’s Sense8,&nbsp;which James McTeigue worked on, shot all over the globe — was that part of the appeal of working on Messiah, for you?Monaghan:&nbsp;Yeah. I think really, for me, what stood out was obviously the global scope of the show. I had never really been a part of anything like that: an international cast. It was such a great, unique opportunity to be a part of something that I think is really important that is not just, specifically, a western point of view. It is about multiple perspectives, it’s very multi-cultural and raises all those ideas and belief systems. So that was one of the main drivers for me to be in it.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)So then, I’m assuming you got to travel to some interesting locations for the production.&nbsp;Yes. We shot Jordan for Israel. We shot in Iman and all around that area. For me, that was also part of the decision; I didn’t want to be in the middle of the desert out here in L.A. shooting green screen for the Middle East. I really didn’t want to do that. Understanding the level of commitment and dedication to the story. As an actor, when you’re embarking on any role, you can be anywhere that is practical to what you’re doing. So, to be able to be in that atmosphere, that environment, and interacting with that culture … you know, any culture is only going to serve us, and it did. It left an indelible mark on me.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)There’s something about being exposed to other cultures, other ways of life, and accepting it without judgment, which is rare to see on TV and in movies. It’s something Anthony Bourdain seemed to do so well.You just nailed it. He bridged the gap. He provoked conversation. But, he was still himself. He respected the people and their cultures, wherever he went. He never judged them, and I think that’s what’s so important. And, look, I’m not comparing Messiah to anything Anthony Bourdain did. But it’s the way in which he presented different perspectives, it’s precisely that. Look, we don’t choose where we’re born, and unless you have the opportunity to be able to go and experience other cultures, you’re going to have a limited perspective. Isolation breeds misunderstanding. Isolation could be within yourself. It could be within a society, a culture, a country, a religion.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)I think that’s just the tip of the iceberg when talking about “the bubble” most of us tend to live in.&nbsp;It’s that same sort of insular perspective that could make someone perceive&nbsp;the concept of a brown-skinned Messiah as problematic. How do you respond to that?It’s something that excites me. The show doesn’t subscribe to any particular religion. I think what people will find when you tune into the show, is that al-Massih doesn’t reveal himself as the Messiah. It’s the projection of everyone else and what they presume him to be. What I really find interesting about this story is that all the characters are searching for something. Eva’s searching for the truth; some people are searching for actual, physical freedom, you know? What he does, as I see it, is he acts as a mirror to your psyche. Everybody’s looking outwardly at him to be the savior of sorts, when in reality he’s throwing everything back at you.(Photo by John Golden Britt/Netflix)Two of the main focal points of the show are the&nbsp;Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a refugee crisis that unfolds at that contentious border. The show also spends a lot of time at the Texas-Mexico border. Is Messiah trying to bridge the gap between&nbsp;these events?What I can say is the show was written in 2016. We didn’t, certainly, have a crystal ball. But obviously, history is repeating itself. So, I think that people will see that. This is an issue that Americans are very familiar with. I think that Americans, in general, are less familiar with the refugee crisis in the Middle East and in Europe. We don’t refer to them as refugees in this country.(Photo by Hiba Judeh/Netflix)There are many layers to the story Messiah is telling.&nbsp;If you had to pick&nbsp;one central message, what do you hope the audience will take away&nbsp;from the series?I hope people watch an episode and identify with a character and then want to dissect that character. I hope it actually provokes a conversation.Messiah is now streaming on Netflix.&nbsp;Like this?

She won two Emmys for American Crime and was part of the ensembles of Southland and The Leftovers. Her latest show, Seven Seconds, may be her most harrowing work yet — at least until she appears in Damon Lindelof’s HBO adaptation of Watchmen.On Seven Seconds, King plays Latrice Butler, a mother whose son Brenton (Daykwon Gaines) is injured in a hit-and-run by a police officer (Beau Knapp). With Netflix vying for Emmy consideration for their dramatic series, King spoke with Rotten Tomatoes by phone about why &nbsp;Seven Seconds&nbsp;was her toughest role yet.But first, King shared her near-total conversion from on-the-air television. Find out what’s on her DVR and streaming queues, and the one thing she makes an exception for on live TV.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT VIEWING FOR YOU?(Photo by Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)I am totally converted. I do not do any appointment TV unless it’s a playoff game or a game final.WHAT SHOWS ARE ON YOUR DVR?(Photo by Pari Dukovic/FX)Here’s the interesting thing: Netflix has changed the game in a really big way, so you don’t have to backup your DVR as much as I guess I did maybe eight years ago. Right now what I have not caught up with on my DVR — I haven’t caught up on all my Unsungs. I love those shows. You learn something about artists that grew up with you or your parents were listening to on the record player. You just learn so many things that you didn’t know. For the artists that were grown up when I was a kid, I just looked at them as artists, not as peers — like Special Ed, I’m really looking forward to seeing the Special Ed Unsung and looking forward to seeing the Digable Planets Unsung. I can’t wait for that. So I have those two to watch and whatever other ones that I haven’t seen this season. And MTume I’m really looking forward to seeing too. They were the group that Biggie Smalls sampled [in “Juicy”].Oh, I know what’s on my DVR that I have not watched yet:&nbsp;[American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni] Versace. That is all queued up and ready for me to watch all of them. I have not seen one, so that’s going to be one of those over-at-four-o’-clock-in-the-morning nights.WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?(Photo by Aleksandar Letic)So much. I want to see Ibiza. That’s on my radar to watch. I haven’t seen the last two Dave Chappelles, so that’s on there, and Chris Rock’s Tamborine is one that I want to see. Obviously, I’m in this space where I want to see comedies and things that will make me laugh. I’ve been doing TV lately that is so heavy that something light, comedies are the things I’m looking forward to. Another Netflix show I like is Atypical. I’ve only watched three episodes, and I haven’t finished that one. That’s a really good show. It’s funny and it has a little emotional weight to it which I dig. My son turned me onto it. There’s another one my son turned me onto that I’ve watched just the first two episodes which I thought was genius, it’s a cartoon called Big Mouth. I thought that was just awesome.WHAT’S COMING SOON THAT YOU CAN’T WAIT FOR?(Photo by JoJo Whilden/FX)I cannot wait for the new season of Power. It’s starting any day now, and I’m also excited about that new show Pose.(Photo by JoJo Whilden / Netflix)Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: I’m sure you’d hoped for a fourth season of American Crime, but when there wasn’t, was it nice to find another show that really had something to say?Regina King: Yes, absolutely. When I came onto Seven Seconds, I only came on for a season. This story is a one-off story. It was never something for me that was supposed to continue. That story was a story that I felt needed to be told. Some people may feel like it’s a told-again story, but unfortunately, this is who we are as an American culture. It’s unfortunate, but for me, the storytelling that is not scared of holding a mirror up is fascinating for me as an artist.(Photo by JoJo Whilden / Netflix)RT: Is there a specific episode you’re submitting for Emmy consideration as an example of your most powerful work?King: Oh my gosh, I have not gone back to watch the shows, because it was so emotional that I can’t go back to watch. It’s already hard for me to watch myself, because as an actor, the times I’ve watched things that I’ve done, I always feel like, “I wish I would’ve made this choice. Oh, I know I did a better take than that. Why didn’t they use that?” I find myself in this space of shoulda/woulda/coulda and that really is ridiculous. That’s just crazy thinking, but because I do that, I tend to not watch things that I’ve done, unless it’s just something that’s really specific to the press tour, and I need to really know it very well. This one, even if it was specific to the press tour, it was such an emotional place to live for six months that I just can’t go back there. I just can’t.(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)RT: Is Watchmen going to be that emotional for you?King: Damon Lindelof is so brilliant. It is going to be emotional in another way, but I don’t think in that way. Because I’m a mother — I’m a mother of a son — I know what it feels like just when your son goes out to a party. If they’re five minutes after curfew, I’m looking at the clock nervous. That alone, I think a lot of parents can relate to that. That’s why&nbsp;[Seven Seconds] was such a raw place for me to be, but Watchmen is going to have some emotion for some different reasons that I can’t say because Damon is so brilliant. He is doing some things in this show that, if it has been done before, I haven’t seen it.RT: They haven’t said who you’re playing yet, but what is it like to play a new character in the Watchmen world?King: Well, I start on Monday, so so far we have just been going through all the wardrobe design and all the different things that come along with developing who the woman I’m playing is. I am being very careful, because I am not messing up anything. I’m still so honored that Damon is calling on me again. I just want to show up and show out.RT: Does reading the comic book help when it’s a new take on Watchmen?King: I am not reading it. Damon’s asking for me to wait and read it after we finish the first season.Seven Seconds is now streaming on Netflix.

Plus, she reveals what she loves about her Fantastic Beasts 2 role.by Kit Bowen | December 21, 2017 |  CommentsCarmen Ejogo’s career keeps the actress incredibly busy these days, so watching TV proves to be a little more difficult than she’d like.In just this year alone, Ejogo appeared in sci-fi–horror prequel&nbsp;Alien: Covenant and horror film&nbsp;It Comes at Night, as well as the drama Roman J. Israel, Esq. with Denzel Washington. She also has a few high-profile projects coming up, including the third season of True Detective and the highly anticipated sequel Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, in which she reprises her role as Seraphina Picquery, the president of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.Ejogo also currently stars in season 2 of The Girlfriend Experience, which reaches its conclusion this weekend. The new season departs from the first by telling two separate stories about women in the GFE business. In one story, Ejogo plays Bria, a woman placed into witness protection to escape an abusive relationship with a former client, a gangster she is willing to testify against. The escort life, however, continues to beckon her, and she starts a cat-and-mouse game with those who are trying to control her.Rotten Tomatoes caught up with the British actress to talk about her work on the show and to find out what she likes to watch when – and if — she has any downtime.WHAT’S APPOINTMENT VIEWING FOR YOU?I’m not a massive TV watcher, but I’ve been watching a lot of Eric André and his talk show [on Adult Swim]. His show is a favorite of mine. I’ve been going back to watching old episodes.WHAT’S ON YOUR DVR?(Photo by HBO)I’ve been binge-watching and revisiting some shows. For me right now, revisiting True Detective season 1 and 2 to remind myself of how great that show was and what we may achieve in season 3.WHAT’S ON YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?There are so many shows I like to watch. I know I want to watch The Handmaid’s Tale. That’s next in the queue, things I need to get around to. And Godless, I should check that out. I keep hearing from good sources that it’s great, so, I definitely need to tune into that for sure.WHAT’S COMING SOON THAT YOU’RE EXCITED ABOUT?In addition to what I already mentioned, I’m watching and waiting for new seasons of: Grand Designs, I’m Dying Up Here, Chef’s Table, Insecure,&nbsp;Curb Your Enthusiasm, Atlanta, Peaky Blinders, and black-ish. And movies! Lady Bird&nbsp;— that’s one on my list for sure. I haven’t seen Lady Macbeth, but I’m meaning to&nbsp;— should be phenomenal.Kit Bowen for Rotten Tomatoes: Your story line in The Girlfriend Experience is so intriguing — what can we expect from the finale?Carmen Ejogo: Yeah, it gets even more intriguing, trust me. I hope that what other people have picked up on is this notion or concept of agency and complicity: How much is Bria in control or how much is she affected by those around her? That kind of comes to a head by the end of the episodes, and I think it, for me, was a satisfying way to end her journey, even the plays that have been influencing and manipulating her world. I am quite satisfied with the way she ultimately comes out. It’s still complicated and still very much down to one point of view as to whether she comes back whether or not, or whether it is even that simple. I don’t know if it really ever is that simple. There is still some real complexity, but I feel good about where she ended up.The show is ultimately about sex and power. Were you a little apprehensive about exposing yourself in ways that you maybe never have before onscreen?Ejogo: Yes, sure. As somebody that has been in this industry for many years, to see the potential of bringing sex to the screen has always been there, as a female actress. I’ve always avoided it, frankly, because it never felt like it was going to be handled in a way that was really nuanced and interesting. I think working with [writer/director] Amy Seimetz made it clear to me that it was going to be all of those things because she is really rad, and she is really interesting as a woman in herself. She is not scared of both sides of the coin when it comes to sex and women and men. So, this felt, for the first time, like the right story to bring to the screen.I have to go into every job I do with a sense of fearlessness and willingness to take chances and to walk through the space blindly at times and have faith. To be able to have that kind of comfort level, you really have to trust the people you are working with and the filmmaker. It was a real gift to be working with the director who also wrote the piece and who also happens to be a woman, a really cool woman. All those things combined made it feel like it was a trip worth taking.It is handled in a way that makes sense to the story. It’s very candid, in a way, but also beautiful in the way it’s approached.Ejogo: I agree and I really am proud of this project. I think you can go back to the viewer and watch it several times, and I suspect that it will be viewed sort of in a new direction every time. And not all material offers that kind of depth of intrigue and doesn’t stand up to that kind of interrogation. This piece really does. So I’m very proud of it. I love the character of Bria, I really do.We’re also very much looking forward to Fantastic Beasts 2. Is there anything you can tell us about the upcoming sequel and your role in it?Ejogo: I feel like the worst interviewee when people ask me questions about Fantastic Beasts, because I never have anything to offer. I will be shot if I said anything. [laughs] There’s nothing I can ever divulge.How about a general feeling about it for yourself?Ejogo: To be part of the world in any capacity is exciting for me, as it is for you. Being part of the process of filming is so — every person’s dream to imagine what it must be like to have the ideal acting job! Because you’re literally on these fantastic sets, in the most stunning outfits I’ve ever worn. You’re been handled by the best hair and makeup people. The entire character has been realized by an incredibly impeccable group of artists around you and you have to show up and do your bit. It’s just like the dream gig, so I am always happy to show up as Seraphina in whatever capacity I can. I am just very grateful that I get to show up in No. 2.The Girlfriend Experience’s season 2 finale airs Sunday, December 24, on Starz.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"Mary, hollywood, Max, 45, halloween","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/21163858/the-girlfriend-experience-carmen-ejogo-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-the-girlfriend-experience-star-carmen-ejogo"},{"id":"47509243285384","title":"What To Watch With Frontier’s Landon Liboiron","content":"What to Watchvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What To Watch With Frontier’s Landon LiboironPlus, how Michael Smyth is the Luke Skywalker of Frontier.by Fred Topel | November 21, 2017 |  CommentsWhile Jason Momoa goes under the sea as Aquaman in Justice League this week, his passion project also returns to Netflix.&nbsp;Season 2&nbsp;of Frontier picks up in the Canadian wilderness with the fate of Declan Harp (Momoa) after he escaped the noose and collapsed in the woods, and Michael Smyth (Landon Liboiron) trying to carry Harp’s load for the Black Wolf Company.Liboiron spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about the six-episode second season of Frontier. But first, he told us how he spends his TV time.WHAT IS APPOINTMENT TV FOR YOU?Generally an HBO show. I really, really am fascinated by dark comedies and stuff like that. Even Curb [Your Enthusiasm], I couldn’t wait for Curb to come back. If I’m already a fan of the creator, I was really excited to watch The Deuce because you want to see what he’s doing next. So I think those are the shows where I need to be like, “OK, I need to see it now.” Generally those are the shows people are going to talk about and I want to be up to date. I was so late onto the Game of Thrones bandwagon, I think it was four or five, maybe even six season I hadn’t seen any of it. I remember there was this one night where two of my really good friends met. They hadn’t met before and they immediately started talking about Game of Thrones. They spent a good hour and a half talking about Game of Thrones which I hadn’t seen, so I just sat there and listened. I was like, “Never again,” so I immediately started watching Game of Thrones. I think it’s also one of those things where you want to be able to talk about these shows. Especially in my industry, we all want to talk about it.WHAT’S ON YOUR DVR?Oh man, I’m actually watching a lot more films than television these days. There’s this new streaming service called FilmStruck, which is the Criterion Collection. I’m kind of in the stage of my life where I need to go back and watch what was before. I’m very interested in the stuff I haven’t seen yet from the past, than what’s building up [on my DVR]. It’s so great that there’s so much content out there but how do you keep up really with everything that’s going on?WHAT IS IN YOUR STREAMING QUEUE?I have it all. I kind of lean towards Netflix whenever I want to laugh. I can always count on some good comedy because of all the [standup] specials that they do now. I just watched the Patton Oswalt special. It’s so, so touching and beautiful and funny. So I usually go to Netflix for when I need to feel light and laugh, HBO when I want to really watch something that will really, really push me to think. I’m so behind on their shows. I really want to watch Rome. I want to finish Boardwalk Empire. I haven’t finished Boardwalk Empire yet. I’m so behind. And then I go to FilmStruck as I’m learning about the history of film and just educating myself on the past masters and all that kind of stuff. I jump around based on what my mood is and what I’m interested in. If I’m hungover I’ll probably just sit and watch Netflix all day, right? Then when I wake up, I’m like, “Ooh, I need to really get a creative boost.” I’ll go to HBO or something. It’s all different.WHAT SHOWS CAN’T YOU WAIT FOR?Can I say my own show? [Laughs]Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: You certainly can. A lot of people do.Landon Liboiron: I don’t know. I’m so scatterbrained with it all. I don’t keep track of what’s coming.RT: That’s cool. You’re more about catching up.Liboiron: Yeah, definitely. I definitely watch in my own time, what I’m feeling at the moment.RT: Are most of your scenes with Sokanon (Jessica Matten) this season?Liboiron: Where we start in season 2 with Michael and Sokanon is that Michael and Sokanon are just trying to keep the Black Wolf Company afloat. It’s the two of them working together and the growth of their relationship actually. Obviously, a lot happens in six episodes. Eventually it leads to all the forces joining again.RT: This season’s episodes begin with quotes from musicians. Did that mean a lot to you?Liboiron: That, I wasn’t actually even aware of until later. I wasn’t aware of them when we got the scripts. That wasn’t a part of it. It had no influence in terms of what I was doing with my character. It’s an interesting idea.RT: It does suggest that modern-day business, like the music industry, is relevant to the old business of the colonial trade.Liboiron: Of course. It’s humanity, right? It’s a circle. It’s just a big circle, man.RT: How far has Michael come from waking up on this ship in season 1 to being a central part of Harp’s company?Liboiron: Yeah, in season 1 he’s much more voyeuristic in the sense that he’s just sort of being dragged along. He’s sort of a prisoner to the world. He’s just doing anything he can to make it. In season 2, he’s taking a lot more control. He’s deciding that this is going to be his new world. He’s almost getting sucked into it a little bit if that makes any sense. It’s the addiction of the business of it, the survival of it. He’s definitely a con man. He’s definitely a guy who likes to win. He does it in a different way than maybe the ruthless characters in the show. He’s very conniving and cunning. I think he’s kind of getting addicted to that new way of life and he wants to continue it.RT: Has this adventure made him more sincere and given him a purpose?Liboiron: I guess you could say it gives him a purpose. I remember the Blackies [Peter&nbsp;and Rob Blackie], the creators of the show, would constantly compare him to a Luke Skywalker kind of character. His journey is very similar where it’s like here’s this guy who’s just kind of living his life and then he gets sucked off into the new world. Yeah, the Black Wolf Company has definitely given Michael his sense of purpose which has caused him to make the decisions in his personal life, with Clenna and his past, just moving forward.Frontier season 2 premieres November 24 on Netflix.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"YouTube, The, critic, psychological, Columbia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/21211617/Frontier-season-2-trailer-screencap-Landon-Liboiron-600x314.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-frontiers-landon-liboiron"},{"id":"47509243281286","title":"What to Watch With Fear the Walking Dead‘s Maggie Grace","content":"What to Watchvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What to Watch With Fear the Walking Dead's Maggie GraceThe former Lost star discusses her return to television, keeping secrets, and cutting the cord.by Jean Bentley | April 13, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by AMC)The fourth season of Fear the Walking Dead moves the post-apocalyptic (or, maybe mid-apocalyptic) action from Mexico to Texas. But that’s not the only major change to hit the Walking Dead spin-off. There will also be time jumps and a new group of survivors fighting to make a life in a post-walker world.One of the newbies is a familiar face: The Walking Dead‘s Morgan, who moves from the flagship series to its spin-off. TWD‘s Lennie James is joined by Lost&nbsp;and Taken star Maggie Grace and fellow new cast members Garret Dillahunt (Raising Hope), Jenna Elfman (Dharma &amp; Greg), Kevin Zegers (Gracepoint), and Evan Gamble (Hap and Leonard).Ahead of the season premiere, which also acts as a crossover between the two series, Grace spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about her fierce new character, returning to television more than a decade after Lost, and having to keep mostly everything about her role secret.But first, she dished on her deepest, darkest DVR secrets, and divulged her TV viewing habits and which&nbsp;other new show she’s most looking forward to seeing.What’s appointment viewing for you?(Photo by AMC)Sadly I don’t have any in terms of live television except Fear the Walking Dead, so I will be watching our show, hopefully with the cast. But I don’t have television per se, but I watch streaming. Being a part of this show makes me want to watch it live Sunday night with the cast and friends.Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;You cut the cord?Like, I’ve never had the cord to begin with.We’d ask what’s on your DVR, but you don’t have one.I travel a lot and I really like to sit down and watch something with the intention to watch it as opposed to zoning out. I plan to watch things. I’m not big into channel-flipping. I don’t love that experience where I feel like hours are stolen from me and I’m not sure what I watched.What’s on your streaming queue?(Photo by HBO)I’m gearing up for a re-watch of The Wire, the greatest television show ever made. And The Honorable Woman, it’s this great hidden gem.What’s coming soon that you can’t wait for?(Photo by Hulu)The Handmaid’s Tale. … I binged [season 1]. It is heavy. It was a dark time.Jean Bentley for Rotten Tomatoes: Tell me about your new character, Althea.Grace: She’s both unusually capable and emotionally deep. Somehow after everything she’s been through, even before society was lost, she uniquely prepared not only to survive but thrive in this post-apocalyptic environment. She’s got a sly sense of humor. She’s a bit of a wild card. I’m never quite sure what I’m allowed to say about season 4 — there’s so much I want to say about her; there’s so many things I love about her. I think she’s scrappy, which is, for me, the most fun part about playing her. She’s always looking for solution after solution.RT: We’ve seen in the trailer that she meets up with The Walking Dead‘s Morgan. What was it like working with Lennie James, who just joined the show?Grace: I adore Lennie. I’m really happy it was him. He’s a really kind, generous actor. I’ve loved his work in other things, so I’m really glad our characters intersect so much. Everything’s easy and relaxed with him.(Photo by AMC)RT: What’s it like joining a show in its fourth season? It seems daunting, though that not might be the right word.Grace: No, daunting is the perfect word. It’s like switching schools halfway through middle school — everyone already knows each other, you don’t know where to sit at lunch. It’s definitely intimidating. And there’s a lot to catch up on in terms of the mythology of the whole Walking Dead universe. I came into it with very little notice so there was a lot to learn along the way.RT: Although Lennie isn’t new to the Walking Dead universe, he was new to the show too. What was that like?Grace: Lennie and Garrett and I had a lot of time together right at the beginning, which was great because we were all in the same boat. We were all new to the show, so that worked out perfectly.RT: With the show’s move to Austin, Texas, from Mexico, there were probably a lot of new crew members to.Grace: It was an odd feeling. It was unlike any work experience anyone’s ever had. It was a mix of crew that had been there since the beginning and some brand new crew that was based in Austin, and cast that was new and cast that had been there since the beginning, and writers and the showrunners that were there in a new location. But I think reinvention has certainly been a part of the series from the beginning, whether it was season 2 on the boat or a Broke Jaw Ranch in 3, it does keep reinventing itself. This is certainly a more extreme reinvention, but hopefully one that’s exciting and leaves viewers unsure of what’s around each corner and what to expect. I think there were a lot of great surprises in it as an actor.(Photo by AMC)RT: There’s going to be a time jump this season, but you probably can’t say too much about that.Grace: I will say this, the writers have certainly played with time in interesting ways in this season. I never know what to expect.RT: You were on Lost for several years, another show about surviving in a beautiful landscape. Do you think there are any more similarities between the two shows?Grace: It really does feel similar day to day because you have this ensemble cast of grounded characters going through extraordinary circumstances in a really rugged environment. I would say that’s a fair comparison — just the ensemble and that environment.RT: What’s it like to be a series regular on TV again?Grace: That’s great, I love the sense of camaraderie it gives, and it serves as a nice anchor in life to keep going back to the same place. I had avoided doing television for many years, but I’ve really come to love having the same group of people and really getting to know the crew and having a character that can unfold over time. And I think that TV is the place now where all the creatives or directors can really make choices. That’s what’s happened in the last decade.RT: Good job in your first season of cryptically teasing the show because you can’t reveal too much information! It’s definitely a hard task.Grace: There’s so much I want to say! I don’t understand [the secrecy], because I would just think it would make the audience more excited to watch it — not that they wouldn’t watch it. It got really comical at WonderCon because it was so, so basic. It was like, “Yes, emotional things happen to various characters in various geographical locations.” I was like, “Aw, come on.”Fear the Walking Dead season 4 premieres Sunday, April 15 at 10:10 p.m. after the season 8 finale of The Walking Dead, then moves to Sundays at 9 p.m. weekly on AMC.","section":"What to Watch","tags":"Games, Paramount, Grant, Sundance, Holiday, rom-coms, vampires, Hallmark, movie, Tomatazos, Dark, Mudbound, Cinematographers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/13165831/ftwd-maggie-grace-thumb.jpg","slug":"what-to-watch-with-fear-the-walking-deads-maggie-grace"},{"id":"47508635962754","title":"24 Fresh Giant Monster Movies","content":"24 Framesgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})24 Fresh Giant Monster Moviesby Alex Vo | March 7, 2017 |  CommentsMoviedom’s main ape makes his first theater appearance since Peter Jackson’s 2005 remake with&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island, a 1970s-set adventure starring Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson who travel to the King’s home to confirm his mythic existence.

Furthermore, in director John Badham’s grim masterpiece (which Rocky&nbsp;director John G. Avildsen was slated to direct before parting ways over creative differences), Tony generally proved to be his own worst enemy, with a smart mouth, explosive temper, and penchant for violence that collectively had a way of slamming shut the doors that his talent, charm, and looks opened for him.In other words, Tony Manero was a small-time loser with big-time ambitions. He was racist, virulently misogynistic, narcissistic, and indifferent to the suffering of others, most notably Annette (Donna Pescow), a vulnerable, heartbreakingly sad admirer who followed him like a lost puppy the entire film and was repaid for her devotion with a sexual assault by two members of Tony’s creepy gang, who had all of his many horrible flaws and none of his redeeming virtues. Even Tony’s climactic dance contest win in Saturday Night Fever&nbsp;was tainted by the racism of a crowd that only voted for him and his partner because they were white, unlike the couple that deserved to win.Movies are full of purehearted dreamers who overcome formidable obstacles through talent, will, and a ferocious determination never to give up, no matter how bleak things might look, and&nbsp;Saturday Night Fever, to its eternal credit, is not one of those movies. Staying Alive, however,&nbsp;to its eternal detriment, most assuredly is. It shamelessly embraces all of the hoary show business and dance movie cliches its predecessor boldly eschewed.To put things in animation terms, between John Badham’s Oscar-nominated 1978&nbsp;film and&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone’s&nbsp;1983 follow-up, the vibe went from Ralph Bakshi‘s New York grit and grime to Walt Disney’s sweetness, polish, and shine. Alternately, if the classic Italian neorealist milestone&nbsp;The Bicycle Thieves&nbsp;had spawned a sequel in which struggling father Antonio recovered his bike, trained under the mentorship of a gruff but kindly veteran cyclist, and won the Tour de France, the tonal shift would have been&nbsp;every bit as jarring, insane, and shameless as Staying Alive’s brazen switch from hard-edged realism to gaudy wish fulfillment fantasy. Staying Alive was a commercial success, to be sure, but at the cost of Saturday Night Fever’s dark, sweaty, coked-up soul.The Zero(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Staying Alive trades Brooklyn for Broadway as its primary setting and a very 1970s darkness and social consciousness for 1980s upbeat flash. Tony is no longer a pill-popping degenerate who lives with his folks, works at a hardware store, and wows the ladies at dance clubs, but a focused, disciplined winner ferociously devoted to chasing his dreams.Tony has similarly ditched the posse of poignantly pathetic, drug-addled, violently misogynistic bigots in order to pursue his noble aspirations to Broadway stardom. He’s off drugs and high on life. He doesn’t curse anymore. He doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t drink, and he doesn’t beat up people of color. His only real remaining vice is women, and even in that department he’s evolved from Neanderthal cretin to nice guy, though he finds it exceedingly difficult to stay faithful, and his affections are split between&nbsp;a pair of love interests who fall rather neatly into the categories of devilish diva and girl next door.The better Tony is as a human being, though, the worse he is as an anti-hero, and that is not good for the movie as a whole. Staying Alive shaves away all the rough edges that made Tony so compelling, rendering him another generic dreamer distinguished only by the fact that he looks, moves, and talks like John Travolta near the prime of his youth.The girl next door is Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes), a sweet, modestly talented dancer and singer Tony likes enough to string along — but not enough to commit to her, although he does get awfully jealous when he sees Carl, with whom Jackie has sizzling musical chemistry onstage, gazing longingly at her. Incidentally, Carl is played by Frank Stallone (i.e. brother to Sylvester), who also wrote and performed much of the music on the soundtrack, and whose song “Far from Over” landed in the top 10 and earned him both Golden Globe and Grammy nominations.The other, more important love interest is Laura (future soap opera queen Finola Hughes), a posh British dancer and woman of wealth and taste who takes a fancy to Tony, but only as a boy toy, a sexual conquest to be used and then discarded when she tires of him. That proves more difficult than anticipated when, due to Tony’s unbelievable, irrepressible talent, as well as the time-honored cliches frequently found in movies like this, he’s promoted to male lead of Satan’s Alley, the hilariously overwrought Broadway extravaganza at the film’s core.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Saturday Night Fever benefited from an almost documentary-like sense of verisimilitude — it was pop sociology you could dance to — whereas Staying Alive hilariously depicts the Broadway world of the early 1980s as overwhelmingly heterosexual and drug-free, even as Satan’s Alley is comically over-the-top in its homoeroticism. The big closing&nbsp;production number is one third proto-Showgirls&nbsp;kitsch&nbsp;minus the satire, irony, and self-consciousness; one third singing, dancing outtake from William Friedkin’s notorious drama Cruising; and one third knock-off of&nbsp;The Apple. The sexed-up, scowling choreography, meanwhile, suggests something&nbsp;Bob Fosse might come up with if he were hit in the head and suffered a neurological malady that removed all his talent.It speaks to the profound disconnect in tone and quality between Saturday Night Fever and its dopey, widely despised follow-up that Tony spends much of the film apologizing for the way he behaved in the first film, for being a potty-mouthed (no place for that in a PG-rated, family-friendly film like Staying Alive!), woman-hating, pill-popping, disrespectful creep.In real life, that would be an admirable gesture. Here, it feels like Tony is apologizing for everything that made his character complicated and interesting in Saturday Night Fever. When he apologizes to his skeptical mother in Staying Alive, Tony even tells her that the sober, hardworking young mensch she sees before her is the real Tony.“That wasn’t the real you back then?” she inquires earnestly, to which Tony answers, “Yeah.”In actuality, the real Tony Manero is the sexy, darkly magnetic monster of id and ego from the first film. It’s this&nbsp;domesticated clone, who looks like the old Tony but doesn’t talk or act anything like him, who seems egregiously phony, as does Staying Alive as a whole.Final Verdict(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Travolta may be playing a perversely cleaned up and watered down version of one of his signature characters, a kinder, gentler striver you would be happy to bring home to mother, but the Grease&nbsp;superstar and pop icon nevertheless oozes boyish charm, sexiness, and blinding movie star charisma.He’s almost too appealing and likable here, since it was precisely that air of incoherent, bottomless rage that made his Oscar-nominated performance in Saturday Night Fever so riveting and endlessly rewatchable. As a follow-up to an unexpected American classic, Staying Alive is an insult to everything its predecessor stood for. As a vehicle for Travolta’s movie star magnetism, however, it’s full of breezy pleasures.&nbsp;Ultimately, Staying Alive is ragingly imperfect, and&nbsp;it does many things very, very wrong, but there is at least one thing that it does very right.At the very end of the movie, after he’s triumphed in Satan’s Alley and really stuck it to his co-star and director&nbsp;with an elaborate, impromptu solo against their wishes, Tony decides to celebrate by strutting down the Manhattan sidewalk to the Bee Gees’ all-time great “Staying Alive.”&nbsp;Travolta shakes off the strictures of cliche, convention, and formula, and the film ends on a note of unexpected victory.In a film&nbsp;ferociously devoted to doing whatever it thinks its audience wants, this final moment marks the only time when pandering to the audience turns out to be the right move.&nbsp;The ending, and only the ending, of Staying Alive is absolutely perfect. It cannot be improved upon. That alone is enough to distinguish it from every other film I’ve written about for this column so far.Nathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Wells-inspired Time After Time, and FOX’s comedy Making History. The repetitious format of TV has always lent itself well to history jumping&nbsp;stories, as we’ll see with these 24 shows featuring some major time travel antics.Doctor Who (1963-present)Seriously long-running show about a designated Time Lord curing what ails the Earth throughout the years. In its fifth decade, Peter Capaldi became the show’s twelfth de facto Doc.Outlander (2014-present)Caitriona Balfe plays a 1945 wartime nurse who’s cast away from her husband and back in time to 1743 Scotland where she falls into a torrid romance with a Highland soldier (Sam Heughan).12 Monkeys (2015-present)In this sci-fi series adapted from the Terry Gilliam movie of the same name (which in turn was based on experimental 1962 short La Jetee), James Cole plays a 2043 chrononaut sent back in time to prevent a world-decimating virus.Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008-09)No fate but what we remake: Avoiding the dour endgame of Terminator 3, this two-season show saw post-T2 Sarah and John Connor leaping forward in time to 2007 where they scrambled to avoid more cyborg assassins, skeptical law enforcement, and anyone else with designs on the future.Legends of Tomorrow (2016)With the world under Vandal Savage’s control in 2166, lord of time Rip Hunter tears the temporal fabric a new one: in 2016, he assembles a team of DC superheroes to prevent the Savage rise.Lost (2004-10)J.J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof’s mindbending drama centered on a group of plane crash survivors trapped on a mysterious island that not only changed location but also transported its inhabitants to the past.Heroes (2006-10)The show wasn’t about time travel per se, but prominent character Hiro Nakamura’s ability to manipulate time played a big part.Timeless (2016-present)A trio of timecops pursue a mastermind crook out to alter human history to his dastardly benefit.Quantum Leap (1989-93)Scott Bakula is Dr. Sam Beckett who, under threat of his time-travelling lab getting the plug pulled by the government, sends his consciousness out from the present. Throughout each historical leap, he must take on a new identity and fix something wrong in the past in attempting return to the present.Continuum (2012-15)In 2077, Vancouver is not a nice place to live. Corporate oligarchs dominate the continents and terrorists, hellbent against the system, travel back in time to tear up the roots. Officer Kiera (Rachel Nichols) and her amazing jumpsuit are pulled to 2012 as well.Hindsight (2015)Becca Brady gets cold feet before her second wedding and side steps back to 1995, on the day of her first betrothal, and seizes the opportunity to redo her next 20 years right.Tru Calling (2003-05)She may look like just any other morgue employee filing paperwork and showing corpses to DUI offenders, but Tru Davies has a secret power: she can reset and relive the day as a calling to save the recently deceased.Samurai Jack (2001-04)A feudal Japan swordsman is thrown into the future where his demonic opponent has taken over the world. Creator Genndy Tartakovsky will air 10 episodes later this year or next, to properly conclude the story over a decade after Samurai ended on Cartoon Network.Life on Mars (2006-07)John Simms plays a Manchester police officer who, after a bonk on the head by a moving automobile, wakes up in 1973.Goodnight Sweetheart (1993-99)Television fixer Gary Sparrow is stuck in routine until he finds a portal back to 1940s Britain, and gets entangled in comedic and romantic misadventures within both decades. A 2016 special saw Nicholas Lyndhurst reprising his role as Gary, who is permanently stuck in the past but finds an opportunity to return to modern day.Peabody’s Improbable History (1959-60)As with most stories, this is about a genius talking dog with a time machine who adopts a human boy from a back alley. Pupper Peabody originally appeared in segments on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, though he later got a DreamWorks animated movie and subsequent Netflix show.7 Days (1998-2001)Alien technology recovered from the Roswell UFO crash is crafted by the NSA into a working time machine, which can send government agents back a week to avert disasters (but not far back enough to save the UPN channel).The Time Tunnel (1966-67)To avert government shutdown, two directors of a secret lab hurl themselves into the swirling psychedelics known as The Time Tunnel, where they become privy to some of mankind’s greatest hits.

He is “an amalgam of several people,\" including, \"more than he'd like to admit, probably elements of my uncle Paul.”by Whitney Friedlander | April 29, 2021 |  CommentsAuthor Paul Theroux’s 1981 novel The Mosquito Coast was meant to be an attack on Reagan-era economics and its views toward consumerism and the environment.Told from the viewpoint of a 14-year-old boy trying to understand his father, we find the frequently failing, yet brilliant, inventor Allie Fox leading his family of four away from modern civilization and deeper into Central America. Then things get complicated. The 1986 film adaptation, which was directed by Peter Weir, written by Paul Schrader and starred a grimy, stubbly Harrison Ford in horn-rimmed glasses, came away with mostly favorable reviews and has 76% Tomatometer score.“The movie has been directed and acted so well, in fact,” wrote late&nbsp; Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert in his review of the film, “that almost all my questions have to do with the script: Why was the hero made so uncompromisingly hateful?”(Photo by Apple TV+)This is also very much the issue in Apple TV+’s new series version of The Mosquito Coast. A prequel of sorts that’s set in the modern day, it stars actor (and nephew of Paul) Justin Theroux, as Allie – this time a mechanic working in a dusty border town. While determined to find ways to make renewable resources out of junk and get a patent for his work, he forces his teens – Gabriel Bateman as son Charlie and Logan Polish as daughter Dina – to eschew technology like cell phones as he and wife Margot (Melissa George) fuel their cars and air conditioners with leftover oil from fast-food restaurants.Read Also: “125+ Books Becoming TV Series That We Cannot Wait to See”Things are going more-or-less fine until the feds come looking for Allie. Instead of skipping town by himself, it’s decided that the family is better protected if they stay together. Soon, they’re on the lam south of the border.Actor Theroux is aware that this decision may make his hero seem unlikeable.“As a person, I love it when a character has, you know, many facets and sides to them,” Theroux said during a recent Zoom call while his gray pit bull mix, Kuma, roamed in the background and occasionally barked her own commentary. “What I tried to do was make him, in turns, charismatic in some instances and frustrating in others. So I hope that people go hot and cold on him because it almost feels like it’s more of a real relationship. I think it’d be a bit boring if he just sort of had his chin to the wind and was doing everything beautifully for his family and everything was all perfect.”Plus, Theroux reminded, “Tony Soprano was not the nicest guy in the world and The Great Santini was one of the most terrifying father figures ever, but yet, completely compelling.”(Photo by Apple TV+)What also makes Theroux’s Mosquito Coast character particularly compelling is what exactly he (or maybe he and his wife?) did to cause them to live on the edge and now go into hiding. It isn’t until episode four that fans get a potential clue as to the Foxes’ past.“The truth is that I’m a cheap date,” series co-creator and showrunner Neil Cross said in a separate Zoom chat. “I like adventure stories. I like thrillers. I’ve got I’ve got the nervous hosts compulsion to entertain their guests.”Cross, who is a devout fan of author Theroux’s books, said it was important to him that the series was “a character piece. And that, at its narrative heart, it is this kind of quite unique family dynamic. I want to tell that in the context of a show that was as exciting and intriguing as I could make it.”“Allie is inspiring and he’s genuinely capable of great love and great enthusiasm,” Cross continued of his lead character. “He’s immensely clever. He’s a fantastic problem solver. And it would be exhausting to know him.”This is also hinted at by the look of the show, which is rich with a feel of grime and sweat while also casting shadows that there might be something more sinister going on. During a phone interview, executive producer Rupert Wyatt, who directed the first two episodes, said he worked with director of photography Alex Disenhof on evoking “the colors of 21st century America [such as] neon [and] very strong blacks” for the early episodes.(Photo by Apple TV+)Wyatt said they looked at what he called the “strong palate” of places like Paris, Texas, and then “infuse it with a kind of Steinbeck; Northern California sort-of farmlands and the notion of the romanticism of that, but also the tragedy of it in terms of the Depression.” The palate softens as the characters head to the desert and then “as we go into the kind of more tropical climates of Mexico and, ultimately to the coast, we start to bring in the greens and the stronger primary colors and heat it up.”He added that “the general thought, always for us, was that we were going to follow this family, we weren’t going to get ahead of them. So camera-wise, we’d always be on their backs where possible, and feel like we’re journeying through this landscape with them rather than getting jumping ahead and bringing them into scenes.”So why a prequel? Co-creator Cross also wanted to make a point of distancing his work from that of the movie adaptation because “there was, to my mind, no point trying to revisit and kind of Xerox something that had already been done so very well.”Plus, he said, “the Allie Fox who appears in a novel is, in some ways, a kind of an American archetype of the great American contrarians. But it’s also somebody who belongs very specifically to a very particular set of economic, political and cultural circumstances.” He said that “because that had been done, that kind of compelled me to think, OK, so who would that guy be now?”For star Theroux, there’s an added layer to nail the role. He said the character is “an amalgam of several people. There are definitely elements of my grandfather, elements of my uncles, and — more than he’d like to admit&nbsp;— probably elements of my uncle Paul.”(Photo by Apple TV+)That could make for some awkward family gatherings, especially since – as a recent Esquire profile recently attested – the family is good at joshing each other: “The only thing Justin’s known for,” Paul Theroux is quoted as saying in that story, “is that when he was a boy, he ate a Styrofoam cup. It’s family lore: Hey, s–t, Justin won an Emmy! Remember the time he ate a Styrofoam cup and then puked it onto his shoes?”“It’s not overt,” actor Theroux told us about the resemblance between his character and his uncle. “I think all of them know what I’m describing. So I think no one’s shocked, you know, at this point.”He said this is also less pressure than his work on another famous book adaptation, HBO’s The Leftovers. That was based on author Tom Perrotta’s novel about a rapture that wipes out a giant chunk of Earth’s population.“With Tom and The Leftovers, I put [writers] on a very high pedestal. So, anytime you approach them with a question, you should do it with your hat in your hand,” Theroux said. “This one, the pressure was kind-of off because I have pre-existing relationship. I could just pick up the phone and say guess what, I’m playing Allie Fox in Mosquito Coast, let’s talk about the character. And it’s probably a little bit of proud uncle syndrome, where he’s happy to chat, not just about my questions, but just what’s going on in life.”It’s probably fitting then that Cross said that in “one of my very last shots of the season, we see the emotional effect of what it is to love, and be loved, by Allie.”The Mosquito Coast premieres April 30 on Apple TV+.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"GLAAD, nightmare, Prime, spider-man","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/29112231/The_Mosquito_Coast_key_art_600x314.jpg","slug":"the-mosquito-coast-star-justin-theroux-plucked-elements-of-his-antihero-from-family-including-the-books-author"},{"id":"47508668063402","title":"9 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This June","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})9 TV Shows You Should Binge-Watch This JuneGLOW, Luke Cage, Preacher, and Power are among the month's top binge TV offerings.by Benjamin Lindsay | June 2, 2018 |  CommentsJune has the perfect variety of action, thriller, drama, and comedy to satisfy anyone’s early summer binging palette. From&nbsp;GLOW&nbsp;to Preacher to The Affair and more, learn more about what you should be watching this month below.HUMANS  94% (AMC)What it is:&nbsp;Based on the original Swedish series, Real Humans, Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley’s English-language adaptation takes place in a near-future where artificial intelligence exists in the form of humanoid servants called Synths. Of course, such miraculous technological developments come with larger social and political consequences. Who’s really the one in power?&nbsp;Why you should watch it: Like film&nbsp;Ex Machina, HBO’s&nbsp;Westworld, and other prestige A.I. outings, Humans is a sci-fi psychological thriller for the thinking viewer. Top-notch performances and enticing plot twists will keep you glued to the screen. After over a year since the&nbsp;March 2017 finale of season 2, it finally returns with season 3 on June 5.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 12 hoursSense8  86% (Netflix)What it is: This sci-fi adventure series from the minds that brought you The Matrix follows eight strangers from around the world who are inexplicably linked mentally and emotionally as “sensates.”Why you should watch it: While the series is inherently escapist entertainment, there’s a pronounced depth to the social themes it explores across politics, identity, religion, race, sexuality, and more, and much of its adventure can ultimately be seen as allegorical to real-world issues today. While it wrapped after season 2, Netflix is bringing it back by popular demand for one finale two-hour feature finale on June 8. So grab the popcorn and get to binging!Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 23&nbsp;hoursClaws  90% (TNT)What it is:&nbsp;Niecy Nash stars as Desna Simms, the takes-no-prisoners owner of Nail Artisans, a nail salon in the swampy town of Manatee County, Florida. She’s flanked by a scene-stealing assortment of&nbsp; coworkers and patrons.&nbsp;The drama flares, however, when the employees of Nail Artisans turn to organized crime and start laundering money.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of camp, high-stakes crime drama, and whip-smart, hilarious scripts with performances to match, Claws&nbsp;may be the most fun you’ll have with a TV series this summer. Plus we’ll take any excuse to see two-time Emmy nominee Nash&nbsp;execute her perfect blend of humor and heart. Season 2 premieres June 10.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 7.5 hoursGoliath  82%&nbsp;(Amazon)What it is: Billy Bob Thornton is a pro at playing down-and-out, so&nbsp;you’re seeing a master at work when you see him put his spin on the trope in Goliath. He stars as Billy McBride, a disgraced lawyer who’s expelled from his firm. Now an ambulance chaser, he gets his shot with a new case to enact revenge on those who took him down to begin with.Why you should watch it: Goliath creator David E. Kelley — Big Little Lies, Boston Legal, The Practice, Ally McBeal, Chicago Hope — has been attached to some of the best television series of the last few decades. Throw in Oscar-winner Billy Bob Thorton (who also won a Golden Globe for his performance here), and the result is must-watch TV.Where to watch it: AmazonCommitment: Approx. 8&nbsp;hoursThe Affair  86% (Showtime)What it is: As the old adage goes, love is a battlefield, and with The Affair, we’re here to witness some emotional warfare. The titular indiscretion comes about when Alison and Noah meet on Long Island, consummate their desires, and in turn destroy their respective marriages to Cole and Helen, respectively. The Affair&nbsp;is told through the four main players’ rotating perspectives.Why you should watch it: We know the Golden Globes love to honor a rookie series, but it’s not for nothing that The Affair swept them after its first season by winning best drama series and best lead actress for Ruth Wilson. Maura Tierney then&nbsp;went on to win for her supporting turn the following year. Dense and emotionally trying as it may be, these are all characters that you’ll fall in love with and feel for as the dissipation of their happiness and potential reconciliation plays out each week. Season 4&nbsp;premieres June 17.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 32 hoursMarvel's Luke Cage  87%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: While we first met Luke Cage on the streets of Hell’s Kitchen in Jessica Jones, when it came to debuting his own namesake series, Netflix brought our super-strengthed hero up to Harlem, where he’s attempting to rebuild a life after the experiment that gave him his strength in the first place went awry.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Luke Cage&nbsp;may have been followed by a billion-dollar blockbuster film straight out of Wakanda, but that doesn’t diminish the power of seeing a black Marvel superhero on the small streaming screen. It helps, too, that it’s an excellent series full of fine performances and industry heavy-hitters like Mahershala Ali, Alfre Woodard, Rosario Dawson, and Mike Colter as the titular hero. Season 2 premieres June 22.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hoursPreacher  87%&nbsp;(AMC)What it is: Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen team up here behind the camera to adapt Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s cult comic book about a preacher, Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper), on a violently allegorical quest to “find God” — plus vampires, exploding holy men, extraterrestrial entities, and gun-slinging exes (played by Ruth Negga, no less).Why you should watch it: If that soundbite wasn’t at least enticing, this series is probably not for you. But if your interest is piqued, Preacher is sheer perfection. Unapologetically bloody, brazen, and bad to the bone, this series comes at the height of peak genre TV and runs with the best of them. Season 3 premieres on June 24.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 17&nbsp;hoursGLOW  92%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: From creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, GLOW (taken from the real-life ’80s entertainment series, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), follows a group of down-and-out actresses who unwittingly find themselves cast in a televised women’s wrestling league. Following both their personal and professional lives, it centers on Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), and the man who runs the league, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron).Why you should watch it: On paper, GLOW sounds like the kind of series that’s just so crazy it might work. Then again, it is from producer Jenji Kohan (Weeds, Orange Is the New Black). Utterly unique in the world of the half-hour dramedy, this standout series is lead by a stellar cast of kickass ladies (and even more behind the camera). Season 2 premieres in full June 29.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 5&nbsp;hoursPower  81%&nbsp;(Starz)What it is: From creator Courtney Kemp Agboh and starring Omari Hardwick as main anti-hero James St. Patrick, Power charts James’ life as he runs a popular nightclub in New York City while moonlighting as an underground drug kingpin. How he keeps it all together while leading a double-life is just the tip of the iceberg of this series’ juicy drama.Why you should watch it: Over the course of its four seasons,&nbsp;this gritty crime drama has succeeded with a powerful ensemble&nbsp;cast providing compelling and gloriously soapy performances&nbsp; in pursuit of&nbsp;its titular vice.

Plus, we’ve got a bunch of great series returning later in the month (and in early March), so it’s the perfect time to get caught up, and there are a couple of brand new shows that will be available to stream right away. With that in mind, here are ten shows you should definitely consider binge-watching in February.House of Cards: Season 3 (2015)  73%What it is: A wily and ambitious congressman utilizes his considerable influence to climb his way up the political ladder, manipulating colleagues along the way and leaving unsuspecting victims in his wake.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey, who just won a SAG award on Saturday) is not a nice man, but he is, for better or worse, the show’s central figure. He manipulates, wheedles, gladhands, seethes, rants, negotiates, and plots behind closed doors, all to fulfill his personal vendettas. His wife, Claire (in an award-winning performance by Robin Wright) is his formidable ally through it all. Use February to get caught up on the Underwoods’ shenanigans, so you’re ready for the season four premiere on Netflix on March 4th.Where to watch: All four seasons are on Netflix, Amazon, Google Play, PlayStation Video, Vudu, and Microsoft Store.Commitment:&nbsp;36&nbsp;hours.Bates Motel: Season 3 (2015)  95%What it is: In this contemporary Psycho prequel series, a bizarre mother-son relationship between Norma Bates (Vera Farmiga) and the infamous Norman (Freddie Highmore) leads to violence and mental turbulence after moving to a small town in Oregon and opening a creepy motel.Why you should watch it: This is one of those rare prequels that actually works. Fans of the Psycho franchise can enjoy along with folks who aren’t familiar; it works as a standalone story line. The top-notch cast effectively takes stabs at subtle — and not-so-subtle — intricacies in delivery, ultimately perfecting characters designed to disturb. With season four premiering on March 7, now is an ideal time to catch up on this exploration of lives so warped, they can’t help but delight.Where to watch:&nbsp;A&amp;E TV (with cable subscription),&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Netflix,&nbsp;PlayStation Video, and&nbsp;Vudu, as well as on&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray.Commitment:&nbsp;25 hours.Girls: Season 4 (2015)  83%What it is: HBO’s hit comedy about four twenty-something female friends (Lena Dunham, Jemima Kirke, Allison Williams, and Zosia Mamet) navigating life, and all it throws at them, while living in the Big Apple.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;For one person to executive produce, write, and star in a show is almost reason enough to give it a chance to win you over. Dunham wears almost all the hats behind the scenes, and drew from her own real-life experiences as she poured her blood, sweat, and tears into Girls. So far, every season of Girls has been Certified Fresh, which is no small feat. Dive in now, and you’ll be ready for the season five premiere on HBO on February 21st.Where to watch: All four seasons are on Amazon (with season one on Amazon Prime), Google Play, PlayStation Video, Vudu, Microsoft Store, and HBO GO.Commitment: 21&nbsp;hours.Show Me a Hero: Season 1 (2015)  96%What it is: Inspired by real life events and based on the nonfiction book of the same name, Show Me a Hero tells the story of the vitriolic dispute over a federally mandated order to build public housing in the middle class neighborhoods of Yonkers, NY.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;David Simon wrote, produced and created this series with Wire alum and journalist William F. Zorzi. There is no doubt Simon is amply skilled at bringing to light those things we need to see, hear and feel — and his most recent miniseries for HBO reminds us just how lucky we are to have him telling such stories. Under the direction of Paul Haggis, and anchored by an immensely talented cast lead by Oscar Isaac, Show Me a Hero&nbsp;is bingeworthy material&nbsp;of the highest caliber.Where to watch: Amazon Prime,&nbsp;Google Play, HBO Go, Microsoft,&nbsp;Vudu, and also on DVD and Blu-Ray.Commitment:&nbsp;About 6 hours.Angie Tribeca: Season 1 (2016)  89%What it is: In the vein of&nbsp;Police Squad!&nbsp;comes this hysterical slapstick single-camera police procedural spoof created by Steve and Nancy Carell.Why you should watch it: An homage to the Leslie Nielsen school of deadpan farce, Angie Tribeca satisfies with its drop-dead serious devotion to ridiculous humor. Whether it’s fake grandparents being assigned to detectives who go deep, deep under cover (with deep voices), or an officer puking upon his every entrance to a crime scene, no matter the level of the crime, fans of the silly-funny will be amused, especially with guest appearances from folks like Lisa Kudrow, Danny Trejo, and Gene Simmons. The series is currently airing on TBS, but the first season is also available to stream in its entirety, for your binge-watching pleasure.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, PlayStation Video, and TBS.com (with a cable subscription).&nbsp;Commitment:&nbsp;5 hours.Broad City: Season 2 (2015)  100%What it is:&nbsp;Ilana and Abbi are twenty somethings navigating life in the big apple. Their voyages lead to an array of awkward, charmingly weird, sometimes cringeworthy and oftentimes out-right hysterical tomfoolery.Why you should watch it: Created by UCB comedian alums Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer and Executive Produced by Amy Poehler, Broad City has some seriously funny, talented women behind the show. Ilana and Abbi have dynamic chemistry and a unique humanizing brand of comedy. It’s no wonder the show has amassed loyal fans, the praise of critics — and Comedy Central’s recent order for a season four and five.Where to watch:&nbsp;Amazon, Google Play,&nbsp;Hulu, Microsoft,&nbsp;Vudu, and on DVD.Commitment: About 4&nbsp;hours.Peaky Blinders: Season 2 (2014)  100%What it is: This BBC drama, available in the US as a Netflix Original, follows the rise of the notorious Peaky Blinders gang in post-WWI England.Why you should watch it: Come for the lush production design and pulsating score — stay for the badass performances. Cillian Murphy delivers as the icy-stared leader of the hardscrabble family gang. Helen McCrory is stellar as the hard as nails matriarch and — TOM HARDY. Although you’ll have to wait for season two for it, Hardy’s turn as baker-cum-vicious gang leader Alfie Solomons is a gift from the television gods.Where to watch: Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, iTunes, Microsoft,&nbsp;Netflix,&nbsp;Playstation,and Vudu.Commitment:&nbsp;12 hours.Togetherness: Season 1 (2015)  93%What it is: A married couple struggling with relationship issues take on two new tenants: the husband’s recently evicted buddy and the wife’s recently dumped sister.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;This is the first television series created by Jay and Mark Duplass, who have worked both together and independently on a number of critically acclaimed films and TV series, ranging from Baghead and Cyrus to Transparent and The League. If you’re a fan of their typically understated, frequently poignant brand of comedy, Togetherness will feel just right. The show’s simple premise also allows its characters to breathe and behave like real people, which makes it all feel authentic and hit home harder. With its second season premiering on February 21, now’s the perfect time for HBO subscribers to catch up if they missed it the first time around.Where to watch:&nbsp;HBO GOCommitment:&nbsp;About 3.5 hours.Love: Season 1 (2016)  87%What it is:&nbsp;Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust play a young couple experiencing the ups and downs of commitment in an adult relationship.Why you should watch it:&nbsp;There isn’t a whole lot of information available about Love at the moment, but we do know that it was co-created by Judd Apatow (alongside star Rust) and stars Gillian Jacobs, who proved her impeccable comic timing on the recent cult favorite NBC comedy Community.

D.J.(Candace Cameron) is the oldest at 10, followed by 5-year old Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and toddler Michelle (played interchangeably by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Why you should watch it:&nbsp;The first season has the most balanced comedy, emphasizing the adult tribulations of three bachelors who grapple with the logistics of raising young girls and coming to terms with a family death. As the Olsens matured, the show played up their tubular cuteness and the humor became more slapstick and broad as the seasons wore on, though there were also frequent arcs on dating and marriage. Netflix’s Fuller House sequel, set to premiere on February 26, parallels the original with D.J., now a suddenly widowed mother of three sons, moving into her childhood home with the help of Stephanie and original series next door neighbor Kimmy Gibbler.Where to watch: Amazon, Google Play, Microsoft, Playstation, and on DVD.Commitment: 70&nbsp;hours.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"satire, historical, and, Cannes","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/01132646/FebruaryBinge.jpg","slug":"10-tv-shows-you-should-binge-watch-this-february"},{"id":"47508674126569","title":"Weekly Binge: Freaks and Geeks","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Binge: Freaks and Geeksby Marya E. Gates | November 20, 2014 |  CommentsOften considered one of the best “cancelled-too-soon” shows, this teen comedy-drama launched the careers of not only its creators Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) and Paul Feig (Bridesmaids), but also its young cast, including Jason Segel, Seth Rogen, James Franco, and Linda Cardellini. Here’s why you should check it out.Freaks and GeeksWhat’s the premise? Set in Michigan in 1980, the show centers around teenagers Lindsay Weir (Cardellini) and her younger brother Sam (John Francis Daley), as they navigate high school life and find peers in two very distinct groups of friends.What’s it like? It’s a period coming-of-age teen dramedy with a period-specific soundtrack, like The Wonder Years, but set in the early 1980s. Instead of the tumult of the 1960s, the Weirs are growing up in late-Cold War, not quite end-of-disco-era America. The “freaks” are the post-punks — the burnouts, outcasts, etc. — who ushered in the DYI aesthetic of the mid-1980s, while the “geeks” are computer nerds in the making. All of the teens are misfits in one way or another, trying to fit into a social group while dealing with teenage angst and a desire for independence.Where can I see it? The complete series is both available on DVD and streaming on Netflix.How long will it take? With 18 44-minute episodes, a dedicated viewer could knock the whole series out in one weekend. Even if you did one episode a day, you’d be finished in less than a month.What do the critics think? Although the show had lower ratings, it was a critical darling when it first aired, and the show’s esteem continues to grow nearly fifteen years after its cancellation. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said it was one of the few shows to “treasure youth even as it embodies all of its contradictions, craziness, hopes, and fears.” Time Magazine’s James Poniewozik listed it as one of his “All-Time 100 TV Shows,” saying, “Adolescence never hurt so good as it did in this comedy-drama about outcasts in a Michigan high school circa 1980.”Why should I watch this? Fans of any of the actors involved will get a kick out of seeing their faves so very, very young. But you don’t even have to be a fan of the cast to relate to the characters as they fumble their way towards adulthood. While the ensemble cast is rather large, their chemistry is amazing. Eschewing the “best friend” ideal most teen shows promote, Freaks and Geeks shows the fluidity of friendships — how some days you relate more to one friend, and other days to another. It also features one heck of a soundtrack, from its theme song — Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation” — to Rush, Neil Young, Styx, and more.What’s my next step? Star Linda Cardellini was a regular on E.R. for six seasons and John Francis Delay was on Bones for seven seasons. For more coming-of-age television with killer soundtracks, try Happy Days, The Wonder Years, and The O.C. For more features from Paul Feig and Judd Apatow, try Anchorman (produced by Apatow), Superbad, Bridesmaids, and their other short-lived TV show Undeclared.See more weekly binge guides.Check out the latest TV reviews, news, interviews, and photos.","section":"Binge Guide","tags":"Network, Lifetime, Month, history, TV, space, series, universe, Television, AMC, video, scary, aapi, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Freaks-and-Geeks.jpg","slug":"weekly-binge-freaks-and-geeks"},{"id":"47508675212020","title":"Weekly Binge: Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.","content":"Binge Guidevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Binge: Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.by Matt Atchity | September 4, 2014 |  CommentsThe interconnected films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have given us an impressive list of superheroes, but it also introduced us to Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), an unassuming (but extremely effective) agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Coulson, who quickly became a fan favorite, appears in four Marvel movies, including The Avengers, and is the central character of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., ABC’s 2013 TV series focusing on some of the background players of the Marvel Universe.Here’s everything you need to know to catch up on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D before it returns for season two on Sept. 23.Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.What’s the premise? Following the events of The Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson assembles a handpicked team of the agency’s “best and brightest” to investigate unusual phenomena in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “But wait,” you’re thinking, “in The Avengers, wasn’t there a scene with Coulson and Loki, where Loki –” Yes, we know that scene. And Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. addresses that and a few other Marvel movies over the course of its first season.What’s it like? Early in the first season, the show feels a bit like a mystery-of-the-week spy show — a quirky team of agents solving the week’s big case while engaging in witty banter, peppered with some references to events happening in the bigger movie universe. There are a couple of references to character backstories, but the first few episodes feel like they’re missing a defining arc; despite some hints at a bigger story, each week’s immediate case takes center stage in every episode. It all starts to come together about halfway through the season, right around the time that Bill Paxton shows up as a semi-regular character. When the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier cross over into Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, the early hints and bigger stories really pay off, and you’ll be glad you stuck with the show.Where can I see it? Season one will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray September 9 and is currently streaming on Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, and iTunes.How long will it take? The first season contains 22 episodes, and each one is about 45 minutes long, so that works out to about 16 1/2 hours of TV. That’s either one marathon weekend viewing binge, or you can watch a couple of episodes a day and be done in just over a week.What do the critics think? For the most part, the critics were cautiously optimistic. Moving the bombastic Marvel Cinematic Universe to TV came with some pitfalls: The show leaves out the major superheroes and instead focuses on the movie universe’s supporting players, and on a TV budget. Writing for HitFix, Alan Sepinwall said, “It’s… okay — quippy in that pleasingly distinctive Joss Whedon way, with a few intriguing ideas about life in a superhero world, but with a cheap look and mostly bland supporting characters.” Vulture’s Matt Zoller Seitz was a little bit more forgiving, saying “The show embraces its relative smallness, building much of the action around knowing banter and the occasional close-quarters fistfight.” But most critics echoed Christopher Orr of the Atlantic, who wrote, “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. looks ready — at least judging from the pilot — to hew a solid middle path between The Avengers and Buffy.” As a result, the first season ended up Certified Fresh at 86 percent.Why should I watch this? Clark Gregg’s Phil Coulson is one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s secret weapons. He keeps that universe grounded, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. gives him some great foils. Although the major superheroes are missing, Coulson’s fellow agents May, Fitz, and Simmons are solid characters in their own right. And if Ward and Skye are a bit bland at the beginning of the season, the show makes them a lot more interesting as the season continues.What’s my next step? If you’re late to the Whedon party, then you should try of one his many shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly or Dollhouse. Or if you like the idea of government agents dealing with fantastical cases, try The X-Files, Warehouse 13, Fringe or Sleepy Hollow.If you really want to get the best sense of how Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fits into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, try this order:1. The Avengers movie2. Iron Man 33. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes 1 though 74. Thor: The Dark World5. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes 8 though 166. Captain America: The Winter Soldier7.

Sometimes, you’ve just gotta post up in front of the air conditioner between trips to the beach and enjoy a nice TV binge. That’s where we come in. With several returning sophomore series and two long-running favorites bidding adieu, there’s plenty to keep you busy this August. Catch it all below.Dear White People  95%&nbsp;(Netflix)What it is: Based on writer-director Justin Simien’s 2014 film of the same name, Dear White People takes place on a predominantly white Ivy League college campus and, through the perspective of several different African-American characters, explores and satirizes the racial tensions, microaggressions, and social injustices experienced while there.Why you should watch it: &nbsp;As funny as it is revealing, this ensemble piece for Netflix fearlessly goes where other network and primetime programs don’t dare to, not just representing the current social and political climate, but crystallizing lasting truths within it. Airtight scripts and a bevy of standout performances make the upcoming third season a must-watch for fans new and old. Season 3 premieres in full Aug. 2 on Netflix.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10 hours (for the first two&nbsp;seasons)Preacher  87%&nbsp;(AMC)What it is: Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen teamed up back in 2016 to adapt Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s cult comic book about a preacher named Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) who’s on a violently allegorical quest to “find God” — plus vampires, exploding holy men, extraterrestrial entities, and gun-slinging exes (played by Ruth Negga, no less). The series, now entering its fourth and final season on AMC, has reached comparable cult status.Why you should watch it: If the above soundbite wasn’t at least enticing, this series is probably not for you. But if your interest is piqued, Preacher is sheer perfection. Unapologetically bloody, brazen, and bad to the bone, this series came at the height of peak genre TV and to this day runs with the best of them. Season 4 premieres Aug. 4 on AMC.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 25&nbsp;hours (for the first three&nbsp;seasons)GLOW  92% (Netflix)What it is: From creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, GLOW (taken from the real-life ’80s entertainment series, Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling), follows a&nbsp;pair of down-and-out actresses who unwittingly find themselves cast in a televised women’s wrestling league. Following both their personal and professional lives, the dramedy centers on Ruth Wilder (Alison Brie), Debbie Eagan (Betty Gilpin), and the man who runs the league, Sam Sylvia (Marc Maron).Why you should watch it: On paper, GLOW sounds like the kind of series that’s just so crazy it might work. Then again, it is from producer Jenji Kohan (Weeds, Orange Is the New Black), so it boasts a creative team that has a track record of doing just that. Utterly unique in the world of the half-hour dramedy, this standout series is lead by a stellar cast of kickass ladies (and even more behind the camera). Season 3 premieres in full Aug. 9 on Netflix.Where to watch it: NetflixCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hours (for the first two&nbsp;seasons)RELATED: “Video: GLOW Stars Alison Brie, Marc Maron, and Betty Gilpin Play ‘Wrestler or Rapper’”Succession  92% (HBO)What it is: Succession is all about what happens when powerful people behave badly and — sometimes — are faced with consequences. Charting one media mogul family’s changing of the guard (with back-stabbing, side-dealing, and bribing a-plenty), the series, from creator Jesse Armstrong, stars&nbsp;Jeremy Strong, Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Natalie Gold, and Emmy winner Brian Cox as the central Roy family patriarch.Why you should watch it: If HBO viewers love two things, it’s watching disparate characters fighting for a throne (hello, Game of Thrones) and extreme, dramatic family discord (Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Big Love…need we go on?). Fortunately, the power-hungry media family of Succession has both in spades, and it boasts top-tier&nbsp;performances to match. Why else would it be recognized with a fistful of 2019 Emmy nominations, including best drama series? Catch up before season 2 premieres Aug. 11 on HBO.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNow, Google Play, HBO Now,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 10&nbsp;hours (for the first season)Lodge 49  93% (AMC)What it is: Set in the sun-drenched but dry-spelled locale of Long Beach, California, creator Jim Gavin’s Lodge 49 follows ex-surfer and current burnout Dud Dudley (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn) as he tries to get his life back together by going with the flow — a fate that brings him to the adrift, philosophically-minded community of Lodge 49.Why you should watch it: What an odd little series Lodge 49 is, but if you stick with it, the magic that’s at play slowly comes to the fore and makes the experience all the more worthwhile. To say much more of the fate that’s in store for viewers of this wholly-original hour-long comedy is to do a disservice to its long-view intention, but you won’t be sorry for following Russell’s “The Dude”–esque hero to the titular lodge’s doorstep. Season 2 premieres Aug. 12 on AMC.Where to watch it: Amazon, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;MicrosoftCommitment: Approx. 7.5&nbsp;hours (for the first season)The Terror  87% (AMC)What it is: Based on Dan Simmons’ 2007 novel of the same name, The Terror is a horror anthology series from creators David Kajganich, Max Borenstein, and Alexander Woo. Season 1 takes the real-world tragedy of the 1845 disappearance and ultimate mass death aboard two British expedition ships&nbsp;and fictionalizes it as a tale of monsters and survival.Why you should watch it: While it’s an anthology series, you’d be remiss to skip out on The Terror’s first season before tuning into round 2: The Terror: Infamy. Creatively suspenseful, tragic, and altogether horrifying, it’s a 10-episode order that fans of the genre&nbsp;will&nbsp;love. Season 2 premieres Aug. 12 on AMC.Where to watch it: Amazon, Google Play, Hulu,&nbsp;Microsoft, VuduCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 8&nbsp;hours (for the first season)RELATED: “The Terror Truths Revealed in a Gruesome Finale and Insights from the Horror Series’ Showrunners”Sacred Games  76% (Netflix)What it is: Netflix’s first original series made in India is a doozy of a police thriller. Based on Vikram Chandra’s 2006 novel of the same name, Sacred Games follows Sartaj Singh of the Mumbai police as he battles personal demons and dives head-first into the city’s dark underbelly of crime and corruption in an effort to save it.Why you should watch it: The series begins with an anonymous call to Sartaj claiming that a looming disaster will wipe out Mumbai’s population in 25 days.&nbsp;Sacred Games’ race-against-the-clock premise does wonders here, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats and eager&nbsp;for more. Season 2 premieres in full Aug. 15 on Netflix.Where to watch it:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 6.5&nbsp;hours (for the first season)Mindhunter  97% (Netflix)What it is: Mindhunter follows FBI agents Holden Ford and Bill Tench — co-founders, along with psychologist Wendy Carr, of the Bureau’s Behavioral Science Unit — as they interview imprisoned serial killers in hopes of understanding patterns of behavior and solving open murder cases in 1977.Why you should watch it: Ripped from the pages of Mindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit by John E. Douglas and Mark Olshaker, Joe Penhall’s twisty series from executive producers David Fincher and Charlize Theron will keep you guessing to the very end — which is exactly why it became a bit of a phenomenon at the time of its 2017 premiere. Now, two years later, an excellent Jonathan Groff returns as Agent Ford to tackle one of the best-known killers of our time: Charles Manson. Season 2 premieres in full Aug. 16 on Netflix.Where to watch it:&nbsp;NetflixCommitment:&nbsp;Approx. 8&nbsp;hours (for the first season)RELATED: “Mindhunter Stars on Diving Too Deep Into Serial Killer Psychology, Hopes for Season 2”The Affair  86% (Showtime)What it is: As the old adage goes, love is a battlefield, and with The Affair, we’re here to witness some emotional warfare. The titular indiscretion comes about when Alison and Noah meet on Long Island, consummate their desires, and in turn destroy their respective marriages to Cole and Helen, respectively. The Affair is told through the four main players’ rotating perspectives.Why you should watch it: The Golden Globes love to honor a rookie series, but it’s not for nothing that The Affair swept the&nbsp;ceremony after its first season by winning best drama series and best lead actress for Ruth Wilson. Maura Tierney then went on to win for her supporting turn the following year. Male leads Dominic West and Joshua Jackson, though lacking trophies for their roles, are also stellar. Dense and emotionally trying as it may be, they each play characters that you’ll feel for as the dissipation of their happiness and potential reconciliation plays out each week. As the seasons progress, The Affair ups its&nbsp;drama and stakes&nbsp;until what is sure to be a blistering finale. Its fifth and final season premieres Aug. 25 on Showtime.Where to watch: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Microsoft, VuduCommitment: Approx. 40&nbsp;hours (for the first four&nbsp;seasons)Power  81% (Starz)What it is: From creator Courtney Kemp Agboh and starring Omari Hardwick as main anti-hero James St. Patrick, Power charts James’ life as he runs a popular nightclub in New York City while moonlighting as an underground drug kingpin. How he keeps it all together while leading a double life is just the tip of the iceberg of this series’ juicy, dramatic hit.Why you should watch it: Over the course of its five seasons, this gritty crime drama has succeeded with a&nbsp;formidable&nbsp;ensemble cast, providing criminally compelling and gloriously soapy performances. Its sixth and final season, which will be split into two halves between 2019 and and 2020, premieres Aug. 25 on Starz.Where to watch it: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, Hulu, Microsoft,&nbsp;VuduCommitment: About 50 hours (for the five&nbsp;seasons)Like this?

Those already disinclined to enjoy it saw little appeal in its early episodes, which combined Burton-esque visuals and&nbsp;Batman Begins‘ color palette into a Law &amp; Order-style police procedural. But the show weathered that storm&nbsp;— and its first year&nbsp;— to become a dependable slice of comic book television. With the series taking its final bow tonight, and introducing the Batman to its world at long last, we thought we’d take a look back at how the series found its footing and five of things it did right in the process.It Found A Remarkable Cast(Photo by Justin Stephens/Fox)Even in its roughest days, the series could boast Robin Lord Taylor, Cory Michael Smith, and a host of other actors as reasons to keep watching. Taylor, in particular, made the series’ conception of Oswald Cobblepot as a pathetic “umbrella boy” into something more than a stereotypical comic book villain. Through the years, Oswald evolved into a power player with a strange and wonderful love for his city. But Taylor always kept a little bit of the beaten-down Oswald around, allowing the scripts to make him both a menace and a joke&nbsp;— sometimes within the same scene.Even its choices for guest characters proved the show could be a magnet for great talent. Alexander Siddig and B.D. Wong proved to be great additions as Ra’s Al Ghul and Hugo Strange. That’s not to mention&nbsp;Crystal Reed as the scheming Sofia Falcone, Jessica Lucas’ long-term stay as Tabitha Galavan, and Anthony Carrigan’s take on Victor Zsasz: a darkly comic and compelling interpretation of the often-one note Batman serial killer.Oh, and we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Jada Pinkett Smith’s contributions to the show as Fish Mooney or Drew Powell as Butch Gilzean, a man who bounced from mob boss to mob boss before becoming a compelling take on DC Comics’s Solomon Grundy.But all of those criminals and villains were able to soar thanks to the show’s backbone: a cast of heroes led by Ben McKenzie. Without the (mostly) upright Jim Gordon, Gotham would’ve floundered as it tried to find itself. And from the moment he was announced, Donal Logue&nbsp;as Harvey Bullock proved to be the casting choice even the most skeptical fan could point to and say “they got that one right.” Sean Pertwee’s Alfred soon proved to be one of the most compassionate versions of the butler ever filmed, David Mazouz carved out a place for the young Bruce Wayne, and it is hard to think of Camren Bicondova’s Selina Kyle as anything less than a heroic presence&nbsp;— even if the character tried to break out of that perception.Without the core ensemble and the choicest of guest performers, the show could never have pulled off its pivot from Batman-themed procedural to the Gotham its viewers came to love.It Embraced Mania(Photo by FOX)It became clear toward the middle of the first season that the show was most comfortable embracing the mania of its Batman characters. Oswald’s shouting, Fish Mooney going big to balance out the contained John Doman as Carmine Falcone, and even that early idea about the Red Hood infecting its wearer with a homicidal megalomania suggested where the series would go in its subsequent years. By season 3, Gotham gleefully embraced its wilder impulses.Ed’s (Smith) battle with his Riddler persona accelerated. Oswald relished his newfound leadership role in the city’s underworld, and characters like Theo Galavan (James Frain) debuted. The plots rose to match the archness of the characters. Arkham became a key location as the Order of St. Dumas, The Court of Owls, and the League of Shadows all made their plays for the city. And in each storyline, characters would reach for the rafters and do things other shows&nbsp;— even superhero shows&nbsp;— could never pull off for fear of the camp edge.Let’s consider Butch’s evolution as an example: Solomon Grundy is one of those characters you just don’t expect to see in live action. Arrow flirted with the character in its early days by featuring a version of Cyrus Gold&nbsp;— Grundy’s human name —&nbsp;but soon left it behind for a greater focus on Deathstroke (Manu Bennett). But Gotham delivered the often put-upon and generally loyal Butch into a place where his transformation makes sense. The runoff from Indian Hill serves as well as the mystical energies in Gotham’s Slaughter Swamp. In doing so, it gave Butch an in-world justification for a quasi-zombie resurrection. It led to some pretty arch things, like Tabitha pummeling the sense back into Butch. But it also continued the unexpected thread between the two of them and fueled more of the show’s operatic energy when Oswald finally put him down.Then there’s the Valeskas. Though the series toyed with our expectations in regards to Jerome’s (Cameron Monaghan) destiny from carny to killer, he proved to be a delightfully unhinged prototype Joker. The arrival of his brother Jeremiah (also Monaghan) only reinforced the need for characters and performances as large and sometimes silly as the ones employed on Gotham. Once the producers knew this was the right note, it all felt consistent.It Revitalized Barbara Kean(Photo by Barbara Nitke/FOX)If you only had the first handful of episodes of Gotham to go on, you’d expect Barbara Kean (Erin Richards) to be the first character cut from the show&nbsp;— yeah, even sooner than Rene Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) and Crispus Allen (Andrew Stewart Jones). But the series performed a magic trick with the character, breathing a wild, wonderful life into her.Introduced as Jim’s buttoned-down, high society love interest, Barbara diverged from Jim’s world diverged soon after he proposed to her. After Jason Skolimiski (Milo Ventimiglia), a serial killer known as the Ogre, brainwashed her into killing her own parents, a long-buried madness awoke in Barbara. That change to the character would sustain her for the next four seasons.She re-emerged in the second season as an unhinged x-factor, a potential proto-Harley Quinn in Theo Galavan’s Maniax (a quasi-Suicide Squad). She eventually found a stronger ally in Theo’s sister Tabitha (even though she killed Barbara that one time) and Selina. Ra’s Al Ghul resurrected her and chose her as his successor for a time, but it all went badly. That misadventure still ended with Barbara killing the Demon and ordering the deaths of every male League member. She became a territorial leader during No Man’s Land and still managed to fulfill a role given to her from comic book lore: becoming Batgirl’s mother.Through it all, the character brought a certain camp energy to the show, making her a delight to watch. Ra’s Al Ghul may have been correct in his assessment — no one in Gotham City likes her&nbsp;— but we loved her. We loved her enough, in fact, that we always wanted to see her get her comeuppance, but also sighed with relief every time she stayed the hand of death itself.It Made Leslie Thompkins A Marquee Character(Photo by Jeff Neumann/FOX)First debuting in 1976’s Detective Comics #457, Dr. Leslie Thompkins was introduced as a family friend who comforted young Bruce on the night his parents were murdered and as a defender of the less-fortunate kids living near Crime Alley. Across the decades, she would become one of Batman’s confidants, but almost always a special guest character. She might matter for a storyline&nbsp;— like the time she faked Stephanie Brown’s death to prove a point to Batman&nbsp;— but she generally drifted back to Crime Alley (or Africa), out of sight and out of mind from the reader.But Leslie proved to be a character ripe for the Gotham treatment. First appearing as a guest character (played by Morena Baccarin) halfway through the first season, the almost immediate flirtation with Jim Gordon&nbsp;— and their ability to work well on cases together&nbsp;— proved too irresistible for the producers to ignore. She was a regular character from the second season onward, even when sensibility or death itself would suggest it was time to leave Gotham. And where Barbara’s path through town was a straight line, Lee’s (as the series would dub her) path proved to be a rubber band.At first as caring and altruistic as her comic book counterpart’s initial appearances, an arrogant streak emerged when she married into the Falcone crime family. Things only got worse when Jim killed her husband, Mario, in self-defense. But in infecting herself with the Alice Tetch Virus, she learned a truth that led her out of Gotham a second time (she first left after Jim was sentenced to life in prison and she miscarried their child). She soon returned to run a clinic in the Narrows (more shades of her comic book counterpart), where she eventually became its benevolent leader and started a relationships with Ed. It led to their deaths, but they both got better thanks to Nyssa Al Ghul (Jaime Murray) and her plans for the No Man’s Land Gotham. In the end, she married Jim.The series took the handful of ideas about Leslie Thompkins spread across 30 years of comics and made them a fantastic, soapy saga of one woman denying her heart. Sure, a lot of people had to die before she would accept Jim’s marriage proposal, but this is Gotham after all, where crime lords get to have happy endings.It is also the sort of show in which Lee could wheel an in-labor Barbara down a disused hospital corridor while Barbara shoots a bunch of goons in the face, leading to the two characters finally bonding after almost five full years of tension.It Tested The Nobility of Jim Gordon(Photo by FOX)In designing a Batman show without Batman,&nbsp;Gotham looked to Jim Gordon to fill the hero role. And on television, heroes get their convictions tested on the regular. Where Batman can out-muscle and out-think any threat to his worldview, Jim can only take those punches and weather those storms.And boy, did Gotham test him. From a green detective on a police force rife with corruption to commission of a city in need of some serious rebuilding, the show kept finding new ways to sweep Jim’s legs, shoot him in the shoulder, and encase him in darkness, like that time Lee buried him to make him take the Tetch Virus.But through it all, Jim always found his way back to his moral center. Sure, he made bad deals with people like Sofia Falcone and Oswald, but those decisions would prove to Jim that he could never take the convenient path. Consider just how few concession he gave during No Man’s Land: Even with resources dwindling and rival warlords chomping at the Green Zone, Jim managed to stay true to his ideals. He also managed not to kill Ed when he was revealed as the person who blew up Haven. Would Jim have had that strength without all the previous experiences, kidnappings, back-door deals, and Oswald’s attempts to be his friend? It may not have all gone smoothly, but Jim managed to save the city from tearing itself apart without the Batman.In fact, he proved you can do a Batman show without Batman. Despite the Dark Knight being the hero Gotham deserves, Jim proved one mostly good cop can hold the line as well. It makes sense. He was the first supporting character creators Bill Finger and Bob Kane introduced into Batman’s world and has had the same 80 years to develop. But Gotham allowed him to take a journey as harrowing and as dark as any his future friend would embark upon, and he is now a richer character for it.Nonetheless, as the series finale airs tonight, let’s see what the Batman can do in his&nbsp;single&nbsp;Gotham appearance.The Gotham series finale airs Thursday, April 25 at 8pm. on Fox.Like this?

Starting next Monday, Legends airs in place of Supergirl, which will in return in April. To some, the split-scheduling suggests a loss in confidence in The CW’s strangest superhero show. But according to CW President Mark Pedowitz, its audience is incredibly loyal and followed the show from its original Thursday night slot to Tuesdays. Presumably, they will be there for the Monday night move as well.But if you walked away from Legends, here are six reasons to give the show another chance.1. It Righted Its CourseIf you walked away, chances are it occurred during or near the end of the first season. And even the most dedicated fan of the series will admit its first year was a rocky beginning. The romance between Carter Hall (Falk Hentschel) and Kendra Saunders (Ciara Renee) was one of the weakest in the entire Arrowverse. The season-long fight against Vandal Savage (Casper Crump) – a worthy opponent on paper and in the comics – failed to create much momentum.But the second season removed those elements and found a new premise for the show: a group of misfits tooling around time and getting into trouble. All the while, they are chased by a charismatic group of villains and the man who teamed them up in the first place. The soft revamp focused the show while giving it a greater freedom to play with the time travel element with lively visits to the Old West, the 1940s, and even the Stone Age. A new romance between newcomers Nate Heywood (Nick Zano) and Amaya Jiwe (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) worked in ways the Hawkes never did. But perhaps the most important change to the show was adopting the devil-may-care attitude of Mick Rory (Dominic Purcell), the semi-reformed pyromaniac and thief. Suddenly, traveling in time was fun.2. Nate Heywood and Ray Palmer – History Bros!And no two characters adopted that sense of fun better than Nate and Ray Palmer (Brandon Routh). Nate was introduced as an archeologist, but his fanboy enthusiasm consistently disarmed his researcher’s eye, leading to even bigger changes to the timestream than the Legends hoped to avoid. But almost always at his side to squee when meeting people like George Lucas and King Arthur is Ray, a clever scientist who also can’t help but want to be at a Comic-Con as long and as deep as history himself.In that Camelot episode — which turned out to be the creation of a timelost superhero — Ray reveals his admiration for the time to Sir Galahad. When the knight is later killed in a sneak attack, Ray offers to take his place despite Nate revealing that a “Sir Raymond of the Palms” suddenly appeared in the Arthurian legend and is fated to die on the battlefield. While it seems Ray’s childhood wish gets the best of him, he heeds Nate’s words and wears an extra layer of protection during the fated battle against.Shortly thereafter, the two find themselves on the set of a low-budget sci-fi movie assisting George Lucas. The two could not be more thrilled as Star Wars inspired Ray to study the sciences and Indiana Jones led Nate to the path of anthropology. But when their fanboying scares Lucas into quitting film school, they suddenly lose all knowledge of their original pursuits.Its clever turns like the this which makes the show a rewarding watch week after week. But not every moment boils down to goofing off in time; and Legends knows how to switch to seriousness.3. Sara’s Journey to CaptainOver the course of the first two seasons, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) the undead Canary of Arrow fame went from reckless brawler with a bottle of Jack Daniels in her hand to a competent team leader. Original team captain Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) later claimed that was his intention from the start, but it also looks like a happy accident as time often plays tricks on him. The end result for Sara is a role she was meant to have, but could never find in the Star City of Oliver Queen&nbsp;or in the League of Assassin’s stronghold in Nanda Parbat (although she has made her way there to recenter herself once or twice).But the toughest moment for Sara occurred when she learned her sister Laurel (Katie Cassidy) was killed at the hands of magician Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough). When a younger Darkh emerged as their enemy, it took everything in her power to avoid assassinating him and wrecking the timeline. The fact she resisted it despite a couple of good opportunities to avenge Laurel prove she has grown a great deal since her post-resurrection impulsiveness. Granted, she can still be impulsive from time to time.That sort of character growth can be seen in the Firestorm pair of Jax (Franz Drameh) and Martin Stein (Victor Garber). Still strangers for the most part when they got aboard the Legends’ timeship, they were definitely family by the end of their story earlier this year thanks to body-swapping, repeated encounter with Stein’s younger self, and a dangerous rescue from a Soviet gulag.But something has to motivate all this time travel, and it typically emanates from the Legion of Doom.4. The Legion of DoomNamed in honor of the Super Friends’ antagonists, season 2 brought Darhk, Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman), and the Reverse-Flash (Matt Letscher) together under a common goal: claim the Spear of Destiny and rewrite their pasts. Though the term “Legion of Doom” was met with derision by Sara when Nate and Ray first used it, Darhk himself fell in love with it, which is key to understanding the villain’s role on Legends.McDonough, who returns this year as Darhk following the events of Arrow’s fourth season, delights in his villainy. Unlike the darker or more complicated big bads like Zoom (Teddy Sears and the voice of Tony Todd) or Clifford DeVoe (Neil Sandilands), Darhk enjoys himself. He was that way on Arrow as well, but as they voice of the opposition, he brings an energy Savage lacked in Legends‘ first season. Also, Darhk’s sense of fun is infectious. Malcolm Merlyn starts to laugh more and even when the pair are trying to stab each other in the back, there’s a good-natured sense about it.But the Legion of Doom can be a serious threat. Reverse-Flash, desperate to stop a time-wraith from erasing him, was all business until he was seemingly victorious. And Darkh’s partner this year — the unseen Mallus (voiced by John Noble) — is not the quippy confrere Malcolm Merlyn was last year. Yet, in balancing that sense of menace with a shot of glee, the Legion of Doom manages to be the most engaging set of villains around.5. It’s Consistently FunnyBut what sets Legends apart the most is its willingness to be funny. Where The Flash occasionally remembers it was originally the show with the lighter tone and shrinks Cisco (Carlos Valdes) and Ralph (Hartley Sawyer) to LEGO minifig size, Legends will set an entire episode around Christmas turning into an Odinsday celebration thanks to a timelost Christmas gift named Beebo. It even uses the “Merry Christmas” greeting to determine whether or not the team saved Christmas or bungled things up worse.It got worse before it got better.Another recent episodes saw a young Ray Palmer (Jack Fisher) living out the plot of E.T.: The Extra-terrestrial with deadly Dominators instead of a benevolent mushroom creature (or whatever E.T. is supposed to be). The jokes come fast as Nate finds himself attracted to Ray’s mother; which the shape-shifting Dominator matron uses against him. Also, newcomer Zari (Tala Ashe) openly mocks the team’s costumes despite putting one on herself.Though Mick Rory’s complicated relationship with his father was explored during a trip to the Vietnam War recently, his cutting remarks and permanently affixed beer bottle are always a guaranteed laugh. But his drinking habit also led to television’s only funny intervention as an alternate reality version of his old friend Leonard Snart (Wentworth Miller), pointed out his chemical dependence. Mick’s attempt to go cold turkey underscores Purcell’s comedic chops and the show’s ability to find a comedic edge in its darker elements.6. Wally West And John Constantine Are Stopping ByConstantine fans will be happy to know that Matt Ryan is making another appearance as the trench-coat-wearing magician and grifter. This time, he needs Sara’s help to exorcise a demon who happens to know her name. If the show is bringing the team to an asylum with Constantine, you know you can expect at least two extended Exorcist jokes.And in the weeks ahead, Wally West (Keiynan Lonsdale) debuts as a permanent fixture on Legends. Criminally underused on The Flash since season four began, Wally’s unfortunate also-ran (pun intended) status makes him a perfect addition to the team. He and Nate are already friends, as seen in the first episode of Legends‘ third season. He is also a dependable fighter, as seen in 2017’s “Crisis on Earth-X” crossover event. His speedster powers also set him apart from the motley assortment of gadgets, powers and fighting prowess aboard the Waverider.DC’s Legends of Tomorrow is definitely the breeziest of The CW superhero shows, but its mix of humor, pathos, ridiculous plots and character growth also makes it the closest thing to reading a late-1980s or early-1990s comic book. The team is also fun to be around as they experience the very same thrill viewers get by seeing Julius Caesar incite a bunch a frat bros into crossing the Rubicon. Well, it was really Aruba in 2017. You kind of had to be there.And if you weren’t, there’s never been a better time to give Legends of Tomorrow another shot.DC’s Legends of Tomorrow returns Monday, February 12 at 9/8C on The CW.","section":"Comics on TV","tags":"Century, indie, Swim, Peacock, The, robots, comic, awards, binge, universal, documentaries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/08175808/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-600x314.jpg","slug":"6-reasons-to-give-dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-another-chance-2"},{"id":"47508714539100","title":"All Kevin Smith Movies, Ranked By Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)All Kevin Smith Movies RankedThe story of Kevin Smith making his first movie starts out like the story of most indie filmmakers following a dream in the ’80s and ’90s: Maxing out credit cards, risking financial ruin all in sheer tyranny of belief that the majorly groundbreaking screenplay you wrote is your ticket into the business. Smith’s story ends differently than most: He actually made it.‘Twas the right time, right place (unlike all those contractors on the Death Star) for Smith’s Clerks. Audiences and studios alike were hungry for outsider voices, and the guy from New Jersey holding a scuzzy black-and-white comedy was as outsidery as you can get. Released the same October week in 1994 as Pulp Fiction, Clerks set a new high for those aiming low, and thus the American independent movement of the ’90s was born.Smith’s next movie, Mallrats, showed he was serious about giving voice to pop culture nerds, slackers, and stoners, throwing more references to movies and more reverence to comic books, to the point of roping in Stan Lee as a sage, secondary character. Smith had his most promising leap forward in writing and direction with Chasing Amy, and then took on a more aggressive front against the status quo with the iconoclastic Dogma. The organized religion send-up featured a growing cadre of stars willing to yuk it up in Smith’s unified Askewniverse (like Matt Damon, Salma Hayek, Alan Rickman, and Chris Rock), with Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob a consistent, comedy presence. (Check out our oral history of Jay and Silent bob with Smith.)The two characters were upgraded to lead status with Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, before Smith returned to his roots in Jersey Girl and Clerks II. With the Judd Apatow style changing the comedy landscape, Smith stuck his own thumb into the pie, mixing extreme raunchiness and sweet sincerity in Zack and Miri Make a Porno.The 2010s began with Cop Out, a failed stab at Hollywood big-budget action filmmaking, and an experience Smith now openly derides. Red State just edged by with enough critics for a Fresh rating, and would begin a 3-movie string operating in horror. Tusk has its defenders. Yoga Hosers definitely does not. For his latest, Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, Smith hit the streets, doing roadshow screenings with Q&amp;As city by city. Not only did that bring together his fans in community, but also played up Smith’s strengths as a world-class raconteur, whose gift of gab has helped him create an empire of podcasts and review shows, overshadowing his directing career in recent years. His next movie is horror-comedy Killroy Was Here, scheduled for a 2020 Fall release.

Apted took over directorial duties after the first installment, 1964’s 7 Up, and released a new installment every seven years without fail, up to 2019’s 63 Up. Roger Ebert called the project “an inspired, even noble, use of the film medium.”Beyond the social intimacy of his documentaries, Apted navigated the studio corridors respectably, specializing in dramas and thrillers. Coal Miner’s Daughter, Gorillas in the Mist, Enigma, and Amazing Grace represent some of the best of this work, and Apted even entered blockbuster territory with the James Bond entry The World is Not Enough&nbsp;and took a crack at Narnia with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.And now we look Michael Apted’s movies ranked by Tomatometer.#24Incident at Oglala (1992) 100%#24Adjusted Score: 100.814% Critics Consensus: No consensus yet.Synopsis: Michael Apted's documentary examines the 1975 slaying of two FBI agents in Oglala, SD, which resulted in the arrest and...

Macy); and espionage entanglements (Killers, starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher). What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212410[/tomatometer]Get Him to the GreekIt might seem like fun to hang with your favorite rock star – unless you actually have to do it. The critics say Get Him to the Greek takes this inspired premise and wrings plenty of terrific gags from it, making for a film that has such high energy that its lapses are easy to forgive. In this quasi-sequel to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jonah Hill stars as a low-level record company employee who’s been given a daunting assignment: get a crazed, hedonistic rock star (Russell Brand) to show up on time for his band’s 10-year reunion show. Naturally, everything goes haywire as Hill finds himself in the midst of his target’s wild lifestyle. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Get Him to the Greek may not be the most disciplined comedy in the world, and it gets a little mushy at the end, but for the most part, this is a raunchy, clever, and deftly-acted good time. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down our favorite cinematic party animals.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1208173[/tomatometer]SpliceGiven our collective anxieties about both childbirth and cloning, a movie like Splice is sure to touch a nerve. And critics say this sci-fi/horror flick is a creepy and provocative piece of work – even if it doesn’t completely live up to its fantastic premise. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley star as a pair of biochemists who craft a new being by combining human DNA with a miasma of animal features – and must confront the moral and practical ramifications of their creation. The pundits say Splice has an ice-cold, queasily compelling look, and is smarter and more philosophical than your typical horror fare, though it’s hampered by an uneven tone and a middling conclusion.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1226669[/tomatometer]MarmadukeMarmaduke has been in the funny pages since the 1950s, so it was inevitable that the gigantic, implicitly savage pooch would eventually wind up on the big screen. Unfortunately, critics say there’s precious little to chew on here, despite the presence of some talented actors. Marmaduke (voiced by Owen Wilson) finds the titular Great Dane on the run after an embarrassing mishap with his new masters, who hit the road to find him; hilarious talking-dog hi-jinks and romance ensue. The pundits say this is strictly juvenile fare padded to feature length, with little to delight kids or their parents.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011824[/tomatometer]KillersIt appears the folks behind Killers don’t believe their film will slay with the critics, since it wasn’t screened prior to release. Jen (Katherine Heigl) is a lonely gal who’s just met Spencer, a guy who seems to be too good to be true; naturally, it turns out he’s a secret agent and she’s about to get caught in the line of fire.

Hood vs Evil, with voice work from Hayden Panettiere and Patrick Warburton). What do the critics have to say?Fast Five 77%Action sequels are always mercenary cash-grabs, and by the time a fifth installment hits theaters, any pretension to quality has pretty much evaporated. Right? Not necessarily, if the reviews of Fast Five are anything to go by — critics say this installment delivers high-octane thrills and rarely pauses for thought, leaving the sporadic success of the first four films in the dust. Once again, ex-cop Brian O’Conner (Paul Walker) and ex-con Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) team up with a bunch of their old comrades to participate in a daring street race (this time in Rio) while staying one step ahead of the law. The pundits say the Certified Fresh Fast Five is borderline avant-garde in its refusal to adhere to logic or the laws of physics, but that’s one of its strengths — the action sequences are breathtaking, and a sly sense of humor and breakneck pace keep things from ever getting stuck in neutral.Prom 35%Given that it’s a Disney release, one can safely assume that Prom won’t delve into the ribald, risqué territory that many associate with (or remember from) prom night. And while critics say this sweet, good-natured comedy has its virtues — among them an appealing young cast — it’s really, really predictable, and a little too squeaky-clean. The film follows Aimee Teegarden and a group of her friends who are trying to plan out every detail necessary for the perfect prom. However, sometimes real life intrudes on even the best laid plans, and soon friendships are tested and nerves are frayed. The pundits say Prom is generally better than it has to be, offering a wish-fulfillment fantasy that’s sincere and non-threatening, but it’s also clichéd, lighter-than-air fluff. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we run down memorable movie proms).Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil 11%Hoodwinked didn’t exactly set the world afire, but a few critics found its Little Red Riding Hood-meets-Rashomon conceit charming and sporadically funny. Now comes Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil, and critics say whatever modest pleasures were to be found in its predecessor have been steamrolled by middling animation and played-out pop culture references. Hayden Panettiere steps into the role of Red, who’s joined a paramilitary group and is tasked with rescuing Hansel and Gretel from an evil witch. The pundits say Hoodwinked Too! is weighted down by corny wisecracks and sub-par animation, stranding a talented voice cast in a kiddie flick that’s unlikely to delight tots or their parents.Dylan Dog: Dead of Night 7%It appears that the folks behind Dylan Dog: Dead of Night knew their flick was a dog, since it wasn’t screened for critics prior to its release. Brandon Routh stars as the title character, a private investigator whose clients include werewolves, vampires, and zombies, all of whom are ready to duke it out if our hero can’t track down a mysterious artifact.

What do the critics have to say?Steve Carell has patented a very specific type of character: One who bristles with unearned self-confidence, fecklessness, and occasional decency and competence. Who better to update the role of Maxwell Smart, the most clueless of secret agents? Well, critics say Get Smart benefits from Carell’s screen persona, but falters when it delves into action territory. Stepping into the role made famous byDon Adams, Carell is Maxwell Smart, an overeager and under-qualified spy who’s recruited along with the lovely Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to take down KAOS, a sinister organization bent on world domination. The pundits say Get Smart is amiable enough, buoyed by a solid cast (includingDwayne “The Rock” Johnson,Alan Arkin, andTerence Stamp) and some solid laughs. But others complain it devolves into a generic action flick, missing the sharp satire of the original show. At 52 percent on the Tomatometer, Get Smart missed it by that much. (Check out pics from the Get Smart premierehere.)“I knew we should’ve taken that left turn at Albuquerque.”After a long hiatus from live-action comedy, Mike Myers is back, playing a New Age spiritualist in The Love Guru. The critics’ advice to Myers: Heal thyself. An American raised by gurus in India, Pitka returns to North America to establish himself in the self-help game; his first undertaking is to help a hockey star heal from the wounds of a recent romantic breakup. The critics say The Love Guru is relentlessly juvenile, wasting a solid collection of players (including Jessica Alba,Justin Timberlake,Ben Kingsley, andVerne Troyer) on shticky comic set pieces that lack rhythm or wit. At 13 percent, The Love Guru is less than enlightening. It’s also one of the worst-reviewed films of Myers’ career.“Welcome to Being John Malkovich, LLC.”Also opening this week in limited release:Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, starringAbigail Breslin as a plucky Depression-era girl who solves a mystery and saves her family’s house in the process, is at 68 percent.Expired, a dark indie comedy starringSamantha Morton andJason Patric as parking meter officers in love, is at 75 percent;And Brick Lane, the story of a Bangladeshi woman who experiences culture shock after an arranged marriage brings her to London, is at 60 percent.“You can still get a job after Batman &amp; Robin!”Recent Mike Myers Movies:————————————-42% — Shrek the Third (2007)89% — Shrek 2 (2004)12% — Dr. Seuss’ the Cat in the Hat (2003)14% — View From the Top (2003)55% — Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002)Recent Steve Carell Movies:———————————–78% — Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!

Jackson); a disgruntled hunchback (the CGI Igor, with voice work by John Cusack and Molly Shannon); a haunted dentist (Ghost Town, starring Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear); and a date from hell (My Best Friend’s Girl, starring Dane Cook and Kate Hudson). What do the critics have to say?Say what you will about the films of Neil LaBute, but give him this: while he rarely delivers a fun time at the movies, he’s no slave to convention. Unfortunately, critics say Lakeview Terrace offers an intriguing setup before devolving into a routine thriller finale. Samuel L. Jackson stars as a strict, emotionally damaged LAPD who objects to his new neighbors’ interracial marriage; after extensive harassment, the young couple (played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington) fights back. Pundits say the problem with Lakeview Terrace is that it presents a realistic, charged scenario before jumping the rails in the final act, substituting smart characterization with generic vigilante tropes. At 36 percent on the Tomatometer, you may not want to visit Lakeview Terrace.“Ugh, Sam’s at it again…. chewing the scenery at three in the morning…”It’s one thing to make a macabre children’s film; it’s another to make one that doesn’t deliver much entertainment. Critics say the film is something of a Frankenstein’s monster, stitching together recycled parts from Shrek and The Nightmare Before Christmas. The titular hunchback (voiced by John Cusack) is tired of being a lowly lab assistant; he wants to be an evil scientist in his own right. But when one of his creations, a monster named Eva (Molly Shannon) turns out to be really sweet at heart, Igor begins to rethink his priorities. While the pundits say Igor has moments of Tim Burton-esque visual invention, it’s a pretty mediocre affair, filled with shopworn pop-culture references and manic action but few laughs; plus, it’s probably a bit too dark for the wee ones. At 20 percent on the Tomatometer, Igor could use more brains.“You too can have your very own Contour Chair.”Ricky Gervais is a very funny man, but thus far, his movie career has consisted of supporting roles. However, with Ghost Town, the man who brought so much cringe-worthy wit to The Office and Extras takes center stage — and the pundits say the result is delightful. Gervais stars as Bertram Pincus, who has a near-death experience and discovers he can see ghosts — and they’re pretty annoying, especially the caddish Frank (Greg Kinnear). But those specters are of some help, as Bertram learns to be a better person — and find love in the process. The pundits say Ghost Town is a perfect fit for Gervais’s talents, and the film emits awkward laughs and warmth without devolving into schmaltz. At 84 percent on the Tomatometer, Ghost Town has plenty of blithe spirit. (Check out this week’s Total Recall for a ghoulish compendium of some of our favorite cinematic apparitions.)“For the last time, I am not pug-nosed!”Given that it wasn’t screened prior to release, it’s unlikely critics will be BFFs with My Best Friend’s Girl. Dane Cook, Kate Hudson, and Jason Biggs star in this romantic comedy about a guy who’s so obnoxious he convinces potentially straying women to stand by their men — before falling for his main homey’s boo. Kids, call up you best friend’s girl and ask her for insight in guessing the Tomatometer!

What do the critics have to say?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207149[/tomatometer]The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, from 1974, was a stylish mix of comedy and thrills that, despite its reputation, is just dated enough to warrant a remake. However, critics say that Tony Scott‘s take, while slick and hyperkinetic, lacks the grit and cool of the original. John Travolta stars as Ryder, who takes control of a New York City subway car and its passengers, demanding a hefty ransom. Meanwhile, subway dispatcher Garber (Denzel Washington) tries to thwart Ryder’s plot. The pundits say the film is well-acted but has little sense of economy or patience; it’s a well-made but empty exercise. (See our feature “A Hundred Years of Heist Films,” in which we break down the caper genre by decade.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190964[/tomatometer]Imagine ThatImagine That has an intriguing premise, especially in these economically tumultuous times: what if a child’s fantasy world could predict the ebb and flow of the stock market? Unfortunately, critics say Imagine That does little with its setup, despite solid work from Eddie Murphy and newcomer Yara Shahidi. Murphy stars as Evan Danielson, a financial advisor who spends little time with his daughter. That changes when he discovers that her drawings and imaginary friends appear to have a preternatural understanding of the investment world. But will Evan learn to become a better dad? The pundits say Murphy is admirably restrained, and Shahidi is a natural, but the film around them is only sporadically amusing; it’s also overly gimmicky and predictable. (Check out this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down Murphy’s best-reviewed films.)Also opening this week in limited release:Youssou N’Dour: I Bring What I Love, a documentary about the great Senegalese singer and his attempt to bridge the musical divide between the sacred and the secular, is at 100 percent.Food Inc., a doc about corporate control (and the lack of governmental oversight) over the food industry, is at 95 percent.Moon, starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey in a dark thriller about corporate skullduggery on the lunar surface, is at 90 percent.Sex Positive, a doc about the complex life and times of gay health activist Richard Berkowitz, is at 67 percent.Blast!, a doc about a team of tenacious scientists and their search for the origins of life on Earth, is at 60 percent.Francis Ford Coppola‘s latest, Tetro, starring Vincent Gallo as a man living in Buenos Aires and haunted by his past, is at 50 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"comic, Nominations, Pirates, Annual, 99%, book, adaptation, Tarantino, worst, mission:, TNT, who","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-Pelham-1-2-3-Doesnt-Quite-Take"},{"id":"47508801373035","title":"Critics Consensus: Who‘s Better, Who‘s Best; Never Goes Down; Guess Doomsday‘s Tomatometer!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: Who's Better, Who's Best; Never Goes Down; Guess Doomsday's Tomatometer!Summarizing the critical voice on this week's movies.by Tim Ryan | March 13, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekat the movies, we’ve Seussian silliness (Dr.Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who!, starringJimCarrey and Steve Carrell), mixed martial arts madness (Never Back Down,starring Sean Faris andDjimon Hounsou), and apocalyptic action (Doomsday,starringRhona Mitra). What do the critics have tosay?Virtually no one denies thegenius of Dr. Seuss’ books, but it’s been an open question whether theircompact, staccato whimsy could be translated into feature-length films; theresults thus far have been middling (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 52percent on the Tomatometer) to poor (The Cat in the Hat, 12 percent).However, critics say the CG Horton Hears a Who is easily the mostSeussian Seuss feature, and therefore the best. Horton (JimCarrey) is anelephant who stumbles across the microscopic Who-ville; he promises to protectthe tiny inhabitants, despite ridicule from his fellow pachyderms. The punditssay Horton is filled with deft animation, solid voice work, valuable lifelessons, and good cheer — and if the runtime is a little padded, the moviestill maintains the enchanting, thoughtful spirit of Seuss’ books. At 74 percenton the Tomatometer, Horton may be a cut below the animatedHow theGrinch Stole Christmas (100 percent), but it’s still cause for Who-bilation.(Check out co-director JimmyHayward’s favorite animated filmshere.)“…And this is our lolcat wing.”Never Back Downis yetanother film in which a wayward teen learns about martial arts — and life —from a stern-but-caring teacher. Wasn’t Ralph Macchio in a movie like this a fewyears back? Perhaps, but critics say NBD is still a reasonably involvingtake on old material. The movie starsSean Faris as an unmoored, ill-temperedyoungster who, after being humiliated in a fight with a classmate, learns mixedmartial arts under the tutelage ofDjimon Hounsouand, in the process, how to better focus his bluster. Pundits say Never BackDown‘s premise may be old as the hills, but pundits say it’s made with moreskill and panache than the material would indicate. At 36 percent on theTomatometer, the critical reception to Never Back Down puts the “mixed”into mixed martial arts.

What do the critics have to say?Affleck as George Reeves romances Lane’s Toni Mannix, wife of MGM studio head Eddie Mannix.More than a whodunit, \"Hollywoodland\" explores fame’s transience and the price paid in pursuit of it. The focus of this cautionary tale is George Reeeves (Ben Affleck), a struggling actor who finds notoriety as the Man of Steel on the ’50s TV series \"The Adventures of Superman.\" Much to his dismay, kryptonite for actors turns out to be unemployment, as he finds it difficult to get roles because he’s so well known as Superman. His torrid love affair with the wife of MGM’s studio chief doesn’t help his cause, either. His death, caused by a bullet to the chest, remains shrouded in mystery: Was it suicide or murder? Critics say the movie doesn’t quite fly with its lumbering narrative, but the performers are in top form. As of this writing, \"Hollywoodland\" has a Tomatometer of 68%.Say hello to my little friend…Tony Jaa is out for revenge in the actioner \"The Protector.\" Traveling from his native Thailand to Australia, he seeks those responsible for killing his father and kidnapping his elephants.

What do the critics have to say?A Secret Service agent is determined to save the president from an assassination attempt. It’s a setup that has worked successfully before (\"In the Line of Fire\"), but critics say \"The Sentinel\" isn’t sharp enough to make good on its premise. Michael Douglas stars as the agent who falls into a web of intrigue, and Kiefer Sutherland, who’s getting pretty good at foiling conspiracies, plays his protege. Critics say the film is slick, but a bit too convoluted to really work. At 26 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"Sentinel\" is not very well-fortified.What is \"American Dreamz?\" Is it a comedy? A satire? An ambitious attempt to capture the zeitgeist of our politically divided, entertainment-craving times? More to the point, is Paul Weitz‘s latest any good? In parts, the critics say, but not as a whole. \"American Dreamz\" tells the story of a recently re-elected, now intellectually curious president (Dennis Quaid) who makes a guest appearance on a popular TV singing competition where would-be songbirds and would-be terrorists convene. The critics say \"American Dreamz\" is a bit too ambitious for its own good, and lacks the sharp bite to really work as satire. At 38 percent on the Tomatometer, this one may not be the stuff that \"Dreamz\" are made of.We’re guessing that the people behind \"Silent Hill\" would consider the little girl on the poster to be the perfect movie critic for one reason: she’s got no mouth. And there isn’t anything for the critics to say, because, like a bunch of other movies this year (all of which have turned out to be critical duds), \"Silent Hill\" was not screened for the scribes.

In what seems to be becoming a familiar Hollywood story, Watts was discovered following an independent film of his that made a splash when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.The name of the film is Cop Car, and Watts’ honest and grounded handling of the film’s young leads is what put him on Marvel’s radar for this latest take on the well-known webslinger – one that would find Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, back in high school, navigating the complexities of coming of age while also having super powers.“What’s important is to just try to remember what it was like to be that age,” Watts told Rotten Tomatoes. “For me, it was like if I was 15 and I could do what Peter Parker could do, that would be so much fun. That would be so amazing, and there’s no way around it. Drama will come and dramatic things definitely happen in the movie, and there’s a lot of awesome action and all of that. But fundamentally, I wanted to approach this from the perspective of enthusiasm and excitement.”Watts devoured every coming-of-age movie he could get his hands on while prepping to make Spider-Man: Homecoming, and when Rotten Tomatoes sat down with him to discuss his Five Favorite Films, the director insisted we stay on theme, natch.Here, then, are the Spidey director’s five favorite coming-of-age movies.The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups) (1959)  100%I would say that’s the first quintessential coming-of-age movie. It felt so real, and it just captured the freedom, danger, fear, hope, and everything that comes with being a kid. It’s one of the best movies ever made. It was such a shock to the world when it came out, too, and it was, like, “Oh, wow. You can make movies like this?” It stands up, too.Leolo (1992)  90%This is a really obscure one, but there’s a really weird French-Canadian movie called Leolo. Roger Ebert loved it. He gave it a four-star review when it came out. The filmmaker, Jean-Claude Lauzon…&nbsp;He made two movies and then he died. It’s a really tragic story. It’s this surreal, messed-up story about a kid whose family is going insane, and so he comes up with these fantastical stories to escape from his world. I saw that movie when I was in high school, and it just made such an impression on me because of the way it balanced humor and absurdity, and surrealism, and then just tragedy. It’s great. I should probably see it again. I haven’t seen it in a couple of years, so I want to make sure it still stands up. That movie is another very particularly strange coming-of-age movie that will always be a reference for me.Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995)  90%Welcome to the Dollhouse is great. Even though it’s about a girl in middle school, to me, that feels like the most honest reflection of what being a kid around that age feels like. It’s just so bad. It’s like that movie captures the very worst moments of being that age so perfectly. Everything is unfair, everyone hates you, and the world is totally against you. It’s such a good coming-of-age movie.River's Edge (1987)  88%I love River’s Edge. River’s Edge is one of those movies like… I grew up in Colorado. When I saw it, I was like, “That’s more like where I’m from than a John Hughes movie.” It’s like seeing that, and then seeing Gummo. That feels more like where I’m from than Can’t Hardly Wait.Mazes and Monsters (1982) This one isn’t a high school movie, but more a college-age movie. It’s called Mazes and Monsters and it stars Tom Hanks. It’s about the dangers of role-playing games, and if you play these role-playing games, you’ll lose touch with reality. Tom Hanks is a kid who gets too into their version of Dungeons and Dragons, which they call Mazes and Monsters. He loses touch with reality and thinks he really is on the quest, and disappears into New York City. His friends have to try and find him. It’s definitely worth checking out if you can find it. It might be one of those movies that just disappeared. I think it was a made-for-TV movie, but it’s always affected me. I saw it when I was a kid on the Saturday afternoon matinee movie, and it just has this ending that is so bleak that I’ll never forget.According to Watts, he hopes Homecoming will serve as a launching pad for more Spider-Man stories that, like the movies mentioned above, are honest and respectful of what it’s like growing up, but also captivating and wildly exciting because, well, Spider-Man!Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;opens everywhere on&nbsp;Friday, July 7.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Trek, Review, Classic, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/06161118/Jon-Watts-FFF1.jpg","slug":"spider-man-homecoming-director-jon-watts-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508816178192","title":"Yuen Woo-Ping’s Five Favorite Fight Scenes","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yuen Woo-Ping's Five Favorite Fight ScenesThe legendary fight choreographer of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and director of Master Z: Ip Man Legacy reflects on his own work.by RT Staff | April 12, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by VCG/Getty Images)You may not immediately recognize Yuen Woo-ping‘s name, but if you’ve seen the Matrix movies, the Kill Bill movies, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, then you’ve seen his work. The renowned martial arts director and fight choreographer has orchestrated some of the most memorable and thrilling action sequences in all of cinema, working with people like Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh, and Donnie Yen. Some of his films, like Iron Monkey, Wing Chun, and the original Drunken Master, are widely celebrated classics of the genre, which has benefited from his talents for nearly half a century.This week, Yuen releases his latest directorial effort, a spinoff of the popular Ip Man franchise called Master Z: Ip Man Legacy. The film focuses on a martial arts master in 1960s Hong Kong who loses a duel with Ip Man and decides to retire, only to be drawn back into fighting by a local drug dealer. Normally, we would ask Yuen what his Five Favorite Films were, but with such an extensive list of credits, we thought we’d do something a little more interesting. With that in mind, read on for Yuen Woo-ping’s five favorite fight scenes that he himself directed.Master Z: Ip Man Legacy (2019)  89%The Sign FightThis one is from my most recent film so it’s still fresh in my mind. The idea was to do a fight completely at height on the signs on our Hong Kong street set. We designed the sequence for months as the wire work with that many people was especially complicated. It was all done off real buildings, nothing was done in a studio. We were hesitant to commit to this sequence because we were shooting in the middle of typhoon season and we were worried the wind would destroy our set and we would not have time to rebuild and would have to scrap the sequence midway through. In the end, we took a chance and the heavens watched over us and we finished the sequence three days early.Iron Monkey (2001)  91%Paper CatchingThough not really a fight, this sequence of grabbing papers caught in a wind has a special place in my heart. It’s one of the times where we take all the martial arts know-how and use it on a character moment without combat. A beautiful little scene.The Grandmaster (2013)  78%Train Station FightHero fights with two people are the most fun to choreograph and probably also the most entertaining to watch. This film was a long time in the making – almost three years. The actors trained hard to learn martial arts and it all shows in this scene. Zhang Ziyi’s bagua and Max Zhang’s xingyi are on full display and we incorporated the best moves from each style. It was the perfect culmination of martial arts, hard work, and cinema.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2001)  97%Tie: Night Chase and Dojo FightThe film is regarded as a classic but many people were skeptical when Ang Lee wanted to make this film. We really pushed ourselves on these two sequences. The Night Chase sequence not only had to have the actors flying on rooftops, but the cameramen as well. Combined with Tan Dun’s drums, the sequence is as thrilling to watch as it was to make.The Dojo Fight was a fun sequence. Ang Lee wanted a fight with “everything” so we used every weapon we could think of. Even though there are a couple comedic beats in the sequence, it really showed how powerful the Green Destiny sword was in the story.Drunken Master (Jui kuen) (1978)  79%Final FightThis was my second film as director and it was made in same style as my first film, Snake in the Eagle’s Shadow. I got to work with my father, who first got me into filmmaking. Since I was still just starting out, the budget and schedule were very tight. And at that point, people were still figuring out the kung fu genre, so we were really left to figure things out on our own. All the hard work paid off and the film was a huge success in Asia. It made drunken boxing popular again to the point where wushu started practicing it again. It made Jackie Chan a star and it got me work for years to come.Master Z: Ip Man Legacy&nbsp;opens in limited release on Friday,&nbsp;April 12.Like this?

When we recently chatted with Moss about her Five Favorite Films, she initially limited her choices to movies about relationships — a major theme in her new film — but as we spoke, we discovered another common thread throughout them. See the full list here:&nbsp;Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977; 98% Tomatometer)The first one is Annie Hall. All of these movies are movies that… I mean, I feel that most people’s favorite movies are movies that you can see over and over again. That’s just a movie that, you know, I don’t know how many times I’ve seen it and it doesn’t even matter anymore. It’s one of those movies that, every time it comes on TV, I have to sit down and watch it even if I’ve seen it before. To talk about why I love it, I mean, what do I even say? “Because I’m not a moron [laughing]? That’s why I love it?”That’s a good reason. I like it.OK, good, we’ll go with that. “Because I’m not a moron.”Do you remember when you first saw it?No I don’t. I’ve no idea when I first saw it, no idea.But you watch it over and over again? Every time it’s on?For sure. It’s definitely something that, yeah, in fact, just talking about it is making me want to watch it.You mention relationships in your upcoming film. What is it about the relationship in Annie Hall that is attractive to you?It’s such a real relationship, you know. I mean the first thing I love about Annie Hall is the humor. It’s just hilarious. It’s a really funny movie. But it’s a very real relationship story and one of my favorite moments is the montage at the end when he goes over all the great moments that he and Annie had. And it’s just that great kind of, like, even after a relationship goes south and you break up or whatever happens, I just love that, the way he looks at it and goes, “Yeah there were a lot of good moments though [laughing].” It has this really, weirdly positive ending.When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, 1989; 88% Tomatometer)That’s a film that, for me, that’s one that, even more than Annie Hall, is like an I-know-every-word kind of movie, you know, that I just can’t get over. It’s very comforting to me. It’s one of those comfort films. And it’s also really funny. And it’s one of those movies like… All the things about these romantic comedies and relationship movies or whatever, they don’t even make them like that any more, you know? Except for independent film. Independent film sometimes does, but you don’t really see them.Yeah, the styles change, even on television. Everything is changing. And I think what happens is sometimes we get kicked back, we revisit what we enjoyed about previous decades and we see a new variation come up again.Yeah, yeah. Totally.Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950; 98% Tomatometer)This is a film — and this is kind of going away from this relationship theme — but this is a film that, when I was little, I loved. I mean, I’ve loved it my whole life. I don’t know what that says about me, but I loved Sunset Boulevard. I was a big old-movie fan when I was, you know, older than most people should be when they’re older-movie fans. [Gloria Swanson is] just so spectacular in that film and it sort of formed my idea of that raw, dramatic acting. And the writing… The writing in that movie is unbelievable. So many incredible one-liners. It’s one of those movies that you can watch now and you’re just, like, “Damn, that was a good line,” you know? Like, God, that was some good writing back then. The thing is that movies written that way wouldn’t fit in, really, these days. It would sound strange, like you couldn’t really do it now. But thank God we have them.Sweet Smell of Success (Alexander Mackendrick, 1957; 98% Tomatometer)Another movie I’m going to give you is the same thing. I mean, it’s just that the writing is unbelievable, and that’s Sweet Smell of Success. It was a movie I discovered a little bit later, like maybe in my teens. And that was another move that I was just like, “Jesus, the writing on this thing, it’s unbelievable.” The one-liners are so smart, you know? I loved movies like Sunset Boulevard and I loved the kind of Hitchcock films and all of these kind of things and then I saw Sweet Smell of Success and I was like, “Oooh, this is a little bit naughtier,” you know what I mean? There’s something a little bit darker about that movie. The performances in it are so priceless. It was a little bit more of a leap in the cinematography, I think, than maybe those of, like, Sunset Boulevard or something. The lighting, it was very harsh. They were doing things with the cinematography that I was like, “Ooh, this is naughty,” like, “You’re not supposed to do that.” You know?So you do have a bit of a dark side.Yes for sure, for sure. But I mean mainly it was the writing, that is what attracts me to the older black and white classics.All About Eve (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1950; 100% Tomatometer)I know I’m kind of sticking in an era. I’m sorry. I know I could probably go to cooler areas like the 1960s and 1970s and stuff.That’s what you like, though.Yeah, I mean those are the films I can watch over and over again that I’ve loved since I was a little girl. All About Eve probably preceded all of those movies. I definitely saw that first. That started my love affair with Bette Davis. It kind of introduced me to what an actress was. Bette Davis was my first introduction to what an actress was, like a real actress, you know? And I subsequently saw all of her movies. I was obsessed with her when I was a little girl. That ballsy, confident, beautiful but flawed woman. She’s strong, but vulnerable. I felt like the characters she played, the later ones, have all of that, and that, to me, is like, “Oh that’s acting.” Even though it’s probably a lot broader than what we do now, and it’s obviously a different style. To me, Bette Davis was like, “Oh wow, that’s an actress, I get it.”And there’s so much truth in that movie, it’s a little scary.Oh my God, completely, completely. And it’s a brilliant script. And again, incredible dialogue. Just full of the most iconic lines. All of these movies… rarely do we have movies these days where you can quote, like… I’m not talking about “I’ll be back” and “Show me the money,” know what I mean [laughing]? I’m talking about really intelligent, quick-witted one-liners. And these movies have, like, 30 of them in every movie.Right; they don’t make movies like that now.They probably couldn’t. It probably would be weird and outdated. It would be strange. I mean, you probably couldn’t anymore, but it’s ok because we can just go watch those.True, and hope that people stop remaking everything.Exactly, exactly.Not sure if you realized, but four out of five of your picks here have an entertainment theme.Oh, that’s true, I didn’t. [Laughing] I didn’t, because I’m a moron, but you’re absolutely right.No, you’re not a moron, remember? Because you like Annie Hall.[Laughing] Because I like Annie Hall, exactly. Thank you.You were obviously drawn to these sorts of films when you were a little girl and now, here you are, doing so well in your career.For sure, for sure. Yeah, I definitely was attracted to things that had an entertainment theme to them, and musicals and things about Broadway and all of that kind of thing, I definitely was attracted to.Listen Up Philip is currently in theaters in limited release.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"america, Winter, Shudder, Series, Marvel, Walt, Pictures, 93rd, mission:, franchise, child's, miniseries, crime, technology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Elisabeth-Moss-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"elisabeth-moss-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508829586581","title":"Breaking Bad Star RJ Mitte’s Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Breaking Bad Star RJ Mitte's Five Favorite Filmsby Kerr Lordygan | March 2, 2016 |  Comments(Photo by Getty Images / Jesse Grant / Stringer)&nbsp;RJ Mitte&nbsp;rose to awareness as Walter White, Jr. in Breaking Bad. While Mitte’s own case of cerebral palsy is less severe than that of the character he played, he serves as spokesperson for several organizations devoted to helping people&nbsp;with disabilities — including actors and others in the media. He also keeps up with his acting career, as evidenced by his most recent film outing,&nbsp;Who’s Driving Doug.&nbsp;Mitte talked to us here at Rotten Tomatoes about five of his favorite movies — a choice selection of action and sci-fi. You can see if the films that excite him get you excited too:Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%All these stories piling together and crossing over — I think that is the simplicity of life — these five degrees of separation that divide us all. I think it was a great cast of people; it’s a good story. Films that I enjoy are films that tell stories and not necessarily on the bounds of believable, but in life, anything can happen. I like action films. I guess Pulp Fiction is fairly&nbsp;violent, but I’m an action film kind of guy. It depends on what I’m in the mood for when it comes down to it.The Crow (1994)  83%The first one with Brandon Lee. The whole set — it was a really cool set — I liked the whole vibe of it with the martial arts. I was a Brandon Lee fan, and that was a fairly bad-ass movie. That whole Hell’s Kitchen vibe in New York — that whole realm just has this cool mystifying vibe. It looked like it would be a fun set.Serenity (2005)  82%I watched Serenity before Firefly [the TV series it was based on]. In 2000, binge-viewing wasn’t something that we did; we didn’t have access to that. If you missed a TV series, you just missed it. Or you’d record it on your VHS, right? It was a chore. In 2002 I was more of a country boy; I was always outside. But I like the whole idea of Serenity, the whole world, that outer rim world that we imagine that one day we will be [part of]. I actually felt this wasn’t too far out of our limits. You look at that ship, and it’s a junky old beat up ship. You would think after a thousand&nbsp;years, we will have things like that — that will fly and that will do things like that. We do. We have shuttles and they don’t look too far off [from those]. [That world is] only going to get closer into our grasp.The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  95%I feel like at one point or another, this is everyone’s favorite movie. Danny Elfman is amazing. I’m a big fan of stop motion. I really have an admiration and appreciation for [it]. I think they do such an amazing job, and they take so long to make. It’s almost flawless. You can’t even tell that they’re fake toys. It looks like animation. I like the music; it was amazing. Danny Elfman always does it with his scores, and Tim Burton is really rad. It’s done so well for the time. That’s a movie that will come around every so often that will just hang in the air and will never — no matter how good the graphics get, or how good your TV gets — at the end of the day, it&nbsp;will never folly. There are some things you’ll put on and go “It looked like that?” But when you watch Nightmare Before Christmas, you know it never gets bad or old. The music is always amazing, and they worked really hard. And that rings through. Stop motion is so great.Training Day (2001)  73%The vibe of it —&nbsp;I always felt like this was an all-around bad-ass cop movie. I could try to go into detail about certain things about it that stood out to me, about how it all takes place in one day and how he sets him up throughout the whole day. It was done right. It was one of those movies that was just set up right.&nbsp;Who’s Driving Doug&nbsp;is now showing in limited release and on premiere Video-on-Demand.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Mindy, AMC, binge, Now, Marvel, sitcom, Larson, BAFTA, Schmidt, Us, female, crime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/29142702/mitte-rep.jpg","slug":"breaking-bads-star-rj-mittes-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508837171413","title":"Joan Rivers’ Five Favorite Films","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Joan Rivers' Five Favorite FilmsThe veteran comedian reveals why she's unable to speak in front of Joan Collins.by RT Staff | September 5, 2014 |  CommentsThere’s nobody quite like Joan Rivers. She began her career in show business during the 1950s, paying her dues on the comedy circuits of the ’60s until she landed a breakthrough appearance on The Tonight Show. From there, Rivers went on to host a couple of her own talk shows, appear on popular TV sitcoms, record Grammy-nominated comedy albums, write best-selling books, establish a line of jewelry, and work on some film roles to boot. Despite her now divisive yet ubiquitous presence at high profile industry red carpet events, she is an entertainer through and through who has managed to remain successful despite personal tragedies and a few career missteps. This year, Rivers became the subject of a poignant documenatry, Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work (Certified Fresh at 91%), which chronicles a year in the life of the veteran comedian and reflects on her lengthy career in Hollywood. She was kind enough to take time out of her busy schedule to provide us with her Five Favorite Films, and they are anything but ordinary. Read on for the full list.Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work (2010,91% Tomatometer)This is by far the best documentary I’ve ever seen about a sensitive, beautiful and sexual artiste! It delves deeply into the age-old mystery of why, for some reason, everyone who meets her, hates her. They are so wrong! Go see Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work for yourself, and send me a present.Empire of the Ants (1977,0% Tomatometer)Two words: Joan Collins. There’s nothing sexier than a young Joan Collins being dragged by giant ants into an underground cave to toil as their slave. I’ve never able to ask her about her performance because I’m in awe. When I meet her I start, but I get as far as “Empire of the…” and then I’m simply in awe.Can’t Stop the Music (1980,8% Tomatometer)I love musicals, and so one that features the Village People AND Bruce Jenner is my kind of movie. Bruce didn’t do much else, but where can you go from there? It’s like the guy who wrote the Bible, where are you going to go? Margaret Mitchell had the good taste to get hit by a car. She knew she could never top Gone with the Wind.The Bad Seed (1956,87% Tomatometer)I love an evil child murderess with perfect, bleached blond hair. It just appeals to me.Rabbit Test (1978,N/A)This is the only movie I ever directed and I’m proud to say that it finally got its first good review after 34 years! Otherwise, it wouldn’t have made this list.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"satire, Prime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Joan-Rivers-Five-Favorite-Films.jpg","slug":"joan-rivers-five-favorite-films"},{"id":"47508844238099","title":"Five Favorite Films with Anna Kendrick","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Anna KendrickThe Pitch Perfect star also chats about her new movie, her love of cinema, and understanding a cappella geekdom.by Ryan Fujitani | October 5, 2012 |  Comments(Photo by Jason LaVeris/Getty Images)Every once in a while, a few young actors and actresses emerge who help reassure us all that Hollywood is in good hands. Anna Kendrick, whose latest film Pitch Perfect expands into wide release this week, belongs on that short list. After securing a supporting role in the continuing pop culture phenomenon that is The Twilight Saga, Kendrick went on to nab an Oscar nomination for her superb work alongside George Clooney and Vera Farmiga in Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air. That breakout performance led to roles in widely praised films like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and 50/50, and while she currently appears in three movies out in theaters, she has yet another — Robert Redford’s The Company You Keep — set to open in November. In other words, she’s doing pretty well for herself.Last week, RT chatted with Anna about Pitch Perfect, in which she plays an aspiring electronic music producer who joins her college’s all female a cappella group and helps turn the team into a winner. But first, of course, she gave us her Five Favorite Films, and being that she’s a huge movie fan, we think you’ll enjoy the variety in her choices.The Women (1939)  94%This has been my favorite film since I was twelve years old. I’m pretty sure I could recite it in its entirety. It has a wildly funny all female cast and a female writer. I revisit it almost every year and my appreciation for the performances and the writing grows.Hot Fuzz (2007)  91%When I first saw this in the theater I remember laughing my ass off and then realizing it was also the best action movie I’d seen in a long time. I love that it’s a love letter to action and not a spoof. It also has some of the best and fastest comedic dialogue ever.Wet Hot American Summer (2001)  38%The first time I watched this movie was with a group of friends who are obsessed with it. I asked to watch it again the following three nights. It’s absurd, it has the most amazing cast, and it’s infinitely quotable. It’s a perfect desert island movie.Nattvardsgästerna (Winter Light) (1962)  73%I love all the Bergman films I’ve seen, but this spoke to me personally in a really profound way. I remember feeling very shaken after watching it. I feel like the greatest thing a writer or filmmaker can do is say something so honest that most people wouldn’t be brave enough and that’s what I love about this film. The characters are deeply flawed and sometimes very ugly to each other, but that’s why it’s so effective.Love and Death (1975)  100%I know this is not the best Woody Allen film I’ve ever seen, but it’s still my personal favorite. Only Woody Allen could mix highbrow Bergman homages and Marx Brothers-esque slapstick. I also love how much fun he seems to be having with the great Diane Keaton. If only there were a blooper reel.Ryan Fujitani for Rotten Tomatoes: Let’s talk about Pitch Perfect. You’re obviously a big movie lover, which is interesting because your character here, Beca, is kind of a movie Grinch. Skylar Astin’s character Jesse wants to score films, and he tries to share some of his favorites with Beca, and your reaction to it is “Meh.” But you’re not like that at all…Anna Kendrick: No, it was a funny thing where I almost thought, “This person isn’t real. A person who doesn’t like movies doesn’t actually exist in the world.” But then there have been people on Twitter who are like, “Oh, I don’t really like movies, but I’m going to check out your new movie!” I’m just like, “Where did you come from?” It’s like saying you don’t like music. It’s baffling!RT: When did your love for the movies start?Kendrick: When I was twelve, my dad started showing me some classic movies. So I had a basic education of classics from the ’30s to the ’60s, I guess. Not a ton of them, but that era of filmmaking — it’s kind of wide, but that feels really cozy to me. That feels like home base. And I know that, for most people, if they had to pick an era, it would be the ’70s, but for me, all the visual language of the ’40s feels like home to me.RT:&nbsp;In Pitch Perfect, one of the movies that plays a particularly key role is John Hughes’s The Breakfast Club.Kendrick: Yeah, I saw that movie a little late. I saw it probably when I was 18 or something. It was one of those movies where I felt like such an idiot because I had obviously heard about it for years and years. And then you see it and you’re like, “This is great!” and you feel like you’ve discovered something because it’s so great and you want to tell your friends about it, and they’re like, “Yeah, we know, idiot. We’ve been telling you to see it forever.” That same kind of thing happened with Terms of Endearment, and it’s like, “Oh right, there’s a reason that The Breakfast Club and Terms of Endearment are some of the most popular movies of all time.”RT:&nbsp;Which of the kids in The Breakfast Club do you think you most identify with?Kendrick: I suppose Ally Sheedy. I was kind of just a drama nerd. That was my world when I was in high school. I would like eat lunch in the auditorium and hang out with all those kids all the time.RT:&nbsp;You knew pretty early on that you wanted to act…Kendrick: Yeah, I started doing theater at around six, and my parents exposed me to a lot of different stuff, like soccer and rock climbing and academic stuff. Performing was just the thing I came back to again and again. Who knows what was going on in my psychology at that age, but that’s what I enjoyed.RT:&nbsp;Right, and a lot of people might not know this, but you performed on Broadway at a young age and even got a Tony nomination for it, so the stage has been a part of your life for a long time. With that background in mind, do you sort of jump at opportunities like Pitch Perfect where you can showcase your singing ability?Kendrick: You know, with this one, it felt more like just being able to sing is a nice trick to have up my sleeve. It’s a nice thing to have on my resume, as it were. But for me, the thing that I loved about this script was everything surrounding the singing. I think it could have been a cappella, it could have been chess club, it could have been math club. You know, I think it’s about the way that, even within a really geeky subculture, there are gods, there are rock stars, and I think that’s the case with everything. I thought a lot about King of Kong when I was reading this script. So to me, it actually had nothing to do with music in this particular case. If anything, I just knew that was going to make the filmmaking process harder. I was just really drawn to Kay Cannon’s writing and her voice; I think 30 Rock is the best show ever made, and I was just excited about this script.RT:&nbsp;Based on your experience, is it more difficult to rehearse for a stage production and then do it live in one shot, or is it more difficult to capture that same live theater energy when you’re shooting a film about stage performance?Kendrick: I think the latter. I insisted that any time I sing alone in the movie that I got to do it live, because I just think that you, as an audience member, can feel when it switches over to a pre-recording. I understand that, obviously, with the nature of some of the musical numbers, you just have to pre-record it, but as far as when I’m singing on my own, it’s not too complicated and I trust myself to be able to show up and do my best, better than I could in a recording studio, really. So every time I open my mouth when I’m on my own in the movie, I’m singing on set.RT:&nbsp;Here, you’re also surrounded by a lot of other talented people as well. Did you guys form bonds specific to your individual groups?Kendrick: Well, I think we all bonded. You know, the girls, seven out of ten of us came from just an acting background, and even though we all came to the table with some level of singing ability, we didn’t come from this world, and I think eight out of the ten guys came from this world, so we were just so impressed with them. Only three of our girls had experience in the a cappella world, but a lot of the guys were from the collegiate a cappella world. I tried to hang out with those kids as much as possible to try and have it rub off on me. They had so many ringers in their group, and their energy and their work ethic was really infectious.RT:&nbsp;And how familiar were you with that world before the movie?Kendrick: When I was 18 — that’s when I first moved to LA — a friend of mine had a crush on a guy in an a cappella group, so I got dragged to this competition between UCLA and USC, and they had a bitter rivalry. I thought it was going to be the most excruciating night of my life, but by the end of it, I’m like on my feet and I want to meet them, I think they’re the coolest, and I’m like starstruck by them. And once again, that was something I was thinking about when I read the script, which is like, that’s absolutely true the way that these kids shouldn’t be cool, and outside of their little world they’re not cool, but within it, the stakes couldn’t be higher.RT:&nbsp;There’s a relatively wide variety of music used in Pitch Perfect, and your character is a budding electronic mashup artist. How closely did the music in the movie match up with your tastes? Like, with your background, are you a showtunes girl or…Kendrick: I’m kind of an everything girl. I feel like, you know, in the grand scheme of things, my musical tastes are probably pretty pedestrian. I’m not going to pretend I’m like all up on the music scene. But there’s obviously a lot of pop music in this movie and I think it works and it gets the job done.One of the moments I really love is… Any time I get to embarrass this character, because she thinks she’s so cool, which she’s not — she’s an 18-year-old girl who’s mad at her dad, you know; she’s not a cool girl and she has no right to think that she’s above these other more obviously dorky girls — and so I love that she has like a shameful, secret Miley Cyrus love. That moment was really, really funny to me and said a lot about her character. You know, I think Beca sees herself as sort of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and I think it was really fun for me to break her down. I think that’s when the audience gets on her side, is when they realize she’s not actually “too cool for school.” She’s secretly weird just like everybody else.RT:&nbsp;That’s actually when I knew the movie had gotten to me, was when I found myself swaying in my seat to Party in the USA, of all things. But this is a good example of the movie blending its musical strengths with comedy, and Pitch Perfect has a lot of funny moments, thanks to a really great cast with surprisingly good chemistry. A lot of people are talking about Rebel Wilson, who’s fantastic, but Hana Mae Lee, who plays Lilly, also had some hilarious one-liners, for example.Kendrick: Yeah, obviously Rebel is like the MVP of the movie, no question, but we’ve got amazing people scattered throughout. Hana Mae Lee in real life is the funniest person, has the sweetest personality, and then when she goes into this Lilly character, it’s like her whole face changes, you know what I mean? It’s not just how she delivers her lines; it’s like, I see a change in her, physically, the second that she’s Lilly from when she’s Hana.RT:&nbsp;Here, you sort of anchor the movie as the “straight man,” so to speak, but you’ve always displayed impeccable comic timing throughout your career. When you got into acting, did you see yourself fitting so well into comedic roles?Kendrick: It’s hard to say. You know, I started so young. It’s interesting because I think… Like, Katherine in 50/50 ended up getting a lot of laughs, but she isn’t a funny character. So I guess I didn’t think about it as one way or the other, like the fact that Beca’s a straight man. I played her the same way that I played Katherine; it’s just that one of them turned out to be really funny. Does that make sense? It’s like one of them came out funny because she didn’t know she was funny. So it’s not like I’m hitting for big laughs, yeah.RT:&nbsp;Do you have a preference between doing more dramatic roles and funnier ones?Kendrick: I guess I’m drawn to… I think, even when I read serious scripts, the moments that I connect to are the little glimpses of humor, because, you know, I think every script, no matter how serious it is, has bits of humor in it. Even End of Watch is really funny. So those are the moments where I can kind of see what I can do with it that’s different, and I feel like that’s the easiest way for me to get inside a character’s head, is through the humor, like what sense of humor they have.RT:&nbsp;In the 2003 movie Camp, which was also a musical, the character you play makes another character vomit on stage, and then it happens here in Pitch Perfect, too. So this must happen all the time during stage performances, right?Kendrick: Oh my god, I hadn’t put that together; that’s so interesting. Well, a lot of people in choir pass out. That happens a lot. I bet if you YouTube that, there will be a veritable cornucopia of kids passing out, because you stand with your knees locked, and you’re nervous, and you’re using your diaphragm. I’m sure there are a couple vomit videos out there, but I’ll bet you there are a lot of passing-out videos. When I grew up doing choir, I felt like once every performance, some girl or some guy went down. But it’s never happened to me, thankfully.Pitch Perfect expands nationwide this week, but you can also catch Anna in Paranorman and End of Watch, both Certified Fresh and in theaters now.","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"stoner, the, monster, Vudu, Emmys, CW, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/19174607/Anna-Kendrick-2012-FFF1.jpg","slug":"five-favorite-films-with-anna-kendrick"},{"id":"47508854445420","title":"Five Favorite Films with Sofia Coppola","content":"Five Favorite Filmsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Favorite Films with Sofia CoppolaPlus, the Oscar-winning writer-director chats about her latest film, Somewhere.by Luke Goodsell | December 27, 2010 |  Comments“I never expected to win a prize for anything for my films,” says writer-director Sofia Coppola, who won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2004 for Lost in Translation and whose latest, Somewhere, recently took home the Best Picture prize at the Venice Film Festival. When RT caught up with her recently, the quiet, modestly spoken Coppola seemed humbled by the attention, preferring to talk about vintage camera lenses and sound-mixing Ferrari engines rather than the Awards-season circus.Indeed, the image that opens Somewhere — Stephen Dorff’s Hollywood drifter doing laps in his Ferrari in the desert — was the impetus for the film. “I imagine these guys with sports car collections, they have to bring it to some track outside the city to have to be able to drive them,” says Coppola, “so I imagined him in the middle of nowhere, kind of going around in circles, to introduce the state he’s in. I started with him and the Ferrari, and then I thought about the Chateau Marmont and the stories of people I knew, or things I’ve heard, around there, and sort of put them all together.”“I pictured Stephen early on, just as kind of this lost, bad boy LA actor,” the director continues. “I just felt like he was the right guy for the part; I’d met him and I knew him over the years and I always thought he was a good actor.” It’s a subtle, affecting performance from Dorff, whose character — a bored actor adrift in the purgatory of his own fame — comprises a lot of wordless, long takes. “Stephen’s so sweet that I felt like that would help make you care about watching the character,” says Coppola. “He’s so flawed that you could easily not be interested, but I felt that he’s got so much heart that he could connect people to it.”Curiously, Coppola shot the film using old Zeiss lenses once used by her father, Francis. It’s perhaps ironic that Coppola senior is now once of digital’s biggest advocates, and at one point had even wondered why his daughter would want to film on archaic stock. “I think he appreciates it now,” she laughs, “but I remember he and George Lucas a while back saying, ‘Oh, you have to start shooting on digital — why are you using film?'”Well, that explains the first of her five favorite films…Rumble Fish (1983, 70% Tomatometer)I love that it’s an art film about teenagers. I just love the way that it’s shot — I love those old lenses, those Zeiss lenses; they have a softer feel. [Coppola and her DP, Harris Savvides, used the lenses from Rumble Fish to shoot Somewhere.] Roman [Coppola, her brother] and I are just sentimental about film.Breathless (1960, 96% Tomatometer)The Godard version. [On the similarities between the moving car jump cuts in Somewhere:] I guess I was going through that whole New Wave thing… coming from a documentary background.Sixteen Candles (1984,87% Tomatometer)That was one of my favorite films when I was growing up, and I’ll still watch it every time it’s on.Lolita (1962,97% Tomatometer)I love Kubrick.

One might also be surprised to discover that, after some acting and a solo singing career, Wiedlin reunited with her bandmates to tour, at age 42, once again as the Go-Go’s. This month, the band kicked off their “Happily Ever After Farewell Tour,” and Wiedlin released the first issue of Lady Robotika, a comic book starring herself as an alien-abducted rocker who is turned into a cyborg and forced to perform music. Sound intriguing? We thought so, and decided to chat with Wiedlin about her favorite movies and what it was like working on the comic. Read on for the full interview!Blade Runner (1982,94% Tomatometer)#1 for sure is Blade Runner. I’ve been a big sci-fi geek since I was a little kid, and it was just done so well. It felt like that’s what Los Angeles was going to look like in the future, and you felt Harrison Ford’s turmoil as a blade runner. Everything about it was so real, and so cool, and everyone that was cast in it was so good in their roles, and so attractive. Even though the future looked spooky, it was also mesmerizing. Sean Young… Who knew she was so crazy? She was so great in that movie. And then when she finds out she’s a replicant, it’s so heartbreaking. I could watch that movie a hundred times and I don’t even care which version I see; I’m fine with the narration, I’m fine without the narration. It’s just a great movie. When you’ve seen it so many times, I guess it doesn’t matter. Like, it’s impossible for me to go back in time and see it for the first time without narration and see if it would have made it confusing or not, which, I guess, was the studio’s worry, that people wouldn’t be able to follow the storyline. But, you know, I’ll never know. [laughs] All I know is it’s the best science fiction movie ever made.Showgirls (1995,13% Tomatometer)#2 is Showgirls. Again, a movie I’ve seen at least a dozen times, and I know that everybody gets it now, but I was a true believer right from the beginning. It is, really, the accidentally funniest movie I’ve ever seen. It never gets any less funny. There’s just something about watching Elizabeth Berkeley in that role, when she’s like flopping in the water like a fish, or when she’s in that club, and Cristal Connors pays her $500 to give Zack a lapdance, and she’s all flapping around on his lap. It’s so cringeworthy, but it’s so funny at the same time. And I’m normally not really a fan of cringey humor — shows like Curb Your Enthusiasm — I can’t even watch those shows because I end up running behind the couch, I’m cringing so bad. The thing about Showgirls, and how earnest everybody was, and how over-the-top it was — I just love that movie. I practically have it memorized.Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes Back (1980,99% Tomatometer)I think #3 would be The Empire Strikes Back. To me, clearly the best of the six, like way, way ahead of the field — the six Star Wars movies, not my list — and here we go, Harrison Ford again. Harrison Ford was like my generation’s greatest leading man. He’s going to be our Clark Gable or whatever. He was so good. That movie just had plenty of story and action, and my problem with a lot of sci-fi is that it’s all action and not enough story, not enough character development, and not enough relationships between the characters. It’s all shoot-em-up, which is good; I think guys like that. But I like my shoot-em-ups with relationships and character development and lots of story. And, you know, lots of snappy lines done really well by the actors. Another thing is, it’s the last Star Wars movie before the cute came in. And once they brought the cute, it was like “Ugh! It’s too cute!” They should have made six movies for adults and six movies for kids, and then everybody could have been happy. I’m going to get death threats now, for criticizing… I kid because I love! [laughs]Star Trek IV – The Voyage Home (1986,83% Tomatometer)The next one would be Star Trek IV, because it was the best Star Trek, and because I was in it. [laughs] Does it count as a plug if it was made a million years ago? I mean, it was the best Star Trek, so there you go. And it was about saving whales, which I would agree with, and it was the first time that they really let the characters get kind of funny and more relaxed, and I think that was a really good direction for them to go.Galaxy Quest (1999,89% Tomatometer)#5, I’ll put Galaxy Quest. I know Galaxy Quest is not a great movie, but I love that movie, and I’ve seen it over and over and over, and I still love it just as much. I think Tim Allen portraying a Kirk-like character is so damn funny. I think that’s one of the best “fan” films ever made. And the fake Spock guy was great, yeah. That movie’s really funny. We saw it when it first came out — my family has a tradition of always going to a movie on Christmas afternoon, and we went and saw that one. It was such a great family moment, too. It brings back good memories.Next, Wiedlin talks more about her love of sci-fi and what it’s like to work on a comic book.RT: So let’s talk about Lady Robotika. What inspired you to create a comic book? It seems like a new direction for you.Jane Wiedlin: It is a really new direction, because I didn’t read comic books as a kid. But I’ve been going to conventions for years now, mostly to sign autographs as a celebrity, and then sometimes as a fan, just because I’m a sci-fi geek. But I kind of ignored the whole comic book thing, and it’s pretty overwhelming at a convention anyway. I mean, I’ve seen literally millions of comics there, and you’re like, “Well, where do we begin?” But as a kid, I wasn’t a huge fan because I read really fast, and the comic books would just end for me before they started, so I didn’t find them satisfying. When I met my writing partner Bill Morrison at Super-Con two years ago, we became really good friends really quickly, and he suggested doing a project together. And, you know, he’s Mr. Comic so it was his idea to do a comic, and I was really intrigued by the idea. When he suggested making me the star of the comic, then I really wanted to do it, because I’d finally get my big chance to be a superhero. So that was how it all came together. We’ve been kind of working on it for three years, and I’m completely amazed that we actually got it to come out. When the box of comics came to my house last week and I looked at one, I started crying, because I was like, “Alright, it’s hard for me to believe this is real.” [laughs] It’s been such a long time coming.Is it a similar feeling to, say, having your first album come out, or your first major movie?Let me think… Yeah, of course it’s a similar excitement. I think when I first started making records, I was so young that I just had this sort of naïve confidence, and now that I’m older, I have no confidence that anything’s ever going to work. So just the fact that we got it to happen was almost more thrilling, because we followed through and made it happen. I can’t control anything that happens besides that, but at least I got that damn comic book out in the real world. It feels like a huge accomplishment.What are some of the influences on the comic? I see a certain amount of ’50s, “Keep Watching the Skies!” sci-fi in there.Yeah, definitely. I think because Bill and I are the same age, a lot of our influences were exactly the same. And in fact, we didn’t really talk about it that much; it just came out of us really naturally when we were co-writing. Both of us love flying saucers and aliens and robots, and both of us collect all that stuff. We had so much in common that it was only natural that the book would be full of those kinds of images. Some of the things we did discuss and put into the comic were that we wanted it to be sassy and sexy, but sexy in a way that was a little bit more subtle than, you know, in-your-face giant boobs and orgy scenes or something. So it is more of a playful sexiness while still being, I would say, relatively safe for kids. [laughs] And I say “relatively safe” because I don’t have kids, and I’m not really sure, but I think it’s fine, and judging from the people that kids love now anyway, like pop stars and stuff, it seems like this is so innocent compared to all that nonsense.It’s a monthly comic, right?Yeah. Wow, that’s killing us, actually. You have no idea how hard it is to get a comic book done in a month. For me, I can’t draw at all; I can only write. So I’m sitting here twiddling my thumbs, trying to get people across the country to draw, because Bill doesn’t have time to draw it all himself, so we’ve had to hire outside artists. And they’re really great, and I can’t even get mad at them, because they’ll send a page and it’ll be beautiful, but I’ll be like, “Okay, I really need the rest of it.” “Okay, any minute!” And then two weeks later, “Please, I’m begging you! Please send me that artwork!” It’s so stressful. I had no idea about all that going into it, or I might have thought twice about it. Or maybe I would have made it more like The Simpsons, where it’s like really simple drawing, instead of these really elaborate things, where each panel is like a piece of art.Obviously there’s a lot of you in Lady Robotika. Does this mean we may get to see some Lady Robotika performances in the future?Oh, yeah, definitely. Are you in LA? Monday night, I’m going to be performing at Meltdown Comics; we’re doing a signing there. But yeah, I put together a band of friends that are fun and cute, and we’re going to do a short set and I’m going to be sitting down, because, to be honest, I was supposed to be on a Go-Go’s tour right now, but I had a hiking accident, and I’m kind of laid up. So the show isn’t going to be my usual jumping-around, going-crazy kind of show; it’s going to be just a few songs with me sitting on a stool. But it should still be fun, and hopefully in the future we’re going to do a lot more shows, because I do have a whole album of Lady Robotika-inspired songs written.Be on the lookout for Issue #1 of Jane Wiedlin’s Lady Robotika, which should currently be lining the shelves of your nearest comic shop.Also, as an added treat, if you’re in Los Angeles, be sure to drop by Meltdown Comics in Hollywood on Monday, July 26th, to see Jane perform live at the official release party!","section":"Five Favorite Films","tags":"Awards, italian, Black, in, and, The, Sematary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Five-Favorite-Films-with-Jane-Wiedlin-of-the-GoGos"},{"id":"47508881631847","title":"The Killing Joke Premieres, Four Almodóvar Films Go Digital, and More Movies Streaming This Week","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Killing Joke Premieres, Four Almodóvar Films Go Digital, and More Movies Streaming This Weekby RT Staff | July 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on streaming video, we’ve got a highly anticipated Batman animated film, four selections from the filmography of celebrated Spanish director&nbsp;Pedro Almodóvar and a couple of small recent films available to purchase.

Basically, all you need to know about this movie is that Lawrence’s character complains that she was sent to “whore school” for her training. This is extremely graphic, violent material.But there are other movies about spies that are far more appropriate for you to watch with your family. Here are a few suggestions:THE RECOMMENDATIONSSpy Kids (2001)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action sequences and brief language.The first Spy Kids was good. Then it was all downhill from there. The fact that Robert Rodriguez was applying his indie sensibilities to a colorful and lively family flick after making his name with the low-budget shoot-‘em-up El Mariachi&nbsp;was exciting, and the movie itself has an enjoyable, goofy energy about it. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino star as married secret agents. When they disappear, it’s up to their son and daughter (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) to rescue them. There’s some potty humor and some bizarre creatures. The kids find themselves in danger, but it’s always depicted in a humorous way. If you’re going to watch any of the Spy Kids movies, this is the one to choose. The (many) sequels felt strained and not nearly as inspired. Fine for viewers around 7 and older.Agent Cody Banks (2003)  38%Rating: PG, for action violence, mild language and some sensual content.I’m not saying it’s a great piece of cinema. But this kid version of James Bond will likely entertain the kids in your own house. And it features two likable young stars in Frankie Muniz and Hilary Duff, who successfully made the tricky transition from child actor to grown-up performer. Muniz stars in the title role as a seemingly ordinary 15-year-old who lives a secret life as a spy, having trained at CIA summer camp. When he has to befriend a scientist’s daughter (Duff) as part of his first assignment, he realizes he has no idea how to talk to girls. But then when she gets kidnapped, he has to do more than just talk to her – he has to rescue her. The action set pieces, which include fights, chases and explosions, are big and cartoonish. The villains also are over the top. There’s a bit of language and suggestive humor. But overall, I’d say this is fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Dr. No (1962)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PGIt’s a classic, of course: The first James Bond movie, which introduced Sean Connery in the iconic role and featured some of the most enduring imagery of the long-running series. Agent 007 must travel to Jamaica to discover what happened to a missing colleague; what he stumbles upon is the evil Dr. No and a plot to interfere with American rocket launches. It’s pure escapism, filled with lavish settings, elaborate action sequences and beautiful women. But while Dr. No seems tame compared to movies of this genre being made today – especially the modern, Daniel Craig Bond films — it’s definitely not for very young kids. Bond famously has a license to kill, and he infamously has a way with the ladies. A lot is suggested without being shown on camera, but still – watching this movie may result in some conversations you’re not ready to have yet. But if you have kids in your house who love action movies and are interested in learning about the films that influence what they watch today, Dr. No is fine for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sundance, Music, dceu, bad, Games, critics, Britbox, First, Fox, Month, nature, Spike, black, scorecard, FirstLook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/02123633/Spy-Kids-PG.jpg","slug":"three-spy-movies-you-can-watch-with-your-family-instead-of-red-sparrow"},{"id":"47508897498894","title":"Digital Multiplex: Wreck-It Ralph, Manhunter, Big Fish, and More","content":"Now Streamingvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Digital Multiplex: Wreck-It Ralph, Manhunter, Big Fish, and Moreby RT Staff | March 8, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend in streaming, there’s a wide variety to pick from, including something for the little ones (Oscar-nominated Wreck-It Ralph), something for the teens (Big Fish), something for the action junkie (Luc Besson’s La Femme Nikita), something thrilling (Manhunter), something for 80s nostalgia (Pretty in Pink), and more.

But&nbsp;if you’ve got older kids, and you’re really looking to see the movie yourself, here’s what you should know about it.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Logan Lucky (2017)  92%Rating: PG-13, for language and some crude comments.Steven Soderbergh is back, four years after saying he was retiring from filmmaking, with another heist movie – but this one’s more down-home and low-key than the splashy Ocean’s&nbsp;trilogy. Channing Tatum, Adam Driver, and Riley Keough play siblings who scheme to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina during a major NASCAR race. Along the way they have to stage a prison break – in and out, then back in again – steal various cars, avoid the authorities, and still be done in time for Tatum’s character to attend a beauty pageant where his young daughter is competing. There’s language scattered throughout, a bit of violence during a bar brawl, some explosions, and general destruction in order to pull off the scheme. Plus, you know, these are criminals – but they’re quick-witted, clever criminals. The subject matter, the pacing, and the length of the film (a minute shy of two hours) will probably make this a tough sit for anyone younger than about 11 or 12 and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Television, screen, PaleyFest, jamie, venice, Poppins, The, Emmys, history, 2020, Horse, franchise, Emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/18102203/Logan-Lucky-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-logan-lucky"},{"id":"47508909034366","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Secret Life of Pets?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Secret Life of Pets?by Christy Lemire | July 8, 2016 |  CommentsJust because a film is animated, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s completely suitable for all ages. This week, Christy offers the lowdown on Illumination’s The Secret Life of Pets, which is probably fine for everyone. Read on for the details on that one, as well as an Oscar-nominated animation from Brazil on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for action and some rude humor.What do your pets do all day while you’re away? That’s the premise of this animated comedy from the folks who brought you the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and Minions.&nbsp;It’s essentially the same idea behind Toy Story, but without the emotional complexity; Pets&nbsp;is basically about friendship, and it’s more interested in lively, colorful antics. Max (voiced by Louis C.K.), a loyal Jack Russell terrier enjoying a comfy life with his owner, Katie (Ellie Kemper), ends up with an unwelcome roommate when Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray from the pound named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Max and Duke become separated from their dog-walking group at the park and go on an adventure through the streets, alleys and sewers of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Along the way, they’re pursued by mean dogcatchers (who are slapsticky and silly) and they reluctantly team up with an underground group of wild animals led by a diabolical bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart). Max and Duke are frequently in danger and nearly drown at one point, and there are a few references to death of both the animal and human kind. There are the obligatory bits about butt-sniffing and nervous peeing. And a perky Pomeranian named Gidget (Jenny Slate) unleashes martial-arts fury on a bunch of creatures to protect her beloved Max, but it’s played for laughs. This movie is high-energy and harmless and, for the most part, fine for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Boy and the World (O Menino e o Mundo) (2015)  93%Rating: PG, for thematic material and images.Viewers of all ages will be fine watching this beautiful, strange and wondrous animated film from Brazilian writer-director Ale Abreu. It tells the story of a boy who dares to wander from his country home to the big city in search of his father, who has traveled there seeking work. As he ventures farther from his family’s farm and closer to the teeming metropolitan center, the boy encounters overworked field hands, cramped favelas, miserable commuters and the general destruction industrialization can cause. As a cautionary tale, Boy and the World&nbsp;isn’t saying much that’s new (and isn’t saying it in a way that’s terribly subtle). But as an artistic exercise, the film is dazzling, full of vibrant hues and rich textures. It looks like a slightly more sophisticated version of children’s color-pencil drawings come to life, and its aesthetic is constantly evolving and surprising. I watched the film with my 6-year-old son, who asked lots of questions because there’s no dialogue and many of the characters essentially look the same. But he also loved the film’s colorful, playful vibe and the infectious, samba-infused score.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Adventures, NBC, SDCC, Seed, Interview, Golden, Cartoon, park, Competition, Year, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/08111404/Secret-Life-of-Pets.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-secret-life-of-pets"},{"id":"47508907592559","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and Keeping Up with the Joneses?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Ouija: Origin of Evil, and Keeping Up with the Joneses?by Christy Lemire | October 21, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the big wide releases this week are rated PG-13, but they include an action-packed shoot-em-up, a creepy horror flick, and a ridiculous comedy, so the rating may be deceptive.&nbsp;Read on to see how family-friendly they are.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)  38%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence and action, some bloody images, language and thematic elements.The sequel to 2012’s Jack Reacher finds Tom Cruise pummeling more bad guys – and running, always running — even as his character is suspected of being a bad guy himself. This time, he teams up with Cobie Smulders, who plays an old friend accused of espionage. Brutal fight sequences, thrilling action set pieces and considerable carnage ensue. Characters get shot and beaten to death in director Edward Zwick’s film, which is once again based on a Lee Child novel. But because this is PG-13 violence, there isn’t exactly a realistic amount of bloodshed. There’s also some language scattered throughout, the suggestion of drugs and a grown-up subplot about whether Reacher has a daughter he never knew. This is probably OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)  82%Rating: PG-13, for disturbing images, terror and thematic elements.Good lord, is this movie scary. It’s also a total blast. But it’s got some supremely creepy imagery that will freak you out no matter how old you are. In this prequel to the 2014 horror movie Ouija, set in 1967, Elizabeth Reaser stars as a widowed fortuneteller living in Los Angeles and raising her two daughters (Annalise Basso and Lulu Wilson). One day, she brings home a hot new board game called Ouija to spice up her activities with her clients. Soon, strange things start happening involving the younger daughter, Wilson’s Doris, who has connected with restless spirits who inhabited the family’s house decades earlier. The little girl says and does startling things and her wholesome appearance changes in disturbing ways as the evil builds within her. We also see the actual demon that takes over her body, and there are several terrifying deaths. But director and co-writer Mike Flanagan has made a beautifully crafted horror film, filled with atmosphere and authentic period detail. If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll dig it. Just don’t bring the kids unless they’re teenagers.Keeping Up With The Joneses (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, action/violence and brief strong language.Tame suburbanites Jeff and Karen (Zach Galifianakis and Isla Fisher) think they’re happy enjoying the mundane security of their cozy cul-de-sac – until exotic and exciting new neighbors Tim and Natalie (Jon Hamm and Gal Gadot) move in across the street and shake things up. Turns out, they’re spies! Madcap hilarity ensues. Director Greg Mottola (Superbad, Adventureland) has given us a rather conventional fish-out-of-water action comedy, as Jeff and Karen bumble their way through dangerous scenarios and Tim and Natalie struggle to maintain their cover. Expect massive car chases, shootouts and explosions. There’s also a scene in which the husbands get drunk on snake wine; meanwhile, the wives try on lingerie together at the department store. And we see both couples getting a little frisky. This is suitable for kids around 13 and older – but it’s not very good.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and destruction, and for some language.Kids around 10 and older probably will be fine watching this sequel to the 1996 smash-hit blockbuster Independence Day. But my own son, who was 6 ½ when I brought him to a screening, slept through about half the movie. Lucky him. This time, the aliens are back, and they want… more of the same thing they wanted before, maybe? Not that it matters, because it’s all about the spectacle. It’s big, shiny, and noisy in the over-the-top tradition of Roland Emmerich, but without the kind of visceral thrills you usually get with the director’s outlandish action extravaganzas. Twenty years after the original film’s alien battle, humans have learned to use their technology for everything from space exploration to getting across town more efficiently. But just as America is about to celebrate the anniversary of that victory, the aliens return — in a spaceship that’s 3,000 miles wide, no less — to lock onto our planet and drill into its core for resources. Or something. Anyway, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, and Brent Spiner are back — Will Smith opted out, wisely — fighting alongside newcomers Liam Neeson, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, William Fichtner and (in the strangest bit of casting of all) Charlotte Gainsbourg. There’s massive urban destruction, ostensibly resulting in massive death, little of which we actually see. The aliens are big, gooey, and relentless in typical alien fashion. Children are in peril — a school bus full of them, for good measure. There’s a bit of language. And there are lots of battles in which human and alien ships shoot green lasers at each other that go “Pew! Pew! Pew!”","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"2020, MSNBC, WarnerMedia, IFC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/21142044/Jack-Reacher.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-jack-reacher-never-go-back-ouija-origin-of-evil-and-keeping-up-with-the-joneses"},{"id":"47508914550719","title":"Parental Guidance: Insurgent, Penguins of Madagascar, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Insurgent, Penguins of Madagascar, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's movies.by Christy Lemire | March 20, 2015 |  CommentsInsurgent 28%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action throughout, some sensuality, thematic elements and brief language.The sequel to last year’s Divergent might be even more violent and intense than its predecessor. It’s also oppressively dour. But because the film carries a PG-13 rating — to make it accessible to the tweens and young teens who also were the target audience for the YA novel source material — there’s minimal bloodshed accompanying the massive gunfire. This time, the rebellious Tris (Shailene Woodley) and her boyfriend, Four (Theo James), are hiding out with some other folks, trying to figure out how best to take down the totalitarian dictator Jeanine (Kate Winslet). But Jeanine is after Tris, too, to put her through a series of simulations which will open a magical box that contains an important message, or something. This sometimes means Tris must endure harrowing imagery and fight dangerous battles. In real life, she and Four also have sex, but we don’t really see anything; the act is implied through kissing and naked backs. If your kids have seen the first film, they’re in for a lot of the same here.New On DVD:Penguins of Madagascar 73%Rating: PG, for mild action and some rude humor.The playful penguins who stole every scene in the Madagascar series have gotten a movie of their own. Part origin story and part spin-off, it explains how Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private became globetrotting super spies and it follows them on an all-new adventure. John Malkovich lends his rich voice to the shape-shifting bad guy they’re after: an angry octopus who’s pretending to be a mad scientist. He kidnaps penguins from zoos and aquariums around the world with plans to inject them with a serum that will turn them into hideous versions of themselves. He hopes they’ll seem less appealing to the masses, but they actually become more silly than frightening. The penguins end up in several dangerous situations but they always find a way to escape. There’s a lot of silly spanking among the animals as well as some fart jokes and flatulence puns, but it’s the kind of harmless, puerile humor that routinely cracks kids up. Nothing here is shocking or inappropriate. This is totally suitable for all ages, although a lot of the pop-culture gags are just for us grown-ups.Annie 28%Rating: PG, for some mild language and rude humor.This movie is terrible. But if it’s the only family-friendly film available for rental… well, it’s still terrible. It’s a modern-day version of the enduring stage musical, which has been moved from the Great Depression to present day Manhattan. This time, the plucky orphan Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) moves in with a billionaire cell-phone mogul (Jamie Foxx) and melts his heart… in song! The celebration of materialism is seriously amped up here, which is sort of depressing. Annie enjoys a helicopter ride around New York City and hands out free phones to her foster-kid friends. Cameron Diaz is rather shrill and inept as Miss Hannigan but she’s not as intimidating as she’s been in previous versions; she’s more pathetic than anything else. And Annie briefly finds herself in danger when she goes off with a couple who pretend to be her birth parents, but she’s not hurt in any way. Suitable for all ages.Exodus: Gods and Kings 31%Rating: PG, for violence including battle sequences and intense images.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching this massive biblical epic from director Ridley Scott, which makes his Oscar-winning Gladiator look like a tiny indie by comparison. With the use of massive visual effects, Scott tells the Old Testament story of Moses leading hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves out of Egypt to freedom. That means plagues — lots and lots of plagues — from frogs to locusts to boils. (The boils are especially gross.) And because everything has gotten so chaotic and overpopulated under the reign of the inept Ramses (Joel Edgerton), slaves are thrown into enormous fires to thin out the city. There are also several elaborate battle scenes, perilous chariot chases and a pummeling wall of water once Moses (Christian Bale) has finished parting the Red Sea. And be warned: besides the violence and the subject matter, the film runs nearly two and a half hours, which might be quite a slog for younger viewers.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Television, adaptation, technology, HBO, Max, king, Family, Academy, Winners, war, spy, Marvel, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/annie-parental.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-insurgent-penguins-of-madagascar-and-more"},{"id":"47508919748591","title":"Parental Guidance: Divergent and Muppets Most Wanted, Plus Frozen and Saving Mr. Banks","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Divergent and Muppets Most Wanted, Plus Frozen and Saving Mr. BanksWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | March 21, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Divergent 41%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action, thematic elements and some sensuality.The movie version of Veronica Roth’s young adult bestseller takes place in a rigidly structured dystopian future, so naturally this means teens are going to have to battle each other for survival. It’s a crucial part of the formula. For the tweens and older who’ve read the book, the film adaptation is probably fine. They (and you) know what to expect. Shailene Woodley stars as Beatrice, or Tris, who must decide which of society’s five factions is the best for her. Once she joins the Dauntless, known for their bravery, she learns to fight, shoot, throw knives and jump from trains. But she also must defend herself from her fellow initiates, who are trying to undermine her, and face her deepest fears within elaborate simulations. A sizable body count builds up during the film’s big action sequences toward the end, but because this is PG-13, there’s very little blood.Muppets Most Wanted 80%Rating: PG, for some mild action.The Muppets are back in yet another high-energy, star-studded, song-and-dance extravaganza. This time, they’re performing in major cities throughout Europe with an internationally known jewel thief, a frog named Constantine, pretending to be Kermit at the helm. There’s nothing even remotely inappropriate here. Miss Piggy is in slight danger, briefly, and the rest of the Muppets have to put themselves in peril to save her. And much of the action takes place inside a Siberian gulag (where a hilarious Tina Fey is the warden) but even that is depicted so cartoonishly, it’s never frightening. A Monsters University short precedes the feature, which is pretty darn delightful, as well.New On DVD:Frozen 90%Rating: PG, for some action and mild rude humor.You probably already have “Let It Go” playing repeatedly in your head like a psychotic episode. Now you can own Frozen on DVD and sear the song into your brain permanently. The Oscar-winning Disney animated musical has become a pop-culture phenomenon, and understandably so. It’s extremely entertaining for the whole family, especially if you have little girls in your house. Broadway veteran Idina Menzel lends her voice to the character of Elsa, a newly crowned queen who loses control and turns her idyllic kingdom to ice. Her younger sister (Kristen Bell), Princess Anna, goes on a journey with some new friends to retrieve Elsa from her self-imposed, mountaintop exile. The only vaguely scary element here is the giant snow monster Elsa creates to protect her fortress from intruders, but it’s on screen briefly and might frighten only the youngest viewers.Saving Mr. Banks 79%Rating: Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements including some unsettling images.A shamelessly sentimental retelling of how charismatic Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) persuaded persnickety Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to let him turn her beloved children’s book into a movie musical. It’s not entirely accurate from a historical perspective, but it’s certainly suitable and sufficiently cheery fare, full of upbeat tunes and cathartic tears. The only reason I can imagine for the PG-13 rating is that Saving Mr. Banks includes some flashbacks to Travers’ childhood with a father (Colin Farrell) whose alcoholism destroyed him. Showing your kids the actual Mary Poppins movie might be a better call.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fall, Nat, Tyler","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-divergent-and-muppets-most-wanted-plus-frozen-and-saving-mr-banks"},{"id":"47508928986171","title":"Red Carpet Pictures From the 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards","content":"Red Carpet Roundupgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})Red Carpet Pictures From the 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awardsby Alex Vo | March 3, 2018 |  CommentsA little rain can’t dampen these&nbsp;Spirits.

Tolkien’s The Hobbit is ridiculously violent. Yes, it’s all computer-generated fantasy spectacle, but what a spectacle it is – full of piercing arrows, ominous shadows, stabbings and beheadings, with some of those severed heads flying right at the camera. If the giant talking spiders don’t get you, the fierce (and fiercely ugly) orcs will. General peril abounds as Bilbo Baggins and his dwarf pals try and make their way to the Lonely Mountain – and then once they get there, they must contend with the ferocious and fire-breathing dragon Smaug, voiced menacingly by Benedict Cumberbatch. Given the graphic nature of this movie and the extended running time, this really is just for the most mature tweens and up.Saving Mr. Banks 79%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements including some unsettling images.I’m actually not quite sure why this movie gets a PG-13 rating – maybe because it includes some flashbacks to a childhood with a father whose alcoholism destroyed him. For the most part, Saving Mr. Banks is a cheery (and not entirely accurate) retelling of how folksy Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) persuaded uptight Mary Poppins author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) to let his studio make a film based on her cherished children’s book. It’s a shamelessly sentimental infomercial by Disney, for Disney, about Disney, full of upbeat songs and cathartic tears. Fine for most kids.Tyler Perry’s A Madea Christmas 20%Rating: PG-13, for sexual references, crude humor and language.This movie is amazingly terrible — incoherent and sloppily constructed in a way that?s surreal — so if you love your children, you probably shouldn’t take them to see it. But! If you’re at the multiplex trying to find something the whole family can enjoy after a long day of holiday shopping ? well, this still probably isn’t the best choice. Multimedia multi-hyphenate Tyler Perry returns to the sassy drag of his Madea character, a crass and wacky old lady with no internal censor. Most of the stuff she babbles about will go over kids’ heads – references to lingerie, drugs and stripping, for starters. Larry the Cable Guy shows up and magnifies the raunch factor with some sexual innuendos – which, again, probably won’t register with young viewers. There’s also a massively contrived car crash and explosion that might have been vaguely suspenseful in the hands of someone, you know, capable.New On DVD:Despicable Me 2 75%Rating: PG, for rude humor and mild action.Minions, minions and more minions make this sequel to the 2010 international hit such a delight. There isn’t a single thing in this movie that would make it inappropriate or objectionable in any way. When a powerful potion turns some of the babbling, bright yellow creatures into crazed, purple-monster versions of themselves, they’re a little more manic but never truly frightening. This remains my 4-year-old son’s favorite among the many animated films he saw this year.Classic Fantasy Films:Princess Mononoke 93%This gorgeous and wondrous animated fantasy from Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki features a true warrior princess: a fierce young woman named San (voiced by Claire Danes in the English-language version) who can communicate with the spirits. She finds herself in the center of a war between animals, humans (whom she hates) and demons in a mystical 14th century setting. Too intense and complex for the littlest kids but a thrill for everyone else.Time Bandits 90%From the endlessly creative mind of Monty Python animator Terry Gilliam comes this comic adventure about a boy who time travels with a group of dwarves. Along the way, he runs into historical figures including Robin Hood and Napoleon. It’s got some darkness to its tone, which may disturb very little kids. But with its elaborately detailed production design, it’s always a wonder to watch.The Princess Bride 97%Long before films like Shrek took familiar fairy-tale conventions and turned them on their head, there was Rob Reiner’s cleverly self-referential comedy. A favorite from my own youth, The Princess Bride remains endlessly quotable with its colorful characters and swashbuckling scenarios. It’s charming and subversive in equal measure but, at its core, has an irresistibly sweet heart.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Rock, Kids","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-hobbit-saving-mr-banks-and-classic-fantasy-films"},{"id":"47508934838387","title":"Red Carpet Roundup With Lily James, Alexandra Daddario, Matt Smith and More","content":"Red Carpet Roundupgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})Red Carpet Roundup With Lily James, Alexandra Daddario, Matt Smith and Moreby Alex Vo | February 4, 2016 |  CommentsHit the red carpet for the premieres of&nbsp;Hail, Caesar!,&nbsp;The Choice, and&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.Alexandra DaddarioLily JamesMatt SmithLena HeadeyJack HustonEllie BamberHermione Corfield, Ellie Bamber, Suki Waterhouse, Millie Brady, Bella Heathcote and Lily JamesBella HeathcoteFrancesca NewmanZara HollandNicole BassLily JamesSuki WaterhouseMillie BradyDouglas BoothJosh Brolin and Kathryn BoydAlison PillVeronica OsorioCaitlin MuelderMelissa BolonaNatasha BassettGeorge Clooney (R) and Amal ClooneyKathryn BoydJonah HillChanning Tatum and Jenna Dewan-TatumJenna Dewan-TatumTeresa PalmerBenjamin Walker and Teresa PalmerMaggie GraceMadeline BrewerNoree VictoriaBecca TilleyKatherine McNamaraRenee OlsteadSkai JacksonArden ChoJeannie Mai","section":"Red Carpet Roundup","tags":"Family, Returns, school, horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/04155720/600RCR.jpg","slug":"red-carpet-roundup-with-lily-james-alexandra-daddario-matt-smith-and-more"},{"id":"47508989014625","title":"Total Recall:  Anthony Hopkins’ Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Anthony Hopkins' Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Wolfman star.by Jeff Giles | February 9, 2010 |  CommentsSome actors struggle with typecasting for their entire careers — and some, like Anthony Hopkins, get to do pretty much whatever they want. Since making his film debut in 1968, Hopkins has dabbled in everything from Merchant Ivory period dramas to horror, moving from television to film — and picking up an Academy Award, and several nominations, along the way. He’s battled a bear in The Edge, walked away unscathed from the misery of Joel Schumacher’s Bad Company, and even survived Freejack, but he’s never been given the Rotten Tomatoes Total Recall treatment — so in honor of his supporting turn in The Wolfman, we decided now would be the perfect time to look back at the 10 best-reviewed films in his distinguished career.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1154562[/tomatometer]10. The World’s Fastest IndianA name like The World’s Fastest Indian doesn’t exactly conjure up images of a Kiwi in his late 60s, but don’t let the disorienting combination of Anthony Hopkins’ face floating over the title on the poster keep you from watching. For one thing, Hopkins has called this his favorite performance; for another, the real-life adventures of New Zealand motorcycle tinkerer Burt Munro, who topped 200 MPH on his souped-up Indian Scout, make for one of the most entertaining, albeit unusual, biopics you’ve probably never seen. While it never enjoyed much more than a limited run here in the States, critics were kind to Indian — among them the Boston Globe’s Janice Page, who wrote, “History dictates that you know how the story ends. Still, the heart beats no less fast when you watch Munro’s Indian rocketing across those salt flats. You can see how it might be enough to justify a journey halfway around the world.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1041859[/tomatometer]9. Bram Stoker’s DraculaBy 1992, the world had seen enough Dracula adaptations — many of them sadly subpar — that the character was in desperate need of a fresh, suitably creepy start. Enter Francis Ford Coppola and his lavishly mounted Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which pit Gary Oldman as the titular vampire against Hopkins as his arch-nemesis Van Helsing — and threw in a marquee cast that included Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, as well as an Annie Lennox song over the closing credits, for added megaplex appeal. Given its impeccable pedigree, the fact that Coppola’s Dracula was a financial success didn’t come as much of a surprise — but unlike a lot of previous adaptations, particularly those of recent vintage, it was also a success with critics, many of whom welcomed the opportunity to see a director as talented as Coppola interpret the vampire’s classic tale. In the words of the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “It is Coppola’s most lavish and, certainly, his most flamboyant film; never before has he allowed himself this kind of mad experimentation.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1013029[/tomatometer]8. MagicThe first of three collaborations between Hopkins and director Richard Attenborough, 1978’s Magic is one of the stranger entries in Hopkins’ admittedly eclectic filmography — a horror movie about an unsuccessful magician named Corky (Hopkins) whose professional expansion to ventriloquism masks a worsening case of multiple personality disorder. Doing a sort of double duty as both Corky and the voice of his murderous dummy “Fats,” Hopkins added to his burgeoning horror resume as part of a stellar cast that included Ann-Margaret, Burgess Meredith, and David Ogden Stiers. While Magic wasn’t a huge commercial success, most critics expressed admiration for the puppet-driven tragedy, and it remains one of the stranger entries in a filmography heavy with big-budget productions and period dramas. As Rory L. Aronsky of Film Threat wrote, “Because of Hopkins, because of Ann-Margret (who hardly looks like that Ann-Margret, adeptly proving herself as an occasional dramatic actress), and because of Burgess Meredith as well as Fats the dummy, Magic is one of the top-notch films of the 1970s.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083302[/tomatometer]7. The Mask of ZorroFor decades, the legend of Zorro held a reliable grip on film audiences, but by the 1990s, Hollywood seemed to have forgotten his appeal; the most recent movie to feature the swashbuckling bandit, 1981’s Zorro, the Gay Blade, was a broad parody starring George Hamilton as both the black-clad hero and his gay twin brother, Bunny. On the surface, Hopkins may have seemed an odd choice for The Mask of Zorro, which presented him as an aged version of the title character, in search of a man capable of assuming his legend and defeating the villanous Don Rafael Montero. Ultimately, however, neither audiences nor critics had much trouble accepting Hopkins as the Spanish swordsman who trains his much younger successor (Antonio Banderas); in fact, despite an ungainly running time of 136 minutes and some rather clumsy stunt editing, Zorro provoked a surprising amount of applause from critics, among them Almar Haflidason of the BBC, who gushed, “There are no clever ground-breaking effects, just lashings of good clean fun with desperately devilish baddies, and good guys so fantastic, so clever and witty, that they make you want to weep with pleasure.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1041803[/tomatometer]6. Howards EndImmediately after collecting a bushel of awards for his portrayal of the despicable Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins made an about face to play a different kind of villain in Howards End — the well-heeled but irredeemably flawed Henry Wilcox, whose casually classist attitudes represent the dark side of early 20th century British capitalist reform. At bottom, Henry is really sort of a cad, but Hopkins infuses him with ambiguity the way only he can; it’s another finely layered performance in a career full of them, and during the era of commercial ascendancy that found Hopkins starring in fluff like Freejack, it served as a gentle reminder of the talent that made him famous. And even if Edwardian dramas generally aren’t your thing, don’t dismiss Howards End out of hand; as Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing wrote, it’s “The best of the countless Merchant Ivory productions — and arguably the most appreciated by those who don’t even like Merchant Ivory movies.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1006527[/tomatometer]5. The Elephant ManBefore David Lynch’s name was synonymous with artsy, non-linear fare, he was the young director whose work on Eraserhead made a fan of Mel Brooks — who, when producing a film based on the life of medical legend and 19th-century British celebrity Joseph Merrick, hired Lynch to direct what would become 1980’s The Elephant Man. Though John Hurt justifiably received much of the film’s critical praise, as well as a Best Actor nomination, it’s Hopkins, as Merrick’s friend and fierce advocate Frederick Treves, that lends Elephant much of its compassion and moral weight. As Christopher Null of Filmcritic wrote, “Understated and masterful in its use of costumes, makeup, and low-budget camerawork, David Lynch’s portrait of John ‘The Elephant Man’ Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012386[/tomatometer]4. The Lion in WinterMany successful actors find themselves making excuses (or apologies) for the earliest entries in their resumes, but Anthony Hopkins’ first film was no Leprechaun — he made his debut in the 1968 period piece The Lion in Winter, starring as twelfth-century king Richard the Lionheart in a cast that included Peter O’Toole (as King Henry II) and Katharine Hepburn (as Queen Eleanor). Also kicking off his film career was Timothy Dalton, who appeared as King Philip II, the French monarch and Richard’s future nemesis (and perhaps paramour). Lion would go on to win three of the seven Academy Awards for which it was nominated, including a Best Actress trophy for Hepburn, and marked the first of many Hopkins performances based on historical figures. Praising it as “Less historical spectacle than vicious farce,” Kim Newman of Empire applauded its “great cast spitting venomous dialogue and a young Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton as gay lovers destined to rule England and France.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048267[/tomatometer]3. ShadowlandsHis gift for fantasy helped make him one of the most successful authors in the world, but C.S. Lewis’ real-life experiences were as noteworthy as his fiction, as evidenced by 1993’s Shadowlands, which recounts his unexpected, slow-blooming love affair with the poet Joy Gresham. First friends, then partners in a marriage of convenience designed to keep her from being deported, Lewis and Gresham found their bond tested when she was diagnosed with cancer — and, in fact, found that their feelings ran deeper than either had planned. A gentle, melancholy tearjerker, Shadowlands reunited Hopkins with Chaplin director Richard Attenborough, and paired him with Debra Winger in a film that brilliantly highlighted the strengths of all three. Praising his work, Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, “Here is Mr. Hopkins giving an amazingly versatile and moving performance, shifting the light in those knowing blue eyes to reveal endless shadings between delight and sorrow.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1034185[/tomatometer]2. Silence of the LambsAll the fame, ticket receipts, and critical superlatives aside, if you want to know what a tremendous actor Anthony Hopkins is, you need only consider that he earned a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs — a role that called for less than 20 minutes of screen time. Of course, it didn’t hurt that Lecter was a terrific character, one whose brilliant intellect and bloodthirsty appetites inspired multiple films and books (and helped make author Thomas Harris a very wealthy man in the process). Hopkins would go on to play Lecter on more than one occasion, resurfacing for 2001’s Hannibal and 2002’s Red Dragon — but while both of those films made money, neither approached the level of critical success enjoyed by Silence, which won a whopping five Academy Awards (including Best Picture). It isn’t often that a horror movie scales such heights; Silence succeeded because, in the words of Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, “For all the unbridled savagery on display, what is shrewd, significant and finally hopeful about Silence of the Lambs is the way it proves that a movie can be mercilessly scary and mercifully humane at the same time.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1046892[/tomatometer]1. Remains of the DayHopkins’ commercial film breakthrough came with his gleefully mad portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, and he hasn’t been above chewing the scenery on occasion — but he’s also more than capable of occupying the other end of the dramatic spectrum, as evidenced by his impeccably reserved work in Merchant Ivory’s Remains of the Day. Adapted from the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, Remains tells the story of an implacable butler (Hopkins) and the comparatively hot-tempered housekeeper who grows to love him (Emma Thompson) during their years together in a pre-World War II British estate. Not the stuff of blockbuster epics, obviously, but it picked up eight Academy Award nominations, gave Hopkins the opportunity to wring incredible drama from an act as simple as raising his hat, and reaffirmed his status as one of the few actors capable of making the jump between the megaplex and the arthouse. Among Remains‘ many appreciative critics was Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who wrote, “All the meticulousness, intelligence, taste and superior acting that one expects from Merchant Ivory productions have been brought to bear.”In case you were wondering, here are Hopkins’ top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Silence of the Lambs — 97%2. The Elephant Man — 95%3. The World’s Fastest Indian — 91%4. Remains of the Day — 90%5. Chaplin — 89%6. Amistad — 87%7. Howards End — 87%8. Shadowlands — 87%9.

Time will tell if The Invasion is remembered as a movie thatcaptured something about the way we live in the 2000s (though with its 21percent Tomatometer score, that seems unlikely), but one thing is for certain:It’s the latest in a long line of films that attempt to grapple with ourcollective anxiety in uncertain times.Perhaps, in this age of domestic spying and alleged sleeper cells, we’re moreanxious than ever. If nothing else, filmmakers have certainly found much to minefrom our collective angst; in 2007 alone, such varied films as The Bourne Ultimatum,Disturbia, The Lives OfOthers, Red Road,and Civic Dutyhave hit screens. Despite profoundly different settings and methods ofexecution, what these films share is a sense of unease, be it in the form ofvast machinations exerting greater control over our lives, or a sneakingsuspicion that someone’s watching.The cinema of paranoia is nothing new; you can expect moviemakers to tap into aspirit of discontent. In fact, for one of the finest examples of how the moviescan depict a society torn apart by fear, you have to go all the way back to thebirth of the sound era.Fritz Lang‘sM, made inGermany only a few years before the Nazis took power, depicts a nation wherethere’s only a thin line between the cops and the criminals, where paranoia andfear can sweep through the streets like a fever. In the role that made himcinema’s favorite sketchy character,Peter Lorreplays a child killer whose crimes have set the city on edge; when an elderly mantries to help a lost child, he’s accused of being the killer and beaten for histrouble. The situation becomes so dire that even the city’s crime bosses decideto find M, since he’s making it hard for them to do business. Once Lorre isbeing pursued by both the police and the underworld, a strange thing happens: hebecomes our point of reference, and we realize we identify with him, partlybecause he’s as much a manifestation of collective fear as he is an evildoer.M is a forerunner to cinema’s most paranoia-minded subgenres (film noir,serial killer flicks, police procedurals), and certainlyDavid Fincherowes a debt to the film; both Se7en (84percent) and Zodiac(88 percent) borrow from its bleak, shadowy palette. As Dave Kehr of the ChicagoReader writes, \"The moral issues are complex and deftly handled: Lorre is atonce entirely innocent and absolutely evil. Lang’s detached, modifiedexpressionist style gives the action a plastic beauty.\" It’s at 100 percent onthe Tomatometer.Many horror and science fiction movies of the 1950s drew from a variety ofpostwar fears, from atomic power to the rise of Communism. Though it’s beenremade twice (and The Invasion was originally intended as a straightremake as well), the original Body Snatchers retains a potent, disquieting aura, and as a politicalallegory it’s tantalizingly hard to read. The plot involves a doctor (KevinMcCarthy) who finds that many of the citizens of his small town have startedacting strange; they look the same as they ever did, but emit no emotionwhatsoever. He soon discovers plant-like aliens are taking over people’s bodieswhen they fall asleep, stripping them of their humanity and spreading out toclaim more victims. Is it a dark satire on the (Joseph, not Kevin) McCarthy era?A warning of what a Communist future would bring?However one reads it, there’s no denying Body Snatchers has proven to beone of the most durable and influential sci-fi films of the 1950s, inspiringeverything from Shaun of the Dead (90 percent) to Signs (74 percent). Andit’s at 100 percent on the Tomatometer. \"Its title implies that it’s somethingyou might watch for its campy comic value,\" writes Audrey Rock-Richardson of TheTooele Transcript Bulletin, \"but it’s flat-out nightmarish.In the 1970s, the fallout from the Watergate break-in — and the general feelingthat the government was veering into criminal territory — inspired a number offine suspense films, fromThree Daysof the Condor (92 percent) to The Parallax View(91 percent). But perhaps the finest paranoid thriller from the post-Watergateera is TheConversation,FrancisFord Coppola‘s taut, haunting reworking of Blow-Up (85percent). GeneHackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who’s been commissionedto listen in on the conversations of a powerful businessman’s daughter. Caul isintensely private — he lives alone in an apartment with four or five deadbolts,and he never gives out his phone number — but he’s also results-oriented to theextreme, more concerned about making the perfect recording than what anyone’ssaying on the tape. But on his latest job, he can’t help but notice that theyoung woman he’s taping seems to be discussing something particularly ominous;is she in grave danger?Caul’s attempt to get at the truth result in a chilling embodiment of the oldadage: \"Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean someone’s not after you.\"Featuring hypnotic sound editing from Walter Murch, as well as one of GeneHackman’s finest performances, The Conversation \"grapples with the moralissue at stake in a country where technology has outstripped our knowledge ofhow to use and control it,\" writes Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of Spiritualityand Practice. At 97 percent on the Tomatometer, this \"masterpiece of modern-dayparanoia is far more than a simple rehashing of a classic slice of cinema.

Four other new films debuted in wide release but generated little interest from moviegoers. Overall, the marketplace suffered the usual late spring slowdown as for the first time since February, the top ten failed to sell $100M worth of tickets.Rising star Shia LaBeouf scored a big victory over the weekend with the thriller \"Disturbia\" which shot straight to number one debuting with an estimated $23M. The PG-13 pic was given the widest release of the frame’s six new entries playing in 2,925 theaters and generated a strong $7,872 average. A modern day version of Alfred Hitchcock’s \"Rear Window,\" Disturbia played to a young female audience as studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was female and 75% was under 35.Just before the film’s opening day, the studio announced that LaBeouf had been cast opposite Harrison Ford in its next \"Indiana Jones\" film. The news may have helped to generate more excitement for Disturbia which was the only major choice for teenage girls this weekend. The safe rating and fairly good reviews may also have contributed. The $20M production looks to become a profitable vehicle.After its two-week run at the top, Will Ferrell’s comedy hit \"Blades of Glory\" slipped to second place dropping a moderate 38% to an estimated $14.1M. The 17-day cume stands at a potent $90.2M. Like \"Disturbia,\" \"Blades\" was produced by DreamWorks and distributed by its new parent Paramount.Slipping only 28% was Disney’s animated comedy \"Meet the Robinsons\" with an estimated $12.1M which lifted the total to $72M. With no new films for young kids this weekend, \"Robinsons\" enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten.Halle Berry and Bruce Willis failed to turn their starpower into box office bucks as their new suspense thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" debuted weaker than expected in fourth place with an estimated $11.5M. The critically-panned Sony release averaged a mediocre $4,322 from 2,661 theaters. With its R rating, \"Perfect Stranger\" played to an adult audience with a female skew. Studio research showed that women made up 54% of the audience and a very high 70% were 25 or older. The opening was weaker than the bows of other films headlined by Berry like \"Catwoman\" ($16.7M) and \"Gothika\" ($19.3M).Ice Cube had a decent second weekend for his comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" which fell by 36% to an estimated $9.2M. That gave the Sony release a cume of $33M after 12 days. Its predecessor enjoyed a much slimmer 12% dip to $16.3M in its second weekend on its way to $82.3M. \"Done\" might find its way to the vicinity of $55M.Fox’s Viking actioner \"Pathfinder\" limped into sixth place with a weak $4.8M opening, according to estimates. The R-rated film averaged a mild $2,791 from 1,720 locations.The rest of the top ten was filled with four films separated by only $400,000. Buena Vista’s motorcycle comedy \"Wild Hogs\" grossed an estimated $4.6M, down only 30%, for a stellar cume of $152.2M. Hilary Swank’s horror flick \"The Reaping\" tumbled 55% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.6M giving Warner Bros. $19.8M in 11 days.The mighty \"300\" broke through the double century mark over the weekend both domestically and internationally. In North America, the Warner Bros. smash dropped 48% to an estimated $4.3M boosting the total to $200.8M. Overseas, \"300\" collected an estimated $14.8M this weekend to lift the international haul to $204.1M giving the Spartan epic a global tally of $405M and counting. The stylish war film is now the highest grossing March release ever having surpassed the old record holder \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" which grossed $195.3M last spring.Rounding out the top ten was the Quentin Tarantino–Robert Rodriguez flop \"Grindhouse\" which plunged 63% in its sophomore session to an estimated $4.2M. Budgeted at $53M, the double feature has taken in just $19.7M in its first ten days and looks headed for a weak $25-27M finish for The Weinstein Co.In addition to the three new wide releases that debuted in the top ten, another three opened outside of it with weaker results. The car racing pic \"Redline\" bowed to an estimated $4M from 1,607 sites for a slow $2,492 average per theater. The first title from rookie distributor Chicago Pictures stars Eddie Griffin and targeted young males.First Look opened the animated film \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" to the tune of $3.1M, according to estimates, giving the R-rated film an average of just $3,521 from 877 locations. Lionsgate made no impact with its Ray Liotta actioner \"Slow Burn\" which bowed to an estimated $805,000 from 1,163 playdates for a puny average of $692 per theater.Three films fell out of the top ten this weekend. Mark Wahlberg’s sniper pic \"Shooter\" dropped 47% to an estimated $3.1M putting its total at $42.1M. The $60M Paramount release should end its run with $47-49M. Fox’s family film \"Firehouse Dog\" held up well in its second weekend, despite collecting low overall grosses. The PG-rated drama dipped 28% to an estimated $2.8M for a cume of $9.9M after 12 days. Warner Bros. took in an estimated $2.1M for the animated actioner \"TMNT,\" off 56%, for a total of $50.7M. Look for a $53-55M final.Platforming to solid results was the Molly Shannon comedy \"Year of the Dog\" which bowed in seven New York and Los Angeles sites and grossed an estimated $112,000. The Paramount Vantage release averaged $16,049 and will open in nine additional cities this Friday boosting its theater count to more than 30.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.5M which was down 14% from last year when Scary Movie 4 opened at number one with $40.2M; but up 29% from 2005 when The Amityville Horror debuted on top with $23.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"E!, Walking, movies, Hallmark, Martial, Now, Rey, hidden, Action, fiction, Movies, TCA, VH1, Trek","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Disturbia-Scares-Up-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509154206777","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"13\" Hits #1 But With Worst \"Ocean\"’s Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"13\" Hits #1 But With Worst \"Ocean\"'s Openingby Gitesh Pandya | June 10, 2007 |  CommentsHollywood served up more of the same dishes and moviegoers said enough is enough and found their weekend entertainment elsewhere. The latest star-studded heist sequel \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" managed to open at number one, but with the weakest debut of the franchise.\"Surf’s Up,\" the second animated penguin movie in seven months, attracted a mild debut while the horror sequel \"Hostel Part II\" was butchered on its opening weekend. Overall, the marketplace generated the worst showing for the second weekend of June since 2003.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Al Pacino made off with the North American box office crown with \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" which debuted on top with an estimated $37.1M. Averaging a solid $10,401 from 3,565 locations, the Warner Bros. release bowed a bit below the openings of the previous installments in the heist franchise. 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" debuted to $38.1M and a $12,393 average while its 2004 sequel premiered to $39.2M and a $11,901 average. Both opened in early December.\"Thirteen\"’s top spot debut marked the sixth consecutive weekend when a threequel ruled the charts. Given higher ticket prices, additional theaters, the more high-profile summer launch, and the publicity generated from the much-hyped world premiere at Cannes, \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" was expected to open stronger by some in the industry. However, competition for adults was stronger with this chapter with holdovers \"Pirates\" and \"Knocked Up\" grossing a combined $41M. Plus the non-stop assault of sequels may have made some moviegoers sick of paying to see the same characters in the same situations again and again. Reviews were mostly upbeat for the PG-13 caper pic.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" tumbled another 52% in its third frame and dropped down to second place with an estimated $21.3M pushing its cume to $253.6M. Both previous Captain Jack films, 2003’s \"The Curse of the Black Pearl\" and 2006’s \"Dead Man’s Chest,\" did better in their third weekends with $23.1M and $35.2M, respectively. The latest Disney pic now stands at number 38 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after 2001’s \"Monsters, Inc.\" which grossed $255.9M. At its current rate of decline, \"At World’s End\" now has no guarantee of reaching the $300M mark which was always seen as an easy milestone before the film’s release. As with the \"Spider-Man\" franchise, the third chapter should become the lowest-grossing installment in the series domestically.But just like with the webslinger, international business is on fire for the latest \"Pirates\" which grossed an estimated $51.3M overseas this weekend, down 50%. That puts the overseas tally at $493.5M and the global gross at a colossal $747M.Universal’s hot comedy \"Knocked Up\" delivered a solid hold in its second weekend thanks to strong word-of-mouth. The R-rated pic collected an estimated $20M, off 35%, for a ten-day cume of $66.2M. By comparison, director Judd Apatow’s last film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" opened weaker and dipped only 24% to $16.3M in its second weekend for a total of $48.6M in its first ten days. \"Knocked Up\" is proving that a film that is good and original can attract a large paying audience and should go on to gross more than \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" this summer despite having a smaller budget and no bankable stars. A final gross of about $120-130M could result for the pregnancy comedy quadrupling its $30M production cost.The penguin toon \"Surf’s Up\" opened in fourth place with a mediocre launch. Sony’s big summer family pic took in an estimated $18M from an ultrawide 3,528 theaters for a decent $5,102 average. The PG-rated film tells of a young penguin who competes in a surfing competition and was made in a mockumentary style. The debut was weaker than last year’s animated releases from the studio – \"Open Season\" ($23.6M) and \"Monster House\" ($22.2M). \"Surf’s Up\" also bowed to less than half of the $41.5M that last November’s penguin pic \"Happy Feet\" took in on its debut frame. Sony saw a six-week gap between the openings of the summer megatoons \"Shrek the Third\" and Pixar’s \"Ratatouille\" and positioned its entry right in the middle.Close behind in fifth was rival toon \"Shrek the Third\" with an estimated $15.8M in its fourth frame. Off a reasonable 44%, the Paramount release has grabbed $281.9M to date putting it at number 29 on the all-time domestic list. A final gross of around $320M seems likely. The latest ogre now stands as the second biggest DreamWorks film ever after \"Shrek 2\" ($436.7M) and the third largest hit in Paramount history after \"Titanic\" ($600.8M) and \"Forrest Gump\" ($329.7M).Yet another horror failure followed in sixth place. Lionsgate’s \"Hostel Part II\" opened to an estimated $8.8M from 2,350 theaters for a weak $3,723 average. That was less than half of the $19.6M bow that the first \"Hostel\" generated in January 2006 on its way to a solid $47.3M domestic gross. The R-rated sequel once again examines the torture of American students in Slovakia, only with female victims this time. \"Part II\" even opened weaker than other recent horror sequels like \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes II\" which both bowed to just under $10M each. With so many fright flicks flooding the multiplexes recently and moviegoers ignoring most of them, Lionsgate has to be a bit worried about getting genre fans back into theaters for the fourth consecutive Halloween with its \"Saw IV.\"The Kevin Costner thriller \"Mr. Brooks\" fell 50% to an estimated $5M and placed seventh with a $18.7M total. \"Spider-Man 3\" dropped 45% to an estimated $4.4M in its sixth mission giving Sony $325.7M to date. That keeps the third webslinger adventure at number 17 on the all-time domestic list just behind \"The Lion King\"’s lifetime cume of $328.5M. A $335M final seems likely.Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten once again was Keri Russell’s comedy \"Waitress\" which dipped only 18% to an estimated $1.7M pushing the cume to $12M for Fox Searchlight. Paramount’s \"Disturbia\" rounded out the top ten with an estimated $550,000, down 51%, giving the thriller $77.8M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $132.5M which was down 8% from last year when \"Cars\" opened at number one with $60.1M; and off 1% from 2005 when \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" debuted in the top spot with $50.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cancelled, medical, TLC, Arts, USA, festival, what, Esquire, TV, Fox, Starz, comedies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-13-Hits-1-But-With-Worst-Oceans-Opening"},{"id":"47509155667021","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Six New Films Try to Shoot Down Spartans From #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Six New Films Try to Shoot Down Spartans From #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | March 22, 2007 |  CommentsA half-dozen new soldiers enter the marketplace this weekend trying to topple the kingdom of \"300\" which has reigned supreme at the box office for the past two weeks.Mark Wahlberg toplines the sniper thriller \"Shooter,\" animated ninja turtles fight crime in \"TMNT,\" and mutated zombies attack in \"The Hills Have Eyes 2.\" In addition, moviegoers will get to choose from the kids adventure \"The Last Mimzy,\" the sports saga \"Pride,\" and the Adam Sandler drama \"Reign Over Me.\" Holdovers should witness some large declines as these new pics all fight over the time and attention of ticket buyers. The box office may not have room for all to survive.Seventeen years after shocking the film industry with a record March opening, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back but in animated form in \"TMNT.\" The Warner Bros. toon features the voices of Patrick Stewart, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ziyi Zhang and carries a PG rating that is friendly for kids. Given the violence, \"TMNT\" should skew more to boys and might even pull in those who grew up with the characters in the late 1980s and early 1990s. With all the R-rated films recently, there have not been too many choices for kids this spring. \"The Last Mimzy\" is the only new release that will provide direct competition for that audience. Bringing its turtle power to 3,110 theaters, \"TMNT\" may generate a bow of roughly $16M this weekend.They’re back.Hot off his recent Oscar nomination, Mark Wahlberg hits the big screen in the action thriller \"Shooter\" playing a former Marine sniper trying to clear his name after being wrongly accused of trying to assassinate the U.S. President. The R-rated film comes from \"Training Day\" director Antoine Fuqua and co-stars Danny Glover and Michael Peña. The film is banking on the starpower of Wahlberg who has been able to anchor hits in recent years. Late summer pics like last year’s \"Invincible\" and 2005’s \"Four Brothers\" opened to $17M and $21.2M, respectively, and brought in solid sales overall. \"Shooter\" is targeting the adult action crowd with appeal that will reach both men and women. Certainly \"300\" will play to much of the same audience and be a factor. Though no Damon or Cruise, Wahlberg has indeed become a believable action hero and is in a role that audiences will buy him in. Plus his Academy nod for \"The Departed\" has only increased audience respect for the former rapper. Opening in 2,600 theaters, \"Shooter\" might take in about $16M for the weekend.Mark Wahlberg, playing a guy named Swagger, in a movie called \"Shooter.\"Last March, Fox Searchlight hit gold with the horror remake \"The Hills Have Eyes\" which bowed to $15.7M and grossed $41.8M overall. A year later, the sequel is born this time coming out through Fox Atomic, the studio’s new division geared towards young adult audiences with genre fare. \"Eyes 2\" once again is targeting the horror crowd with slick marketing hoping to lure in those seeking R-rated gore and violence. Plus the distributor is premiering the trailer to the upcoming fright sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" with the new \"Hills\" installment to help give moviegoers more for their money. Much of the audience for the first pic will probably return, although the sequel will face more competition as \"300\" and \"Shooter\" will both be drawing in young men. Attacking 2,500 theaters, \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" could open to around $13M this weekend.\"The Hills Have Eyes, Too.\"New Line studio chief Bob Shaye steps back into the director’s chair with the family adventure \"The Last Mimzy\" based on a popular short story. The \"E.T.\"-like film about a boy and a girl who find a mysterious animal with mystical powers hopes to attract an audience of kids and parents, but will have to face some stiff competition from its studio’s former heroes, the Ninja Turtles. That toon should take away more boys than girls so \"Mimzy\" may end up skewing a bit more female. New Line hopes that much of the crowd that spent $75M and counting on \"Bridge to Terabithia\" will take a spin with this new effects-filled fantasy so sneak previews were held to help raise awareness and get buzz spreading. Still, a competitive environment will probably cut into its potential. Landing in over 3,000 sites, \"The Last Mimzy\" might gross about $12M this weekend.\"The Last Mimzy.\"Targeting the African American audience this weekend is Lionsgate with its swim team drama \"Pride\" starring Terrence Howard. The PG-rated film will try to appeal to males with the sports saga and females with its human drama and half-nude muscular men. But Howard has not yet proven that he can open a picture on his own and \"Pride\" may not be the one to increase his future salary demands. \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Coach Carter\" both opened north of $20M and much of that was due to starpower. Plus Chris Rock found out last week that African Americans will not just show up for any film with a predominantly black cast. Diving into 1,518 theaters, \"Pride\" could swim to a weekend gross of about $7M.Terrence Howard in \"Pride.\"Adam Sandler goes back to serious territory with the R-rated drama \"Reign Over Me\" playing a man whose life fell apart after his wife and kids were killed on 9/11. It’s no surprise Sony is releasing the film given all the cash the comedian has made for the studio over the years. Don Cheadle and Jada Pinkett Smith co-star. Given the subject matter, the rating, and Sandler’s Bob Dylan haircut, the actor’s core audience of immature young males will not be lining up this time. Remember \"Spanglish‘\"s $8.8M bow? Well, it could get worse for \"Reign.\" After \"United 93\" and \"World Trade Center,\" demand isn’t very high for yet another look at September 11. Given all the choices in the marketplace, adult audiences will be divided between many films so only a small slice might go this way. Debuting in 1,671 venues, \"Reign Over Me\" could open with about $6M.Sandler and Cheadle in \"Reign Over Me.\"The mighty King Leonidas barely broke a sweat over the last two weeks in his box office victories. But the invading armies this weekend will pose a great threat to \"300\"’s rule. \"Shooter\" and \"Hills\" will provide the most direct competition. A 50% drop may be in order which would leave the Warner Bros. epic with roughly $16.5M for the frame and an impressive $157M in 17 days.\"Wild Hogs\" may finally see a normal drop and slide by 40% to $11M giving Buena Vista $121M to date. \"Premonition\" should lose half of its audience and fall to $9M for a ten-day cume of $30M.LAST YEAR: Spike Lee and Denzel Washington joined forces for the heist thriller \"Inside Man\" and found themselves at number one with a potent $29M opening. Universal went on to collect $88.5M domestically and $183M worldwide. The competing actioner \"V for Vendetta\" dropped from first to second with $12.3M falling 52% in its second weekend. Debuting in third was the horror flick \"Stay Alive\" with $10.7M on its way to $23.1M for Buena Vista. Rounding out the top five were \"Failure to Launch\" with $10.5M and \"The Shaggy Dog\" with $9M, both in their third weekends. Bowing in seventh place was the blue collar comedy \"Larry the Cable Guy\" with $6.9M leading to a $15.7M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"aliens, ratings, movies, Television, Pirates, CNN, wars, Hallmark, Ice, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Six-New-Films-Try-to-Shoot-Down-Spartans-From-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509175058673","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2019","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2019A month-by-month round-up of the best news to come out of Hollywood this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 27, 2019 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood, and when we get to this time of the year, there’s rarely much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” of the year.JANUARY: MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 7 AND 8 TO FILM BACK-TO-BACK(Photo by David James/Paramount Pictures)There are lots of long-running movie franchises, but in many of them, the cast changes over time (the MCU and the Rocky/Creed franchises being two exceptions to the rule). In January, we first learned that,&nbsp;in 2022, Tom Cruise will hit movie #8 in the&nbsp;Mission: Impossible franchise, as Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible 8 are being developed for release in the summers of 2021 and 2022, respectively. The two movies will be shot back-to-back to ensure their releases within a year of each other, and also to make it easier to secure not just Tom Cruise, but also his supporting cast, which may include Fallout cast like Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, etc. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie&nbsp;will&nbsp;work on these sequels, hoping to match what he’s&nbsp;achieved with the last two films, 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (Certified Fresh at 93%), and last year’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout (Certified Fresh at 97%). Mission: Impossible 7 is now scheduled for July 23, 2021 (the week after LeBron James’ Space Jam 2), and Mission: Impossible 8 is scheduled for August 5, 2022. The first new franchise cast member to be announced for Mission: Impossible 7 was British actress Hayley Atwell, who probably remains best known for playing Marvel’s Peggy Carter, as seen in both Captain America: The First Avenger, and in the much-missed ABC series, Agent Carter. There are no details yet as to where the Mission: Impossible franchise might go after 2022, but Tom Cruise will turn 60 on July 3 of that year, so Mission: Impossible 8 might be his last opportunity to&nbsp;hang off the sides of airplaines and&nbsp;jump off&nbsp;of skyscrapers.FEBRUARY:&nbsp;AQUAMAN GETTING SEQUEL IN 2022 AND HORROR SPINOFF FOR THE TRENCH(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)With over $1.14 billion earned at the global box office, Aquaman became the highest-grossing DC Comics movie (worldwide) ever in early 2019, even above The Dark Knight (though Joker came close to beating Aquaman at $1.063 billion).&nbsp; That was quite an achievement for a character long considered a joke (including a long-running story arc on HBO’s Entourage). Those numbers also made it super obvious that Aquaman would get a sequel and that’s exactly what’s happening, with one of the first film’s screenwriters now working on the sequel. Aquaman director James Wan is on board as producer, but it’s unclear as to whether he will also direct the sequel. Warner Bros didn’t stop there, though, as they also hired two “newbie” screenwriters to work on a horror movie spinoff for The Trench,&nbsp;about the ” deadly amphibious creatures seen attacking the hero and his love, Mera” in Aquaman. The main characters from Aquaman are not expected to appear in The Trench, which suggests that the “horror movie” may instead focus on surface dwellers who come into contact with the monsters separate from any involvement with Atlantis.MARCH: CAST ANNOUNCED FOR CHRISTOPHER NOLAN’S AMBITIOUS ACTION MOVIE TENET(Photo by JA, Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Although we obviously knew what Dunkirk was about way before release (the title gives it away), director Christopher Nolan also has a history of starting his movies with mystery premises (we’re thinking here of Inception and Interstellar&nbsp;in particular). In March, pretty much the only thing we knew about Nolan’s next film (revealed in May to be called Tenet) was that Warner Bros had scheduled it for release on July 17, 2020 (up against Bob’s Burgers: The Movie). In March, we learned that Nolan had cast John David Washington (Denzel’s son and the star of Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman) as the film’s lead, as well as Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki (Ayesha from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2). Since then, the cast has expanded to include Kenneth Branagh, Clémence Poésy (In Bruges), Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Quicksilver in Avengers: Age of Ultron), and frequent Nolan collaborator Michael Caine. Most recently, the first trailer for Tenet debuted online just last week in a surprise move from Warner Bros., and it included a six-minute prologue preview attached to IMAX screenings of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.APRIL:&nbsp;SHAZAM! 2 TAKES OFF, AND DWAYNE JOHNSON GETS BLACK ADAM GREENLIGHT TOO(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)After this year’s&nbsp;Shazam!&nbsp;had only been in theaters for a week, Warner Bros. went ahead and announced that they were moving forward with plans for a sequel, even despite the film opening much lower ($53 million domestically) than similar movies like Captain Marvel ($153 million)&nbsp;and Aquaman ($67.8 million). We don’t know the premise of the sequel yet, but the mid-credits tease give a clue about the possible villain. A few weeks ago, we learned that Shazam! 2 is now scheduled for release on April 1st, 2022. This news came after Dwayne Johnson’s long-in-development Black Adam movie (based on the popular Shazam! villain) will start filming soon and is scheduled for release on December 22, 2021. The timing suggests that the Black Adam movie might directly lead to Dwayne Johnson also reprising the role in Shazam! 2. Warner Bros. is also directly positioning Shazam! 2 against Marvel movies, as Sony’s Spider-Verse sequel comes out a week later (4/8/2022) and Black Panther II comes out a month later (5/6/2022), followed by&nbsp;DC Super Pets on 5/20/2022.MAY: ROBERT PATTINSON TAKES OVER THE BATMAN(Photo by Dee Cercone/Everett Collection)Although some superhero movies are “slow burns” when it comes to news, others, especially the biggest movies (Avengers, or in this case, Batman) can happen in what feels like a relatively brief amount of time. Specifically, just eight months ago, we knew nothing about who would be in the 2021 reboot The Batman (6/25/2021). That all started to change in mid-May, beginning with the news that the shortlist included Nicholas Hoult and Robert Pattinson, the latter of whom secured the role two weeks later. In the meantime, details started to trickle forth about who the villains in The Batman would be. In September, as the Joker hype express was well under way, it was confirmed that there were no plans&nbsp;for Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker to crossover with Robert Pattinson’s Batman (which is not to say that the Joker won’t be in Batman movies, just not Phoenix’s specific version). Two weeks later, there was talk about Jonah Hill possibly taking on a villain role, which ultimately didn’t work out, as both the Penguin and Riddler went to other actors. In October, Paul Dano (Love and Mercy) landed the role of the Riddler&nbsp;and Zoe Kravitz became the next actress to portray Selina Kyle, A.K.A. Catwoman. Last month, The Batman found two more of its ensemble cast members as Colin Farrell (who also played the villain Bullseye in Daredevil) was cast as the Penguin, and Andy Serkis was cast as Bruce Wayne’s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. And lastly, there was also news last month suggesting that Warner Bros. might give villains like Catwoman, The Penguin, and The Riddler their own Joker-style spinoff movies.JUNE: DISNEY BEGINS CASTING LIVE-ACTION THE LITTLE MERMAID(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images)Walt Disney Pictures has yet to announce a release date (or even a release year) for its live-action remake of The Little Mermaid, but we can be fairly certain that&nbsp;it’s actually happening, because the studio made lots of “splashes” about it this year. Going into July, we had already known for a while that The Little Mermaid will be directed by Rob Marshall&nbsp;as his next Disney project after last year’s Mary Poppins Returns. The casting news started in late June with word that Melissa McCarthy was in early talks to play the evil, tentacled sea witch Ursula. (It’s not yet known if Ursula will be fully CGI, or possibly part live action with animated tentacles.)&nbsp; This was soon followed by the casting of Awkwafina (Ocean’s Eight) and Jacob Tremblay (Room) as the voices of the animated animal characters Scuttle the seagull and Flounder (who’s not a flounder), respectively. Next up — and again, this was all basically in the same week — was the casting of Ariel herself, who will be played by R&amp;B singer Halle Bailey, who, with her sister Chloe,&nbsp;makes up the singing group Chloe x Bailey. For a while, Harry Styles of One Direction was also in talks to play the romantic lead Prince Eric, but that role ultimately went to relatively unknown actor&nbsp;Jonah Hauer-King.JULY:&nbsp;MARVEL MAKES MASSIVE PHASE FOUR ANNOUNCEMENT AT COMIC-CON(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)In recent years, Marvel Studios has sometimes stayed relatively quiet at San Diego Comic-Con, but that was definitely not the case in 2019, when they had arguably the biggest superhero movie news event of all time. Part of the reason for that has to do with the way that Phase Four will involve not just movies, but also various shows on the Disney+ streaming service as well. Without getting into every detail (since doing so would involve a column as long as this one for the entire year), we’ll just mention that the (movie) announcements included: Black Widow (5/1/2020), The Eternals (11/6/2020), Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2/12/2021), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (5/7/2021), Thor: Love and Thunder (11/5/2021), Blade (presumably Phase Five), Fantastic Four (Phase 5), and X-Men (Phase 5). In August, we also found out that Kit Harrington will be joining The Eternals as long-time Avengers member Black Knight, and that Black Panther II is scheduled for May 6, 2022.AUGUST: GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S STAR-STUDDED&nbsp;NIGHTMARE ALLEY CASTS UP(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)After years and years of attempts to get several different projects off the ground, director Guillermo del Toro is ultimately using his post-Shape of Water clout to get something completely different going,&nbsp;namely a remake of the 1947 carnival thriller Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%). By the time August rolled around, seven-time Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper had already been attached for the role originally played by Tyrone Power for&nbsp;some time, but that month, we finally saw the casting of two of his female co-stars. Cate Blanchett, who’s a seven time Academy Award nominee and two time winner (for Blue Jasmine and The Aviator) ultimately landed a key supporting role, while Toni Collette, who received an Academy Award nomination herself for&nbsp;The Sixth Sense, secured the female lead role of the psychiatrist and hypnotist who teams up with Cooper’s carnival con man. Later, in September, a key role also went to Rooney Mara. Fox Searchlight is expected to schedule Nightmare Alley sometime in prime “awards season” in late 2020.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;SONY AND MARVEL COME TO TERMS ON SPIDER-MAN DEAL(Photo by Sony Pictures)You may remember that last summer, there was a big uproar about the fact that talks between Sony Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures (and their Marvel Studios) had fallen apart over future Spider-Man movies starring Tom Holland within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reportedly, Disney and Marvel had wanted a 50% cut of future Spider-Man movies in exchange for Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios working on the movies for Sony. After all of the attention and feedback from the fans, the relevant parties started up talks again, resulting in the big news in September&nbsp;that Sony and Marvel would indeed work together on a third solo Spider-Man film starring Tom Holland,&nbsp;to be released on July 16, 2021 and directed by Jon Watts, who directed the first two. The financial compromise calls for Disney to receive 25% of the film’s profits (leaving 75% for Sony), down from their original request of 50%. As part of the new deal, Tom Holland will also appear as Spider-Man in one more MCU movie, the title and premise of which hasn’t been revealed yet.OCTOBER: JOHN WICK&nbsp;IS GETTING HIS OWN CINEMATIC UNIVERSE(Photo by @ Lionsgate)When John Wick was first released in 2014, it became something of a pop culture phenomenon that helped Keanu Reeves stage a mid-career comeback and led to two sequels (thus far) and continuing box office success. Lionsgate scheduled John Wick: Chapter 4 for release on May 21, 2021 a while ago, and in October, we learned that Lionsgate is not limiting their John Wick plans to just Keanu Reeves movies. Instead, the studio is moving forward with plans for a female-centric John Wick spinoff called Ballerina about “a young female assassin who seeks revenge against the people who killed her family.” Although the premise doesn’t specify a nationality for the Ballerina, there is something of a trope involving Russian ballerinas who become super spies or assassins (mainly we’re thinking here of both Red Sparrow and Marvel’s Black Widow). The Ballerina character was briefly seen in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, played by newcomer Unity Phelan, but it’s possible/likely that another actress will star in Ballerina. And then, earlier this month, Warner Bros. effectively did something huge that raised the profile of John Wick: Chapter 4 at the same time as it directly competed with it, announcing that&nbsp;they had scheduled their own Keanu Reeves sequel, The Matrix 4, for May 21, 2021, the same release date as John Wick: Chapter 4. Both Carrie-Anne Moss and Reeves are attached to return in their roles as Trinity and Neo in&nbsp;that film.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;SPIDER-VERSE 2 AND&nbsp;BLACK PANTHER II ANNOUNCED FOR 2022(Photo by Sony Pictures)As mentioned above, Marvel Studios put on a big, big panel at San Diego Comic-Con this past summer, but the dates were only specific for 2020 and 2021. Since then, Marvel has also announced a release date of May 6, 2022 for Black Panther II, but November’s biggest news story painted an image of 2022 that promises an ambitious slate comparable to that of 2019. Sony Pictures has confirmed plans for a second animated movie starring the Miles Morales version of the web-crawler as seen in last year’s Academy Award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The Spider-Verse sequel is now scheduled for April 8, 2022, just shy of a month before Black Panther II&nbsp;on May 6, 2022. Although they’re not yet dated, two other Marvel movies that might be scheduled for 2022 are the Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali and the Fantastic Four movie mentioned at Comic-Con that would finally bring Stan Lee’s original Marvel super team into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As for what we might see in Spider-Verse 2, the final scenes of the first movie did hint at both Spider-Man 2099 and the finger-pointing Spider-Man ’67.DECEMBER:&nbsp;KUMAIL NANJIANI’S ETERNALS&nbsp; BODY BLOWS UP THE INTERNET LIKE BABY YODA(Photo by @kumailn/Instagram)Like any Marvel Cinematic Universe movie with pretty much an entirely new cast, next year’s The Eternals (11/6/2020) has been the focus of multiple casting news stories this year. Individually, we’re not sure any of them would have been enough to make our list of top stories for the year. And then, Kumail Nanjiani posted the images you can see on his Instagram account. When Nanjiani was first cast in&nbsp;The Eternals, it was probably safe to assume that he would basically look like the Kumail Nanjiani we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in other projects like The Big Sick, Stuber, and HBO’s Silicon Valley, so it was something of a shock to see him looking absolutely shredded.&nbsp;His co-stars in The Eternals&nbsp;include Angelina Jolie (Thena), Salma Hayek (Ajak), Gemma Chan (Sersi), and Game of Thrones stars Richard Madden (Ikaris) and Kit Harrington (The Black Knight), but we haven’t heard yet about whether they’re that buff yet. Also, yeah, this December has been kind of a slow news month.Like this?

The fourth MCU movie on the schedule awaiting release (after Black Widow, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Eternals) will be the not-yet-titled third Spider-Man movie (12/17/2021) starring Tom Holland. Just last week, that movie was the focus of the surprising news&nbsp;that Jamie Foxx will be reprising his role as Electro from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (starring Andrew Garfield, not Tom Holland). We now know that Benedict Cumberbatch will also be appearing in the next Spider-Man as Spidey’s Avengers teammate Doctor Strange, which we’ll actually end up seeing before Cumberbatch’s own sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (3/25/2022). That title, plus the Jamie Foxx news and the recent WandaVision trailer is leading to speculation that the MCU is heading towards some sort of alternate reality, timey-wimey criss-cross of dimensions and properties (Marvel Studios has to get the X-Men and Fantastic Four characters re-introduced at some point,&nbsp;too, after all). In related news, Natalie Portman was also quoted this week about her return as Jane Foster&nbsp;in Thor: Love and Thunder (2/11/2022), which appeared to confirm previous speculation about which popular Marvel Comics storyline the movie will be (at least partly) based on.Other Top Headlines1.&nbsp;A&nbsp;DON’T BREATHE SEQUEL HAS ALREADY BEEN FILMED(Photo by Ghost House Pictures)A few months after the release of the horror thriller Don’t Breathe in 2016, the news first broke that the producers were quickly working on developing a sequel, but it wasn’t until earlier this year that a director had signed on for it. The word at that point was that filming was scheduled to start in April, but that was also before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted pretty much the entire film and television industry. That is, of course, in the United States (and many other places where movies are frequently filmed), but just like the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, movies (sometimes) find a way. It was just last month that we found out that Sacha Baron Cohen had secretly filmed a Borat sequel (which will debut on Amazon), and this week, Stephen Lang took to his Twitter account to reveal that he has wrapped filming of the Don’t Breathe sequel in Belgrade, Serbia. Don’t Breathe 2 was directed by Rodo Sayagues, who served as the screenwriter for director Fede Alvarez on both his Evil Dead remake (Fresh at 62%)&nbsp;and the first Don’t Breathe (Certified Fresh at 88%).2.&nbsp;ALLISON WILLIAMS TO STAR IN BLUMHOUSE THRILLER M3GAN(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)Before 2017, Allison Williams had a few claims to fame, including being one of HBO’s Girls, NBC’s Peter Pan Live!, and anchorman&nbsp; Brian Williams’ daughter, but for many, she is best known as the girlfriend from Jordan Peele’s blockbuster psychological horror film&nbsp;Get Out (Certified Fresh at 98%). That movie was produced by Blumhouse Productions, the company behind such horror and thriller franchises as The Purge, Insidious, Sinister, Happy Death Day, and Paranormal Activity, and recent hit movies like Halloween and The Invisible Man. Allison Williams is set to reunite with Blumhouse on a technology-based horror thriller film called M3GAN whose premise is similar to&nbsp;the recent reboot of&nbsp;Child’s Play. Williams will play a “brilliant roboticist” who invents a “a life-like doll programmed to be a kid’s greatest companion and a parent’s greatest ally.” M3GAN will be directed by Gerard Johnstone (Housebound, Certified Fresh at 95%) from a screenplay by Akela Cooper (one of the producers of Netflix’s Luke Cage), based on a story idea by James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring, Aquaman), who is also co-producing along with Jason Blum. Akela Cooper also co-wrote Wan’s upcoming horror film Malignant, which was filmed pre-COVID-19 and is now awaiting its release, probably sometime in 2021.3.&nbsp;SANDRA OH TO STAR IN SAM RAIMI-PRODUCED HORROR FILM UMMA(Photo by Michael Tackett/©Warner Bros.)Stage 6 Films is a Sony-based production company that since 2008 has given us movies like Don’t Breathe, Robot &amp; Frank, Searching, and the Insidious franchise (co-produced with Blumhouse). This week, Stage 6 made a deal with Sam Raimi’s production company to acquire the rights to a supernatural horror film called Umma, with Sandra Oh attached to star (and serve as the film’s executive producer). “Umma” is the Korean word for “mother,” and the story will depict Oh’s character living on a farm in the U.S. with her daughter until their lives are disrupted by supernatural events following the arrival of her mother’s remains from Korea. Umma will be the first film produced by Sam Raimi under a new deal with Starlight Media, whose recent productions include Crazy Rich Asians and Midway. Sandra Oh&nbsp;currently stars on the BBC America series Killing Eve, for which she won a Golden Globe Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and three Emmy nominations, following ten seasons on Grey’s Anatomy, for which she received five Emmy nominations. Oh’s co-stars in Umma will include Fivel Stewart, MeeWha Alana Lee, Dermot Mulroney, Odeya Rush, and Tom Yi.4. BILLY CRUDUP TO PLAY BARRY ALLEN’S DAD IN THE FLASH(Photo by Julio Macat/©Sony Pictures Classics)By its very nature, Justice League had a huge ensemble cast, but some of the actors were uncredited, including Billy Crudup (who played Dr. Manhattan in director Zack Snyder’s Watchmen) as Henry Allen, the father of Barry Allen, A.K.A.&nbsp;The Flash. We can now report that Crudup will reprise that character&nbsp;in The Flash (11/4/2022), the long-in-development solo movie starring Ezra Miller as the Justice League super speedster. Crudup is actually returning to The Flash after previously being attached to co-star as Harry Allen (in 2015, years before Justice League came out) but then dropping out when that version of the movie was sent back to “development hell.”&nbsp;He is the third male star beside Ezra Miller to be announced for The Flash, following Michael Keaton&nbsp;and Ben Affleck, who will be playing different versions of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The Flash will adapt the popular Flashpoint storyline from the comics, during which the Flash attempts to prevent his mother’s murder, resulting in changes to both time and reality. (The Flashpoint story was also adapted for season 3 of the the CW series The Flash ). It’s not yet known if Billy Crudup’s character will receive more screen time in next year’s HBO Max mini-series Zack Snyder’s Justice League.5.&nbsp;ANDY SAMBERG HEADLINES SUPERHERO STONER COMEDY&nbsp;SUPER HIGH(Photo by ©Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Superhero movies and stoner comedies are some of the most popular films for certain swaths of the moviegoing audience, so it makes a certain kind of sense when the two genres intersect. With that in mind,&nbsp;Andy Samberg, Craig Robinson, and Common are teaming up for a superhero stoner comedy&nbsp;called Super High, which New Line Cinema won the rights to this week following a “competive situation.” Super High will be set in a world where “smoking special weed gives you super powers.” The Super High screenplay will be written by Adam Mansbach, the screenwriter of the 2016 Barack Obama drama Barry (Certified Fresh at 80%), and also the author of the New York Times bestselling book, Go the F*ck to Sleep, and its sequels, You Have to F*cking Eat and F*ck, Now There are Two of You (the audiobooks of which were narrated by Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston, and Larry David).6.&nbsp;CLINT EASTWOOD TO PRODUCE, DIRECT, AND STAR IN&nbsp;CRY MACHO(Photo by Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros.)When Daniel Day-Lewis announced that he was retiring from acting in 2017 after his final film Phantom Thread, he had just recently turned 60 years old. We bring that up because Clint Eastwood just announced this week that he will be starring in the next film he will direct, and he’s currently 90 years old. Put another way, if Clint Eastwood had retired when he was 60 (in 1990), we never would have seen him in movies like Unforgiven, In the Line of Fire, Million Dollar Baby, or Gran Torino. The Warner Bros. movie that Clint Eastwood will be producing, directing, and starring in is an adventure drama called Cry Macho, which is an adaptation of a 1975 novel that has been in development as a screenplay since the early 1970s because author N. Richard Nash actually wrote the book&nbsp;after his initial attempt to sell it as a screenplay.&nbsp;Other actors who were previously attached to star in the film&nbsp;include Roy Scheider in the 1990s and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the early 2010s. In the 1980s, Eastwood himself was also in the running to star, but he decided to make&nbsp;The Dead Pool instead.&nbsp;Cry Macho will tell the story of a “washed-up horse trainer who schemes to make $50,000 by snatching a streetwise Mexican boy from his mother in Mexico City and delivering him to his father — and the trainer’s ex-boss — in Texas.”7. ANGELINA JOLIE AND CHRISTOPH WALTZ TO STAR IN TRAGIC ALS ROMANCE(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)This year’s “awards season” is obviously curtailed a bit because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Hollywood appears to be chugging right along,&nbsp;with various projects that sound like they might be future awards-friendly features. That theme especially applies to Every Note Played, a romantic drama to be produced by STX Films based upon the novel of the same title by Lisa Genova. Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Alita: Battle Angel) is in talks to star in Every Note Played as a famous concert pianist who has been diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s Disease, the same disease that afflicted Stephen Hawking), with Angelina Jolie also in negotiations to play his ex-wife, who assumes the role of his caregiver as his condition worsens. Every Note Played will be directed by Michael Sucsy, whose filmography includes Grey Gardens (Fresh at 88%) and The Vow (Rotten at 31%). In related news, the fantasy adventure Come Away, starring Angelina Jolie and David Oyelowo, was picked up this week by a new distribution company called Relativity Media Studio.8.&nbsp;CAST OF RESIDENT EVIL ORIGIN MOVIE REVEALED(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)In 2002, Milla Jovovich starred in the first live-action movie adapted from the popular Resident Evil video game franchise, and the film’s success led to five more sequels, even as the movies moved farther and farther from both the tone and the plotline of the actual Resident Evil video games. Jovovich and her husband, director Paul W.S. Anderson, have moved on from Resident Evil&nbsp;(taking on another video game franchise with Monster Hunter instead), but the Resident Evil&nbsp;franchise forges ahead. The reboot will start with an origin story that will depict the initial viral outbreak at the Umbrella Corporation in Raccoon City that then leads to the apocalyptic events of the video games (and presumably, future movies with some of the new cast). The reboot draws heavily from Resident Evil for its characters, including Jill Valentine (Hannah John-Kamen), Chris Redfield (Robbie Amell), Claire Redfield (Kaya Scodelario), Leon Kennedy (Avan Jogia), Albert Wesker (Tom Hopper), and William Birkin (Neal McDonough).9. ZOMBIE MOVIE DIRECTOR TAKING ON KID-FRIENDLY THOMAS &amp; FRIENDS TRAIN MOVIE(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/©Paramount Pictures)Marc Forster directed 2013’s zombie thriller World War Z, and the 2016 South Korean zombie horror hit Train to Busan&nbsp;was set on a train; combine the two together and remove the zombies, and what do you get? Probably something along the lines of the next Thomas &amp; Friends&nbsp;movie, which Forster has, for some reason, signed on&nbsp;to direct. Successful directors frequently helm a variety of projects, true, but it’s fun to point out that Thomas the Tank Engine will be brought to us next by the guy who did Machine Gun Preacher.&nbsp;Anyway, Thomas &amp; Friends will be co-produced by the toy and game company Mattel, which is also actively developing movies based on Barbie (probably starring Margot Robbie) and Barney the Dinosaur (produced by Get Out star Daniel Kaluuya).On an Apple device?

If it was the former, however, Sigourney Weaver definitely messed up those plans this week. The original Alien turned 40 last month, so as part of that, Weaver spoke to Parade about it, and also revealed not only that she’s returning as Dana Barrett in the upcoming Ghostbusters movie, but also that “It’s going to be crazy working with the guys again.” Now, we don’t know for sure who “the guys” she’s referring to are, but the way most writers are interpreting it is that she was speaking about the surviving original Ghostbusters. Harold Ramis died in 2014, and Rick Moranis has spoken out repeatedly about why he chose to pass on&nbsp;Ghostbusters. Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Bill Murray, however, already all returned for the 2016 reboot, so they all seem likely to be “the guys” Sigourney Weaver was referencing. Sony Pictures has scheduled Ghostbusters 3&nbsp;for July 10, 2020, up against The Purge 5. The new Ghostbusters cast members will include Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, and Carrie Coon.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN REPLACING DICAPRIO, PART 1:&nbsp;BRADLEY COOPER AND NIGHTMARE ALLEY(Photo by John Baer/Rogue Pictures)We see this more with directors, the most successful of whom frequently have more projects than they can actually make, but there are also some major movie stars who are consistently linked to several films at once. Leonardo DiCaprio is absolutely in that field, and this week, we learned of two of DiCaprio’s former projects going to other actors in his stead. Less that two months ago, the news broke that Leonardo DiCaprio was going to team up with Guillermo del Toro on his first film as director since his Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water. Although an exact reason isn’t being given, DiCaprio’s agents failed to reach a deal with Fox Searchlight for that film, a remake of the creepy 1947 carnival drama Nightmare Alley (Fresh at 100%). Instead, it’s now Bradley Cooper who is in talks for the male lead in Nightmare Alley as a carnival “carnie” who teams up with a female psychiatrist to improve his mentalist act and his ability to rip off people.2.&nbsp;THIS WEEK IN REPLACING DICAPRIO, PART 2:&nbsp;SAM ROCKWELL AND RICHARD JEWELL(Photo by Fox Searchlight)DiCaprio had also previously been attached to star in Clint Eastwood’s next film as director, Richard Jewell (previously titled The Ballad of Richard Jewell), but his role has now gone to Sam Rockwell instead. The title refers to a security guard who discovered a suspicious backpack bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. Rockwell will play Jewell’s defense attorney, and the title role is going to Paul Walter Hauser, who was arguably the breakout star of I, Tonya. (At one point, that role would have gone to Jonah Hill, when he was physically much heavier.)&nbsp;The cast for the film expanded even further this week, though, as Kathy Bates will also be co-starring as Jewell’s mother. In related news, Paul Walter Hauser also signed on this week for a lower profile film, Silk Road, which is also based on a true crime story.3.&nbsp;NETFLIX ADAPTING HIT VIDEO GAME THE DIVISION WITH JESSICA CHASTAIN AND JAKE GYLLENHAAL(Photo by JA, Jason Smith/Everett Collection)There are so many Marvel movies (over 30 if you include the various Sony and Fox movies) that it’s rare to find a big star who hasn’t appeared in at least one of them. Jessica Chastain co-starred as an alien in last week’s Dark Phoenix, and Jake Gyllenhaal will play Mysterio in next month’s Spider-Man: Far from Home, and we now know that they will both headline an upcoming video game movie. Both of them actually joined the movie based on Tom Clancy’s The Division three years ago, but that was so long ago that, until this week, it didn’t seem like a sure thing that either was still attached. The big reveal this week is that Netflix has stepped in to produce and distribute The Division, which will be the next film directed by David Leitch, who’s coming off Certified Fresh action hits in&nbsp;Atomic Blonde (78%) and Deadpool 2 (83%). Tom Clancy’s The Division is an action role-playing game set in New York City following a mass genocide from a viral attack.4.&nbsp;NETFLIX ENLISTS COCO WRITER FOR THEIR TAKE ON CHRONICLES OF NARNIA(Photo by Walt Disney courtesy Everett Collection)Ostensibly inspired by the box office successes of both the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies, Walden Media started adapting C.S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia in 2005 with The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe. That first movie was a box office smash ($745 million globally), but the second (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian) and third (The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) both dropped by nearly half with $419 million and $415 million, respectively. (The third film also dipped the franchise into Rotten territory.) Disney released the first two films, and Fox the third, but nine years later, Netflix now has the rights. To get things started, Netflix has hired screenwriter Matthew Aldrich (who cowrote Pixar’s Coco, Certified Fresh at 97%) to work on their ambitious adaptations of Lewis’ seven novels into both movies and at least one series.5. MELISSA MCCARTHY’S ST. VINCENT REUNION THE STARLING(Photo by JA/Everett Collection)Like many comic actors, Melissa McCarthy frequently dips her cinematic toes into more dramatic fare (like last year’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Certified Fresh at 98%). McCarthy arguably started doing this in 2014 with the “dramedy” St. Vincent (Certified Fresh 77%), co-starring Bill Murray, Naomi Watts, and Chris O’Dowd. St. Vincent was directed by Ted Melfi (Hidden Figures), who had planned to direct a psychiatric dramedy called Fruit Loops (with Woody Harrelson) next, until Disney recently let it go as part of their new Fox plans. Quickly shifting gears, Melfi will instead next direct a tragic comedy&nbsp;called The Starling, with McCarthy and O’Dowd reuniting from St. Vincent as a married couple struggling with grief.6.&nbsp;BO BURNHAM&nbsp;WILL WRITE&nbsp;THE NEW SESAME STREET MOVIE’S SONGS&nbsp;(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Although January is historically seen as a “dump month,” studios have more recently been enjoying success with the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend in mid-January (Glass in 2019, Hidden Figures in 2017, Ride Along 2 in 2016, etc.). Warner Bros. is developing a Sesame Street musical starring Anne Hathaway, and they chose a release date of January 15, 2021 (which would have been MLK’s 92nd birthday) a while back. Filming isn’t expected to start until April of next year, and this week, we found out who will be writing the new Sesame Street songs. That role has gone to comedian-turned-writer-director Bo Burnham, who is coming off a great 2018 after his award-winning feature directorial debut with teen drama Eighth Grade (Certified Fresh at 99%). As pointed out in this piece, Burnham made an early mark on YouTube by performing “raunchy” songs like “My Whole Family Thinks I’m Gay,” but it’s pretty obvious that his Sesame Street songs won’t be like that. Or so we assume.7.&nbsp;CLASSIC HORROR FILM BLACK CHRISTMAS GETTING REMADE (AGAIN)(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)Possibly more than any other genre, horror movies are particularly&nbsp;ripe for remakes, mostly because they can be made relatively affordably with a high potential box office return. In 2006, one such remake was Black Christmas (Rotten at 15%), based on the influential early 1974 slasher of the same title (Fresh at 71%). Both films featured young actresses as sorority house members who later became more famous: Margot Kidder (Superman) in the original film, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, TV’s Fargo) in the remake. Blumhouse Productions and Universal Pictures are rushing to remake Black Christmas again, and the lead actress this time around will be Imogen Poots, who co-starred in 2016’s Green Room. We say “rushing” because Universal has scheduled Black Christmas for just six months from now (December 13, 2019), up against the&nbsp;Jumanji sequel. The updated film will be directed by Sophia Takal, who co-wrote the script with April Wolfe, which gives the remake a unique female perspective that might be exactly the jolt it needs.Rotten Ideas2. KEVIN HART REMAKING BILL MURRAY’S SCROOGED(Photo by Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures)Bill Murray’s zombie comedy The Dead Don’t Die is in theaters this weekend, and he’s all over The Weekly Ketchup as well. This is the third story with Murray connections, following Ghostbusters 3 and The Starling (which is a reunion project for St. Vincent, in which Bill Murray starred). Although they don’t always “hit” financially, remakes remain popular with Hollywood because many of them can be made relatively affordably (compared to say, superhero movies), but still have name brand familiarity. In 1988, Bill Murray starred in Scrooged (Fresh at 70%), which was itself basically a remake (more specificially a reimagination) of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. Well, that remake is going to get a remake, because Kevin Hart is producing and is expected to star in&nbsp;a Scrooged remake for Paramount Pictures. The Scrooged remake does not yet have a screenwriter or director, so it’s probably at least a few Christmases away.1.&nbsp;ANIMATED SPICE GIRLS MOVIE IN THE WORKS(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Last year marked the 20th anniversary of the 1998 Spice Girls movie, Spice World&nbsp;(Rotten at 35%), which unironically had absolutely nothing to do with Frank Herbert’s Dune (melange jokes for the win). As with all mortals, time marches on even for the Spice Girls, but Paramount Pictures has figured out a way to make another Spice Girls movie: animation. All five original Spice Girls members are signed on to star in the new animated film, which will feature both their hit songs and new songs as well. The Spice Girls movie is part of a new Paramount Animation slate&nbsp;that aims to release two movies a year, starting in 2020 with The SpongeBob Movie: It’s a Wonderful Sponge (5/22/2020) and the comic book adaptation Rumble (7/31/2020). Paramount is also still developing an animated Mighty Mouse movie. This story isn’t the week’s Rotten Idea for those films, however, but because of&nbsp;Spice World‘s Tomatometer score.Like this?

Meanwhile, another player (from another sport) continues to make the news as he transitions from Cleveland to Los Angeles, creating a lot of sweet movie deals in the process. LeBron James doesn’t make his Lakers debut until October 18th, but he already has 10 projects in development in both TV and film. The highest profile of these has, for a few years now (since 2015), been the planned Space Jam sequel, teaming James with the various Looney Tunes characters the same way Michael Jordan did in the 1996 family film. To get things going, LeBron is&nbsp;working with Ryan Coogler, the director of Black Panther and&nbsp;Creed, who will serve as one of the producers on Space Jam 2. Terence Nance of HBO’s Random Acts of Flyness will direct Space Jam 2 when it starts filming in 2019 after the&nbsp;upcoming NBA season ends. Warner Bros. will distribute Space Jam 2&nbsp;probably in 2020. It’s not yet known what other current NBA stars LeBron James is hoping to recruit to join him and the returning Looney Tunes all-stars (or who might be the “Bill Murray,” if not the actor himself).Fresh Developments1. THIS WEEK IN MARVEL: THE ETERNALS, TV SHOWS FOR LOKI AND SCARLET WITCH, AND KEVIN FEIGE OVERSEEING X-MEN(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel Studios is such a force to be reckoned with that, in some weeks,&nbsp;they could easily&nbsp;dominate half the Weekly Ketchup. This week, we’re going to group all of the Marvel news into one story. We’ll start with the just-breaking news that the summer-long director search for The Eternals has settled upon indie film director Chloe Zhao (The Rider, Songs My Brothers Taught Me). Zhao is following a similar path as previous Marvel choices (like the directors of Thor: Ragnarok and next year’s Captain Marvel). Her take on The Eternals will reportedly focus on a romance between Ikaris and Sersi (who, in the comics, was a longtime member of the Avengers in the 1990s). We also learned from Disney CEO Bob Iger this week&nbsp;that Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige will oversee Fox’s various Marvel properties (X-Men, Fantastic Four, etc) going forward. On the (streaming) TV front, Marvel and Disney are also now preparing spinoff solo shows for both Loki and Scarlet Witch (it’s unknown if they will be prequels or sequels to the movies). Those shows on Disney’s upcoming streaming service are separate from ABC, which is reportedly developing a “female Marvel superheroes” series that is being written by Allan Heinberg (Wonder Woman). On top of that, there was also that big first trailer for next year’s Captain Marvel&nbsp;(3/8/2019), and all of the things that we think we may have learned from it.2.&nbsp;JAMES BOND 25 WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE SERIES WITH AN AMERICAN DIRECTOR(Photo by James Atoa/Everett Collection)Over the course of the 24 “official” James Bond films to date, there have been many different takes on the character and the franchise, and several different actors playing him as well, including Daniel Craig, who is returning for James Bond 25. One constant, however, has been that the movies have always been directed by Brits. That all changed this week with the news that the search to replace Danny Boyle has ended with the hiring of director Cary Fukunaga (Jane Eyre, Sin Nombre; HBO’s True Detective), who was at one point attached to direct last year’s horror hit IT (he retained a writing credit on that film). James Bond 25 had been scheduled for 2019, but that was delayed when Boyle departed as director. With Fukunaga hired, James Bond 25 is now scheduled for release&nbsp;on February 14th, Valentine’s Day, 2020. It’s not yet known if that date was chosen because of any inherent romantic plot or if it’s just an example of counter-programming. The other major sequel currently scheduled for February 14, 2020 is Reese Witherspoon’s Legally Blonde 3. Other directors that had been previously mentioned as possibilities were Edgar Wright (Baby Driver), Jean-Marc Vallee (Dallas Buyers Club), and Yann Demange (White Boy Rick). It’s also not known if Said Taghmaoui (Wonder Woman) will still be cast as one of the James Bond 25 villains.3. MICHAEL B. JORDAN RECRUITED FOR TOM CLANCY’S RAINBOW SIX FRANCHISE(Photo by Marvel Studios)It was just last week that Michael B. Jordan’s (Creed, Black Panther) name was floated out as a possible Superman replacement following Henry Cavill’s likely departure. This week, however, we learned that it’s a very different franchise that Michael B. Jordan is now joining, with the news that he’s signed with Paramount to star in a new series inspired by novels by Tom Clancy. Clancy’s most famous movie character is Jack Ryan, but there have long been plans to also adapt another character, CIA operative John Clark. Clark has been a supporting character in the past (played by both Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber), but Michael B. Jordan’s take on the character will be clearly in a lead role. The plan is reportedly to start with an “origin story” adaptation of Without Remorse, which would then be followed by an adaptation of Rainbow Six, which has already become a popular video game series.4.&nbsp;PATRICK STEWART ALSO PLAYING A BOSLEY IN CHARLIE’S ANGELS REBOOT(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)As details emerged about Elizabeth Banks’ planned reboot of Charlie’s Angels, one of the changes was that the Townsend Agency is now an international “security and intelligence service.” This week, we learned that this means that each location will also have its own “Bosley,” with Elizabeth Banks playing one, and an esteemed Star Trek and X-Men actor playing another. That actor is Patrick Stewart, whom we learned last month&nbsp;has also signed on to reprise his role of Jean-Luc Picard in an upcoming new Star Trek series. The three new Angels that Banks and Stewart will be playing Bosleys to were already announced as being Kristen Stewart (Twilight), Naomi Scott (Disney’s new Jasmine in next year’s Aladdin), and newcomer Ella Balinska. Sony Pictures has scheduled this new Charlie’s Angels reboot for a year from next week, on September 27, 2019.5. DC COMICS MOVIES BIRDS OF PREY AND JOKER CASTING UP(Photo by Kerry Hayes/EuropaCorp USA, Chuck Zlotnick/Focus Features)Last week’s big movies concerning DC Comics movies had to do with the likely departures of Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck as Superman and Batman. That doesn’t mean, however, that the studio is slowing down, as other projects continue to be developed and produced at a faster pace than they had been previously. Aquaman and Shazam! (via New Line Cinema) are both wrapped, and Wonder Woman 1984 and Joker are both filming, with Birds of Prey and The Flash in preproduction. Margot Robbie is already signed and announced to reprise her role as Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey, but that leaves her teammates Black Canary, Huntress, and Detective Renee Montoya yet to be cast. Warner Bros is now testing actresses for each role, with the goal being to sign them by September 30th, so they can train for the January start of filming. The Black Canary actresses include Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle, A Wrinkle in Time) and Jurnee Smolett-Bell (TV’s Underground), and possibly Janelle Monáe (Hidden Figures) as well. For Huntress, Warner Bros is considering Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, Scott Pilgrim vs the World), Margaret Qualley (HBO’s The Leftovers), and Cristin Milioti (whose Star Trek-inspired Black Mirror episode won an Emmy this week). Justina Machado, who stars in Netflix’s One Day at a Time reboot, is one of the actresses who tested for Renee Montoya. In other casting news, Warner Bros has also cast Shea Whigham (Boardwalk Empire) in Joker, and has replaced Alec Baldwin as Batman’s father Thomas Wayne with LOST costar Brett Cullen.6.&nbsp;JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT AND&nbsp;JAMIE FOXX GETTING CATFISH-ED BY NETFLIX(Photo by Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment, Ron Batzdorff/New Line Cinema)Although the 2010 documentary (and related TV show spinoff) Catfish became part of the decade’s new lingo, that film’s directors otherwise mostly produce horror and thriller films like Paranormal Activity 4 and 2016’s Nerve. Like many directors, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman are making the transition to Netflix, where they will direct an untitled science fiction movie about “a drug epidemic that gives people a range of superpowers.” The film sounds like it has an ensemble cast, with a female lead yet to be cast, but this week, both Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt signed on for roles. Jamie Foxx will play “a family man who has suffered a great loss and is desperate to trace the drug’s supply line and find its designer,” while JGL will play “a beat cop who takes law enforcement matters into his own hand.” Hopefully, this take on superpowers from the Catfish directors will earn a better Tomatometer score than recent similar Netflix movies like Bright (27%) and The Cloverfield Paradox (17%).7.&nbsp;AUBREY PLAZA AND BRIAN TYREE HENRY JOIN&nbsp;CHILD’S PLAY REBOOT(Photo by FilmDistrict courtesy Everett Collection, Curtis Baker/FX)MGM has one of the oldest and largest back catalogs still operating in Hollywood, and for the past decade, much of their output has been reboots and remakes of old titles. Since 2008, that has included The Taking of Pelham 123, Fame, Carrie, Hercules, Poltergeist, Ben-Hur, RoboCop, The Magnificent Seven, Death Wish, Tomb Raider, Overboard, and next month’s A Star is Born. Well, MGM apparently isn’t going to stop doing this anytime soon, with the news this week that production will soon start on the remake of the 1988 horror hit Child’s Play, which led to the five movies of the “Chucky” series. Child star Gabriel Bateman will be Chucky’s new friend, Aubrey Plaza (Legion, Parks and Recreation) will play his mom, and they’ll also be joined by Atlanta co-star Brian Tyree Henry. The Child’s Play reboot is being directed by Norway’s Lars Klevberg (Polaroid), and you can see the first glimpse at the new Chucky doll right here. The first&nbsp;Child’s Play&nbsp;was&nbsp;Fresh&nbsp;at&nbsp;67%, and though the sequels were all Rotten in the 23%-46% range, this remake offers an opportunity to right the ship, and the cast is a promising start.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK2.&nbsp;EDDIE MURPHY’S OLD ENOUGH NOW TO STAR IN GRUMPY OLD MEN?(Photo by Bruce McBroom/DreamWorks)If you want another clue that Hollywood’s definition of “old” isn’t necessarily the same as most everyone else’s, consider this week’s news about a planned return to Grumpy Old Men. When that film came out in 1993, its stars were 68-year-old Jack Lemmon and 73-year-old Walter Matthau. Even if one allows for a few years before the film is actually produced, Eddie Murphy is currently only 57.&nbsp; Of course, Murphy has played characters of all ages (such as in Nutty Professor II: The Klumps) in the past, so perhaps that’s what’s going on here. The Hollywood Reporter is calling the planned reboot a remake of Grumpy Old Men, while Variety says it’s just “inspired by” it, as does&nbsp;Deadline. Eddie Murphy’s director on&nbsp;the movie will be Tim Story, whose Tomatometer has been entirely Rotten since 2002’s Barbershop (if one doesn’t count Kevin Hart concert films).1.&nbsp;BRYAN SINGER&nbsp;MAY NEXT DIRECT RED SONJA REMAKE(Photo by Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Last December, director Bryan Singer (X-Men, The Usual Suspects) was fired by 20th Century Fox from their Freddy Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, reportedly because he repeatedly didn’t show up to set. In the same week, however, there were also reports about a lawsuit related to sexual assault allegations from 2003. Eventually, Singer’s directing credit on Bohemian Rhapsody was confirmed, and the film is still scheduled for November 2nd, 2018. Millennium Films is now reportedly in talks&nbsp;with Singer for their remake of Red Sonja (15%), which has been in development for over a decade now. (Coincidentally, Rose McGowan, who is one of the key figures behind the #metoo movement was once attached to co-star in Red Sonja). The blog reactions were uniform this week, including from sources like Collider and SyFy Wire. We’re just going to say that a remake of a 15% misfire like Red Sonja is a “Rotten Idea” anyway.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cinemax, telelvision, Arts, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/22133753/Space-Jam-2-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"lebron-james-teams-up-with-ryan-coogler-for-space-jam-2-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509187606902","title":"Chris Evans Is Done With Captain America After Avengers 4, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Chris Evans Is Done With Captain America After Avengers 4, and More Movie NewsThe Conjuring inspires another spinoff, Michael Bay leaves as Transformers director, and we'll get new biopics for Dock Ellis and 2 Live Crew.by Greg Dean Schmitz | June 16, 2017 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Avengers 4, The Crooked Man, X-Men: Dark Phoenix, and new biopics about Dock Ellis and 2 Live Crew.This WEEK’S TOP STORYCHRIS EVANS HANGING UP CAPTAIN AMERICA’S SHIELD AFTER AVENGERS 4 IN 2019(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Earlier this year, there was some intimation from Chris Evans that he might soon be hanging up his shield as Marvel’s Captain America. However, there were also statements — like this —&nbsp;that&nbsp;muddied the waters. Now two months later, Chris Evans is speaking more authoritatively on the issue, confirming the fourth Avengers movie (May 3, 2019) will be his last film as Captain America. &nbsp;“I had six films in my Marvel contract, so I could have said after the third Avengers I was done, but they wanted to make the third and fourth Avengers films as a two-parter,” Evans said. “They said they had so many other characters to fit in…&nbsp;and couldn’t get them all into one movie. [I agreed] because it made sense. It’s going to wrap everything up.” (Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is scheduled for release in between Avengers: Infinity War and the fourth Avengers movie on March 8, 2019.)Fresh Developments1. JESSICA CHASTAIN IN TALKS TO CO-STAR&nbsp;IN X-MEN: DARK PHOENIX(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures)In 2006, when Fox adapted the fan favorite Dark Phoenix Saga from 1980 as&nbsp;X-Men: The Last Stand, broad changes were made, including the deaths of two major characters, and the absence of any of the&nbsp;cosmic characters and settings in the comics. Fox is now preparing to retell the story as X-Men: Dark Phoenix (11/2/18), and Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty,&nbsp;Interstellar) is&nbsp;in talks to co-star as Empress Lilandra of the Shi’ar Empire, described as the&nbsp;film’s “villain.” We’ve put that word in quotes because in the comics, Lilandra not only becomes an X-Men ally, but after a lengthy romance, she marries Professor X! Speaking of Charles Xavier, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, and other recent X-Men cast members are in talks to return for Dark Phoenix (Evan Peters as Quicksilver is a notable exception), which will be directed by Simon Kinberg. Game of Thrones‘s Sophie Turner is set to star&nbsp;in X-Men: Dark Phoenix&nbsp;as the titular character.2. THE CONJURING GETS THIRD HORROR SPINOFF THE CROOKED MAN(Photo by New Line Cinema)As other studios are struggling to set up their own “cinematic universes” — The Mummy and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&nbsp;come to mind — New Line Cinema appears to be building one more organically. The studio&nbsp;first spun off Annabelle from The Conjuring (its sequel,&nbsp;Annabelle: Creation, opens in August), and a second spinoff called&nbsp;The Nun is scheduled for next summer, on July 13, 2018. In last year’s&nbsp;The Conjuring 2, Patrick Wilson’s Ed Warren (based on a real-life paranormal researcher) experiences a terrifying encounter&nbsp;with a creature called the “Crooked Man,” and we now know that, like Annabelle and&nbsp;The Nun,&nbsp;The Crooked Man will be getting his own film. New Line Cinema has hired screenwriter Mike Van Waes, who is also working on a Wizard of Oz horror movie (yes, really), to write it.&nbsp;The Crooked Man doesn’t have a director or a release date yet, but we’d guess that it could be out sometime in 2019.3.&nbsp;TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT WILL BE MICHAEL BAY’S LAST TRANSFORMERS (AS DIRECTOR)(Photo by Michael Germana/Everett Collection)After four movies with Rotten Tomatometer scores, we generally include Transformers news in the “Rotten Ideas of the Week”. All of the franchise’s films thus far have been&nbsp;directed by Michael Bay, who, with the exception of 1996’s The Rock, has an even longer streak of Rotten scores. So, why would we suddenly include a&nbsp;Transformers-related story in&nbsp;“Fresh Developments”? Earlier today, Fandango.com published a series of video interviews with Michael Bay in which he confirmed that, after Transformers: The Last Knight, he will be stepping away from the franchise as a director (he will continue to produce them for Paramount). Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) will direct next summer’s Bumblebee spinoff (starring Hailee Steinfeld and opening on 6/8/18), but Paramount has yet to announce a director for Transformers 6, which is scheduled for release on June 28, 2019.4. SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING STAR TOM HOLLAND “ACCIDENTALLY” CONFIRMS TRILOGY PLANS(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures)We’ve known for a while that Marvel Studios signed Tom Holland for six movies when he was cast to play the new Spider-Man in last year’s Captain America: Civil War and this summer’s Spider-Man: Homecoming. Considering Marvel has made (or will soon make) trilogies for a number of its characters, this week’s news should surprise pretty much no one. While talking to a reporter in France, Tom Holland “accidentally” confirmed that there will be a third Spider-Man movie, saying, “There will be a Spider-Man 2 and 3… yeah well, now you know, sorry Marvel. Whoops!” (Of course, that could have been completely planned.) Holland will play Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Homecoming (7/7/17), next year’s Avengers: Infinity War (5/4/18), and 2019’s untitled Avengers 4.5. CLASSIC BATMAN COMPOSER DANNY ELFMAN TAKES OVER JUSTICE LEAGUE SCORE(Photo by Steven Ferdman/Everett Collection)Earlier this year, we learned through a series of revelations that Joss Whedon (Marvel’s Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron) was moving on to direct DC Comics adaptations for Warner Bros. In addition to an eventual Batgirl movie, Whedon will first take over for director Zack Snyder on this November’s Justice League, following an unfortunate tragedy in Snyder’s family. Although it’s not the way&nbsp;anyone would have wanted it to happen, Whedon’s move to Warner Bros seems to be bringing a change in tone. After the success of Wonder Woman, the five keywords for DC Comics movies will reportedly be&nbsp;“heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism.” We also learned composer Tom Holkenborg, aka Junkie XL (Mad Max: Fury Road, Deadpool), has left Justice League, and in his place, the film will now be scored by Danny Elfman, who might be most famous for his work with&nbsp;Tim Burton and the theme song of&nbsp;The Simpsons.6. ICE CUBE AND SON TO COLLABORATE ON DOCK ELLIS BIOPIC(Photo by Warner Bros.)Even if you’re not a sports fan, you may have heard the story of baseball pitcher Dock Ellis. On June 12, 1970, while pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Dock Ellis threw a no-hitter, which is a very rare, very difficult feat, but made all the more remarkable by his (admittedly disputed) admission years later that he was high on LSD at the time. It’s so remarkable, in fact, that someone was bound to make a movie about it, and that someone is rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, aka O’Shea Jackson, who has signed on to&nbsp;produce a Dock Ellis biopic with his son O’Shea Jackson Jr. attached to star as Ellis. The younger&nbsp;Jackson starred in 2015’s hit biopic Straight Outta Compton, playing his father. Dock Ellis died in 2008 at the age of 63 after struggling with liver disease.7. MICHELLE MONAGHAN TO RETURN TO THE FRANCHISE WITH&nbsp;MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Much has been made this week of the&nbsp;box office disappointment&nbsp;of&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;(domestically, at least), but it’s not all doom and gloom for Tom Cruise’s future. The trailer for his awards season release&nbsp;American Made&nbsp;(9/29/17)&nbsp;came out recently, he’s&nbsp;been talking up&nbsp;Top Gun: Maverick, and he’s&nbsp;signed to star in the&nbsp;Edge of Tomorrow&nbsp;sequel&nbsp;Live Die Repeat and Repeat. That would be a lot for most movie stars, and yet, there’s more. Cruise recently began filming of the sixth&nbsp;Mission: Impossible&nbsp;movie (7/27/18), and this week, we learned the cast&nbsp;will feature the return of a fan favorite. After co-starring in&nbsp;MI:3&nbsp;and popping up in a cameo in&nbsp;MI: Ghost Protocol,&nbsp;Michelle Monaghan&nbsp;is now confirmed&nbsp;to return for&nbsp;Mission: Impossible 6. Monaghan joins a cast that includes new addition Henry Cavill and returning cast members Alec Baldwin, Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, and Ving Rhames.8. 2 LIVE CREW TO BE NEXT RAP PHENOMENON WITH ITS OWN BIOPIC, THE BOOK OF LUKE(Photo by Dimension Films courtesy Everett Collection)Following the success 2015’s N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton, we’ve heard some&nbsp;plans for other biopics based on famous rappers (like this week’s All Eyez on Me, and its 27 percent Tomatometer score). Next up&nbsp;is Luther Campbell (and 2 Live Crew), with a project at Lionsgate called The Book of Luke. RJ Cyler, who played the Blue Ranger in this year’s Power Rangers, will play Campbell in this film, which is expected to focus on the precedent-setting legal battle that took&nbsp;2 Live Crew all the way to the Supreme Court. Biopics are commonly made posthumously — the aforementioned Tupac Shakur, for example, and The Notorious B.I.G., the subject of 2009’s Notorious —&nbsp;but just for the record, Luther Campbell is still very much alive.&nbsp;Until recently, the once-controversial recording artist was&nbsp;coaching high school football in Miami.ROTTEN IDEA OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;DODGEBALL DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR CANNONBALL RUN REMAKEA&nbsp;little over a year ago, we heard about Warner Bros.’ plans to remake the 1981 hit comedy The Cannonball Run, and at the time, Get Hard writer/director Etan Cohen was attached to it.&nbsp;As of this week, though, Warner Bros. has attracted a new screenwriting team and a new director. Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant (of the Night at the Museum franchise) are now in talks to pen&nbsp;the Cannonball Run remake, as is director Rawson Thurber (Central Intelligence, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story). The original Cannonball Run&nbsp;(which received a sequel in 1984) was an ensemble comedy about assorted teams racing across the United States — think It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World or&nbsp;Rat Race —&nbsp;that featured such stars as Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, the recently departed Sir Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr.&nbsp;It’s also remembered today for being one of the first movies with an extended “gag reel” during the credits (which you can watch right here).","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Society, awards, Hulu, Film, Pop, Hallmark, science","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/16163740/Chris-Evans-Captain-America-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"chris-evans-is-done-with-captain-america-after-avengers-4-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509185882471","title":"Thor: Ragnarok Director Wanted for Live-Action Akira, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Thor: Ragnarok Director Wanted for Live-Action Akira, and More Movie NewsLinda Hamilton returns to the Terminator franchise, and new roles for Tom Hanks, Gal Gadot, Bradley Cooper, Elisabeth Moss, and Matt Damon.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 22, 2017 |  CommentsToday’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next), covering such titles as Akira, The Croods 2, Terminator 6, and new roles for Gal Gadot, Matt Damon and Tom Hanks.This WEEK’S TOP STORYTHOR: RAGNAROK DIRECTOR TO BRING ANIME CLASSIC AKIRA TO LIFE(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)The trailers for this November’s Thor: Ragnarok (11/3/17) promise a colorful, kaleidoscopic adventure hybrid of fantasy, science fiction, and obviously, superheroism. The director responsible is New Zealand’s Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople), and his&nbsp;talent has attracted the attention of Warner Bros., who have&nbsp;long been trying to get a live-action remake of Akira going. Waititi is now in talks to direct an adaptation of the long-running manga, intended to be two films, each adapting three of the classic manga books. The Akira manga was previously adapted as a 1988 anime film&nbsp;which now regularly appears on “greatest movies of all time” lists. Warner Bros.’ ongoing efforts have led to some controversy.Fresh Developments1.&nbsp;THE CROODS SEQUEL IS STILL EVOLVING AFTER ALL(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Nearly a year ago, there were reports that DreamWorks Animation had pulled the plug on plans for a sequel to their 2013 animated caveman hit The Croods (71% on the Tomatometer), which was, at one point, scheduled for this coming December 22. Well, fans of The Croods can celebrate again, because DreamWorks has put The Croods 2 back into production. The new release date for The Croods 2 is September 18, 2020, with Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, Catherine Keener, Ryan Reynolds, and the rest expected to return. DreamWorks has also scheduled an animated Blumhouse movie called Spooky Jack for a year later, on September 17, 2021.2. TOM HANKS TO STAR IN REMAKE OF SWEDISH HIT A MAN CALLED OVE(Photo by Jaap Buitendijk/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)There is something of an ongoing “golden age” in publishing for Scandinavian authors like Jo Nesbo (The Snowman), and the late Stieg Larsson’s continuing Millennium series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, etc). Similarly,&nbsp;Fredrik Backman’s novel&nbsp;A Man Called Ove&nbsp;was adapted into&nbsp;a hit 2015 film. Since the release of the film, the novel’s English language adaptation has become a&nbsp;best-seller in the USA. The story, about a curmudgeonly man whose heart of ice is thawed by new neighbors, is&nbsp;about to reach an even larger audience, as Tom Hanks has come on board to both produce and star in a new English-language film adaptation of A Man Called Ove.3. MATT DAMON TO PLAY NOTORIOUS CONMAN&nbsp;IN CHARLATAN(Photo by Paramount Pictures)As we near the heat of this year’s “awards season,” Matt Damon finds himself&nbsp;starring in movies from two directors associated with 2011’s The Descendants. That film’s director, Alexander Payne, has the upcoming sci-fi satire Downsizing, while its star, George Clooney, directed the crime drama Suburbicon from a screenplay co-written by the Coen brothers. One of Damon’s next films will be called Charlatan, adapting the true story of early 20th century conman John R. Brinkley, as told in the bestselling 2008 book Charlatan: America’s Most Dangerous Huckster, the Man Who Pursued Him, and the Age of Flimflam.&nbsp;Decades before pills like Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis, Brinkley pretended to be a doctor who could cure male impotence by surgically transplanting goat testicles into his unsuspecting patients.4.&nbsp;THE HANDMAID’S TALE STAR ELISABETH MOSS JOINS ABORTION DRAMA CALL JANE(Photo by Take Five/Hulu)Elisabeth Moss won the Emm for Best Actress in a Drama on Sunday night for her role in The Handmaid’s Tale, and by Monday, she had landed her next major film role. Moss will star in Call Jane, an indie drama set in 1960s Chicago about an underground initiative called the&nbsp;Jane Collective, which provided abortions to women in the years before the Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973. Call Jane will be directed by Simon Curtis, whose previous films based on true stories have included My Week with Marilyn, Woman in Gold, and the upcoming Winnie the Pooh film Goodbye Christopher Robin.ROTTEN IDEAS OF THE WEEK5.&nbsp;WONDER WOMAN STAR GAL GADOT JOINS BRADLEY COOPER DEEPER UNDERWATER(Photo by Giles Keyte/Universal Pictures, John Baer/Rogue Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It’s becoming increasingly difficult to find major movie stars who haven’t joined a&nbsp;superhero franchise at some point in their careers.&nbsp;This story, for example, involves DC’s Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot, and Bradley Cooper, the voice of Marvel’s Rocket [Raccoon] from Guardians of the Galaxy. Gadot is in early talks with MGM to co-star in an underwater thriller called Deeper, in which Cooper is attached to star “as a disgraced astronaut who is on a deep-sea dive exploring a newly discovered trench but soon finds himself confronted by a sinister and dangerous force.” We’re calling Deeper a “Rotten Idea” because of screenwriter Max Landis’ long string of Rotten Tomatometer scores,&nbsp;among other things related to Max Landis.4. MARK WAHLBERG REUNITES WITH DADDY’S HOME DIRECTOR FOR&nbsp;INSTANT FAMILY(Photo by Patti Perret/Paramount Pictures)Mark Wahlberg’s 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home (with Will Ferrell) earned a Rotten score of just 31%, and some of the reactions to the Daddy’s Home 2 trailer have been sort of borderline vicious&nbsp;(NSFW). Even so, Mark Wahlberg appears to be perfectly happy with the work relationship with Sean Anders, because he will work with the Daddy’s Home franchise director on another similar “family” comedy. The project is called Instant Family, and the premise involves a couple who decide to use the foster children system to create a family for themselves overnight.3. DAVE BAUTISTA TO CO-STAR IN TWO ESCAPE PLAN SEQUELS WITH SYLVESTER STALLONE(Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Earlier this year, the news broke that Dave Bautista (Marvel’s Drax) would be joining his Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 costar Sylvester Stallone in a sequel to 2013’s Escape Plan (49% on Rotten Tomatoes). That movie, now called Escape Plan 2: Hades, isn’t expected to be released until sometime in 2018, but Escape Plan 3 has already started filming. Dave Bautista will be returning for Escape Plan 3: Devil’s Station as well, and he will be joined by franchise newcomers Jaime King and China’s Max Zhang.2. KINGSMAN DIRECTOR BLAMES FLASH GORDON ON MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Director Matthew Vaughn’s new film Kingsman: The Golden Circle (49% on Rotten Tomatoes) comes out this weekend, and so he’s doing all of the usual rounds of press. Speaking to Collider, Matthew Vaughn was asked about his planned remake of Flash Gordon, and he had a surprising reaction. Vaughn said, “For me, the only problem with Flash Gordon is Guardians [of the Galaxy] kind of stole what I would have liked to have done with it.” Matthew Vaughn joined the Flash Gordon reboot in 2015, after the 2014 release of the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out in 2014, so ostensibly, he’s referring to something that happened in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Might his plan for Flash Gordon&nbsp;have involved Ming the Merciless being his dad or something? Or was there something more obvious that Marvel “stole” from Flash Gordon?1. LINDA HAMILTON WILL BE BACK FOR THIRD TERMINATOR REBOOTWhen 2015’s Terminator: Genisys barely made more than half its production budget in the USA ($89 million vs $155 million), the second attempt at a reboot seemed to be the end of the Terminator franchise. Even so, talk of a Terminator 6 lingered in the last two years (mostly from Arnold Schwarzenegger). On Tuesday (in an event that was teased online last week), James Cameron announced that he will producing a sixth Terminator movie (the third reboot), which will feature the return of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. About 60-year-old Linda Hamilton headlining Terminator 6, James Cameron said, “There are 50-year-old, 60-year-old guys out there killing bad guys… but there isn’t an example of that for women.” We’re calling this the Rotten Idea of the Week based on the Tomatometer scores&nbsp;and box office results of the last two Terminator movies.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Red, Arts, archives, streaming, Academy, Premiere, Max, Amazon, Esquire, Black, cinemax, scorecard, spain","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/22142030/Taika-Waititi-Akira-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"thor-ragnarok-director-wanted-for-live-action-akira-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509179211045","title":"Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2018","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Yearly Ketchup: The Freshest Movie Development News of 2018A month-by-month round-up of the best news to come out of Hollywood this year.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 28, 2018 |  CommentsFew industries enjoy taking really, really long extended holiday vacations quite like Hollywood, and when we get to this time of the year, there’s rarely much in the realm of “movie development news” to discuss. So, this week and next, we’re going to review 12 of the year’s top stories, presented to you in monthly chronology. The year-in-review begins with the “Fresh Developments” which here also serve (mostly) as the “Top Stories” of the year.JANUARY:&nbsp;BLACK WIDOW&nbsp;MOVIE FINALLY&nbsp;ANNOUNCED(Photo by Marvel Studios)Marvel Studios hasn’t had a big slate announcement since 2014, and we didn’t get one in 2018 either, but project-by-project, this may have been the biggest such year since. It started in January with confirmation that a solo Black Widow was now, finally, in development. Black Widow continued to receive a steady stream of news stories, as the director shortlist started at 60 in May, was narrowed in June to just three, and led up to Australian director Cate Shortland landing the job in July. We also learned in October that Scarlett Johansson will receive a $15 million pay equity with her male co-stars&nbsp;for Black Widow, in the same week that Black Panther 2 moved forward in development. Other Marvel Studios movies that made the news this year included Ms. Marvel (A.K.A. Kamala Khan), The Eternals, and earlier in December, both Doctor Strange 2, and Shang-Chi: Master of Kung-Fu. &nbsp;FEBRUARY:&nbsp;GAME OF THRONES SHOWRUNNERS GET THEIR OWN STAR WARS PROJECTS&nbsp;(Photo by Steve Granitz/Getty Images)Just a few months after the November, 2017 news that Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson was developing a new Star Wars trilogy (after next year’s Star Wars: Episode IX), we learned about another set in February. David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the showrunners of HBO’s popular Game of Thrones, are now writing and producing at least one film, a trilogy, or several films in the Star Wars universe, though the nature of their project has yet to be&nbsp;confirmed. Having said that, the popular rumor as of this writing suggests movies based on the popular Knights of the Old Republic setting, which is best known for inspiring a series of video games. Something that we didn’t know in February (and Lucasfilm and Disney probably didn’t know this either) was that Solo: A Star Wars Story would turn out to be a box office disappointment, prompting Disney to slow down or outright cancel most of their “prequel spinoff” Star Wars Story projects. That development presumably puts the new Rian Johnson and Benioff/Weiss projects even closer to production than they have otherwise been.MARCH:&nbsp;AVA DUVERNAY&nbsp;INVOKES DC COMICS’ THE NEW GODS&nbsp;(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Paramount Pictures)In late 2017, director Ava DuVernay (Selma, A Wrinkle in Time) revealed on Twitter that her favorite superhero was Big Barda of DC’s New Gods, a comic created by former Marvel artist and Stan Lee collaborator Jack Kirby. In March, we learned that she may have been teasing talks that she had either started or was considering having, because DuVernay is now developing a New Gods movie. Warner Bros. attempted to develop an animated New Gods movie back in the late 1990s, and though the project was never realized, it now looks like it’ll happen after all, and the studio has brought DuVernay on board to direct it. No screenwriter has been named yet, but Warner Bros. will obviously be making that next hiring a priority. This piece suggests why Ava Duvernay is potentially a great choice for The New Gods, and this one explains who some of these characters are, exactly.APRIL:&nbsp;A BIG YEAR FOR STEVEN SPIELBERG: BLACKHAWK, INDIANA JONES 5, WEST SIDE STORY, THE COLOR PURPLE(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Director Steven Spielberg had a huge year in announcements, partly buoyed by the Certified Fresh release of Ready Player One in March. It actually started off in January with confirmation of his (previously already talked about) plans for Indiana Jones 5 and his remake of West Side Story. The first big new project this year, though, came in April, when Spielberg started development at Warner Bros. of a Blackhawk movie, based on the long-running comic about a squad of World War II pilot-adventurers. West Side Story also had a few big casting announcements this year, including Ansel Elgort as Tony, and original West Side Story star Rita Moreno, not as Anita, but as a reimagined take on neighborhood shopkeeper “Doc.” We also found out last month that Steven Spielberg is partnering with Oprah Winfrey on a musical remake of The Color Purple.MAY:&nbsp;ANNABELLE: CREATION AND HAPPY DEATH DAY&nbsp;SEQUELS ANNOUNCED(Photo by New Line Cinema)Superhero movies (like Avengers: Infinity War and Aquaman) are obviously crushing it right now at the box office, but they also tend to have pretty big budgets. Horror films do well, too, and they’re a lot cheaper to produce. One such example is New Line Cinema’s The Conjuring franchise, which includes the “creepy doll” spinoff Annabelle and its prequel Annabelle: Creation. The Conjuring 3 doesn’t come out until 2020 (9/11/2020), but we learned in May that Annabelle 3 (7/3/2019) was likely to beat it to release. The Blumhouse horror production company also quickly moved forward with plans for Happy Death Day 2U, the sequel to last year’s $123 million Groundhog Day-like hit. We also learned in October that the Warrens (based on the real paranormal investigators) will be joining one of the non-Conjuring films in the franchise for the first time, as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga will reprise their roles in the third Annabelle movie.JUNE:&nbsp;THIS YEAR IN STEPHEN KING: DOCTOR SLEEP, FIRESTARTER, AND THE CASTING OF IT CHAPTER TWO(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection, Warner Bros.)Although 2017 was obviously not a great year for The Dark Tower (Rotten at 16%), the success of the other major Stephen King movie last year drastically offset it. IT was both Certified Fresh at 85%&nbsp;and a tremendous box office hit, earning $700+ million worldwide from a budget of just $35 million. This made Stephen King- sourced projects hot properties again, especially if they’re remakes (like Pet Sematary, 4/5/2019), or otherwise related to a pre-existing horror classic. That “otherwise” leads us to Doctor Sleep, the 2013 novel by King that&nbsp;serves as a sequel to The Shining because it focuses on the adult Danny Torrance. That role went to Ewan McGregor, with King himself reportedly having given his blessing to the choice for the sequel, which will be directed by Mike Flanagan (Ouija: Origin of Evil, Gerald’s Game). Also in June, we learned that Universal Pictures is remaking Stephen King’s Firestarter, with the directing job going to Turkish-German director Fatih Akin (Goodbye Berlin, Soul Kitchen), with Blumhouse also co-producing. Finally, there’s IT: Chapter Two (9/6/19), and this week, we saw our first images from the set. 2018 was a big year for IT: Chapter Two (9/6/2019) casting news, including the confirmation of Jessica Chastain in February, and the news in April that James McAvoy (Split, X-Men: First Class) and Saturday Night Live alumnus Bill Hader had been cast in lead roles (as Bill and Richie, respectively).JULY:&nbsp;STAR-STUDDED LITTLE WOMEN REMAKE TO BE GRETA GERWIG’S NEXT(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)One of the biggest stories coming out of last year’s awards season was the underdog success of actress-turned-director Greta Gerwig’s semi-autobiographical Lady Bird (Certified Fresh at 99%) starring Saoirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet (whose Call Me By Your Name also did well). For her next film, Gerwig is turning to classic literature, in the form of Little Women. Gerwig also attracted some major star power for her version, including Ronan and Chalamet, as well as Meryl Streep. Emma Stone was initially cast as Meg, but dropped out to allow her time to promote The Favourite, so the role went to another Emma, Emma Watson. In August, Jurassic Park and Blue Velvet star Laura Dern also signed on. Little Women is now scheduled for release in just under a year, on Christmas Day, 2019 (up against Call of the Wild, the World War I drama 1917, and Melissa McCarthy’s Super Intelligence).AUGUST:&nbsp;SHHH…. JOHN KRASINSKI IS NOW WRITING A QUIET PLACE 2 FOR 2020(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount)In late August, Paramount Pictures announced A Quiet Place 2 (title pending) for release on May 15, 2020, which currently puts it up against Warner Bros’ Scooby reboot and a week before another monster movie, Godzilla vs Kong (also from Warner Bros). Almost immediately, it was clear that Paramount was going to want to return to the first film’s premise (about monsters that are super sensitive to sound), given that it made over $332 million from a $17 million budget. John Krasinski gave an update in October, stating that after initially telling Paramount to hire someone else, he is now actively working on writing the sequel. It’s not yet known if Krasinski and his wife Emily Blunt will also be returning to star in the sequel. Emily Blunt is following up Mary Poppins Returns with another film for Disney, their attraction adaptation Jungle Cruise, which is scheduled for release&nbsp;on July 24, 2020.SEPTEMBER:&nbsp;HENRY CAVILL LIKELY OUT AS SUPERMAN, SIGNALING BIG DCEU CHANGES(Photo by Clay Enos/Warner Bros.)The DCEU (DC Extended Universe) hit a major snag in September&nbsp;with the news that Henry Cavill is most likely done playing Superman. Instead, the focus in the “Superman Family” will be on his cousin, Supergirl, whom we learned in August&nbsp; is getting her own movie. The talks with Cavill reportedly broke down over a Superman cameo in next year’s Shazam! (4/5/2019). Warner Bros.’ upcoming DC Comics projects also include Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker (10/4/2019), Margot Robbie’s Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (2/7/2020), and Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 (6/5/2020). Many pieces went online speculating about the future of DC Comics movies.&nbsp;Even without Superman on his slate anymore, Henry Cavill is expected to be keeping very busy anyway, as he also signed with Netflix this year to star in&nbsp;their video game adaptation series&nbsp;The Witcher.OCTOBER: JAMES GUNN&nbsp;SWITCHES SIDES FOR DC COMICS’ SUICIDE SQUAD SEQUEL(Photo by Marvel Studios)One of the most shocking stories in recent memory came in July when Disney fired director James Gunn from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 over a number of questionable tweets from before his original hiring for 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy. In October, we learned that that Gunn is now signed to write, and possibly direct&nbsp;the sequel to DC Comics’ Suicide Squad. Gunn is supposedly working on a “completely new take,” which suggests it could even be a reboot instead of a true sequel to the first film. One reason to believe that is that, in the past, Gunn has tweeted negatively about Jared Leto, suggesting that he may not be in a hurry to recast Leto as Joker in James Gunn’s Suicide Squad.NOVEMBER:&nbsp;GUILLERMO DEL TORO REVEALS OVER 15 BIG MOVIES READY TO GO(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Long before Guillermo del Toro won the Academy Award for Best Picture this year for The Shape of Water, it was well known that he had a long list of shelved movies in his past. That little golden man on his mantle has changed a lot for GDT, including his new deal at Fox Searchlight that basically set him up with his own mini-studio for horror/genre films. In November, del Toro took to Twitter to list over 15 unproduced screenplays that he has completely finished, which are basically “ready to go” projects for any studio that wants to work with him to get them produced. (You can read a summary of that list in our coverage last month right here.) Del Toro also made the news in August for producing Scary Movies to Tell in the Dark, and in October for landing his Pinocchio at Netflix.DECEMBER:&nbsp;INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE&nbsp;SUCCESS INSPIRES SPINOFFS AND SEQUELS&nbsp;(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)After just two weeks in release, Sony’s innovative animated film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 97%) has already earned nearly $150 million globally. The film was always part of Sony’s ambitious plans for its Marvel properties, and last week, we leaned a lot more about possible future films. Development had already reportedly begun in November on both a sequel and a spinoff&nbsp;of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animated sequel will focus on the romance between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, which will then lead into the spinoff Spider-Women, featuring Gwen, Silk, and the original Spider-Woman (in the comics), Jessica Drew. These two animated films join a growing slate of Marvel movies at Sony that also includes Venom 2, Morbius (AKA The Living Vampire), Black Cat, Silver Sable, Kraven the Hunter, Jackpot, Nightwatch, and Silk.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"poppins, TBS, Academy, TLC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/23184647/Indiana-Jones-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"yearly-ketchup-the-freshest-movie-development-news-of-2018"},{"id":"47509196293573","title":"Hasbro Announces Cinematic Universe Centered On G.I.

Joe, Plus More Hollywood HeadlinesKurt Russell joins the Guardians of the Galaxy, Katherine Waterston joins Alien, and Vin Diesel keeps the Riddick franchise alive.by Greg Dean Schmitz | December 18, 2015 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next). Included in the mix this time around are stories about such movies as Alien: Covenant, the Bride of Frankenstein remake, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, and Bubbles (about Michael Jackson’s pet chimp).This Week’s Top StoryG.I. JOE TO STAR IN A NEW “HASBRO CINEMATIC UNIVERSE”Ever since Marvel Studios hit upon box office success with their string of films, the term “cinematic universe” has become one of the Holy Grails of major Hollywood film development. “Cinematic Universe” refers to a setting that is shared by multiple films (and in Marvel’s case, TV shows), which provides a sense of continuity, but is also pretty great for “franchises.” In various stages of development, there are now cinematic universes for DC Comics, Universal’s Classic Monsters, 21 Jump Street/Men in Black, and even Robin Hood’s Merry Men. The toy company Hasbro arguably already has one in the form of Transformers (and its upcoming spinoffs and prequels). This week, Hasbro announced that some of their other toy brands will also be coming together in a new cinematic universe centered around G.I. Joe. (at least at first).&nbsp;G.I. Joe will be joined by Micronauts (tiny aliens and robots who see our world as a planet of giants), ROM: Spaceknight (who’s also a popular Marvel Comics character), M.A.S.K. (another paramilitary group not unlike G.I. Joe), and Visionaries (their subtitle Knights of the Magical Light says it all, pretty much). (You can find another guide to these characters in this article). It’s not yet known how the various characters will be combined and/or featured, or in what order, but it seems likely that the first film will focus on G.I. Joe (with other characters possibly introduced as well, ala Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). Hasbro has been known to be working on a Micronauts movie for some time now, so for many comics fans, the big news in all of this is the notion of a ROM: Spaceknight movie. As part of a licensed deal with Hasbro, Marvel Comics published 75 issues of ROM: Spaceknight from 1979 to 1986, and the character remains one of Marvel’s most popular “cosmic” characters, especially among older fans. Marvel can’t use ROM: Spaceknight and Micronauts in their own movies because they’re licensed characters, but it looks like that won’t mean they won’t get their own movies, eventually.Fresh Developments This Week1.&nbsp;BIOPICS DOMINATE THIS YEAR’S “BLACK LIST”, LED BY… BUBBLES THE CHIMP?Since 2005, “The Black List” has been an annual survey of Hollywood insiders appraising the current batch of unproduced screenplays that are actively in development. Since this is a weekly column about film development, the Black List is most definitely one of our “big deals” here. Well, the 2015 edition arrived this week, and the quickest take away we can give you is that “biopics” and other “true story” scripts did very, very well, representing 4 (or 5) of the top 10 screenplays, including the #1 and #2 spots. Those scripts are called Bubbles and Stronger, and they tell the stories of Michael Jackson’s pet chimp (who serves as the film’s narrator), and Jeff Bauman, one of the survivors of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Two baseball biopics also made the top ten: Rocket* (about baseball pitcher Roger Clemens and his disqualification from being a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame), and True Fan (about Steve Bartman, the Chicago Cubs fan who was accused of costing the team their first pennant since 1945). Other screenplays involving real people are Reagan (a fictional comedy), White Boy Rick (a successful 1980s Detroit drug kingpin), All the Money in the World (the Getty kidnapping case), The Virginian (young George Washington), Mayday 109 (JFK during WWII), Nyad (swimmer Diana Nyad), Hunting Eichmann (about the Nazi fugitive), Battle of New Orleans (Andrew Jackson and the War of 1812), and Chappaquiddick (see below).2. KURT RUSSELL “EYED” TO PLAY STAR-LORD’S DAD IN GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2We still don’t know who Star-Lord’s dad is (and really, at this point, do we want to?).&nbsp; However, the people at Marvel Studios certainly do, and when they think of him, the guy they want to play him is Kurt Russell. That’s right, if Marvel can make the deal, the same actor who starred in Escape from New York, John Carpenter’s The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, and is currently in Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, will also be joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has been stepping up their casting game recently, with their latest “big get” being Cate Blanchett, who will costar in Thor: Ragnarok. Marvel Studios has scheduled Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 for May 5, 2017.3.&nbsp;SCARLETT JOHANSSON TO MOVE THAT BODYScarlett Johansson is currently in talks with Sony Pictures to star in an R-rated comedy called Move That Body. Described as a cross between The Hangover and Weekend at Bernie’s, the comedy is about five friends who accidentally kill a male stripper at their bachelorette party, and so they have to dispose of the body. (A more specific comparison&nbsp; would be to 1998’s Very Bad Things, but Hollywood publicists almost always go with “popular” over “precise” with their analogies.)&nbsp;Move That Body was written by Broad City participants Lucia Aniello (director) and Paul W. Downs (writer/actor), and Downs is also expected to costar in the movie.4.&nbsp;KATHERINE WATERSTON IS THE NEXT ALIEN FRANCHISE LEADEver since Sigourney Weaver starred in the first Alien, there have been later female roles that joined the Alien franchise, such as those played by Sanaa Lathan and Noomi Rapace, that begged inevitable comparisons. With the Prometheus sequel Alien: Covenant, which will start a new trilogy of Alien prequels, it has been expected for a while that the female lead will also become the new “franchise lead” as well. So, it was something of a big deal for many young actresses working today, no doubt. This week, we learned that this sought after role has gone to Katherine Waterston, who is probably best known for costarring with Joaquin Phoenix in Inherent Vice. (Katherine Waterston also happens to be the daughter of Sam Waterston, of Law &amp; Order fame.) Michael Fassbender is also returning as the android David in Alien: Covenant, which will be directed by Ridley Scott, in what will be his third film in the Alien franchise (after Alien and Prometheus). 20th Century Fox has scheduled Alien: Covenant for release on October 6, 2017.5.&nbsp;MAMA DIRECTOR TO CONJURE SPIRITS FOR DEBUNKER HARRY HOUDINIIf you know two things about Harry Houdini, it’s probably that he followed a) his career as an escape artist with b) a second career as a debunker of mystics who claimed to speak to the spirits of the dead.&nbsp; There are a number of competing movies about the life (or chapters in the life) of Harry Houdini, and this week, another one joined the fray.&nbsp; Mama director Andres Muscietti has signed to direct an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Witch of Lime Street: Seance, Seduction, and Houdini in the Spirit World, by David Jaher. As sometimes happens with books with lengthy subtitles, David Jaher also basically put the premise of this movie right there on the book’s title. More specifically, this film will be set in the 1920s and focus on Houdini’s efforts to debunk a spirit medium known as “Crandon.”6.&nbsp;SPIDER-MAN SCREENWRITER UNWRAPS BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN REMAKEWe recently heard about how Universal Pictures is hoping to recruit Angelina Jolie to star in their remake of Bride of Frankenstein (the rumor/story goes, that’s partly how her film By the Sea got its greenlight). This film is, along with the new female-centric version of The Mummy (3/24/17) (starring Sofia Boutella from Kingsman: The Secret Service), part of Universal’s upcoming “Classic Monster Cinematic Universe.” Even though Universal is talking to Jolie about this contemporary new film, what they don’t have right now is a script. And that’s when we mention that screenwriter David Koepp has signed on to write Universal’s remake of Bride of Frankenstein.&nbsp;David Koepp‘s credits include&nbsp;Spider-Man (the first, really good one), David Fincher’s Panic Room, Steven Spielberg’s War of the Worlds, and the two latest Hanks/Howard films, Angels &amp; Demons and the upcoming Inferno.&nbsp; (David Koepp also wrote Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but his Tomatometer is still mostly Certified Fresh.)Rotten Ideas of The Week3. CHADWICK BOSEMAN APPOINTED TO PLAY JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALLAlthough Chadwick Boseman has only starred in five movies to date, already two of his biggest roles have been in celebrity biopics, as Jackie Robinson in 42 and as James Brown in Get On Up.&nbsp; Lately, the press about Boseman has been about either his casting as Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War and his own solo film. Add to those movies Chadwick Boseman’s upcoming portrayal of the god Thoth in Gods of Egypt, and his filmography is almost entirely made up of figures famous outside the movies (both real and fictional). Well, this week, yet another famous figure was added to that list, as Chadwick Boseman has signed to star as Thurgood Marshall in the historical film Marshall. Thurgood Marshall was of course, the first African American Supreme Court Justice, but Marshall will focus on a case much earlier in his career, when he represented a “black chauffeur against his wealthy socialite employer in a sexual assault and attempted murder trial that quickly became tabloid fodder.”&nbsp; Marshall will be directed by Reginald Hudlin (The Ladies Man, Boomerang, House Party), whose string of four Rotten Tomatometer ratings in a row is why this is one of the week’s “Rotten Ideas.”2.&nbsp;FIFTY SHADES OF GREY DIRECTOR TO TACKLE TED KENNEDY AND CHAPPAQUIDDICKIf you’re under a certain age, it’s very possible the word Chappaquiddick means absolutely nothing to you. It probably looks like a character’s name from Duck Tales or something. For older folks (or those who have boned up on their political history), Chappaquiddick possibly has a lot of meaning indeed. On July 18, 1969, Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy accidentally drove his car off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, MA, killing his female passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Ted Kennedy was the last surviving Kennedy brother, and had until that point been seen as a likely president candidate for the 1972 election against Richard M. Nixon. (The news about the accident also broke the day before the historic Apollo 11 moon walk mission launched.) There has never been a major Hollywood movie about the Chappaquiddick scandal, but that’s about to change. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson (Fifty Shades of Grey, Nowhere Boy) is now in talks to direct a movie simply titled Chappaquiddick. The script, which was written by newcomers Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan, recently landed a spot on this year’s Black List of Unproduced Screenplays (see above).&nbsp;Chappaquiddick is described as a “political thriller” which details the events of seven days of Senator Kennedy’s life before (presumably) and after the accident that took Mary Jo Kopechne’s life. We’re calling this story a borderline “Rotten Idea” just because Sam Taylor-Johnson’s Tomatometer currently has two movies below 26%, and only one Fresh rating.1.&nbsp;VIN DIESEL TO CONTINUE RIDDICK SERIES WITH FURIA ORIGIN STORYBeing the star (or at least, one of two stars) of one of the biggest movie franchises of all time has its privileges. For Vin Diesel, we’re talking about how he has helped Universal Pictures make the Fast and Furious franchise what it is.&nbsp; And one of his rewards has been the ability to keep the Riddick science fiction series going, despite none of the films ever being box office smashes in their own right. Critically, the Riddick movies have never been beloved either, with their Tomatometer scores being 57% (Pitch Black), 29% (The Chronicles of Riddick), and 58% (2013’s Riddick). We know that the Riddick franchise is being kept alive because Vin Diesel took to his Facebook account this week&nbsp;to announce two new projects. The first is an upcoming TV series called Merc (basically a Riddick spinoff), and the second is an origin story for Diesel’s Riddick character called Furia (which might be expanded to something like The Chronicles of Riddick: Furia). Vin Diesel’s plan is to film the Furia origin story movie in early 2017, which suggests a release date probably in 2018. We’re calling this the “Rotten Story of the Week” because Vin Diesel is critically batting 0 and 3 with the Riddick franchise.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"cinematic, Film, FOX","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/18134437/GIJoeUniverse.jpg","slug":"hasbro-announces-cinematic-universe-centered-on-g-i-joe-plus-more-holllywood-headlines"},{"id":"47509191880092","title":"Mark Wahlberg Will Attend Lebron James’ Basketball Camp in Ballers, and More Movie News","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mark Wahlberg Will Attend Lebron James' Basketball Camp in Ballers, and More Movie NewsJared Leto will play Andy Warhol, Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, Rooney Mara and Sia team up, and Bill Hader joins Power Rangers.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 23, 2016 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup brings you another ten headlines from the world of film development news (those stories about what movies Hollywood is working on for you next).&nbsp; Included in the mix this time around are stories about such titles as Mission: Impossible 6, Power Rangers, Robin Hood: Origins, and the biopic Warhol.This WEEK’S TOP STORYMARK WAHLBERG JOINS LEBRON JAMES’ BALLERSThe HBO sports dramedy series Ballers debuted in 2014, and this weekend, wraps up its second season, with a third already in the works. People who are familiar with that show, and that it’s about football, may not have been confused as this week’s movie news, but it’s at least something that Google searches still find perplexing. That’s because Ballers is also the title of a basketball comedy feature film that’s been in the works since 2013, with LeBron James attached as an NBA superstar. This week, during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Mark Wahlberg revealed that he is now attached to also star alongside LeBron James in Ballers.&nbsp; Previously, Kevin Hart had also been attached to Ballers as Lebron’s&nbsp;less-talented-at-basketball brother, but Hart has since dropped out. Wahlberg will play one of a group of guys who go to a “basketball fantasy camp,” and while there, his and LeBron James’ character “have a situation” (quoting Wahlberg on The Tonight Show). Wahlberg is also bringing with him writer and TV producer Doug Ellin, the showrunner on Entourage (which Wahlberg also produced), to work on the screenplay previously cowritten by Kevin Hart. LeBron James made his acting debut in last summer’s comedy hit Trainwreck, and he is also attached to star in the reboot/sequel Space Jam 2.Fresh Developments1. IN THE FUTURE, EVERY JARED LETO WILL BE ANDY WARHOL FOR 15+ MINUTESNext year (specifically February 22, 2017) will mark the 30th anniversary of the death of 20th century “pop art” icon Andy Warhol, who died soon after normally non-lethal gallbladder surgery. Famous painters are very much a go-to staple in the biopic genre; contemporary examples who have already received their own films include Jackson Pollock, Jean-Michel Basquiat,&nbsp;and Margaret Keane (Big Eyes). Andy Warhol himself has been used a few times to add flavor to other films (such as 54, The Doors, Factory Girl, and I Shot Andy Warhol), but thus far, he&nbsp;hasn’t been the focus of a major film devoted just to him. That will change soon, because Jared Leto is now producing and attached to star in an Andy Warhol biopic titled simply Warhol. There have been dozens of books devoted to Warhol and his peripheral circle and influence, but this film will specifically be based upon Victor Bockris’ 1989 book Warhol: The Biography. Terence Winter, best known as the showrunner of HBO’s Boardwalk Empire (and for writing 19 episodes of The Sopranos) is now working on adapting Bockris’ biography. Winter will have many elements to draw upon, as Andy Warhol’s claims to fame include not just his famous use of pop culture and common objects in his art, but also his time as a magazine publisher (Interview), his musical associations (The Velvet Underground), his work in art films (such as Andy Warhol’s Frankenstein), the Factory and its influence on younger artists, and Warhol’s celebrity status in New York City. And of course (and there is no way this biopic doesn’t address this), Andy Warhol was also one of the most openly gay American celebrities, even before the events at Stonewall and the changes that came in the 1970s and 1980s.&nbsp;Warhol is being produced by former New Line Cinema executive Michael De Luca, whose credits as producer include Captain Phillips, Moneyball, and The Social Network.2. TOM CRUISE TO RETURN FOR MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 6 AFTER ALLThe funny thing about “the news” is that an initial news item often gets way, way more coverage than later follow-ups to the same story. Unfortunately, there is also an inherent drive for most sources to be the first to cover a story, which means that it’s difficult to check all factors and get the story absolutely 100% correct the first time out. Sometimes (actually frequently), film development news is just not that easy, since so much rests on scheduling, contracts, conflicting interests, etc. With all that said, a big story that emerged early last month was the news that Paramount was halting pre-production on Mission: Impossible 6 over contract negotiations with Tom Cruise.&nbsp; The angle that received the most attention was the notion that Cruise made more money on Universal Pictures’ reboot of The Mummy (producer fees were also an issue).&nbsp; Well, in what was relatively under-reported this week, Tom Cruise is indeed now signed (or close to signing) to return for Mission: Impossible 6. Production on the spy franchise sequel is expected to start by early 2017 to get the film ready for a release tentatively in the summer of 2018. As of right now, there are no known details about the premise of the sixth film, but generally, the Mission: Impossible franchise is not one that we usually know much about nearly two years before release.3.&nbsp;ROONEY MARA AND SIA JOIN FORCES FOR POP STAR MUSICAL VOX LUXFemale pop singers have been making the transition to the big screen for decades (just like their male counterparts); some examples include Diana Ross (Lady Sings the Blues), Madonna (Desperately Seeking Susan), and Mariah Carey (Glitter). More recently, we’ve heard news about films for the likes of Lady Gaga (opposite Bradley Cooper in A Star is Born), Rihanna (Ocean’s Eight), and Sia (as one of the voices in next year’s My Little Pony: The Movie). This week, we have another film credit for Sia, and just like her career as a pop singer, it will be another example where we won’t see her face. Rooney Mara is attached to play&nbsp;a pop star in the independent musical&nbsp;Vox Lux, with Sia providing the music via her own voice and a new batch of original songs.&nbsp;Vox Lux will be directed by independent director Brady Corbet (The Childhood of a Leader), who plans to film it in 65mm for exhibition in 70mm large format (ala Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight).&nbsp;The story of Vox Lux will follow a pop star named Celeste as she rises “from the ashes of a major national tragedy to pop superstardom. This 15-year odyssey, set between 1999 and the present day, tracks the important cultural evolutions of the 21st Century via her gaze” (thanks, Variety!). That’s what Rooney Mara has going on. As for her sister Kate, she’s preparing to film the independent romantic drama Mercy in Cincinatti, with Ellen Page already cast as her romantic interest.4. JAKE GYLLENHAAL TO STAR IN PAUL DANO’S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT WILDLIFEActor Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood) remains mostly an indie darling, with last year’s Beach Boys biopic Love &amp; Mercy being followed this summer by the bizarre Swiss Army Man (with Daniel Radcliffe). Like many actors, Paul Dano is now preparing to step behind the camera for his directorial debut, a marriage drama called Wildlife, based upon a novel by Richard Ford. The story is told from a boy’s perspective of his parents’ failing marriage, and this week, we learned that the two adult leads will be&nbsp;Jake Gyllenhaal and Carey Mulligan (Inside Llewyn Davis, Drive). Jake Gyllenhaal’s next film Nocturnal Animals recently debuted in the festival circuit, and is scheduled for release this fall (11/28/16), and currently has a 88 percent Fresh Tomatometer score.5. STEPHEN KING’S HEARTS IN ATLANTIS TO BE ADAPTED AS (JUST) HEARTSIn addition to his dozens of novels (and hundreds of short stories), many of which have inspired film adaptations, Stephen King also periodically publishes novellas as well. These stories are typically in the 100-200 page range, and they are released in compilations like Different Seasons, Four Past Midnight, and Hearts in Atlantis. These books actually have given us some of King’s most famous movies, with Different Seasons alone providing the source material for Apt Pupil, Stand By Me (adapting The Body), and The Shawshank Redemption (adapting Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). Something odd, however, happened with the 1999 collection Hearts in Atlantis, when it came time for Anthony Hopkins to star in the movie. Instead of adapting the story called “Hearts in Atlantis,” that movie adapted two other stories in the same book, leaving the titular tale unadapted. Well, that is an oversight that will soon be corrected, with the news that British director Johannes Roberts is now preparing an adaptation to be called Hearts (since Hearts in Atlantis is now already taken). Like King’s novella, Hearts will depict a group of college students in 1966 who play the card game Hearts and struggle with the possibility that they might be drafted if their studies suffer, and they have to leave college. No announcements have been made about possible casting for the college students.6.&nbsp;FIFTY SHADES OF WILL SCARLET: JAMIE DORNAN JOINS ROBIN HOOD: ORIGINSEver since Marvel’s The Avengers (and related films) popularized the notion of the “cinematic universe”, other studios have been developing their own takes on similarly interconnected films (such as Universal’s rebooting of their monster movies starting with The Mummy). One such concept that has made the news the last few years is the notion of Lionsgate developing a series of swashbuckling adventures focusing on the “Merry Men,” starting with Robin Hood: Origins. Three of the characters most frequently given as examples of spinning off from Robin Hood: Origins are Friar Tuck, Little John, and Will Scarlet. Thus far, three of the major characters have been cast: Robin Hood (Taron Egerton of Kingsman: The Secret Service), Maid Marian (Eve Hewson), and Little John (Jamie Foxx). As of this week, we now know that the potential star of the Will Scarlet spinoff movie is Jamie Dornan (Fifty Shades of Grey), who is now in talks for the role’s first appearance in Robin Hood: Origins. The first Robin Hood: Origins film will be directed for Lionsgate by Otto Bathurst (Peaky Blinders).7.&nbsp;DEADPOOL BAD GUY ED SKREIN CAST AS BAD GUY IN ALITA: BATTLE ANGELActor Ed Skrein does not yet have a “household name,” but thanks to his nasty role in Deadpool earlier this year, he’s getting closer to having, at least, a “household face.” Playing a villain for 20th Century Fox seemed to work out alright for Skrein in Deadpool, so perhaps that’s the reasoning behind his latest role. 20th Century Fox and producer James Cameron are in talks with Ed Skrein to join the manga adaptation Alita: Battle Angel as one of the film’s villains (possibly a cyborg, but that’s not confirmed yet).&nbsp;Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Machete, Spy Kids) took over the directing duties from James Cameron (so he could focus on the multiple Avatar sequels). If he signs on, Skrein will be joining a cast which includes Jackie Earle Haley, Christoph Waltz, and title star Rosa Salazar, whose Alita character is a “a 26th century cyborg who’s rescued from a scrapyard and reassembled…&nbsp; as a hunter-warrior who tracks down vicious criminals.” 20th Century Fox has scheduled Alita: Battle Angel for release on July 20, 2018 (the week after The Secret Life of Pets 2, and the week before Aquaman).2.&nbsp;BILL HADER TO VOICE ROBOT ALPHA 5 IN NEXT YEAR’S POWER RANGERSWe’re now just about six months away from the release of the Power Rangers reboot (March 24, 2017), and we’re still hearing new casting announcements. In this week’s case, it’s mostly because the character that is being cast is a possibly CGI animated supporting character. We’re talking here about the robot Alpha 5, who we now know will be voiced in the new movie by Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader. The five stars are mostly “near unknowns,” but Bill Hader joins a few other “names” who ostensibly help give Power Rangers the star clout their leads don’t have yet. The other famous costars of Power Rangers&nbsp;are Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle) as Zordon and Elizabeth Banks as the evil villainess Rita Repulsa. In other Power Rangers news, Lionsgate also revealed the first glimpses of the “Dinozords” this week via five preview posters. Although we typically call stories about Power Rangers “rotten ideas,” the addition of Bill Hader might now be tipping this movie into at least a “borderline” Fresh/Rotten status.ROTTEN IDEA&nbsp;OF THE WEEK1.&nbsp;PARAMOUNT WRITES OFF $115 MILLION FOR A MYSTERY MOVIE (THAT IS PROBABLY MONSTER TRUCKS)Within film journalism and online discussion, there is a whole sub-community devoted to box office and its ramifications on the film industry, both domestically and internationally. What is far less common is a story that unfolds about a film nearly four months before it’s even first released. That, however, is what apparently happened this week as various sources broke the news that Paramount Pictures is taking a write-down (ie, a “programming impairment charge”) of some $115 million on what is officially called an unknown title, but which pretty much every source says is this January’s family adventure Monster Trucks. That aliens-disguised-as-engines sci-fi comedy was originally first scheduled for release on May 29, 2015, until eventually being scheduled in the “dump month” of January, 2017. When it’s released on January 13, 2017, Monster Trucks will be going up against the awards-friendly wide releases of both Hidden Figures and Ben Affleck’s Live by Nights, as well as the (also pushed back) horror film The Bye Bye Man. The budget of Monster Trucks is reportedly in the range of $100 million, and the other $15 million probably comes from budgeted marketing costs, all of which Paramount is apparently expecting will add up to (or subtract down to) a loss higher than the budgets of many of its competitors in January, 2017.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, One, love, Mary, GoT, razzies, movies, Star","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/23154112/Lebron-Wahlberg-Ketchup.jpg","slug":"mark-wahlberg-will-attend-lebron-james-basketball-camp-in-ballers-and-more-movie-news"},{"id":"47509219204779","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Harrison Ford to Play Wyatt Earp in Black Hats","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Harrison Ford to Play Wyatt Earp in Black HatsPlus, new movies for Kevin Bacon and John Cusack, and Rob Cohen does history.by Greg Dean Schmitz | July 29, 2011 |  CommentsFollowing San Diego Comic-Con last weekend, movie news slowed to a trickle this week, mostly consisting of last minute news from the convention, and a few other stories. What news did happen this week includes new movies for Kevin Bacon, Nicolas Cage, John Cusack and Harrison Ford, a sequel to Wolf Creek, an adaptation of The Nutcracker, and two very different cowboy movies.This Week’s Top StoryCOWBOYS &amp; ALIENS STAR HARRISON FORD TO PLAY OLD MAN WYATT EARP IN BLACK HATSCowboys &amp; Aliens opens in theaters this weekend, but Harrison Ford isn’t quite done playing aging cowboys just yet. The actor who gave the world both Han Solo and Indiana Jones has signed on to star as the aging Wyatt Earp in Black Hats, an adaptation of the novel by Max Allan Collins (Road to Perdition). Blending real historical figures with fiction, Black Hats tells the story of how 1920s Hollywood detective and movie consultant Wyatt Earp teams up with Bat Masterson to take on Al Capone in New York City when he learns that Doc Holliday’s son has gotten into trouble with the mobster. So, basically, to follow up Cowboys &amp; Aliens, Harrison Ford just signed on to a movie that could be called Cowboys &amp; Mobsters. Black Hats is being adapted by screenwriter Kurt Johnstad, who cowrote 300, and is now also adapting that film’s sequel 300: Battle of Artemisia. There’s no word yet on when Black Hats will start filming, or who will be directing. Harrison Ford is likely to be just the first big star to sign on for the film, as the roles of Bat Masterson and Al Capone also seem to be ripe for big name movie stars to portray.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING TRUE STORIES OF 2010 TO BECOME A MOVIE IN 2013Producer Mike Medavoy (Zodiac, Black Swan, Shutter Island) has signed an agreement with two Chilean businessmen to develop a feature film based upon the true story of the 33 miners trapped in the Copiapó copper/gold mine in 2010. Following a cave in, the 33 miners and support personnel were trapped half a mile underground for a record 69 days before eventually being rescued. Screenwriter Jose Rivera (The Motorcycle Diaries, Trade) will adapt the miners’ stories. An official book is being written by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Hector Tobar, and since this film is also being called “official,” some of the same material may also be used in the adaptation. Filming of this currently untitled project is expected to start sometime in 2012. It is not yet known whether this movie will be filmed in Spanish or English.#2 GERARD WAY’S THE UMBRELLA ACADEMY IS THE LATEST SUPERHERO MOVIE PROJECTIn 2008, Gerard Way, the leader singer of My Chemical Romance, got into the comic book business with The Umbrella Academy, a six issue limited series about a group of kid superheroes who reunite years later after their adoptive father dies. Now, Rawson Thurber (Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story) has signed on to do a rewrite of The Umbrella Academy, and possibly direct. The first draft was by Mark Bomback (Unstoppable; cowriter of Live Free and Die Hard), who also cowrote Bryan Singer’s upcoming Jack the Giant Killer. To give you an idea of what kind of movie The Umbrella Academy could be, when they were kids, the heroes defeated the Eiffel Tower after it was turned by a zombie robot into a giant monster that shot lasers. That was just one of two news stories involving Rawson Thurber this week. Thurber also has come aboard to direct We’re the Millers, a drug comedy to star Jason Bateman (Arrested Development, Horrible Bosses) as a low level drug dealer who concocts a plan to smuggle 1,400 pounds of marijuana using a rented RV and a fake family as a cover story.#3 JOAN ALLEN AND ALBERT FINNEY CONNECT THE BOURNE LEGACY TO THE MATT DAMON MOVIESAlthough Matt Damon won’t be returning as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Legacy, this week, two actors from The Bourne Ultimatum signed on to reprise their roles. Joan Allen costarred as CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy in The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, while Albert Finney played Dr. Albert Hirsch, the man in charge of the Treadstone behavior modification program, in The Bourne Ultimatum. Jeremy Renner will be playing one of the other assassins that was trained by Treadwell, Rachel Weisz will be costarring as the new agent’s romantic interest, and Oscar Issacs is also signed in an unknown role. Edward Norton is still in talks to play the film’s primary villain/antagonist. Director Tony Gilroy (Duplicity, Michael Clayton), who also wrote or cowrote the first three films, will be directing The Bourne Legacy, as well as cowriting with his brother Dan Gilroy (Two for the Money; cowriter of The Fall). Universal Pictures has already scheduled The Bourne Legacy for release on August 3, 2012.#4 KEVIN BACON RETURNS TO EVIL IN R.I.P.D.Kevin Bacon earned critical praise as Sebastian Shaw, the central villain in this summer’s X-Men: First Class. Now, the actor has signed on for another villainous role in Universal Pictures’ adaptation of the Dark Horse Comics series R.I.P.D. Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges are already signed to star as a rookie/veteran buddy cop team who work for an agency of deceased lawmen who fight supernatural criminals and monsters. R.I.P.D. will be directed by Robert Schwentke (Red, Flightplan) from a script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, the screenwriting team behind Aeon Flux and Crazy/Beautiful (they also cowrote Clash of the Titans). Universal Pictures has already scheduled R.I.P.D. for the pre-Independence Day weekend of June 28, 2013. Kevin Bacon playing another villain, as well as the idea of Jeff Bridges playing an undead cowboy lawman are both “Fresh” ideas, but the rest of the creative people involved with R.I.P.D. lands it in the borderline area.Rotten Ideas of the Week#5 NICOLAS CAGE AND JOHN CUSACK STUCK TO THE FROZEN GROUNDJohn Cusack and Nicolas Cage are in talks to star in The Frozen Ground, a crime drama based upon the true story of Alaska serial killer Robert Hansen. John Cusack would play Hansen, who abducted over 20 women over a 12 year period, flying them into the Alaskan wilderness to be hunted and eventually killed. Nicolas Cage is in talks to play the Alaskan State Trooper who finds Hansen’s only surviving victim, who teams up with the young girl to bring Hansen to justice. The Frozen Ground will be produced by the independent company Emmett/Furla (16 Blocks, 88 Minutes, Righteous Kill). Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is also one of the film’s executive producers. The Frozen Ground was adapted by newcomer screenwriter Scott Walker, who will also make his debut as director when filming starts this fall in Anchorage, Alaska.#4 THIS WEEK IN FAIRY TALE ADAPTATIONS: THE NUTCRACKERUniversal Pictures has picked up rights to a pitch based upon the 1816 German story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King by E.T.A. Hoffman, which went on to inspire the Tchaikovsky ballet The Nutcracker. This new movie based on The Nutcracker will be a live action adventure about a 12 year old girl who receives a Nutcracker doll as a gift. That leads to “an adventure that includes a war involving a seven-headed Mouse King and his army of mice, curses and themes of ugliness and beauty.” The pitch was made by the screenwriting team of Jon Gunn and Jon Mann, whose only previous credit is the 2000 Eric Roberts film Mercy Streets. Universal’s The Nutcracker is actually now the second movie in development based on that story, with the other being developed by the producers of The Twilight Saga.#3 THE GNOMEO &amp; JULIET TEAM REUNITES FOR COWBOY FANTASYElton John’s Rocket Pictures is reuniting with Gnomeo &amp; Juliet writer/director Kelly Asbury for an adaptation of Derek Keilty’s Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll, the first in a series of British children’s books. Set in a world that combines fantasy with the Wild West, Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll is the story of “a young Elfing sky cowboy” who sets out to bring Noose Womworx the troll to justice for the murder of his father, the former deputy sheriff of Oretown. Like Gnomeo &amp; Juliet, Will Gallows and the Snake Bellied Troll is expected to heavily feature musical elements. Unlike that film, however, it will feature both live action (probably Will Gallows) and CGI (probably the Snake Bellied Troll).#2 MORE CRAZY AUSSIE TORTURING IN WOLF CREEK 2Australian horror director Greg McLean (Rogue, Wolf Creek) has received the financing he needs to move ahead with plans for a sequel to the 2005 torture/captivity movie Wolf Creek. The premise for the sequel sounds nearly identical to the first film, as three backpackers in the Australian Outback encounter an evil torturer (John Jarratt reprising the role), who chases and then tortures and kills them. Wolf Creek 2 is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because the first film received a Rotten Tomatometer score (53%), but also because the whole “torture horror” genre seems over played at this point.#1 ACTION DIRECTOR ENLISTS FOR KOREAN WAR EPIC 1950Action director Rob Cohen (xXx, The Fast and Furious, Stealth) has signed on to direct a $100 million Korean War epic called 1950 (the year the war started). 1950 will be the most expensive film ever produced by the Korean film industry, and is scheduled to start filming in May of 2012 for a release in the spring of 2013. 1950 will be based on true stories of the Korean War as depicted by New York Herald Tribune journalist Marguerite Higgins, for which she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize. The producers are in talks with unspecified “A-list Hollywood and Asian talents” for the lead roles of Marguerite Higgins, Captain Darren, the leader of a platoon of Marines, and a Korean KATUSA named Sunjae Lee. KATUSA stands for Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, and refers to Korean soldiers who fight alongside American soldiers. General Douglas MacArthur is also expected to be depicted in 1950 as a supporting cast member. The script is being adapted by screenwriters Rachel Long and Brian Pittman, whose first produced credit will be the upcoming independent film Silver Falls. 1950 is the week’s most Rotten Idea mostly because Rob Cohen’s reputation as an over-the-top action director makes the concept of him directing a Korean War epic seem a bit too much like Michael Bay’s Pearl Harbor.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Access, Critics, star, blockbuster, Talk, Sundance, camera, composers, History, Biopics, Valentine's, Awards, BBC, CW, criterion","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Harrison-Ford-to-Play-Wyatt-Earp-in-Black-Hats"},{"id":"47509217689243","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Will Do A Serial Killer Film","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Martin Scorsese Will Do A Serial Killer FilmPlus, new roles for Anthony Hopkins, The Rock, and Chris Evans.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 23, 2011 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup doesn’t even really cover a full week, as it is being published on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving Thursday, and so only half a week has transpired since the last Ketchup. And Hollywood has basically taken the whole week off for the holiday as well, so instead of the usual 10 stories, this Ketchup can only give you seven… because that is literally everything that happened this week in movie news. Included in the mix are two different adaptations of Scandinavian novels, new movies for director Martin Scorsese and Kenneth Branagh, and new roles for Dame Judi Dench, Chris Evans, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.This Week’s Top StoryMARTIN SCORSESE TO GO DARK AGAIN POST-HUGO WITH THE SNOWMANThis week saw the release of director Martin Scorsese’s first ever “kids’ movie” Hugo. Possibly to address movie fans concerned that Hugo might be a sign that Scorsese has gone soft, it was announced this week that he was signed to direct an adaptation of the Norwegian serial killer novel The Snowman. This international bestseller was the seventh in the Harry Hole detective series by Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. The Snowman follows the investigation by Harry Hole, “an anti-authortarian, anti-sobriety cop,” of a series of killings targetting married women with children, and in each case, a snowman is found at the scene of the crime. Jo Nesbø had to agree to the production’s director selection, but also agreed to allow the English translation film not necessarily to be filmed in Oslo (where the novel is set). Screenwriter Matthew Michael Carnahan (The Kingdom, Lions for Lambs), who also cowrote the upcoming zombie disaster movie World War Z, is now working on adapting the screenplay from the novel. Despite being the center of news this week, The Snowman is not likely, however, to be Martin Scorsese’s first post-Hugo movie. Other previously announced projects for Scorsese include the missionaries-in-Japan drama Silence, the mobster biopic The Irishman (starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro), a Frank Sinatra biopic, and a possible remake of Scorsese’s Taxi Driver done in the style of Lars von Trier’s The Five Obstructions.Fresh Developments This Week#1 ANTHONY HOPKINS AND JUDI DENCH TO DON ITALIAN SHOES FOR KENNETH BRANAGHSir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Judi Dench are in negotations to star in the next film from director Kenneth Branagh (Thor, Hamlet, Henry V) (no “Sir” title for him… yet). Italian Shoes is an English language adaptation of a novel by Swedish author Henning Mankell. The story concerns an elderly man (Hopkins) who has spent years in isolation in the wilderness (where he lowers himself into the icy waters nearby each morning to remind himself that he’s still alive) whose life changes when an unexpected visitor (Dench) arrives. The Italian Shoes script was adapted by Richard Cottan, who also wrote several episodes of the Wallander TV series in which Kenneth Branagh also starred. Filming of Italian Shoes is expected to start in late 2012 or early 2013.#2 THE LATEST HAROLD &amp; KUMAR DIRECTOR SIGNS ON FOR SLASHER COMEDY FINAL GIRLSDirector Todd Strauss-Schulson recently made his studio debut with New Line Cinema’s A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas after a career previously best known for independent comedy shorts and videos. That movie ended up earning a Fresh RT score of 72% and $28 million at the box office thus far. Despite that low box office, but perhaps because of the good critical reception, New Line Cinema has signed Schauss-Schulson for another comedy project. In what is being called a cross between Back to the Future and Friday the 13th, Final Girls is a horror/comedy hybrid about a teenage girl who gets sucked with her friends into the 1980s slasher movie that her mother starred in. Final Girls was written by newcomers Mark Fortin and Josh Miller, who have worked on other projects, but have not yet had anything produced.#3 DWAYNE “THE ROCK” JOHNSON, MONSTER HUNTERA common point of complaint among action movie fans concerns the way that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has spent much of his post-WWE movie career starring in family-friendly fare like Tooth Fairy and Race to Witch Mountain. The argument is often made that Johnson is an obvious natural for more adult-friendly action movies (and as with all things, there’s a ticking clock about how much longer the 39-year-old will be able to stay in top shape). Recently, Dwayne Johnson has started to transition back into non-kids-movies with Fast Five, but his next two movies are Journey 2: The Mysterious Island and G.I. Joe: Retaliation, which are both arguably hybrid movies in terms of this argument. This week, Dwayne Johnson signed on to star in an adaptation of the independent comic book miniseries Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide for Simon Kinberg, producer of X-Men: First Class and the upcoming Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter and Neil Blomkamp’s Elysium. As the title suggests, Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide is “a comprehensive guide to hunt monsters [sic], the undead and unnatural beasts, and survive the confrontations.” There is not a director or even a screenwriter announced for the adaptation yet, so Monster Hunter’s Survival Guide can most likely be seen as a possible project for farther along in The Rock’s career.#4 THE HUMAN TORCH JOINS THE ICEMAN (BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARVEL COMICS)The Iceman is the name of a long-in-development adaptation of the Phillip Carlo serial killer biography Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer, about Richard “The Iceman” Kuklinski. Kuklinski (who was 6′ 5″ and 300 pounds) claimed to be responsible for as many as 200 murders over the course of a 30 year career, and died in prison in 2006 at the age of 70. The independent production has had a rocky road through casting. Mickey Rourke was originally supposed to star as Kuklinski, but he has since been replaced by Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road, Boardwalk Empire). Benicio Del Toro had been signed to play Kuklinski’s mob boss Roy Demeo, but Del Toro has since been replaced by Ray Liotta. Finally, James Franco had been attached to play Kuklinski’s hitman mentor, but Franco recently bailed on the project. And that brief history of the project brings us up to this week’s news, which is that Chris Evans (AKA Captain America and Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies) has signed on to replace James Franco as Robert “Mr. Softee” Pronge. Independent director Ariel Vromen (2005’s RX, 2006’s Danika) is preparing to start filming The Iceman in December in Detroit, working from a script he cowrote with his RX screenwriter Morgan Land. Shannon, Liotta and Evans will be joined by a supporting cast which includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Elias Koteas and David Schwimmer.#5 WHAT SCARLETT JOHANSSON REALLY WANTS IS TO DIRECT… SUMMER CROSSINGScarlett Johansson has announced plans to follow the career arc of so many other actors and actresses before her: she’s going to become a director. Johansson’s choice for her first movie as director will be an adaptation of Summer Crossing, Truman Capote’s first novella, which was long thought to be lost until eventually being published in 2005. Finally, it should be noted that this story actually broke late last week, but this is already a short Ketchup this week, so it’s being included here to help fill out the piece a bit. Actress-turned-screenwriter Tristine Skyler (1999’s Getting to Know You), who also has an adaptation of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar in development, adapted Capote’s novella. Set during the hot New York summer of 1945, Summer Crossing is the story of an 18-year-old debutante who decides not to join her parents on vacation in France, so that she can instead have a summer exploring her sexuality. There’s no word yet as to whether Johansson (currently 27) plans on also starring in Summer Crossing. Since there’s no way of really knowing whether or not Johansson has directing talent or not, this should be considered a borderline Fresh Development for now.Rotten Ideas of the Week#1 CHOPPING MALL GETTING A REMAKE THAT LEAVES OUT THE WHOLE PREMISE OF THE MOVIEFirst off, it should be noted that this pre-Thanksgiving shortened week was so light in news that not only was there only 7 stories (instead of 10, which are usually chosen from 15 to 40 total stories), but the Rotten Idea is for a movie that may not even be intended to get a theatrical release. However, there is something so inherently ridiculous about the premise of this remake that it has to be mentioned here. Kevin Bocarde, the producer of titles like Shark Swarm, Lightning Bug and The Curse of King Tut’s Tomb, is reuniting with FX-makeup-artist-turned-director Robert Hall, the director of Laid to Rest and Chromeskull: Laid to Rest 2 for a remake of the 1986 Roger Corman horror film Chopping Mall. Originally released as Killbots, Chopping Mall is about a group of teenagers who find themselves trapped in a shopping mall guarded by robotic security guards who start killing all of the teens. That premise is classic B movie cheese, but it’s not really what makes this a Rotten Idea (because really, who cares if Chopping Mall gets a remake?). No, the Rotten part is in how Robert Hall plans on remaking it. The new Chopping Mall will “downplay the science fiction elements and instead focus on a supernatural terror.” That’s right… a remake of a movie about killer robots is going to leave out the killer robots. Oy vey. Anyway… have a great Thanksgiving!For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"movies, screenings, elevated, Awards, movie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Martin-Scorsese-Will-Do-A-Serial-Killer-Film"},{"id":"47509202741758","title":"Weekly Ketchup: The Joker and Harley Quinn Confirmed for Suicide Squad","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: The Joker and Harley Quinn Confirmed for Suicide SquadPlus, new roles for Christoph Waltz, Robert De Niro, and Julia Roberts, as well as a Playmobil movie.by Greg Dean Schmitz | November 14, 2014 |  CommentsThis week’s Ketchup covers seven days of movie development news for such movies as King Arthur, Playmobil, Wonder Woman, the next James Bond movie, and new roles for Robert De Niro, Dwayne Johnson, and Julia Roberts.&nbsp;This Week’s Top StoryVILLAINOUS SWEETHEARTS JOKER AND HARLEY QUINN IN SUICIDE SQUADThis was a big week for casting news for Warner Bros’ DC Comics adaptation Suicide Squad, with the last seven days seeing the release of three different casting stories for that movie about super villains brought together as a team. The first story of the week also involved the most famous character and the biggest star of the three. Jared Leto is being “eyed” to star as Batman’s archenemy The Joker in Suicide Squad for director David Ayer (Training Day, Fury, End of Watch). Directly related to that news is the report this week that Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) has signed to costar as Harley Quinn, the Joker’s psychiatrist-turned-girlfriend. And finally, for a character that has nothing to do with either, there’s the assassin Deadshot, who might be played by Jai Courtney (Divergent, A Good Day to Die Hard). Suicide Squad is expected to feature an ensemble cast of various super villains, with Tom Hardy and Will Smith also in talks for unknown roles (although they might be Rick Flag and Captain Boomerang). Jesse Eisenberg may also reprise his role as Lex Luthor from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which will be released on March 25, 2016 before Suicide Squad is released later that summer on August 5, 2016.Fresh Developments This Week#1 BREAKING BAD DIRECTOR IN TALKS FOR WONDER WOMANThere was a time when a way to write, in code, that a movie was a potential train wreck was to combine the phrase “feature film debut” with “previously has only directed television.” Well, as you may have heard, we are in a new golden age of television, and that math no longer necessarily adds up. Take, for example, the news this week that TV producer/director Michelle McCLaren is now in talks with Warner Bros to make her feature film debut with Wonder Woman. That’s one way to tell the story, but another would be to say that Michelle McClaren was the director of such recent hours of television as four episodes of Game of Thrones, three episodes of The Walking Dead (including the S2 episode where Rick “killed” [SPOILER]), and a whopping 11 episodes of Breaking Bad (including four from S5 with some of the most important plot beats). For her work on Breaking Bad, Michelle McClaren has been Emmy-nominated twice as director, and won two Emmys as producer. Instead, most of the press has focused on McClaren’s gender (if she signs on, McClaren will be the second female director of a major comic book adaptation, after Lexi Alexander on Punisher: War Zone). Gal Gadot will star as Wonder Woman when the solo movie is released on June 23, 2017, after first appearing as the character in 2016 in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.&nbsp;#2 WILL CHRISTOPH WALTZ BE A VILLAIN IN THE NEXT JAMES BOND FILM?Or just a totally awesome and nice guy who just happens to be German (that *would* be a twist)? The news comes from Daily Mail columnist Baz Bamigboye (names are just plain cooler in the U.K.), who attempted to get an answer as to the nature of Waltz’s character (bad guy? good guy? somewhere-in-between?), and the answers he seemed to get varied between each (unidentified) source. Whatever the nature of his character, Christoph Waltz joins a growing cast which already includes Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, Lea Seydoux, Rory Kinnear, and Dave Bautista. Hopefully soon, we’ll get a title for “James Bond 24”, which will be directed by Sam Mendes, who made his Bond debut with Skyfall.&nbsp;#3 ROBERT DE NIRO IN TALKS TO PLAY J-LAW’S DAD IN JOYDirector David O. Russell has definitely established by now that he is believes in using a “production posse,” with Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, and Mark Wahlberg all having appeared in at least two of his films. If there’s one actress that most obviously represents this for Russell, it’s Jennifer Lawrence, who starred in his two most recent films (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle), and who will be starring in his next film, Joy, based on the true story of Joy Mangano, creator of the Miracle Mop (yes, there’s really going to be a “Miracle Mop” movie). This week, another acclaimed actor started talks which will bump him up to working with David O. Russell three times (in a row), and it’s Robert De Niro. If De Niro signs the deal, he will be playing the father of Jennifer Lawrence’s character, who started inventing gadgets when she was a teenager, and eventually became a HSN star by appearing on the network to pitch her own products.&nbsp;#4 JUDE LAW TAKES VILLAIN ROLE IN GUY RITCHIE’S KING ARTHURWarner Bros and director Guy Ritchie are preparing for production on what has long been planned as the first of a six movie King Arthur epic, and this week, we found out who is in talks to play the villain in that film. Having said that, that’s about all we know about Jude Law’s character, including whether this particular villain will just be in the first movie, appear in several, or all six. Another detail also came with this news, which is that Idris Elba has dropped out of the franchise, with other actors now being considered for the “mentor” role, which had been described as “Merlin-esque” (an odd distinction when the character could just be called “Merlin”). If he signs on, Jude Law will join a cast which already includes Charlie Hunnam as Arthur and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Guinevere. This will also be the third time that Jude Law and Guy Ritchie have worked together, after their two Sherlock Holmes movies together.&nbsp;#5 JULIA ROBERTS TO REUNITE WITH GEORGE CLOONEY FOR MONEY MONSTERThis was a big week for actors reuniting after previously working together on other movies. Another example of that involved George Clooney, who previously worked with Julia Roberts on Ocean’s Eleven, Ocean’s Twelve, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. Roberts and Unbroken star Jack O’Connell are both now in talks to join George Clooney in the movie Money Monster, which will be directed by Jodie Foster (Little Man Tate, The Beaver). Money Monster will be a “financial thriller” about the star (George Clooney) of a financial advice TV show (also called Money Monster, produced by Roberts’ character) who is held hostage on the air by a blue collar worker (O’Connell) in an effort to increase a stock’s value and save his family’s finances. Jack O’Connell also made the Weekly Ketchup last week for signing to star in Terry Gilliam’s long-awaited Don Quixote.Rotten Ideas of the Week#4 DWAYNE JOHNSON AND KEVIN HART JOIN ACTION COMEDY CENTRAL INTELLIGENCEThe success of the two Jump Street movies is reportedly leading other studios to start moving forward with their own comedies that revive the “buddy action comedy” subgenre. The latest example of this happening is New Line Cinema’s Central Intelligence, which is also a “class reunion” comedy about a high school athlete who is approached by a classmate who was bullied back in the day. The “twist” is that the former jock will be played by Kevin Hart, and the bullied kid is now an assassin for the CIA, as played by Dwayne Johnson. Central Intelligence will be directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose first film was well received (Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story), but whose second and third movies (The Mysteries of Pittsburgh and We’re the Millers) both have Rotten Tomatometer scores.&nbsp;#3 PLAYMOBIL TOYS TO GET THEIR OWN MOVIE, TOO (TAKE THAT, LEGO!)This writer doesn’t think that he ever gave it much thought, but apparently, within certain toy company circles, companies like LEGO and Playmobil are seen as direct competitors. Forced to consider it, there are similarities — one is Danish, one is German, and they both use little “people toys.” You can also often find both in highly used condition at garage sales and thrift stores. Anyway, presuming that the Playmobil people really see LEGO as their decades-long corporate competition, it’s easy to imagine lots of German exclamations (“Verdammt! Schweinhund! Fahrvergnügen!”) at the Playmobil board room as the box office figures came in each week earlier this year for The LEGO Movie. Even if that’s not true (regardless of how much fun this writer had imagining that scene), a Playmobil movie is still now in development. The $80 million animated feature will be a partnership between three French companies: Wild Bunch, Pathé, and ON Entertainment, which is also the animation house currently working on an adaptation of The Little Prince. The executive in charge of development on the Playmobil movie previously worked as head of story at DreamWorks on such movies as Shrek 2, Puss in Boots, and Monsters vs Aliens. Although the movie doesn’t currently have any sort of distribution in the USA, it’s being aimed at release in late 2017.&nbsp;#2 EDDIE MURPHY TO STAR AS COOK FOR DRIVING MISS DAISY DIRECTORWhen his publicist is promoting his new movies, director Bruce Beresford is almost always mentioned in the same sentence as Driving Miss Daisy, the movie that won the Best Picture Academy Award which did not go to Field of Dreams, My Left Foot, Dead Poets Society, or Born on the Fourth of July. Of Bruce Beresford’s last ten films as director, only 2002’s Evelyn has earned a Fresh Tomatometer score. For his next film, Bruce Beresford will be directing Cook, which has a premise that sounds a lot like Driving Miss Daisy. Eddie Murphy will be playing a cook hired by a dying man to work for his girlfriend and his daughter for a few months after his death, in a working relationship that ends up lasting for 15 years. The character of the daughter will be played by Britt Robertson, who will be seen next year as the star of Tomorrowland, along with George Clooney.&nbsp;#1 1001 ARABIAN NIGHTS TO GET GOTG-STYLE MOVIE FORTY THIEVESIt’s been going on since Garbo was gabby, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t remain worthy of notice: a very successful movie inspires imitators (people who say it’s flattering are probably the ones doing the flattering). 20th Century Fox is now developing a movie called Forty Thieves, which is described as “being in the vein of Guardians of the Galaxy and Pirates of the Caribbean,” but it’s more directly an adaptation of the folk tale “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves”, as commonly found in the collection of stories called One Thousand and One Nights (AKA Arabian Nights). Forty Thieves will be directed by Shawn Levy, whose filmography as director includes the three Night at the Museum movies, Real Steel, The Internship, and This is Where I Leave You. 20th Century Fox is currently meeting with various young actors (including Liam Hemsworth and Evan Peters) for the lead role of “Allen”, who is believed to be the Forty Thieves stand-in for the character of “Ali Baba.” Nothing much else is yet known about Forty Thieves, including the setting, but the name “Allen” sort of tells us that it’s probably not set in Medieval Arabia.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"Character, Apple, King, NYCC, king, Emmy, Fox, E3, animated, mockumentary, scene, story","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"weekly-ketchup-the-joker-and-harley-quinn-confirmed-for-suicide-squad"},{"id":"47509219197607","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in Les Miserables","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman in Les MiserablesPlus, a new Scorsese film and casting updates for Josh Brolin, Anne Hathway, and Taylor Lautner.by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 2, 2011 |  CommentsHollywood’s weekly news cycles have been very slow through most of August, and the buzz only got quieter this week before the Labor Day weekend. Things are so slow, that it was even difficult for this writer to figure out which story deserves to be the Top Story. There were only a total of 14 news stories (at all) to choose from for the week’s Top 10, which meant that a story had to be really obscure not to be included. This week’s hum drum announcements include new projects for Josh Brolin, Anne Hathaway, Ed Helms, Dwayne Johnson, Taylor Lautner, Zoe Saldana and director Martin Scorsese.This Week’s Top StoryANNE HATHAWAY AND HUGH JACKMAN TAKE THEIR MUSICAL ACT TO THE MOVIES: LES MISERABLESEver since their duet at the Oscars in 2009, there has been speculation about whether Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman will ever do a movie musical together. This week, that question was answered with the news that Anne Hathaway is set to join the cast of Les Miserables as Fantine, the doomed mother of Cosette. Les Miserables is of course an adaptation of the stage musical set during the French Revolution, based upon the novel by Victor Hugo. Director Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech, The Damned United) is lining up a star studded cast that is rumored to include Russell Crowe (replacing the earlier reported Paul Bettany) as Inspector Javert, and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter as the Thenardiers. Geoffrey Rush previously played Javert in the 1998 film Les Miserables which also costarred Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes. The casting of Cosette and Eponine is the next step, with Miranda Cosgrove (Nickelodeon’s iCarly), Lucy Hale (NBC’s Bionic Woman), Hayden Panettiere (NBC’s Heroes) and Emma Watson (Hermione of the Harry Potter films) being considered for either role. Filming of Les Miserables is expected to start in February, 2012 in England before Hugh Jackman proceeds to Canada for filming of The Wolverine. Les Miserables is a coproduction between Universal Pictures and Working Title Films.Fresh Developments This Week#1 MARTIN SCORSESE REMAKING A MOVIE THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH KENNY ROGERSDirector Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan (Body of Lies, Kingdom of Heaven) previously worked together on 2006’s The Departed. This week, both Scorsese and Monahan signed with Paramount Pictures to develop a remake of the 1974 James Caan addiction drama The Gambler, which was itself based upon a short novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. The Gambler told the story of a college professor struggling with an addiction to gambling on basketball scores. That movie, by the way, should not be confused with the series of TV movies starring Kenny Rogers that started in 1980. Paramount hopes that frequent Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio will star, but negotiations with DiCaprio haven’t yet started. This week, William Monahan was also revealed to be working with Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez on the script for Sin City 2.#2 SPIKE LEE HAS TRAPPED JOSH BROLIN IN HIS REMAKE OF OLDBOYJosh Brolin has signed with Mandate Pictures (Whip It, The Switch, Drag Me to Hell) to star in the English language remake of Park Chan-wook’s Korean action thriller Oldboy, which will be directed by Spike Lee (Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Inside Man). Josh Brolin will play a man who is kidnapped and kept hostage for 15 years until he is finally released and sets out to take his revenge. The screenplay was adapted by Mark Protosevich, whose past work includes Poseidon and cowriting duties on I Am Legend. Back when Steven Spielberg was attached to direct this remake a few years ago, Will Smith was to have been the star.#3 SCOTT PILGRIM AND BRIDESMAIDS COSTARS STEP UP FOR PITCH PERFECT LEAD ROLESAnna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson are young actresses currently best known for supporting roles in Twilight, Up in the Air, Scott Pilgrim Vs the World, and Bridesmaids. Anna Kendrick was in those first three films, and Rebel Wilson played Kristen Wiig’s British roommate in the last. Kendrick and Wilson are now signed with Universal Pictures to costar in the romantic comedy Pitch Perfect, set in the world of college a capella singing groups. Kendrick will be playing a rebellious goth girl who surprisingly becomes the singing group’s secret weapon in competitions. Since Pitch Perfect is also described as a romantic comedy, she presumably falls in love with someone too. Director Jason Moore, who directed the stage musical Avenue Q as well as episodes of Dawson’s Creek, Everwood and Brothers &amp; Sisters, will be making his feature film debut with Pitch Perfect. Filming of Pitch Perfect is scheduled to start this fall in New Orleans.#4 ED HELMS TO STAR IN REMAKE OF FRENCH COMEDY LE MACEd Helms, one of the Wolf Pack stars from The Hangover, has signed to star in the English language remake of the 2010 French comedy Le Mac, which will presumably have a different title (The Mac, perhaps?). Jose Garcia starred in Le Mac in the dual roles of a banker and the criminal mastermind pimp who is secretly his long lost twin brother (who the banker must impersonate to help the police with a case). The adaptation is being written by newcomer screenwriter Johnny Rosenthal. This remake is being produced by Ben Stiller’s Red Hour Films production company, which most recently produced 30 Minutes or Less in addition to several of Stiller’s past films (Zoolander, Tropic Thunder, etc). This remake is a borderline Fresh Development mostly because not enough is yet known to really damn it with a Rotten Idea label.Rotten Ideas of the Week#5 ZOE SALDANA SAYS SOMEDAY, SOMEDAY, SOMEDAY… DOMINIONAvatar and Star Trek star Zoe Saldana marked the first week of release for her new action film Colombiana by signing with Paramount Pictures to star in a supernatural thriller called Dominion. Although the premise is mostly being kept secret for now, what is known is that Zoe Saldana will play a woman who is half human and half angel. Saldana will also produce Dominion, which is based on a spec pitch by newcomer screenwriters Dean McCreary and Chester Hastings, who cowrote the short film Fanboy featuring Sam Raimi and J.K. Simmons as themselves. Dominion is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because of its status as yet another movie about angels.#4 NEW SCREENWRITER SNIKTS HIS PENS INTO THE WOLVERINEThe filming schedule for The Wolverine has reportedly been pushed back until the spring of 2012 (after Hugh Jackman wraps filming of Les Miserables). This change now allows time for a rewrite of the original script by Christopher McQuarrie (Valkyrie, The Usual Suspects). The new screenwriter will be Mark Bomback, who previously wrote Unstoppable, cowrote Live Free or Die Hard and Race to Witch Mountain and also has the Total Recall remake coming soon. The new script is expected to still be set in Japan, and feature a supporting cast of mostly Japanese or Japanese American actors except for the character of Viper, who’s described as a secretary for Japan’s Minister of Justice. In the comics, Viper (AKA Madame Hydra) is a long running villain for the Avengers who also blackmailed Wolverine into marrying her. The Wolverine will be directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, Knight and Day) in 2012 with filming expected to be mostly done in Vancouver with some filming also in Tokyo. The Wolverine has been a Rotten Idea pretty much since Darren Aronofsky left the project, and the contributions from one of the Live Free or Die Hard writers does little to change that.#3 NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM DIRECTOR RESURRECTS FRANKENSTEIN FOR 20TH CENTURY FOXFollowing delays for the studio’s planned remake of Fantastic Voyage, 20th Century Fox has signed director Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Date Night, Real Steel) for their entry in Hollywood’s race to see who can get a new Frankenstein movie made first. Fox’s Frankenstein is being written by Max Landis (John Landis’ son), who has a few other projects in the works but has not yet had a feature film produced and released. Landis’ script is described as being a “sci fi take” on Mary Shelley’s novel which “focuses on themes of friendship and redemption.” The other Frankenstein projects that Fox’s version is competing with include Guillermo del Toro’s long gestating project at Universal, Sony’s contemporary version, adaptations of The Casebook of Victor Frankenstein, This Dark Endeavor: The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein and Wake the Dead, starring Haley Joel Osment (which currently seems likely to be the first movie actually filmed and produced). This is one of the Rotten Ideas this week because Frankenstein and Night at the Museum really don’t belong in the same sentence together.#2 WILL SHARK BOY AND THE ROCK BE DAVID AND GOLIATH?The success and ongoing cult popularity of The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lava Girl and Twilight continue to buoy the career of Taylor Lautner. Taylor Lautner and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson are reportedly in negotiations to star in the ancient Hebrew war epic Goliath based upon the Biblical tale of the future King David (Lautner) and his struggles with the philistine warrior Goliath (Johnson). Director Scott Derrickson (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Exorcism of Emily Rose) signed on earlier this year to helm Goliath, which is being produced by two of the people behind The Twilight Saga. Lautner stands at a height of 5′ 10″, which makes him seem tall in comparison to most of his costars, but Dwayne Johnson will appropriately tower over Lautner too at a height of 6′ 5″. Although Johnson might indeed make a pretty great Goliath, the idea of Shark Boy playing the young King David earns this story its Rotten Idea tag.#1 DIE HARD 5 WILL BE A SEQUEL DIRECTED BY A REMAKE SPECIALIST20th Century Fox continued to keep the 5th entry in the Die Hard franchise on the fast track this week with the hiring of the film’s director. Irish director John Moore has made all of his movies to date for the studio, with an emphasis on remakes (The Omen, Flight of the Phoenix) that also included the video game adaptation Max Payne. Die Hard 5 will mostly be filmed in Russia, with Fox hoping that it can be wrapped before Bruce Willis moves on to star in the planned sequel to last year’s Red. Die Hard 5 is described as a father-son action adventure, and was written by screenwriter Skip Woods, who wrote the video game adaptation Hitman, as well as Swordfish, and shared cowriting duties on The A-Team and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. John Moore’s RT Tomatometer record is what earns Die Hard 5 its Most Rotten Idea of the Week status, though the idea of that limping franchise getting a fifth movie was most likely enough by itself.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via Facebook or a RT forum message.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"2017, All, Amazon, drama, video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Anne-Hathaway-and-Hugh-Jackman-in-Les-Miserables"},{"id":"47509238796122","title":"The Weekly Ketchup: New Bond Title, Golden Brad Bird, Del Toro To Direct Hobbits","content":"Weekly Ketchupvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Weekly Ketchup: New Bond Title, Golden Brad Bird, Del Toro To Direct HobbitsAlso: Another role for Shia, new pic of Will Smith as Hancock.by Nick Hershey | February 1, 2008 |  CommentsIn this week’s Ketchup, Bond 22 has a flashy new title, Brad Bird gets his just desserts for directing the highest rated film of 2007, and Shia LaBeouf is set to star as the last man on Earth.

Candy Land?Plus new projects for Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliamby Greg Dean Schmitz | February 6, 2009 |  CommentsThis week was chockful of so many movie announcements that the Weekly Ketchup could have been a top 20 instead of a top 10, but these jewels of the week include new movies for acclaimed directors Martin Scorsese and Terry Gilliam, sequels for Sex and the City and Bloodsport and a movie based on the Candy Land board game.#1 NEVER MIND GREEN HORNET, HERE COMES GREEN LANTERN!Coming off the upcoming Mel Gibson movie, Edge of Darkness, Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale) is in talks to direct Green Lantern, the outer space superhero project which Warner Bros is now tagging as their #1 priority among their various projects based on DC Comics characters (the western Jonah Hex is #2). The adventures of Green Lantern take place within a epic space opera scope comparable to Star Wars, as pilot Hal Jordan is entrusted with a power ring which allows him to form anything he can imagine out of an green power that is as strong as Jordan can keep his will resolute. The three screenwriters who are being credited as working on Green Lantern are Greg Berlanti (creator of TV’s Everwood), comics writer Marc Guggenheim (Aquaman, The Flash) and Michael Green, who like Guggenheim, has written various TV shows that Berlanti has produced. With Green Lantern given top priority, we should now hear some casting news for Hal Jordan, and the many other DC characters that this very positive script review suggests should be in the movie.#2 DANIEL DAY LEWIS AND MARTIN SCORSESE TO COLLABORATE A THIRD TIME ON SILENCEAlthough his latest film, Shutter Island (AKA Ashecliffe) won’t hit theaters until this October, director Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas) is already lining up his next project, which will be Silence, a project Scorsese has been eager to make for over a decade, long before he even acquired the rights to the Shusaku Endo novel in 2005. Adapted by Jay Cocks (De-Lovely; cowriter of Gangs of New York), Silence is the 17th century story of two Jesuit priests who encounter violence and prejudice when they travel to Japan to both locate their mentor and spread the word of Christianity. In various stages of negotation to star in Silence are Daniel Day-Lewis (who starred in Scorsese’s The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York), Benicio Del Toro and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y Tu Mama Tambien), although it’s not yet known if the missing priest will be played by Day-Lewis or Del Toro. Filming of Silence is expected to start later this year in New Zealand.#3 SEX AND THE CITY 2: IS OBSESSIVE SHOE COLLECTING RECESSION PROOF?Sure, there’s no script yet, but that apparently isn’t going to stop Sex and the City 2 from getting fast-tracked and produced in time for a planned Summer, 2010 release date. The four stars (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall) made the news a few years back about whether they would migrate from HBO to a movie version (mostly Kim Cattrall), but this time around, their collective casting is the first real news for the sequel. Michael Patrick King, who wrote, directed and coproduced the $152 million dollar hit will be back to do the same for the sequel.#4 THE HANSON BROTHERS RETURN: SLAP SHOT REMAKEThe genre of hockey movies is very spotty, populated mostly by the Mighty Ducks franchise, the star-studded 1999 flop that was Mystery, Alaska, the unapologetic patriotism of The Miracle and the 1977 Paul Newman-starring gem, Slap Shot. Which of those do you think Universal wants to remake? Dean Parisot (Galaxy Quest, the Fun with Dick and Jane remake) has been signed to direct the Slap Shot remake from a script by Peter Steinfeld (Be Cool; cowriter of 21). Slap Shot is the story of the coach of a losing minor league team, the Charlestown Chiefs, who attempts to bring them victory by turning the team into a gang of violent thugs on the ice, led by the possibly insane trio of the Hanson Brothers. Something that’s interesting about that Variety article is that it makes note of the Internet furor over the idea of a Slap Shot remake, and points out the success of Adam Sandler’s remake of The Longest Yard, showing that the writer doesn’t get that people don’t have the same kind of affection for Burt Reynold’s The Longest Yard as they do for Slap Shot.#5 BLOODSPORT 2: BLOODIER, SPORTIERI’ve not yet seen JCVD, but the buzz is that it is evidence that Jean-Claude Van Damme totally gets his role in the world, and basically pops the balloon of anyone who will ever want to make a joke about him ever again. And so, I will give the Muscles from Brussels some respect and treat this story completely seriously. No zingers on this one! Talking to Total Film, Van Damme revealed that he has plans to make a “true sequel” to Bloodsport, the first movie he starred in. Let me just say right here that whatever I thought of JCVD’s later work, Bloodsport was indeed a very well done, kick ass martial arts movie. Van Damme’s plan is to ignore the three sequels that he didn’t star in, and tell the story of Frank Dux 20 years later (a la The Wrestler?), as “a complete bum, maybe abusing his son” and “on drugs.” JCVD is encountering some resistance to the concept, but I think it sounds really intriguing.#6 HASBRO MOVIES: TRANSFORMERS, G.I. JOE AND NOW, CANDY LAND?The first movie to come out of the deal between Universal and Hasbro to make movies based on their classic board games appears to be Candy Land, the game that Wikipedia says has “no optimal strategy, or indeed any decision making.” That sounds like a great game for someone who would greenlight a Candy Land movie. In Candy Land, players take on the role of a gingerbread man as he travels through locations like Chocolate Swamp and Candy Cane Forest, as they learn how to tell colors apart, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Kevin Lima (Enchanted, A Goofy Movie) will direct from a script by Etan Cohen (Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa; cowriter of Tropic Thunder). Yes, one of the Tropic Thunder writers is scripting the Candy Land movie, though I’m not sure if that means someone at Universal has a brilliant sense of irony, or totally does not.#7 YOUNG DISNEY STARS TO STAR IN FOX’S BEEZUS AND RAMONAThe long-in-development movie version of Beverly Cleary’s popular series of novels aimed at young girls, Ramona, has had its focus changed slightly to adapt first Beezus and Ramona, which Cleary wrote in 1955 before the seven books in which Ramona is the main title character. In casting the movie, Fox 2000 has managed a coup of sorts, as both Selena Gomez (star of Wizards of Waverly Place) as Beatrice/Beezus and Joey King (supporting role in The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody) as Ramona are coming from shows on the popular Disney Channel. Beezus and Ramona is the story of how a girl named Beatrice (AKA Beezus) learns to deal with her annoying little sister, Ramona. Elizabeth Allen (Aquamarine) is directing from a script by Laurie Craig (the parrot comedy Paulie) and Nick Pustay (2007’s Camille). Filming starts later this spring, and 20th Century Fox has set a release date for Beezus and Ramona of March 19th, 2010.#8 TERRY GILLIAM RETURNING TO THE MEANING OF LIFE WITH ZERO THEOREMWe’re still waiting to see Heath Ledger’s last film, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, directed by Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam, but Gilliam is already preparing for his next project, Zero Theorem. Billy Bob Thornton will star in Zero Theorem as a reclusive computer genius who finds himself wracked with existential angst while working on a project which he hopes will either produce the answer to the meaning of life, or prove that there isn’t one. Considering how often Gilliam’s attempts to get movies made have hit brick walls, it’s nice to see two of his projects coming together so closely together. Filming of Zero Theorem is scheduled to start in May.#9 CAMILLA BELLE TO BE MARY, MOTHER OF CHRISTIt’s only been a little over two years since Keisha Castle-Hughes (Whale Rider) starred as the Virgin Mary in The Nativity Story, but the greatest story ever told is going to get told again. Camilla Belle (10,000 B.C., Push) has signed to play the title character in Mary, Mother of Christ, which MGM plans to release on Good Friday (April 2nd), 2010. Other cast members are expected to include Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (as both Gabriel and Lucifer), Jessica Lange, Peter O’Toole and as King Herod, Al Pacino (who also signed this week to play the lead in King Lear). Alejandro Agresti (The Lake House) is directing, and filming is scheduled to start in Morocco in May.#10 ORLANDO BLOOM TO CROSS THE BORDEROrlando Bloom, Vincent Cassel and Olga Kurylenko have signed on to star in The Cross, a futuristic sci-fi thriller to be directed by Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Lord of War). Set in the near future, The Cross is the story of a man (Bloom) who dares to cross a mysterious, forbidden border near his town, with Cassel playing the guard who is out to stop him. The story sounds a bit like the premise of M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village, and considering that Andrew Niccol also wrote The Truman Show, here’s hoping that it doesn’t turn out that what’s on the other side of the border isn’t something like a suburban highway or a big blue wall. Filming starts in July in Australia on a budget of $24 million.For more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS through his MySpace page or via a RT forum message and Greg also blogs about the TV show Lost, at TwoLosties.Blogspot.com.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"BAFTA, Crunchyroll, Kids, spanish, Originals, Winter, Guide, pirates, Crackle, Pop","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Green-Lights-for-Green-Lantern-and-Candy-Land"},{"id":"47617223245208","title":"New on Hulu in May 2021","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on Hulu in May 2021The third and final season of Shrill, psychological horror film Saint Maud, and season 1 of Marvel's M.O.D.O.K. are among the new titles premiering on Hulu in May.by Jean Bentley | April 19, 2021 |  CommentsThe weather’s getting warmer, but don’t worry if you’re not quite prepared to face the outside world just yet. Hulu has you covered in May with a slew of premieres, including the complete final season of Aidy Bryant’s Shrill, the debut of Marvel animated series M.O.D.O.K., and the fifth season premiere of Freeform’s The Bold Type.On the film side, the streaming service will debut original film Plan B, about high school BFFs on the hunt for the morning after pill, plus some ’90s rom-com classics (How Stella Got Her Groove Back, One Fine Day), 2016 South Korean zombie film Train to Busan, and more.

Caught off guard by the presence of a woman on a military flight, the crew tests Maude’s every move. Just as her quick wit is winning them over, strange happenings and holes in her backstory incite paranoia surrounding her true mission. But this crew has more to fear… lurking in the shadows, something sinister is tearing at the heart of the plane. Trapped between an oncoming air ambush and an evil lurking within, Maude must push beyond her limits to save the hapless crew and protect her mysterious cargo.Critics Consensus: Part creature feature, part war movie, and part social commentary, Shadow in the Cloud doesn’t always blend its ingredients evenly — but it’s frequently pulpy fun.Premiere Date:&nbsp;May 5, 2021Shrill: Season 3 (2020) 87%Description: Season 3 of Shrill finds Annie (Aidy Bryant) energized by her breakup with dud boyfriend Ryan and her newfound momentum at work. Annie feels like everything is finally falling into place for her, but does she actually know what she really wants?Premiere Date:&nbsp;May&nbsp;7, 2021Saint Maud (2020) 93%Description: The debut film from writer-director Rose Glass, Saint Maud is a chilling and boldly original vision of faith, madness, and salvation in a fallen world. Maud, a newly devout hospice nurse, becomes obsessed with saving her dying patient’s soul — but sinister forces, and her own sinful past, threaten to put an end to her holy calling.Critics Consensus: A brilliantly unsettling blend of body horror and psychological thriller, Saint Maud marks an impressive debut for writer-director Glass.Premiere Date:&nbsp;May 13, 2021Supernova (2021) 88%Description: Sam (Colin Firth) and Tusker (Stanley Tucci), partners of twenty years, are travelling across England in their old campervan visiting friends, family and places from their past.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Included in the mix are new roles for two of the stars of Game of Thrones, sequel news for Red 3, and a new role for one of the stars of that franchise, Morgan Freeman.  All that and a remake of Timecop.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nFOX ENGAGES MARVEL IN THE GREAT QUICKSILVER RUSH OF ’13: X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST VS THE AVENGERS 2\n\nThis week gave us a pretty solid example of why maybe it’s not always the best thing for the creatives involved in highly anticipated genre projects to try to give the “fans” all of the hot details about movies that haven’t even started filming yet.  Those who have been following The Avengers 2 closely will remember that in the last couple of weeks, Joss Whedon first hinted, and then confirmed, that he was planning on using the sibling heroes Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who are also the mutant children of Magneto.  And it’s that last point that might have been a reason for Joss Whedon to hold off on revealing his plans until after a certain 20th Century Fox movie finished filming.  Because, sure enough, director Bryan Singer revealed this week that a young actor named Evan Peters has been cast as the super speedster Quicksilver in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  Almost overnight, Quicksilver has gone from being a Marvel superhero that most non-comic book fans have probably never heard of to being a potential major stumbling block for The Avengers 2.  The question for Joss Whedon is whether he just ignores the X-Men use of the character, or does a last minute rewrite to replace Quicksilver with some other character (or maybe just uses Scarlet Witch by herself instead of half a sister-brother team).  Speaking of which, when the Scarlet Witch news first broke, there was talk that Marvel Studios was using actress Saoirse Ronan (The Host, The Lovely Bones) as the model for casting (ie, trying to get actresses “like” Saoirse Ronan).  Or maybe they could just cast Saoirse Ronan.  The question was posed to the actress this week, and her reply was, “Yeah, of course I would.  I love Joss and I love those films, and I love his handle on them and how he portrayed these kinds of superheroes…. So yeah, I’d love to be in it.”  The hex bolt is back in Marvel’s corner.  X-Men: Days of Future Past is scheduled for July 18, 2014, some ten months before the May 1, 2015 release date for The Avengers 2.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 PETER DINKLAGE AS HOP FROG WILL BE BATTERED AND BRUISED, BUT THE KING WILL BE AMUSED\n\nSomewhere out there there is someone who can get that reference sans Google.  Anyway, in what may be a case of casting destiny, Peter Dinklage has signed on to play a court jester (sort of) in the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation Hop Frog.  Dinklage will play a puppeteer who poses as a court jester to get his revenge on the knights who murdered his uncle and kidnapped the woman he loves.  Hop Frog will be directed by Mark Palansky, whose only RT Tomatometer entry is the 2006 film Penelope, which only scored a mixed rating of 53%.  However, this is a movie in which Peter Dinklage (arguably the actor that makes Game of Thrones work) actually gets to star and be awesome for the entirety of a movie, and so, that sort of tips the scale back towards this being a Fresh story.  It’s a weak week, so it’s even the top one.\n\n\n\t\n#2 FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA TO DIRECT ANOTHER 20TH CENTURY ITALIAN AMERICAN FAMILY EPIC\n\nThe down side to directing two of the greatest films in American cinematic history when you’re 33 and 35 is that there’s a very good chance that the rest of your life will be spent never quite living up to that accomplishment.  That specific example is Francis Ford Coppola, who directed The Godfather and The Godfather Part II in 1972 and 1974 (which makes him born in 1939, which becomes important in this story very soon).  After years spent trying to get an ambitious movie called Megalopolis made, Coppola ended up spending the last decade directing little movies like Youth Without Youth, Tetro, and Twixt.  For his next film, Coppola may finally be returning to his roots, as it will be about an Italian American family set across the span from the 1930s to the 1960s.  The untitled drama is also said to be a coming-of-age story that focuses on a boy and girl in their late teens.  Now, let’s go back and consider that Coppola himself was born in 1939, which suggests that the boy in question might be himself (Coppola was in his late teens in the late 1950s).  Francis Ford Coppola has set up a production office on the Paramount Pictures lot, but as of right now, the studio behind The Godfather is not directly involved.\n\n\n\t\n#3 BANDERAS, SHEEN, AND PAULO FROM LOST HEADLINE THE CHILEAN MINERS DRAMA THE 33\n\nMost of the big announcements at Cannes happened last week, but there’s a few stragglers.  One of them concerns The 33, the previously announced drama about the Chilean miners who were trapped for 69 days back in 2010.  We now know who three of the stars of that movie will be.  The headliner will be Antonio Banderas, who will play the charismatic miner Mario Sepulveda, known to his coworkers as “Super Mario” (no word yet as to whether he wears red overalls).  The cast will be an ensemble, and two of those actors will be Martin Sheen and Rodrigo Santoro, who played Xerxes in 300, but is more recognizable to LOST fans as Paulo from Season 3.  The 33 will be directed by Mexican director Patricia Riggen.\n\n\t\n#4 THIS WEEK IN SPY MOVIE NEWS: RED 3 AND TOM CRUISE DISOWNS HIS U.N.C.L.E.\n\nThe sequel Red 2 doesn’t open in theaters for another two months yet on July 19, but Summit Entertainment is already starting development on Red 3.  The Lionsgate subsidiary is doing that by hiring screenwriters Jon and Erich Hoeber, who also worked on the first two movies.  There’s no announced deals yet with any of the various franchise stars, such as Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, or Catherine Zeta-Jones.  However, what is known is that Red 3 will involve the retired “black ops” agents teaming up to track down a loose portable nuclear device.  Another (would be) spy franchise that hit a major obstacle this week is Warner Bros’ adaptation of the 1960s TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  Tom Cruise was to have starred as the American spy Napoleon Solo (opposite Armie Hammer as his Russian counterpart), but this week, Tom Cruise dropped out completely to focus instead on Mission: Impossible 5.  Warner Bros still hopes to start filming in the fall, but the hunt is back on because Tom is back on as (Ethan) Hunt.\n\n\n\t\n#5 EMILIA CLARKE FROM GAME OF THRONES PLAYS SHAKESPEARE’S JULIET IN ROSALINE\n\nThis was a good week for fans of the stars of Game of Thrones, as Emilia Clarke (who plays Daenerys Targaryen) has been cast as Shakespeare’s Juliet in Rosaline.  The title character will be played by Allison Williams (from HBO’s Girls), and will be the first girlfriend of Romeo (played by Dave Franco from 21 Jump Street), in a bit of revisionist storytelling that changes the focus in a style that’s being compared to the Broadway musical Wicked.  Universal Pictures has picked up Rosaline from Fox 2000 out of turnaround.  The script was written by the team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who also worked on the Sundance hits (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now.\n\n\t\n#6 MORGAN FREEMAN AND DIANE KEATON STAR IN COMEDY LIFE ITSELF\n\nMorgan Freeman and Diane Keaton are signed to star in the “heartwarming comedy” Life Itself for director Richard Loncraine (Wimbledon, Richard III, The Special Relationship).  Freeman and Keaton will play a long-married New York couple whose lives are disrupted when they become engaged in a bidding war for the sale of their apartment.  Unfortunately, Life Itself will probably be released in an “off month” like February, April, or September, and three months later, most people will have forgotten the movie ever existed.\n\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\n#3 LIAM HEMSWORTH TO TEST OUT AURORA RISING\n\nLiam Hemsworth (from The Hunger Games and also Thor’s non-Loki brother) has been cast in the action movie Aurora Rising.  Hemsworth will play a California surfer who becomes a military fighter pilot who is eventually recruited to be a test pilot for a new generation of aircraft just before a new international conflict begins.  The script was written by screenwriter Christian Gudegast, cowriter of A Man Apart, and it’s that movie’s very low RT Tomatometer score that mostly justified this being one of the Rotten Ideas of the Week.\n\n\t\n#2 ZAC EFRON IN NARC: NEITHER A RAY LIOTTA REMAKE OR AN ADAPTATION OF THE 1980S ARCADE GAME\n\n20th Century Fox has acquired the life rights behind a true crime project called Narc, with Zac Efron attached to star.  Narc will tell the true story of a college student who used his status as a fraternity president and la crosse team captain to become an informant for the local police narcotics team. Narc is one of the week’s Rotten Ideas mostly because of Zac Efron’s RT Tomatometer scores.  However, as the story title alluded, it’s also because Narc was already the title of a pretty great Ray Liotta/Jason Patric movie.  Go rent that one instead.\n\n\n\t\n#1 REBOOTS ARE STILL A “THING”… NEXT UP: TIMECOP?\n\nBy this point, there’s almost no titles from the 1980s that haven’t either been remade/rebooted, or are lingering in development.  And so, the next hot decade for this trend is the 1990s.  And a movie that came out in 1994 was Timecop, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a cop of time.  Universal Pictures has started development on a remake of Timecop, and the funniest thing about this story might be how every story about it stresses that Jean-Claude Van Damme will not be involved in any capacity.  Timecop also has the distinction of being one of those movies (like say, The Mask or Men in Black) that was technically based upon a comic book, but almost no one knew that at the time.  Anyway, Timecop is pretty much exactly what you would expect it to be: it’s the distant future of 2004 where cops regulate the use of time travel, and there’s a bad guy who uses time travel for his nefarious deeds, and then JCVD kicks time traveling bad guys… IN THE FACE.  And now it’s going to happen all over again.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Fox-and-Marvel-Both-Courting-Quicksilver-for-Comic-Blockbusters"},{"id":"47509213423217","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Dreamworks Announces 12-film Schedule for 2013-2016","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Dreamworks Announces 12-film Schedule for 2013-2016\n                        Plus, new roles for Al Pacino, Tobey Maguire, and Elizabeth Banks, plus a Brave Little Toaster remake.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | September 14, 2012                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis week, Hollywood finally started to recover from their long two-week lapse in movie development news due to the end of summer, including Labor Day weekend.  Bouncing back from this near hiatus, Hollywood has given us new movies featuring Brad Pitt, three different stories involving CGI animation, a few unnecessary remakes, and biopics about the lives of Emily Dickinson and Coach Joe Paterno.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nDREAMWORKS ANIMATION ANNOUNCES AN AMBITIOUS TWELVE FILM SCHEDULE FOR 2013-2016\n\nNormally, animated films are announced one at a time (like most movies), but this week DreamWorks Animation revealed their release schedule for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and in doing so, provided a more concrete idea of what they’re planning.  In the year 2013, DreamWorks will give us the caveman comedy The Croods, the snail racing adventure Turbo, and the 1960s TV cartoon adaptation Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman, all of which were previously announced, including production images you can Google.  In 2014, DreamWorks’ plans include Me and My Shadow (which blends traditional animation with CGI), the sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2, and Happy Smekday!, which is an adaptation of a 2011 children’s book (The True Meaning of Smekday) about a future in which the human race has been enslaved by an alien race.  For 2015, there’s the spinoff The Penguins of Madagascar, the toy adaptation Trolls about those creepy little bug eyed dolls that were popular back in the 1960s-1970s, and B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations, which is speculated to be sort of like Men in Black but for ghosts, spirits and wraiths.  Finally, there are just two movies slated for 2016 (with a third probably not yet announced), which are Kung Fu Panda 3 and How to Train Your Dragon 3.\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 BRAD PITT WANTS TO TELL YOU ABOUT IBM AND THE HOLOCAUST\n\nBrad Pitt is producing a feature film adaptation of the NYT bestselling non-fiction book IBM and the Holocaust, which as the title suggests, is about how IBM assisted the Nazis in the 1930s in identifying the Jews to help facilitate their extermination.  The feelgood movie of the year, this probably will not be.   An adaptation of the book had formerly been silently in development at HBO, but now Brad Pitt is shopping it around to studios and production companies as a theatrical feature film that he may star in, to help sell what is obviously a very heavy and more-than-potentially controversial subject.  While it was at HBO, the script was adapted by Marcus Hinchey, cowriter of the 2010 Ryan Gosling film All Good Things, and it appears that it is still Hinchey’s script that Brad Pitt is shopping around town.  IBM and the Holocaust isn’t, however, the only story set in 1930s Germany that made the news this week.  Although he was just mentioned two weeks ago in this column as the director of a comedy called Will, Michel Hazanavicius made the news again this week for being in talks to direct another film.  Tom Hanks is producing and will star in In the Garden of Beasts, which is an adaptation of a non-fiction book about the U.S. ambassador to Germany during the late 1930s.  Natalie Portman is also in consideration to play the daughter of the ambassador, who will be played by Hanks himself.\n\n\n\t\n#2 THAT SEQUEL TO HOPE AND GLORY THE WORLD’S BEEN CLAMORING FOR FINALLY ARRIVES AS QUEEN AND COUNTRY\n\nThere are certain genres of movies that are particularly conducive to sequels, like horror flicks, comedies, superhero movies, etc.  Decidedly unlike any of those is the 1987 family dramedy Hope and Glory, which was written and directed by John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) about his own childhood experience during the Blitz in London during WWII.  That film will be celebrating its 25th anniversary this November, and at the same time, Boorman will be continuing to work on a sequel to be called Queen and Country.  Caleb Landry Jones (Banshee from X-Men: First Class) has been cast as the older Bill Rowan in a story set during the Korean War that will also reference Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1952.   Filming of Queen and Country is expected to start soon, and then Caleb Landry Jones will reunite again with director John Boorman on a science fiction project called Broken Dream.\n\n\n\t\n#3 UNIVERSAL PICTURES IS LITERALLY DOUBLING DOWN ON SEQUELS\n\nThis story is more about the big picture, but it does include a couple of details about specific movies.  The headline here is that the CEO of NBC/Universal (Steve Burke) said this week that Universal Pictures is going to focus in the near future more on “franchises and animation.” Two sequels that were mentioned as examples were the fifth film in the Bourne franchise (which is rumored to possibly feature both Jeremy Renner and Matt Damon), and Ted 2, the sequel to this summer’s hit from Seth McFarlane and Mark Wahlberg.   This emphasis on sequels at Universal may have been predictable when one considers how quickly Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall went from being possibly forever shelved to being cast and in production within just a few months. As for the animation half of this story, Universal Pictures is expected to ramp up their animated slate from two movies every three years to two movies every year.  The bulk (indeed, probably the entirety) of those animated movies are expected to come from Illumination Entertainment. Illumination certainly has enough projects in development to meet this new demand, including The Addams Family, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Curious George, Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat, Emily the Strange, and Woody Woodpecker.\n\n\n\t\n#4 CYNTHIA NIXON: FROM SEX AND THE CITY TO PLAYING EMILY DICKINSON IN A QUIET PASSION\n\nDirector/screenwriter Terence Davies (The House of Mirth, The Deep Blue Sea) recently wrote a screenplay about the life of 19th century poet Emily Dickinson called A Quiet Passion, with a very specific actress in mind.  This week in Toronto, it was announced that the actress was Cynthia Nixon (Miranda from Sex and the City), and that she has signed on to star in the independent biopic drama.  The film will cover Dickinson’s entire life “from precocious schoolgirl to the tortured recluse who saw only seven of her more than 1,000 poems pubished in her lifetime.”   And now, let’s finish this story with a quote from the 2009 Robin Williams movie, World’s Greatest Dad, responding to a question from a student about whether Emily Dickinson was “hot:” “She was a Victorian.  If you like your buttoned-down girls, she was one of them.”  Quoting Bobcat Goldthwait about whether Emily Dickinson was hot was why the Internet was given to us.\n\n\n\t\n#5 TOBEY MAGUIRE AND FOX ANIMATION TEAM UP FOR CARDBOARD\n\nOnce upon a time, there was no fancy CGI animation, and children usually had to imagine their own wonders.  Now, Tobey Maguire is teaming up with Fox Animation to produce a CGI animated movie about that exact topic, which of course, has the potential to be ironic, but only if the finished film isn’t aware of that very contradiction.  Cardboard will be an adaptation of a graphic novel by Doug TenNapel about a little boy whose broke father gives him a cardboard box for his birthday, which the boy then imagines comes to life, leading to an adventure of the imagination.  Tobey Maguire might also provide his voice (probably as the father?).  Cardboard, if it moves forward, is being eyed as a possible directing job for Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots). Cardboard is the third project that Doug TenNapel has sold to Hollywood, after two adaptations in development at Disney called Ghostopolis and Monster Zoo.\n\n\n\t\n#6 AL PACINO GOES FROM JACK KEVORKIAN TO JOE PATERNO\n\nAl Pacino may have thought he played a divisive real life character when he starred in HBO’s You Don’t Know Jack as Dr. Jack Kevorkian, but the movie that was announced this week might make that look like… a movie that isn’t controversial.  Al Pacino’s name is attached to a film project that is being shopped around Hollywood that is based on the currently bestselling book Paterno by Joe Posanski, about the life of longtime Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.  Ever since his death, there have been expectations that Paterno’s story would be adapted as a feature film eventually, basically because his story so closely matches a traditional three-act character arc. Paterno became “the winningest coach in college football history,” and then just as his legacy seemed entirely ensured, a horrible scandal brought it all down, to the point that Penn State actually removed his statue recently.  This writer could get into more detail as to what the film’s third act will probably entail, but he just ate, thanks.  There’s no writer or director attached yet, and as of this writing, it’s still only being shopped around.  As for the idea itself of Pacino playing Paterno… well, they do sort of resemble each other, and their names are similar.\n\n\n\t\n#7 ELIZABETH BANKS AND DIANE LANE KNOW EVERY SECRET THING\n\nIndependent documentary filmmaker Amy Berg (Deliver Us from Evil, West of Memphis) is making the transition to independent drama with a crime story called Every Secret Thing, to be produced by actress Frances McDormand.  Elizabeth Banks and Diane Lane are attached to star, but it’s unclear what their roles will be, as the premise seems to describe lead characters who are much younger than they are: “At 11-years-old, Ronnie and Alice were convicted for the murder of a baby and were incarcerated until they turned 18. Now newly released and replete with psychological problems, each attempts to adjust to life outside juvenile detention… when children start to go missing. As the police turn their attention to Ronnie and Alice, the mystery surrounding the original murder and their roles in it takes the fore.”  Filming of Every Secret Thing is scheduled to start in February, 2013.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#2 BORN FREE AND BRAVE LITTLE TOASTER BOTH TO GET UNNECESSARY REMAKES\n\nThis story concerns two family friendly movies that were released in 1966 and 1987.  Let me inject a little autobiographical information here: as someone born in 1970, this writer was born too late to experience the pop culture sensation that was Born Free directly, and by the time Brave Little Toaster came out, I was too old to claim that it was an important part of my childhood (I was 17).  The reason this gets mentioned is that most of the online writers who covered this news the week that both properties are being targeted for remakes by the same company seem to really treasure Brave Little Toaster as part of their youth.  Whereas, this specific writer (me), is stuck in the middle, and quite frankly, I’m actually more familiar with Born Free because it was rerun on TV quite a bit during the 1970s.  Anyway, here’s the very brief facts:  Born Free was released in 1966, and told the true story of a couple in Africa who raised an orphaned lion cub to eventually become Elsa the Lioness, who is released happily back into the wild (presumably).  This week brought the news that producer Steve Waterman, one of the people behind both the Stuart Little and Alvin and the Chipmunks film franchises, wants to remake Born Free as a movie told from the perspective of Elsa the Lioness herself.  As for Brave Little Toaster (the original of which was one of the first films that Pixar’s John Lasseter was involved with), the plan appears to be to update the animation as a combination of CGI and live action.  The story appears to be about five household appliances going off on an adventure; at least, that’s what I read on Wikipedia, to be completely honest.   Regardless, the idea of Born Free and/or Brave Little Toaster being updated all Alvin and the Chipmunks style doesn’t seem like it could possibly be considered a “fresh development,” and so here we are.\n\n\n\t\n#1 ALL OF ME, WHY MUST THEY REMAKE ALL OF ME? CAN’T THEY SEE, IT’S A ROTTEN I-DE-A?\n\nDreamWorks is “quietly” developing a remake of the 1984 comedy hit All of Me, about Lily Tomlin’s ghost possessing the body of Steve Martin.  All of Me was also directed by Carl Reiner, and currently has a RT Tomatometer score of 90%.  This isn’t the first time a studio considered remaking the film; at one time, New Line Cinema almost made one that would have starred Queen Latifah, back in the era when Queen Latifah regularly headlined major studio comedies.  Whatever one thinks of that, the DreamWorks remake has an even lamer twist.  In this remake, instead of it being the ghost of a woman inside a man, it would be a ghost of a man inside of a man.  In other words, the premise is being fundamentally changed to the point where it no longer even resembles All of Me at all.  However, the title would remain the same, and the legacy of the original film would still be tainted.  The screenwriters of this All of Me remake are Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, whose recent film was The Vow, which is “Rotten” on the RT Tomatometer with a score of 30%.\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"criterion, TV, Film, tv, Hallmark, deadpool, Nat, live","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Dreamworks-Announces-12film-Schedule-for-20132016"},{"id":"47508706400276","title":"The 22 Worst Christmas Movies Ever: The Rottenest Holiday Films Of All Time","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                \nThe Worst Christmas Movies\nFrom painful family reunions to sequels no child asked for to multiple Vince Vaughn and Tim Allen vehicles, these are all the Christmas films that scored less than 30% on the Tomatometer. And to make sure these movies landed on enough critics’ naughty lists to be deemed truly universally loathed, every entry had to have at least 20 reviews for inclusion. This leaves the likes of Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas and Nativity 3: Dude, Where’s My Donkey?! out in the cold, but makes plenty of space for Home Alone 3, Christmas With the Kranks, and Deck the Halls.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

In particular, the Sundance Midnight program has a bit of a reputation behind it; it’s where we first saw films like&nbsp;His House, Hereditary, The Babadook, Get Out, and even The Blair Witch Project. This year, however, it was possible to find your favorite new genre film across the entire program, be it a documentary, an animated film, or a new Nicolas Cage extravaganza of weirdness.Let the fancy awards watchers worry about what movie from the festival will go on to win trophies. We’re here to round up the weird, creepy, scary, bizarre genre movies from this year’s program that are likely to make a big impression when they get released. 67% The Blazing World (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Part&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland, part giallo-inspired nightmare, the feature directorial debut of&nbsp;Carlson Young&nbsp;is a strong first impression starring the always-deliciously-evil&nbsp;Udo Kier&nbsp;as an enigmatic dream guide. It’s a film bursting with imagination and a unique visual style, and enough bright reds to satisfy fans of&nbsp;Dario Argento.Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro&nbsp;praises Young’s debut, describing the film as “bold, ambitious, and confident, and refusing to adhere to commercial conformity.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;Matt Donato of What to Watch&nbsp;celebrates the film’s cinematography&nbsp;and fantasy atmosphere, writing, “The camera glides in an unconscious state and draws the most candy-coated, delightfully whimsical hues from a movie that might as well take place in the Gumdrop Forest. What do you get? A tickled-transcendent collaboration of talents that’s en-vogue, saccharine-sweet, and establishes world building in a fraction of the time most other films require.”Then there’s Udo Kier himself, a legend in horror filmmaking who plays a creepy, mysterious entity in the film.&nbsp;Nerdist’s Kyle Anderson&nbsp;writes of the actor, “Udo Kier gives exactly the kind of scary Udo Kier performance you want. An excellent casting choice to represent literal inner demons.” 87% Censor (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)The 1980s were a golden age for horror fans, with the birth of home video allowing bold new voices to defy censorship and conventional distribution — leading to the “video nasty” era of British horror cinema. But what if a film looked eerily similar to the disappearance of your own sister years prior? Censor blurs the lines between fiction and reality in a feature debut that heralds the arrival of a brave new voice in horror, and a love letter to a bygone era of cinema.The best-reviewed horror film out of the festival so far, Censor is being declared “the future of British filmmaking,” by the likes of Little White Lies’ Hannah Woodhead. Only time will tell if the hype is real, but for now, audiences can look forward to a confident feature debut by Prano Bailey-Bond&nbsp;and a captivating, blood-soaked performance by Raised by Wolves’ Niamh Algar. Critics are also praising the film’s graceful and nuanced approach to the debate of violence in film. Daily Grindhouse’s Mary Beth McAndrews writes, “Bailey-Bond contrasts over-the-top violent images in these films with violence shown on the news, as if exaggerated fictional violence is somehow worse than the horrific events that unfold in the world on a daily basis.” 87% Coming Home in the Dark (2021)(Photo by Goldfish Creative courtesy of Sundance Institute)Sometimes, a film is so intense that even the festival programmers warn the audience about what they’re about to watch.&nbsp;Coming Home in the Dark&nbsp;is definitely not for the faint of heart. Horror films have a unique ability to comment on the darkest, most unspeakable parts of the human condition while still delivering entertaining and thrilling rides, and this film definitely gets to some dark places.Early reactions from critics describe this film as&nbsp;“bleak, tense, and often unshakable,”&nbsp;as Chris Evangelista wrote for SlashFilm. In a tight 90 minutes,&nbsp;James Ashcroft&nbsp;delivers an anxiety-inducing film&nbsp;you simply can’t take your eyes off of, one that is frequently unpleasant but never boring.&nbsp;What to Watch’s Matt Donato&nbsp;writes, “Ashcroft executes horrors of commonplace means through barbarism, revenge, and admittance. Not without his acting troupe’s investment.” A big part of the film’s success in holding your attention is&nbsp;Daniel Gillies’&nbsp;performance as one of two murderous drifters holding a family captive during a night of utter terror. As&nbsp;Screen Zealots’ Louisa Moore&nbsp;writes, “Gillies gives a spine-chilling performance as a quietly unhinged lunatic, and he’s able to establish so much fear with nothing but a menacing stare.” 71% Cryptozoo (2021)(Photo by Johnny Dell'Angelo courtesy of Sundance Institute)What do you get when you combine the plot of&nbsp;Jurassic Park, the visuals of&nbsp;Yellow Submarine, and the mind of one of the most unique voices currently working in animation? The bizarre, colorful, and fascinating world of&nbsp;Cryptozoo.SlashFilm’s Hoai-Tran Bui&nbsp;describes&nbsp;Cryptozoo&nbsp;as “the slyly anti-Disney film, digging into the idea of capitalizing on the magic of the world and turning it into a corporate product.” The film is about a sanctuary for mythical creatures and the shady military guys who are hellbent on using the creatures for their own nefarious purposes. The consensus seems to be that the film’s strongest asset is its unique kaleidoscopic animation, which&nbsp;Eric Kohn describes for IndieWire&nbsp;as “a cluttered symphony of erratic line drawings, psychedelic colors, and recycled genre tropes galore.” Because animation is more than just kid-friendly content, viewers should beware that&nbsp;Cryptozoo&nbsp;is definitely not for kids, but a film loaded with bloody shootouts, explicitly sexual content, and a surprising amount of gore. If you ever wanted to see a Gorgon having to escape the clutches of a giant Kraken while turning the soldiers chasing her into stone, this is the film for you. 76% Eight for Silver (2021)(Photo by Sean Ellis courtesy of Sundance Institute)The werewolf genre is in need of a comeback, because one can’t simply watch&nbsp;Underworld&nbsp;on repeat forever. So it’s great news that&nbsp;Anthropoid&nbsp;director&nbsp;Sean Ellis&nbsp;is giving us a much-needed fresh coat of silver on the werewolf movie with his new period horror film,&nbsp;Eight for Silver. In it,&nbsp;Boyd Holbrook&nbsp;acts as a Van Helsing type investigating some grisly murders and disappearances in the French countryside, where a mysterious set of silver teeth are bringing a lupine horror to the unsuspecting townsfolk.Most critics agree that the film brings some fascinating and gnarly additions to the werewolf myth:&nbsp;Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro&nbsp;wrote in her review, “This unique form of curse relies on some biblical evils, and the werewolf mythology itself gives thrilling glimpses of body horror that would make&nbsp;The Thing&nbsp;proud.” There’s also some love for Boyd Holbrook’s wolf hunter, with&nbsp;Brian Tallerico at rogerebert.com&nbsp;writing that the film includes “another game performance from Holbrook, who could make a career as a cinematic monster hunter and I’d be pretty happy.” 67% A Glitch in the Matrix (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Reality can be scarier than fiction; that much we’ve learned from&nbsp;Rodney Ascher’s films. Ascher has made a career out of peeking into what makes our imaginations run wild and&nbsp;dissecting the things that we’re obsessed with, most notably in 2012’s&nbsp;Room 237, which explored the wild conspiracy theories surround Stanley Kubrick’s classic horror film&nbsp;The Shining. Ascher’s latest,&nbsp;A Glitch in the Matrix, is all about another conspiracy theory that has slowly grown over the last couple of decades: the idea that we all live inside a computer simulation. It’s a frightening thought made all the&nbsp;more terrifying by Ascher’s&nbsp;deep dive into why people believe this theory.Writing for the&nbsp;AV Club, A. A. Dowd&nbsp;praises the film’s exploration of human obsession, stating “This film uses simulation theory as a window into the desperately human search for order and logic, with technology as just another variant on some grand designer outside the membrane of our consciousness.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;Nonfics’ Christopher Campbell&nbsp;writes of its potential as a horror film, “A Glitch in the Matrix&nbsp;is a perfect midnight movie because it does eventually become something of a horror movie but is also the sort of trippy feature, with its heady metaphysical subject matter combined with its surreal visuals, that is going to welcome drug-fueled viewings.” 78% In The Earth (2021)(Photo by Neon courtesy of Sundance Institute)Ben Wheatley returns to his folk horror origins with a timely, psychedelic film that was part of a new wave of pandemic-themed movies at this year’s Sundance. In the Earth is a movie about paranoia and isolation and a true attack on the senses that overcomes even the “at-home” part of Sundance to deliver an effective horror film filled with dread. This is in part due to a fantastic, synth-heavy score by Clint Mansell that includes plants in its sounds.So far, early reviews are praising this as Wheatley’s return to form after his disappointing remake of&nbsp;Rebecca&nbsp;for Netflix, and it’s a gnarly return at that. For SlashFilm, Chris Evangelista writes that “There’s a wealth of close-ups here of ruined, bleeding, open flesh; of skin stitched up with foreign objects inserted beneath the surface. It’s all so gross and weird and kind of wonderful.” Meanwhile, Consequence of Sound’s Joe Lipsett recognizes that those along for the ride will find a unique sensorial experience, writing, “Restless audiences may quibble with the pacing and length, but fans of bombastic visual sequences and discomforting violence will find plenty to like.” 79% Knocking (2021)(Photo by Hannes Krantz courtesy of Sundance Institute)At one point or another, everyone has had experience with an annoying neighbor who makes noise at inappropriate times, but what if that noise — say, a knocking sound — began to sound like cries for help? And what if, when confronted, no one seems to be able to hear the knocking? That is just the beginning of Molly’s (Cecilia Milocco) problems in the new Swedish horror film&nbsp;Knocking.&nbsp;Pajiba’s Kristy Puchko&nbsp;is enthusiastic about&nbsp;Knocking&nbsp;in her review, writing “Methodically paced and keenly tense, this thriller draws you in with the openness of Milocco’s visage, then hooks you with its titular inciting incident,” comparing the film to the works of&nbsp;Darren Aronofsky&nbsp;in their handling of insanity, vulnerability, and obsession.&nbsp;Frida Kempff’s film is unapologetically about gaslighting and the threat it continues to be to women, and the film plays with the audience’s expectations as it makes viewers reconsider what is and isn’t real.If there’s one consensus, it’s that Cecilia Milocco delivers a knockout performance here.&nbsp;Nightmarish Conjurings’ Sarah Musnicky&nbsp;writes, “Her performance easily grips onto the audience’s hearts and pulls them along with her as all we can do is watch Molly spiral onscreen. With a mixture of vulnerability and strength as Molly fixates on saving whoever is trying to initiate contact, the magic and glue of this film is truly found in her.” 74% Prisoners of the Ghostland (2021)(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Japanese director Sion Sono makes his English-language film debut with arguably the most bonkers film to have graced Sundance moviegoers’ screens since Mandy; this one just also happens to star&nbsp;Nicolas Cage.The film is a unique blend of Eastern and Western sensibilities, and finds Cage playing a former bank robber strapped into a black leather suit rigged with explosives (including one for each of his privates) and tasked with rescuing the governor’s adopted granddaughter from the “Ghostland” before his suit explodes. Writing for Nightmare on Film Street, Kimberley Elizabeth describes the film as “a melting pot dystopia of the nostalgic neons of both Eastern and Western culture.” Believe it or not, critics say that this could be Cage’s craziest film yet, with IndieWire’s David Ehrlich writing, “Cage screams at the sky while stretching the word ‘testicle’ for the length of an aria,” and that is enough to pique our interest.Though critics describe the film as a more muted Sion Sono, What to Watch’s Matt Donato still finds the director able to play with a largely practical world, “Sono’s prop-latent universe includes carnivalesque 18-wheelers outlined in neon light trims, modded arm-swords on mangled appendages, and Mad Maxian devastation that still carries creative flourishes.” That’s all well and good, but did we mention the testicle bombs? 87% Violation (2021)(Photo by One Plus One courtesy of Sundance Institute)Though Violation had its world premiere at TIFF last year, it’s part of the Sundance program this year, and it absolutely deserves recognition. This is a rape-revenge film with graphic violence that will make even hardcore horror fans squirm and raw, noteworthy performances.Indeed, many critics praise the central performance by Madeleine Sims-Fewer, including The Playlist’s Monica Castillo, who writes “Sims-Fewer’s incredible performance takes up space usually reserved for blood splattery comeuppance with a full gut-punch of intensity.” That being said, many critics also note that this film may be too shocking for some audience members. Pajiba’s Kristy Puchko writes, “It’s a film that strips away the artifices of genre to leave us with the bones of pain and horror. It then scrapes those bones, carving out a cinematic experience that is electrifying in its agony and empathy.”On an Apple device?

Think again! These stories of rampaging bulls, terrifying sea creatures, ghosts, and more will satisfy your genre thirst.by Rafael Motamayor | September 18, 2019 |  CommentsThe Toronto International Film Festival is usually best known for being the unofficial start to the awards season, with many of next year’s nominees making their debut at the Canadian festival. But among the hundreds of films showing in Toronto, there are some that wait far from the Oscar-bait madding crowd. After the day’s big red-carpet galas are done, the genre enthusiast crowd gathers at 11:59PM for the Midnight Madness program, which shows the boldest, sometimes most extreme films that horror, sci-fi, and fantasy filmmakers have to offer.This year, genre expanded beyond the confines of the late-night selection, as even the Contemporary World Cinema program — which usually focuses on art-house films that may not see wide releases — included a few titles that used horror tropes to tell poignant and contemporary stories. No matter what corner of the world these movies were made in, they all showed a love for genre cinema and its ability to make us care about real socio-political issues through pure entertainment. And the good news is that distributors and streaming services are likely to snatch them up and make them available to you soon.To help you plan your future watch list, we’ve put together a list highlighting some of the genre movies that blew audiences and critics alike away at TIFF and which show the wild directions horror, thrillers, and sci-fi flicks can be taken in.Jallikattu (2019)  96%&nbsp;(Photo by Opus Penta)A film that completely grabs you by surprise and never lets go, Lijo Jose Pellissery’s&nbsp;Jallikattu&nbsp;is a symphony of chaos, where a wild buffalo escapes and causes mayhem and violence in a remote Indian village. Hundreds of extras are seen running through the jungle wielding machetes and knives, with the movie playing out like an on-foot version of Mad Max: Fury Road with a bit of Spielberg’s Jaws&nbsp;thrown in; &nbsp;the buffalo is used sparingly, but its presence is always looming. It’s a film that will leave you wondering how they managed not to accidentally kill anyone during production. “When Jallikattu lets it rip, it’s as exciting and unusual an experience as you’re likely to get this year. Grab it by its horns and don’t dare let go,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Globe and Mail’s critic Barry Hertz of this exhilarating and unique cinematic experience.Sea Fever (2019)  87%&nbsp;Aquatic horror is a bit of an underseen sub-genre, but Neasa Hardiman’s&nbsp;Sea Fever&nbsp;shows why we should still be afraid of what lies beneath, as a bizarre creature sneaks on board a trawler on the high seas. This film will remind audiences of such classics as&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Thing&nbsp;while offering a new voice to the creature feature, with an engrossing tale that challenges your assumptions of the unknown.&nbsp;“Sea Fever is a nightmare you can’t take your eyes off of and can’t stop thinking about after it wraps up,”&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;Collider’s critic Perri Nemiroff.Bacurau (Nighthawk) (2020)  93%&nbsp;Right after the theatrical release of The Hunt was cancelled, TIFF presented us with an alternative to the Most Dangerous Game sub-genre, one that combines socio-political commentary with sci-fi and horror elements. RogerEbert.com’s Brian Tallerico described Bacarau, which also played the Cannes Film Festival,&nbsp;as “a crazy genre hybrid that exudes the confidence of the people who made it.” The premise is simple:&nbsp;In a&nbsp;near-future Brazilian village where citizens are sold as prey to bloodthirsty foreign hunter (led by cult-cinema legend Udo Kier), a resistance forms in an all-out war that allows the filmmakers to blend genres and blows minds. Psychotropic drugs are involved.Gundala (2019)  83%&nbsp;What if we were to tell you that the next big superhero cinematic universe wasn’t going to be based on American superheroes, but on Indonesian comic books? Writer-director Joko Anwar unleashed a different kind of superhero on the Midnight Madness crowds of Toronto with Gundala, a superhero origin film that&nbsp;infuses&nbsp;standard tropes of the genre with Indonesian legends and martial art fights that will make you cheer. That Shelf critic Victor Stiff says,&nbsp;“From beginning to end, Gundala delivers fast and furious action and rarely stops to take its foot off the gas.”Knives Out (2019)  97%&nbsp;(Photo by Lionsgate)One of the biggest surprises of TIFF was how universally liked Rian Johnson’s murder-mystery Knives Out turned out to be. The star-studded ensemble not only lets Chris Evans play a despicable character fresh off of&nbsp;hanging up the Captain America shield, but spoofs the classic whodunnit genre. What starts as a simple mystery of the murder of a crime novelist evolves into a laugh-out-loud puzzle-box comedy that will keep your mind spinning as you try to figure out what comes next. David Ehrlich writes for IndieWire: “A crackling, devious, and hugely satisfying old-school whodunnit with a modern twist…”. Lionsgate will release Knives Out on Thanksgiving.The Vigil (2021)  90%&nbsp;(Photo by BoulderLight Pictures)The demonic possession genre has long been associated with bibles and priests, but Keith Thomas’s debut feature, The Vigil,&nbsp;takes the genre and roots it in Jewish mythology making&nbsp;for a novel and terrifying horror film. Breakout performer Dave Davis stars as Jakov, a young man abandoning his Orthodox community to embrace the secular life, who finds himself working as a shomer, watching over the body of a recently deceased member of the community who is haunted by an evil presence. The Hollywood Reporter’s Jordan Mintzer writes,&nbsp;“What works… is how Thomas transforms Orthodox culture into gory material for a slightly elevated horror flick, with Yakov ultimately turning to Hebrew prayer as his only way out of hell.”The Vast of Night (2020)  92%&nbsp;A throwback to not only the classic sci-fi TV shows of the ’50s, like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits, but also a time when we were still fascinated with the idea of the future and the wonders it could bring, Andrew Patterson’s debut feature The Vast of Night follows two young people seeking the source of a mysterious sound invading their local radio station in a town in New Mexico. TV Guide’s Oliver Whitney writes that the film is&nbsp;“like an old school radio play that fuses the slow-building paranoia of The Twilight Zone and chilling awe and extraterrestrial sightings of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.” This nostalgic sci-fi thriller was picked up by Amazon just before the film’s premiere at TIFF.Synchronic (2020)  79%&nbsp;(Photo by Rustic Films )Filmmaking duo Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead have made a career out of blending different genres to create something entirely new, while also providing emotional stories stuffed with characters we connect with – their 2018 flick, The Endless, is Certified Fresh at 93%. This time they got Anthony Mackie and Jamie Dornan together to play the&nbsp;two friends at the core of a time-bending crime thriller involving two paramedics that get their lives turned upside down by a series of crimes involving a mysterious synthetic drug that lets you experience new realities. Synchronic is the duo’s most dramatic and emotional work yet, but it still delivers a fun and exhilarating experience.&nbsp;Writing for The Playlist, critic Jason Bailey says,&nbsp;“Synchronic can best be described as egghead indie sci-fi, in which the ideas are as exciting as the effects.” This is a sci-fi thriller that will stick with you long after you leave the theater.La Llorona (2020)  96%&nbsp;Unlike that other film about the Latin American horror myth, Jayro Bustamante’s La Llorona is 100% rooted in Latin American history and culture, which adds an extra layer of horror to this already chilling tale of an aging general accused of genocide who starts seeing visions of a terrifying ghost haunting his estate. Bustamante blends&nbsp;utilizes&nbsp;stylized cinematography and effective scares that make this the surprise horror hit of the festival. Critic Carlos Aguilar writes for The Wrap that La Llorona is “a purposefully somber cry for amends and acknowledgement permeated in phantasmagoric allure.” This is the type of genre film that proves you can have a strong message while still delivering entertaining thrills and scares.The Platform (El Hoyo) (2020)  80%&nbsp;Imagine a prison where the cells are vertically stacked, and the only food given to prisoners is lowered down from the highest levels – feeding those on the upper cells but leaving those below violently starving. Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia’s The Platform combines poignant and relevant social commentary about the&nbsp;distribution of wealth and the difficulties of convincing people to do good, with the nasty, wicked horrors of Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer. Writing for Slashfilm, critic Meredith Borders says,&nbsp;“Starvation, cannibalism, heinous violence and no small amount of feces aside, The Platform&nbsp;makes spending time in The Pit a pretty intriguing enterprise.” This is a movie that is as grotesque and shocking as it is surprisingly funny. Netflix will release The Platform at a later date.Like this?

And, whew, it’s gonna be quite the evening – and not just for the glitz, glam, and speeches.The pandemic, with its shuffled release dates and changes to eligibility for various awards ceremonies, already made this year a different beast for the HFPA’s night of nights, but a slew of controversies have also colored the 2021 Globes. First came criticism after the&nbsp;organization decided that&nbsp;Minari, the American film with mostly Korean dialogue, would compete in the “foreign” category; then came the noticeable snubbing of multiple projects featuring Black creatives and casts on nominations morning. And then, just a week out from the ceremony, the&nbsp;L.A. Times&nbsp;dropped a bombshell investigation into the makeup (zero Black journalists are members) and ethics of the 87-member group.&nbsp;You can read the full piece here.Recommended: The Full List of Nominations for the 2021 Golden GlobesRecommended:&nbsp;Vote for the Winners In Our Online 2021 Golden Globes BallotYet the show will and must go on, in virtual form this year, with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting from opposite sides of the country (and no doubt re-writing their material to address recent controversies even as we speak). And while some in the industry will snigger at and maybe even avoid the ceremony, it’s hard to deny its significance as on one of the biggest dates on the awards season calendar, both in (potentially) reshaping&nbsp;the Oscars race and giving TV networks and streamers some new marketing juice, and in its standing as one of the most widely-viewed awards ceremonies of the year.If you’re going to be viewing the Golden Globes, and perhaps wanna beat your buddies on a ballot, we’ve got you covered with our choices for who’s likely to win on the big night (and those who&nbsp;we feel truly deserve to win). Our experts – Jacqueline Coley for film and Debbie Day for TV and streaming – take into consideration everything from industry buzz and the tastes and historical leanings of the HFPA, to our Tomatometer and Audience Scores, to read the tea leaves and place their bets. How right will they be? Bookmark this page for Sunday night and find out.Check out our picks for the Golden Globes winners, and let us know who you think will be a win in the comments.Film | TelevisionFILMBest Motion Picture – Drama(Photo by © Searchlight Pictures)What will win? 94% Nomadland (2021)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a&nbsp;battle between Nomadland and&nbsp;The&nbsp;Trial of the Chicago 7,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;a bit of a toss-up on who deserves it. However, the wanderlust drama starring Frances McDormand is&nbsp;one of the few studio films in competition this season,&nbsp;which we think is enough to tip the scales in its favor just for the sake of balance. Both worthy selections, but it’s hard to argue with Nomadland’s more than&nbsp;100 wins this awards season thus far.Best Motion Picture – Musical or ComedyWhat will&nbsp;win? 97% Hamilton (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Hamilton. The HFPA did some – let’s call them&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;– calculations to justify including Hamilton here rather than with the other made-for-TV&nbsp;films and limited series (a ridiculously competitive category). We’d have to think&nbsp;they performed such leaps of logic for a reason. Plus, if Hamilton wins, we might&nbsp;get another incredible acceptance speech from Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda – always a good time and even better television. Oh, and yes:&nbsp;Hamilton&nbsp;is very,&nbsp;very&nbsp;worthy.Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Viola Davis 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Viola Davis. This is a&nbsp;bit of a wild card category, as none of the nominees have really run away with things so far this awards season. We could make a compelling argument that all have a right to win. All have snagged several prizes this season, but we are betting on Davis’ transformative turn as the larger-than-life Mother of the Blues, Ma Rainey, deservedly winning out. The notoriously finicky HFPA apparently raved about the film – particularly Davis’s performance.Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?&nbsp;Chadwick Boseman 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Even without the tragedy of his death, Chadwick Boseman was winning – as he should.Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy&nbsp;(Photo by Seacia Pavao / Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Rosamund Pike 78% I Care a Lot (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Bucking the general thinking here, we have gone with an upset. With a small voting body, the Globes are highly unpredictable – so when Pike cut a nomination, we suspected it was due to how much the HPFA enjoyed the film and her darkly hilarious performance as a scheming care assistant. If you want to win your ballot, you have to give room for at least one surprise and we&nbsp;think this is where to do it. Borat Subsequent Moviefilm‘s&nbsp;Maria Bakalova is the odds-on safe bet, but bumping her to lead instead of supporting is a quizzical choice and hard to put up against Pike, who carried an entire movie under that fierce bob. Besides, where’s the fun in playing it safe?Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy&nbsp;(Photo by © Amazon)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Sacha Baron Cohen 85% Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The HFPA really likes Sacha Baron Cohen.&nbsp;He is nominated three times this year and four times previously – it really comes down to where&nbsp;the group wants to honor him?&nbsp;Immersing himself in character for hours – with the burden of that thick and hilarious accent – to pull of Internet-shaking ruses… it’s hard to argue he’s not deserving.Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Amanda Seyfried 82% Mank (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?This is a complicated choice. Maria Bakalova should win here – she does give a supporting performance – but she’s in the Lead category so… As the David Fincher black-and-white drama has little hope of winning in the other categories, this is the best place for the Globes voters to show the tale of Citizen Kane‘s prickly screenwriter some love. And Seyfried is very, very good in the film.Best Supporting Actor – Motion PictureWho&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Daniel Kaluuya 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Better late than never. Coming on late in the season, Daniel Kaluuya turn as Chairman Fred Hampton of the Chicago Black Panther Party has quickly emerged as a late-season frontrunner in this category. Leslie Odom Jr. – who has snapped up many of the prizes thus far for playing Sam Cooke in One Night In Miami&nbsp;–&nbsp;would also be a logical choice, but after snagging&nbsp;his second GGs nomination in just four years, we’re giving it to the&nbsp;Get Out star who more than deserves to take home the prize.Best Director – Motion Picture(Photo by Joshua Richards, 20th Century )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Chloé Zhao 94% Nomadland (2021)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In&nbsp;case you haven’t been keeping score,&nbsp;Zhao, the director of Marvel’s upcoming&nbsp;Eternals, has swept the major directing prizes this season. It would beyond shocking if she came up short here, and we don’t think she should or will… but the one name that could unseat her would be Aaron Sorkin for The Trial of the Chicago 7.Best Screenplay – Motion Picture(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Aaron Sorkin 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a category with more than a few glaring omissions, the film that should win is arguably not even among the nominees. Soul, One Night in Miami, Never Rarely Sometimes Always would all be welcome and worthy additions to this group, with all of them being heavily favored nominees for the Oscars ceremony in April.Best Motion Picture – Foreign LanguageWhat will&nbsp;win? 98% Minari (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Minari. We love Another Round, and it would be a worthy winner, but this is yet another category where the HFPA might look to do a bit of damage control. Selecting Minari as the winner could go a long way to lowering the temperature&nbsp;on the controversy surrounding their “Foreign Language” classification of the film. Need a quick brush up on that controversy? The dialogue for Minari is spoken in mostly Korean, with only 30% in English, a ratio which relegated this 98% Certified Fresh American immigrant story to a foreign category. That raised some questions about a double standard:&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds, which featured similar language ratios, was&nbsp;nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama in 2010.Best Motion Picture – Animated(Photo by Pixar)What will&nbsp;win? 95% Soul (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Apple’s&nbsp;Wolfwalkers has a real chance to upset Pixar’s long-running&nbsp;dominance of this category, but with Soul‘s&nbsp;additional nomination for Best Score,&nbsp;we’re thinking the HFPA favors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers’ jazz-filled&nbsp;tale.Best Original Score – Motion PictureWhat will&nbsp;win? 95% Soul (2020)What&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Soul. With two nominations this year (Mank, Soul), it would be strange for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross not to take home the prize for Best Score. As it is assumed they are taking home a statue no matter what,&nbsp;Soul – a win for&nbsp;which&nbsp;would also honor Stephen Colbert’s bandleader Jon Batiste, who did the incredible jazz orchestrations – is the preferable option.Best&nbsp;Original Song – Motion Picture(Photo by Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?“Speak Now” – Leslie Odom Jr. and Sam Ashworth 98% One Night in Miami (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Leslie Odom Jr. was our out-of-the-gate front-runner for Best Supporting Actor in every major contest earlier this year – but all that changed when Daniel Kaluuya recently joined the race with rave reviews, replacing the Hamilton alum as frontrunner there. Still, having&nbsp;Odom Jr.&nbsp;on stage to accept&nbsp;an award would be a great TV moment to tune in for, something every awards show is cognizant of this year, and this could be the category that gets him there.TELEVISIONBest Television Series – DramaWho&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The Crown’s fourth season was spectacular in the same way that the unraveling of Prince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage was a spectacle. The series will and should win for its portrayal of that drama, as well as the one unfolding at 10 Downing Street.Best Actress – Television Drama(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who will win?Olivia Colman 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who should win?Emma Corrin was compelling in her role as Princess Diana in The Crown season 4 and Colman is certainly deserving, but Laura Linney should top this list for her strong, multi-layered performance in an emotional season 3 of Ozark. Colman&nbsp;should be recognized at least once this year; she’s also nominated for a Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.Best Actor – Television Drama(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who will win?Josh O’Connor 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who should win?O’Connor’s portrayal of Prince Charles was certainly riveting, but Bob Odenkirk&nbsp;was sublime in&nbsp;Better Call Saul&nbsp;season 5, which is Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer. Take episode 8 (“Bagman”), which follows Jimmy on an ill-fated roadtrip to Mexico that devolves into an overnight hike through the desert with Mike (Jonathan Banks). The Emmy-nominated episode and&nbsp;the storyline’s continuation&nbsp;in the also Emmy-nominated episode 9 (“Bad Choice Road”) served as a showcase for Banks as much as for Odenkirk, who inhabits the skin of Jimmy/Saul down to the last sun-crisped cell.Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy(Photo by ©CBC / courtesy Everett Collection)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?The big question in the comedy categories is if the HFPA will follow the Emmys in honoring Schitt’s Creek and the Pop series’ actors. We’re betting they’ll split their support to spread the love around in that HFPA way, but Schitt’s Creek will get the big honor – as it should.Best Actress – Television Musical or Comedy(Photo by Pop)Who will win?Catherine O’Hara 100% Schitt's Creek: Season 6 (2020)Who should win?With the revelations on the HFPA’s relationship with Emily In Paris hitting before voting concludes, we’re expecting the membership to exercise more restraint in the final round of voting, ensuring that neither the series nor its star Lily Collins&nbsp;will receive awards. The situation makes it one less person&nbsp;competing against O’Hara, who will and should win for her portrayal of unhinged Rose family matriarch, Moira.Best Actor – Television Musical or Comedy(Photo by Ollie Upton/Hulu)Who will win?Nicholas Hoult 88% The Great: Season 1 (2020)Who should win?As part of the Emmys’ “Schitt’s Sweep,” Eugene Levy received the top comedy actor prize – and he should probably win here too – but the HFPA is a different organization. Ramy Youssef took the prize last year, but we expect the HFPA membership to woo Hoult with a prize for his performance in The Great. Huzzah!Best&nbsp;Miniseries or Television Film&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win? 97% The Queen's Gambit: Miniseries (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?With its collection of auteur films – that auteur being Steve McQueen of 12 Years a Slave fame – Small Axe feels somewhat out of place competing against the likes of The Queen’s Gambit, Unorthodox, Normal People, and The Undoing. It’s here, though, and matches The Queen’s Gambit’s 97% Tomatometer score. We think Netflix is going to win this particular streaming war for the phenomenon that was The Queen’s Gambit; though the Amazon Prime Video title may deserve it for its heartfelt storytelling experience.Best Actress – Miniseries or Television FilmWho will win?Anya Taylor-Joy 97% The Queen's Gambit: Miniseries (2020)Who should win?Despite facing off against big names Cate Blanchett (Mrs. America) and Nicole Kidman (The Undoing), and powerful performances from relative newcomers Shira Haas (Unorthodox) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Normal People), Taylor-Joy reigns supreme in this category for her performance as chess prodigy Beth Harmon; she will and she should win — that is, unless HFPA members get star struck by either Blanchett or Kidman.Best Actor&nbsp;–&nbsp;Miniseries or Television Film&nbsp;(Photo by HBO)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Mark Ruffalo 74% I Know This Much Is True: Miniseries (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We’ve said it again and again, Ruffalo took on two very different and equally challenging roles in I Know This Much Is True and deserves to prevail (as he did at the Emmys) for doing twice the work even if the overall series wasn’t a critics’ favorite.Best Supporting Actress –&nbsp;Series, Miniseries, or Television Film(Photo by Des Willie/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Gillian Anderson 96% The Crown: Season 4 (2020)Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?After two back-to-back Emmy wins, the HFPA was finally convinced to nominate Ozark’s Julia Garner, who is indeed deserving for her role as Ruth Langmore, but this year she has the misfortune of competing against Anderson’s remarkable transformation into The Crown’s Margaret Thatcher. Emmy winner Annie Murphy, of Schitt’s Creek,&nbsp;has a hard road against those two powerful dramatic performances.Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film(Photo by Amazon Studios)Who will win?John Boyega 98% Small Axe: Red, White and Blue (2020)Who should win?It’s an awards season high crime&nbsp;that Better Call Saul isn’t represented (in Jonathan Banks or Giancarlo Esposito) and that Ozark’s Tom Pelphrey was also overlooked, despite his extraordinary performance as Wendy Byrde’s bipolar brother, Ben. The supporting categories too broadly encompass both drama and comedy, leaving Boyega — who shines in a&nbsp;lead&nbsp;role as Leroy Logan in “episode” Red, White and Blue’s true story — to face off against Dan Levy for Schitt’s Creek, which is just absurd.

The movies – with Tomatometer scores of 71% and 76% respectively – are his best reviewed works since his debut, Dawn of the Dead, back in 2004.While Army is no direct sequel to Dawn – different characters, different kinds of zombies here – it’s clear Snyder is relishing playing with the undead again, and this time with a totally original story. A heist movie/zombie movie mashup, Army sees a ragtag group of soldiers and mercenaries, led by Dave Bautista’s Scott Ward, heading into a walled-up Las Vegas that’s teeming with zombies to pull off one last heist. As critics have noted, it’s Snyder unfettered: full of gore, awesome soundtrack choices, plenty of slo-mo, and heart-on-your-sleeve, earnest emoting… even from the zombies.Ahead of the movie’s release on Netflix, Snyder spoke to Rotten Tomatoes about the “most fun” movie-making experience of his life, building a new kind of zombie lore (and getting audiences to root for “Team Zombie”), and his no-holds-barred plans to expand the Army of the Dead world with more films and a “very adult” animated series. (Warning: the below interview contains minor spoilers for Army of the Dead.)Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: Congratulations on the movie, Zack, and congratulations on the surprise theatrical run. Why is this a good film for audiences to see on the biggest screen they possibly can – if it’s safe –&nbsp;right now?Zack Snyder: By the way, if that big screen happens to be in your living room, by all means [watch it there]. But being at the theater, it’s a fun movie to see. Listen, when I made the film, there was no vision of this movie being in a theater. I didn’t even care to ask. I was like, “No, I appreciate you, Netflix, saying yes to this idea, and so I will honor you and your platform by making a movie specifically for this world.” And it was Netflix that came to me and said, “Hey, is it cool if we release the movie on the big screen as well?” And I said, “Absolutely, that would be amazing.” And it’s worked out great. The movie plays really well on a giant screen. In a lot of ways, it’s a lot of movie on a big screen. We went bigger than we normally would because it was going to be this big [gestures a small TV size], so I was like we might as well just blow the doors off it since you’re going to watch it at home. So in the theater it plays awesome.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: It does so from the moment it starts with that credits sequence. When the social media embargo lifted, and then we were reading the reviews, everyone was like: This is the biggest credits sequence I think I’ve ever seen, or at least the biggest Zack Snyder credit sequence. Why did you want to go so big and put so much into that montage – and how challenging was that to pull off?Snyder: It was pretty challenging. I will say though that, like anything, I wanted to make sure that this … Well, this was a movie about veterans. These are veterans. The old gunslingers. They go for one last mission. That was the movie, and it always was, but I wanted to tell the story of their journey and their war story in the title sequence. I just felt like it was important that we let you know in the title sequence that they had suffered trauma and they’d gone all the way into the heart of darkness with their journey in the zombie fall of Vegas.I also wanted to trick you a little bit with it, like the movie does. It’s a small metaphor for the actual experience of the movie. It looks like a lot of zombie fun and there’s a lot of hijinks, and then suddenly you find yourself caring about these guys. And there’s a lot of drama and there’s a lot of heartbreak. But then in the end, you realize that you’re in this “let’s do it again” kind of a world. That was something I wanted to express on a small scale in the title sequence.Rotten Tomatoes: I think the film really does that balance so well, between the spectacle and the gore, and then these emotional relationships, particularly between Dave [Bautista] and Ella [Purnell], and then also between Matthias [Schweighöfer] and Omari [Hardwick], which I absolutely loved. Why was it so important for you to home in on and really develop these strong bonds between certain characters?Snyder: That’s the “why” of the movie in a lot of ways – in the end you can go on a zombie romp, but what is the “why” of it? And I think that in the end, it’s those human relationships that make us care and make it important, and the characters you want to see live, and the ones that sacrifice, and the ones that you want to see not make it, you start rooting in all different directions. And I think that in the end this is the “why” of making a big movie and going on this big journey. It’s really a fun and exciting place to be if you care.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: You went even further than that in some ways. There are certain zombies we come to care for!Snyder: Yes, it was important to me that [we cared about the zombies], if it was possible. I remember when we were talking about this at the early days, I was like, I want people to be Team Zombie at some point. I want there to be people that are like, “I really hope that Zeus makes it.” That’s what I want. Or him and his queen to start a new world somewhere. I think that would be amazing. And I just think that’s the rare thing in a zombie film: empathy for the zombies.Rotten Tomatoes: Yeah, because it’s a completely new spin. I mean we’ve had empathy for zombies, but generally because you see the previous character that was there and you know the relationship between the person who’s alive, but we hadn’t really seen society-forming, thinking zombies. And it’s almost a Planet of the Apes development here.Snyder: Yeah, I really love the Planet of the Apes reference because that’s what I was going for in a lot of ways. I love the idea that Zeus… he cries, frankly, in the movie. And I know it sounds like a joke when I say a zombie cries in this film, but I think when you see it in context that you don’t bat an eye. It’s just, like, of course he would. Who wouldn’t? And I think that even just the notion that… the switching of the thing where you go into that world thinking we’re just going to kill any zombie we see, but then you realize that in the end, the humans are double crossing, and they’re not honoring the deal, and all of that. I just think that’s super fun to wonder who’s the honorable one in the scenario.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: It was really refreshing, and that all came from you, because, if I’m correct, this is your second project after Sucker Punch that’s entirely original as opposed to an adaptation. What’s the difference in the experience between adapting something that is beloved and trying to do that justice, and doing something where you have free rein and it’s all come from your own mind?Snyder: First, I mean just to say, Sucker Punch –&nbsp;and I loved the movie and it’s awesome – but it was one of those things we pitched as a hard R, crazy, R-rated movie. And the studio asked us to make a PG-13 and we were like okay, to do it, we’ll do it. And Army of the Dead is a movie where Netflix has been 100% with us. I go, “It’s an R-rated movie all the way,” and they were like, “Awesome, go for it.” I think it just allows the true original vision of the movie to keeps it integrity. And you can feel that when you watch the movie, that it’s singular. I think the singularity of it is the thing that makes it so you go into that world and you buy it at every turn.And when you’re dealing with something like the DCEU, which is such hyper-focused IP where the studio is doing a lot of the decisions out of playing defense with the idea, they’re constantly just trying to protect their back, it’s hard to score when you play defense. It’s just difficult. You can see it. A lot of the decisions feel like they’re made in a… I mean that’s the one thing about what I got to do with Justice League, finally it’s just like okay, just go and do it. And that was fun for me.(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: So, would you say this is one of the most free experiences you’ve had making a film?Snyder: Yeah, I would say for sure it was the most fun I’ve had making a movie. I mean pure fun every day, day in and day out. These actors, these scenarios –&nbsp;we knew it was crazy, and so it’s fun to do. When you’re having Dave Bautista run down across the tables in a casino firing a machine gun and zombies are diving all over the place, I mean, I’d say “cut” and I would literally be laughing, like, okay, this is ridiculously awesome. Or even just taking Garret [Dillahunt] and throwing him around on these wires, and that’s going to be a zombie shaking him to death…. It was pretty funny, but we didn’t not take it seriously or not try and make it at its highest level, but we still had the joyous child-like glee from the experience.Rotten Tomatoes: And I think the audience will share that feeling, because you watch that scene with Garret and that tiger and it’s just delightful in its gory way.Snyder: Yeah, I know. If you can’t have fun watching that in the movies, then you’ve lost touch of your inner gore child that is waiting to get out.Rotten Tomatoes: I want to talk to you about runtimes, because it’s a two-and-a-half hour zombie movie, and we’ve come off a four-hour Snyder cut, Zack Snyder’s Justice League. What do you say to people who think a popcorn movie needs to be two hours, that’s what an audience can handle, that’s what makes for good pacing, when you’re delivering these long movies that people are eating up?Snyder: I don’t know. I mean, the record doesn’t hold that. If you go look at the top box office movies of all time, Jim Cameron sure doesn’t make short movies, I’ll tell you that. You know what I’m saying? And Lord of the Rings is no matinée quickie and is better for it; the Dark Knight trilogy, they’re not short movies. And the movie’s as long as it is. I don’t think you can back into it that way. I mean yeah, you have a target, you have an area, two-and-a-half hours. Beyond that, sure, we’re constantly trimming. Was the first pass of Army of the Dead three hours, three-and-a-half hours? Probably. I was conscious of it. I was like, “Oh, it’d be good if it was just under two-and-a-half hours. That’d be good.”(Photo by Clay Enos / © Netflix)Rotten Tomatoes: And we’re actually getting more of this world, right?Snyder: There’s an animated series, a prequel. I’m directing two of the episodes of the animated series. Yeah, it’s fun. And I came up with the story with Shay [Hatten, co-screenwriter of Army of the Dead] and well, because Shay and I actually, we were ready to go if there was a sequel that anybody ever wanted, we know how to do it, and so the world of the animated series is directly related to what would be the world of the sequel. So I really had to very carefully plan out and construct the entire “what happens in that world” in the world of the animated series. And then the prequel, also Shay and I wrote the story for that. That’s another genre bender – Matthias [Schweighöfer] directed basically a romantic comedy heist movie. We constantly keep doing this genre mashing.Rotten Tomatoes: Can you give us a sense of what we can expect from the animated series?Snyder: In the animated series, we trace the origins of the zombie plague, not only where it came from, but then its actual origins and what is the “why” of it. And from a scale standpoint, it’s hilarious. It really is a crackup if you can imagine the kind of things that you could do in animation, where there’s no rules and nothing to stop you.Rotten Tomatoes: Also a hard R rating?Snyder: Oh God, yeah. It’s very adult animated series, yeah. Very adult.Army of the Dead is in theaters now and available on Netflix from Friday May 21, 2021.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pixar, quibi, Dates, Arrowverse, Peacock, Extras, Network, Showtime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"zack-snyder-wants-to-tap-into-your-inner-gore-child-with-horror-heist-hybrid-army-of-the-dead"},{"id":"47611737419884","title":"Know Your Critic: Sharronda Williams, Founder of Pay or Wait","content":"Know Your Criticvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Know Your Critic: Sharronda Williams, Founder of Pay or WaitWilliams shares what she’s been watching in quarantine, a favorite movie from her childhood, and the film whose Rotten score keeps her up at night.by Sophie-Marie Prime | April 15, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Touchstone Pictures, Fox, and Marvel Studios)“Know Your Critic” is a column in which we interview Tomatometer-approved critics about their screening and reviewing habits, pet peeves, and personal favorites.In just the few years since she founded her multimedia platform Pay or Wait, Sharronda Williams has become a go-to source for her audiences. She’s interviewed major creatives from directors like Spike Lee to actors such as Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer. Her expertise and sharp wit shine brightest in her video reviews on YouTube, in which Williams always offers both nuance and a sense of humor.“For me, it’s very intentional that people see me, that I’m funny at times,” Williams said in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes. “I try to make people feel like they’re talking to themselves, I never want to make people feel as though, ‘I’m not smart enough to be a film critic,’ right?”Williams’ decision to appear on-camera is a reflection of her desire to offer visibility for Black women like herself, and to transparently represent her experience. No matter what she’s reviewing, she is aware of the many subjectivities at play: her own, the creatives’, and the audiences’.“Sometimes it is hard to let go of your experience as a Black person in this country, because you see the film in a totally different viewpoint,” Williams said.“When we’re talking about issues, especially that are still a sore subject in America’s history – when it’s confronting slavery, and confronting racism and how it still plagues this nation to this day – it’s very hard to make sure that you’re doing your job as a critic,” Williams said. “These are experiences that are lived that are witnessed day in and day out.”As Williams grows her audience, she has become – and hopes to remain – a voice for movie fans and up-and-coming critics alike.Sharronda Williams is the founder of Pay or Wait, a YouTube channel and an online publication centered on entertainment reviews and interviews. Find her on Twitter: @payorwait.What’s your favorite seat in a movie theater?I like to sit in the back, middle. I love being in the middle of the screen. I feel like I have all of the viewpoints I need to see. I also hate when people kick my seat, I hate to hear people chew in my ear. The only downfall to that being my favorite seat is, I can see everyone and their cellphones.You get to see people’s reactions, too. I love people-watching and seeing how the movie makes them feel. That’s why – even for press screenings, when they put you in the front – I really like sitting in the back, because I love watching the audience’s reaction as well.Does that ever play into how you review a film or how you discuss it?I love going to screenings for kids’ movies because I really love to be able to tell how it’s going to hold a child’s attention. I bring my god-children with me – they’re still getting into going to the movies.That and comic book movies, I love – I have to see it with an audience.I totally agree – comic book movie experiences are made by the audience.I literally still remember the audience’s reaction to the end of Endgame, when you hear Steve say, “Avengers, assemble!” And then when you hear Sam say, “On your left.” It’s just brings me back to that emotion of what was happening in the theater at that time. You can’t beat a theater experience, you really can’t.(Photo by Liam Daniel/Netflix)What has been your favorite thing to watch in quarantine this past year?The obvious is Bridgerton, because it gave me romance, it gave me entanglements, it gave me messy drama. It’s what I live for. It made me feel like I was in a whole relationship, I was totally invested.Did you binge the show, or do you avoid binge-watching?I actually watched Bridgerton a couple of months before it released and I was like, “Oh my gosh, this show is so good.” I was literally calling my colleagues like, “You need to go, you need to request Bridgerton. Do it right now. It’s going to be a hit, just thank me later.” So yeah, I binged the whole thing.I had to pause halfway through – I think it was the fourth episode – when the Duke… the whole scene in the garden. When he said he still wasn’t going to marry her, I lost it. I had to take a couple of hours of a break because I was so upset at him that I couldn’t even deal. I had to come back to it the next day.That scene infuriated me. I cannot stand when people know they could be happy and will not choose happiness.Yes, because it was his pride! I was like, “What are you doing?”When you are reviewing, do you go in cold?I do reviews on YouTube and trailer reactions are this huge thing. Every time a trailer comes out, they’re like, “Hey, can you do a trailer reaction?” And then I have to disappoint everyone and tell them that I don’t watch trailers. I like to go in completely blind.This started when Southpaw came out. I hadn’t seen any trailer, I just knew it was a boxing movie with Jake Gyllenhaal. That’s all I needed: Jake Gyllenhaal shirtless. Done, I’m there.So, I get into the movie and we’re watching it, and then Rachel McAdams‘&nbsp;character dies. I literally was the only one who gasped in the middle of the movie theater. My friend turned to me, she was like, “What is wrong with you?”I was like, “She just died!” And she was just like, “Girl, that was in the trailer!” And I was like, “See! I will never watch another trailer again after this, never.”What makes a “good” movie?It makes me feel something. I mean, that’s why we watch movies! We want to be excited. Sometimes we want to be sad or we want to be happy, we want to laugh.Movies that cause thoughts or discussion. Movies that promote change or a change within, that make you want to be a better person, make you analyze yourself as a person. Those movies that truly stick with you afterwards, and you’re still thinking about the next day, that you’re still having conversations with your friends about. I think those are such good movies, because it just truly shows the impact of a creative work.Was there a movie or a television series that you watched that made you want to become a critic?I can tell you one that made me understand the importance of being a Black critic. That was Detroit.When Detroit came out, it was really interesting because I would read reviews but I also watch YouTube videos. That’s what helped me solidify why I do what I do – and really, just seeing a lot of the people miss a lot of the historical things that someone growing up in the Black experience, that this is my life.When they show The Great Migration portrait – the famous illustration in Black culture. Growing up, everyone had this picture in their house. We’ve seen this on Black TV shows. I saw that a lot of non-Black critics, they didn’t understand what that illustration meant. Or, they didn’t understand the importance of how certain characters are portrayed, especially when we’re dealing with real events that have happened, that have shaped our country as a whole.I think it really helped me understand the importance of my voice, the importance of why we ask for diversity in film criticism. The beautiful journey of watching from different viewpoints, different experiences – how they’re really shaped, how you view films, how you criticize films. That was a movie that helped me to keep going, even in times when I felt like giving up – my perspective as a Black woman, why it’s so necessary and essential to film criticism.(Photo by Warner Bros./Courtesy Everett Collection)What are you most proud of in your career thus far?I remember the first time I got an email from Rotten Tomatoes. When I first started, I remember going to the website and looking at the qualifications and I’m like, “Child, I’m never going to get this. We’re going to put this on the back burner forever.” Being a part of Rotten Tomatoes, being able to say that when you see the Tomatometer on commercials or whatnot that, “Hey, my review counts towards that.”Most recently, I got my first pull quote for Judas and the Black Messiah. I remember I was asleep and I woke up and everyone was like, “Oh my goodness, I just saw your name on TV during SNL!” Having my brother call me as I try and drift off, “I just saw your name. I was watching Judas and the Black Messiah and then I watched this trailer afterwards where your name popped up.” I think that is when I was like, “Whoa, this is serious, this is real.” You know?Do you remember a time when you were watching something, a movie or a television series, where you saw a character that reflected your experience?Living Single was one of my first experiences. Before I got into film criticism, I used to want to be a lawyer in college. I remember growing up and watching Maxine Shaw on Living Single and I was like, “Oh my goodness, it’s a Black woman as a lawyer. And she lives by herself, and she has these friends, and she’s lives this great life.”What is the hardest review you’ve ever produced?The most recent one was Antebellum. It was really hard.I always want to make sure that I respect the role of creatives – that they took the time and the energy to put their art into the world for a lot of people to consume it and form their own opinions.It’s challenging as a Black critic – and I think a lot of people will agree whether they will publicly admit it or not – because we don’t get a lot of films or TV shows that center around the Black experience that star Black women. Because we don’t get so many, it becomes very hard because you understand the importance of seeing someone like Janelle Monáe on screen, a woman leading this film. That was a really hard review, critiquing a work that features a Black woman, that features an issue that is very close to me as someone who lives the Black experience each day – especially when you don’t necessarily connect with it.It’s hard, because personally you want to see more of this on screen and you don’t want to knock down someone’s ability to create. Especially because it’s so hard for Black people to be able to create in this industry, and to actually have their projects seen by the masses. But you also want to make sure that the stories that are being told, the stories that are portrayed, and these characters – who are my aunts, my uncles, my mother, my sister, my brother – you want to make sure that it is being done in a great light.Because in this world, what you see on TV, people take it as gospel… Unfortunately, that’s just the society we live in. What we see on TV, we basically say, “This is what Black people do, this is how they act.” If you see Black caricatures, that is how people see us. The situation makes it hard as a critic, especially a Black critic.(Photo by Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)What is your favorite movie from your childhood?I watched A League of Their Own so many times that if my mother came into the room she was like, “I can’t believe that you’re watching this movie again.” It was just – I loved it, I was fascinated, I didn’t know that there were female baseball players.Especially that scene where the Black woman catches the ball and throws it, and she has this mean arm. I loved that moment in the movie.Is there an actor or a director or a screenwriter whose work you always love? Someone who regardless what they make, you’re excited to watch it?Growing up, I always loved Denzel Washington. I remember after watching one of my favorite roles of his is Malcolm X. No matter how long the movie is, I watch him all the time.The most conflicted I’ve ever felt in a movie was Training Day. I’ve never necessarily hated Denzel so much in a movie, and I felt morally conflicted because I wanted this character to die so bad. But it’s Denzel playing him, so I can’t … I just remember watching that with my parents and I was like, “This is really causing me stress, like internal stress right now, that I really don’t like him in this movie.” But I mean, I think that speaks to his performance.Do you ever feel like actors get cast in roles that are completely awful and unlikable people, so people will empathize with them?Yes, that’s how I feel about him in Training Day. I mean, it’s such an iconic role! You know? “King Kong ain’t got nothing on me!” I mean it was just like, “Oh my goodness, why is he so good at a bad person? Why?! Why are you that good?”That’s my dream interview one day, to interview Denzel. I will pass out though, if they actually said, “Hey Sharronda, it’s time to interview him,” I’d probably pass out.(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)What is your favorite Rotten film or television series?Sister Act and Sister Act 2. It’s disgusting! It is troubling. Sometimes I cannot sleep at night, to think that Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit, one of my favorite films growing up, is at a 19%! It is an injustice, it truly is.Yes! I feel that way about But I’m a Cheerleader. Like, “Did y’all miss the point? Did it sail over your heads? What?”Even Robin Hood: Men in Tights! That’s disrespectful, too. I could go on about this for days. But Sister Act 2, we’ve got to do something about that.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?I think part of it is that film critics hate every single thing. It’s weird because, in our industry, the negativity is what gets amplified outside of those who actually connect and love the art that comes out.For YouTubers, they don’t see us as critics because we don’t write. I think that’s really important. I’m an English major, I’ve written poetry that’s been published in books. I can write if I choose to write, you know? I think just understanding that what we do is just as important, it’s just another way that people consume criticism. And I think really just opening themselves up to the fact that the world is changing and how people consume things are changing.For me as a Black woman, it’s not easy for me to go get a staff job. To write for someone, it’s just an anomaly, honestly. It doesn’t happen very often and it’s too few and far between in the industry right now.For me, it’s important that we have avenues to build our own platforms that we can support ourselves off of, and to have that visibility. Because the visibility of a YouTuber is really important, especially in the Black community.You’ve mentioned before that your decision to appear on-camera for reviews was very intentional. Can you talk about that?My parents always took me to the movies since I was a little kid. I would have my mom drop me off in the theater by myself to spend the whole day there. I love watching films. But I never saw anyone who was like me, who was popular and made me feel like that was something that I could be – a film critic. I thought I could just be someone who always went to the theaters every weekend. It’s very important that you see people who look like you, that you see Black women who are doing this.There’s so many people that reach out like, “Oh my goodness, I want to be a film critic and never thought I could do it, then I saw your channel and I started my own.” I help people – people who message me or DM me, I help them – give them tips on how they can do it because I don’t want to be the only Black woman who does this. I don’t want to be the only Black face that you see on YouTube.So, it’s really important that we have these images of people who look like us, because they inspire the next generation. They inspire those who have been trying to do this for so long and just never had the courage to actually do it. And that’s why for me YouTube is such an intentional thing that I do, especially when you see the discussions all the time about how – as we look at staff writers for major publications – there’s not a lot of Black people, and especially on top of that, not a lot of Black women.Everyone’s perspective, as long as it’s done respectfully, is needed in criticism.(Photo by Universal International Pictures)What is your favorite classic film? And, you can define classic however you like – inside or outside the canon.There’s this movie my mother – my mother is such a character – if she felt like I wasn’t appreciating her as a mother, she would make me watch Imitation of Life. I think it was the 1959 version.I watched it so many times. She was like, “You see how she treated her mother?” She turned into a whole African queen. And I was like, “How many times do I have to watch this movie?”But that film is now ingrained into my DNA. That is a movie I will never forget, and mainly just my mother forcing me to watch it every time she felt like I was being a disrespectful child.Is there an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?Mike Gauyo (@blackboywrites). He was like an assistant on Claws, this show that I love, and also too, on this upcoming season of Insecure. He was actually on a writers staff for Ginny and Georgia. Some of his work is in TV, but I would love to see him be able to break through more doors.Who are three people that you think everyone should follow on Twitter?@Ryan_Ken_Acts on Twitter. He’s hilarious. He’s an actor, but he does parodies of movie stuff. He literally brightens up my day, because whatever I was thinking about a film he’s like spot on in his parody of it.I love Robert [Daniels] (@812filmreviews). Robert’s my fave. I love his spicy tweets. He’s also a great writer and it’s inspiring to watch Black critics excel the way that Robert has. I love that he uses his platform to uplift other voices and to also use his platform to fight for change, which really affects those spicy tweets.You know who I love? Joi Childs (@jumpedforjoi). I love watching her progression – we both worked corporate jobs and we’re film critics. To see her transition and see her working for Amazon – and seeing how she makes it a priority to uplift diverse voices, that she’s in a position of power and still continues to fight for that in a different arena – I think is really inspirational. … Joi’s one of those people that I just can’t wait to see what she’s doing 10 years from now, because I know she’s going to be a badass in whatever she’s doing.Just, I want us to get to a point where we uplift everyone. My goal in life is to have a platform so I can uplift those under-represented voices to provide more shine or light to people who are up and coming in the industry – whether it be actors, film makers, and writers. I think that is why we build our platform, that’s why we have an audience, to help usher in a new generation of people.Do you have any advice for critics who are still finding their voice?Just keep providing criticism. Your voice is going to change, how I view movies, how I reviewed movies is totally different from when I first started, to where I am now. And I think that as you get more access, and you’ll start to see that you have a bigger responsibility. … It’s such a huge thing to put your art out there, and there’s a respect that has to be had.I would just tell people to keep fighting, keep pushing. If there aren’t any lanes for you to succeed in, then create your own lane. And just always be true to yourself. Don’t change who you are, don’t try to sound like someone else. I always tell people, especially when they ask me how to become successful on YouTube, even though I don’t feel like I’ve found success yet myself: What viewpoint or what perspective are you giving that you’re currently not seeing?I started my channel because on YouTube I didn’t see Black people, especially Black women, who looked like me giving their thoughts on films and TV shows.That’s the important thing that everyone misses. I think everyone looks at who’s successful and, “I need to be just like them. I need to write like them. Why can’t I write like them? Why can’t I come up with these think pieces like everyone else?” I think that if you’re chasing someone else’s dream, you’re never going to realize your own, or even be able to live it.You have to always be true to yourself at all times. Just be you. There are going to be people who don’t like you. There are people who don’t like me – they don’t like my long nails, they don’t like how I talk – but I have to always be me. And there’s going to be people out there who enjoy you for who you are and the work and the viewpoint that you bring to the criticism.Sharronda Williams&nbsp;is the founder of&nbsp;Pay or Wait,&nbsp;a YouTube channel&nbsp;and&nbsp;an online publication&nbsp;centered on entertainment reviews and interviews.

This season – one unlike any we have seen in recent years – has had its share of upheaval over the past eight months. First came the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’s decision to push back the awards ceremony to April, and then several marquee titles vacated the 2020 calendar due to COVID-19 shutting down the theatrical box office. The ceremony&nbsp;itself will take place at satellite venues around the globe with the bulk of the show taking place outside at Los Angeles’ Union Station.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.One result of all this change is that we have a host of tiles and performances that many audiences – and a not-insignificant&nbsp;number of AMPAS voters – have yet to screen.With all&nbsp;that in mind, we decided to break down some of the top categories in the final days of the season&nbsp;and give our odds on who’s most likely to be going home with some hardware come Oscar night. Up first we have the Actor categories, both Supporting and Lead.Disagree with our picks and odds? Have at us in the comments.BEST SUPPORTING ACTORLeslie Odom Jr.,&nbsp; 98% One Night in Miami (2020)The Role: Four famous friends – Jim Brown, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Cassius Clay – share a night in a hotel room in Miami and Hamilton‘s&nbsp;Leslie Odom Jr.&nbsp;is Oscar-nominated for his performance as Cooke. Odom Jr.’s talent is on full display as he transforms into the charismatic star who spends most of the film battling with the equally formidable Malcolm X. And no voter is going to forget his stirring rendition of the soul singer’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” at the closing of the film.The Odds:&nbsp;With one of the best lines of the film and an exclamation point of a closing number, Odom Jr. rises above the already&nbsp;impeccable&nbsp;ensemble. And though we think he has faded a bit under the blinding light of Daniel Kaluuya’s star power and sweep of the major awards so far for his work in Judas and the Black Messiah, the Tony-winner is still in the mix for a reasonable upset if there is one brewing.Paul Raci,&nbsp; 97% Sound of Metal (2020)(Photo by Amazon Studios)The Role:&nbsp;Joe, the leader of a home for troubled deaf youth, who gives shelter and education to Ruben (Riz Ahmed), a rock-metal drummer who recently lost his hearing.&nbsp;Joe is the mentor, patriarch, and a frank counselor&nbsp;who&nbsp;guides Ruben to accept this new diagnosis, which in turn allows him to find peace.The Odds:&nbsp;Not to knock his chances, but this year the journeyman character actor (check out our detailed breakdown of his career here) is poised to reap rich benefits from just being nommed. Just&nbsp;as with Robert Forster after his late-career Oscar nomination for Jackie Brown, we don’t think this is the last we will see from the 40-year acting veteran – but this time is not likely his year to take home gold.Sacha Baron Cohen,&nbsp; 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)(Photo by Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;Abbie Hoffman, one of the&nbsp;seven men charged with inciting a riot outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.&nbsp;Cohen relies on his natural comedic timing and biting political wit to bring authenticity and humor to one of the most recognizable men of the 1960s’ counter-culture movement.The Odds: The sole acting performance to stand out as awards-worthy amongst the likes of Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne, Jeremy Strong, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Frank Langella in a film tailor-made for an awards voting body, many of whom most likely&nbsp;lived through the events of the narrative – that is a power plus. Coupled with the recent SAG ensemble win for the cast, and a second Oscar nomination for writing on the Borat sequel, and it’s hard to dismiss Cohen’s chances… but even he will likely be lapped by Kaluuya’s late surge.LaKeith Stanfield,&nbsp; 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)The Role:&nbsp;William O’Neal, a petty thief turned FBI informant who befriends then betrays Fred Hampton, the Chairman of the Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther party.&nbsp;As the “Judas” half of the title, the Get Out and Sorry to Bother You&nbsp;star wrings every ounce of tension and anxiety out of himself to embody the informant under deep cover but completely naive to who’s the real enemy.The Odds:&nbsp;When we made our original Oscar predictions, we placed Stanfield at a near-zero chance to make it&nbsp;to nominations morning – particularly as he was campaigning in the hotly contested Best Actor field – but lo and behold here he sits with a puzzling Best Supporting Actor nomination. So let’s just say it’s unlikely he will win. Stranger things have happened in Oscar’s 93 year history, though, and clearly we’ve been wrong on this one before.Daniel Kaluuya,&nbsp; 96% Judas and the Black Messiah (2021)The Role:&nbsp;Fred Hampton – one of most pivotal if not well-known names from the Black Civil Rights movement – the leader of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party who was assassinated by the Chicago Police following a raid orchestrated by FBI informant William O’Neal.The Odds:&nbsp;The role of a&nbsp;tragic true-life figure, whose story comes loaded with issues relevant to the current national conversation, would be&nbsp;enough to get anyone into the conversation – especially a former Best Actor nominee. But Kaluuya’s&nbsp;sweep of the BAFTA, Golden Globes, Critics Choice, and SAG awards make his win in this category foregone conclusion.&nbsp;His odds are even.BEST ACTORRiz Ahmed, 97% Sound of Metal (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Ruben, a metal drummer on tour with his girlfriend and living out of an RV, whose rapid-onset hearing loss threatens everything he holds dear. Playing a person grappling with a sudden diagnosis, Ahmed shines not only as he wrestles with the anger over his loss but also his obstinate and foolish&nbsp;railing against reality.The Odds:&nbsp;There is a growing push for Ahmed, who made history as the first British Pakistani to be nominated for Best Actor and one of only a handful of South-Asian actors to ever earn an acting nomination – but that will likely not have enough traction to combat the inevitability of the Best Actor frontrunner.Gary Oldman, 82% Mank (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Citizen Kane scribe&nbsp;Herman J. Mankiewicz, who battled his director and co-writer Orson Welles, Hollywood, the Hearst empire, and his own demons on his quest to pen what many argue is the greatest screenplay ever written.The Odds:&nbsp;After it took decades of Oscar-worthy work – and yes we include his work in The Professional and True Romance&nbsp;– for Oldman to get his first Oscar nomination, followed closely by his first win,&nbsp;we appreciate&nbsp;the actor getting quick and deserved praise for his&nbsp;performance in&nbsp;Mank.&nbsp;But sadly the film has little chance of taking home any Oscars outside of the craft awards (though Amanda Seyfried&nbsp;may&nbsp;cause an upset for Best Supporting Actress), despite Oldman’s typically great performance.Anthony Hopkins, 98% The Father (2021)The Role:&nbsp;The eponymous Father, an aging man suffering from&nbsp;Alzheimer’s who is reluctant to employ&nbsp;a full-time caretaker and who becomes increasingly confused, angry, and terrified as the faces and events around him become unrecognizable.The Odds:&nbsp;Since&nbsp;The Father‘s debut at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2020,&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins&nbsp;has been penciled in at the top of just about every Best Actor tip sheet by awards prognosticators, and he would have remained there if not for Chadwick Boseman. However, the Oscar winner’s recent BAFTA Best Actor win is nothing to dismiss lightly, so we place him still in the thick of things despite losing front-runner status.&nbsp;He’s a solid chance for an upset – if an upset is in the cards.Steven Yeun, 98% Minari (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Jacob, a Korean immigrant singularly focused on his quest to taste the “American Dream,” uproots his family and moves them from California to a tiny Arkansas farm. Saddled with a determination that borders on delusion, Jacob still remains disarming and empathetic in large part due to Steven Yeun‘s quiet charm.The Odds:&nbsp;Nothing would please us more than finding a way to give a tie to Yeun and the current Oscar favorite, but alas that is not possible. Still, as this is the first Oscar nomination for Yeun – who has been on Certified Fresh streak since his departure from The Walking Dead&nbsp;–&nbsp;we feel this is just a stop on what is likely to a long journey in awards contention.Chadwick Boseman,&nbsp; 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)(Photo by Netflix )The Role: Levee, the trumpeter in Ma Rainey’s band, who dreams of recording his own music and&nbsp;bristles at the control Ma&nbsp;commands over his artistry. In his last role to be released following his untimely death last year,&nbsp;Boseman gives the best performance of his career as&nbsp;a cocky and troubled musician.The Odds:&nbsp;There’s little chance of anyone topping Boseman this year. And while&nbsp;the win will be a fitting way to honor the&nbsp;the actor’s legacy, it will also&nbsp;be undeniably&nbsp;deserved given the spectacular work he did on screen in the film.

The studio’s latest feature, Luca, is arguably on that lower tier, according to critics — not among Pixar’s best but still better than most alternatives — hence the high Tomatometer score we’ve come to expect, even if there isn’t quite as much of the excitement we usually find in the reviews themselves. Some critics think that it’s too basic, while others believe its lack of complexity is a good thing. And some critics trust that there’s more to the movie than what’s on the surface and it requires repeat viewings to properly appreciate it. Fortunately for anyone hoping to find out, Luca can be watched over and over on Disney+ starting this Friday, June 18.Here’s what critics are saying about Pixar’s Luca:How does it compare to other Pixar movies?Luca leans far lighter in tone and effect, but it’s no less memorable.–&nbsp;Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsLuca&nbsp;is easily Pixar’s most intimate and laidback effort since&nbsp;Ratatouille.–&nbsp;Keith Watson, Slant MagazineThe last fifteen minutes of&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;might go down as one of the best endings Pixar has ever produced.–&nbsp;Ryan McQuade, Awards WatchThis might be Pixar’s most childlike and cartoony offering.–&nbsp;Brian Roan, The Film StageMore of The Good Dinosaur or Onward level for me, Luca doesn’t quite reach the potential that I have grown to expect from Pixar.–&nbsp;Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansWhile some material may hit with younger audiences, Luca makes for Pixar’s least enchanting, least special film yet.–&nbsp;Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com(Photo by Pixar)Is it just a simpler Pixar movie than we’re used to?Luca&nbsp;is nowhere near as complex or deep as other Pixar fare and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportAll the more satisfying for its simplicity… the rare Pixar movie that doesn’t feel like it’s been thought to death.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireIt is rigorously unphilosophical in a way that proves to be its greatest strength.– Clarisse Loughrey, IndependentBy going back to basics, we get a real connection with these characters.– Ryan McQuade, Awards WatchLuca&nbsp;has the look and feel of a more disposable flick, but that’s just on the surface. Beneath, it has the beating heart of a classic family tale in the making.– Joey Magidson, Awards RadarLuca never quite rises beyond being adorable — and hey, these days, adorable is fine —there’s something that just isn’t there.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesHow are the visuals?The real magic of&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;is its visuals… The richness of the settings in both realms is a constant source of pleasure.– David Rooney, Hollywood ReporterLooking like a hand-drawn fairy tale book come to animated life, Luca&nbsp;has a captivating visual style with every detail popping.– Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-TimesThe gorgeous animation of&nbsp;Luca… is unlike other Pixar movies you’ve seen.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyIt’s been a while since they’ve done anything visually distinct and felt vastly different from the rest of their fare.

But… [it] may just leave you in a puddle of tears.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportYeah, it’s cliched to say “I got misty-eyed in a Pixar movie,” but damn by the way they invest you with the friendship, it’s difficult not to find yourself feeling all warm and fuzzy.– Rendy Jones, Rendy ReviewsHappy tears at how lovely it all is, fortunately, we’re not talking&nbsp;Toy Story 3&nbsp;or&nbsp;Inside Out&nbsp;trauma here.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyI watched twice and no Inside Out or Up equivalent eye watering… Luca misses the Pixar emotional pull for me.– Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansAre the characters memorable?Giulia’s lovable father Massimo, who instantly goes into the all-time list for best animated dads.– Ian Sandwell, Digital SpyA translucent anglerfish who Sacha Baron Cohen turns into one of Pixar’s funniest characters in less than two minutes of screen time.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireAs always, the Pixar magicians create a wonderfully populated world: I particularly enjoyed the cat character, who stares fixedly as only cats can.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle Times(Photo by Pixar)How is the screenplay?With all of its wit and perfectly interwoven story threads and running gags, [the script] bears all the hallmarks of the best of Pixar’s story trust.– Brian Roan, The Film StageThe script… like all the best Pixar movies, laces touching life lessons and delicate helpings of sentiment into what’s essentially a caper.– David Rooney, Hollywood ReporterWhy do another narrative about a&nbsp;girl stuck in the middle of two best friends?… The primary story flows through the motions.– Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.comUnfortunately, there’s also an episodic, shaggy-dog quality to the plotting that undercuts&nbsp;Luca’s emotional beats.– Keith Watson, Slant MagazineAre its themes up for interpretation?This really is a metaphorical film. The sea monsters could be any of us who feel different. Maybe they’re a metaphor for the LGBTQ community.– Danielle Solzman, Solzy at the MoviesIt’s the kind of metaphor that could be applied to a hundred different situations, but there’s an inherently queer subtext bubbling beneath the surface.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportVery relatable for anyone who is within the LGBTQ+ community… [and also] works for a universal audience who may not identify as LGBTQ+ but can relate to someone who is.– Ryan McQuade, Awards Watch[It] serves as a kind of all-purpose allegory, where audiences are free to narrow in on its queer subtext, its rebuke of xenophobia, or its triumph against any facet of small-mindedness.– Clarisse Loughrey, IndependentIts themes of coming-of-age resemble too much of Pixar’s existing catalog — and without a narrative that really makes these themes feel fresh.– Nicole Clark, IGN MoviesIt never settles on exactly what it wants to say… It never makes a cohesive, powerful point.– Germain Lussier, io9.comWho is Luca ultimately for?While Disney and Pixar’s Luca is fun for the whole family, there are some very important messages for children laced throughout the film.– Tessa Smith, Mama’s GeekyLuca&nbsp;is entertainment for all ages as its bright colors and fast-moving action will appeal to the kids while the humor and themes should speak to older viewers.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsWhile there are a few moments that may be a little tense for younger kids… I recommend Pixar’s Luca for kids as young as 5-6 years old.– Christie Cronan, Raising WhasiansWill it remind us of any other films?Luca is the closest that Pixar has ever come to capturing the ineffable spirit of a Studio Ghibli film.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireThe smooth, rounded character designs are something more akin to the stop-motion work of Aardman Animations.– Doug Jamieson, The Jam ReportThere are obvious shades of&nbsp;The Little Mermaid&nbsp;in this fairy tale-like story… but&nbsp;Luca&nbsp;plays like a deliberate inversion of that Disney classic.– Keith Watson, Slant MagazineLuca&nbsp;is The Little Mermaid without the heart, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs without the laughs.– Roger Moore, Movie Nation(Photo by Pixar)Is it rewatchable?Expect to visit this destination more than once.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsSince it’s so dense and layered, my guess is it’ll only improve, solidify and blossom with multiple viewings… I do want to watch it again.– Germain Lussier, io9.comIt’s also so fabulously summery that you shouldn’t be surprised if you return to it over and over for that sunny feeling.– Deirdre Molumby, entertainment.ieWill&nbsp;Luca leave us hopeful for Pixar’s future?Luca&nbsp;should be the model going forward for Pixar, with character driving entertaining stories instead of big concepts that fail to execute and leave you feeling hollow by the end (looking at you&nbsp;Soul).– Ryan McQuade, Awards Watch[It] hopefully anticipates how the monolithic animation house will continue to create more intimate fare now that it can use Disney+ as a safety net.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireLuca&nbsp;releases in theaters and streams on Disney+ on June 18, 2021.On an Apple device?

Case in point: You’re the Worst star Aya Cash joins the second season as Stormfront, a character who in the comics is described as a male neo-Nazi.Executive producer and showrunner Eric Kripke&nbsp;(Supernatural) told journalists that this change was two-fold: The first, he said is because they wanted to create an antagonist to Anthony Starr’s villain, Homelander, and that “his worst nightmare would be a strong woman who wasn’t afraid of him and proceeded to steal his spotlight. I think that would hurt him way more than if it were a male character, because he has a gaping hole of insecurity.”The second was more of a commentary on modern society.“Stormfront … has certain hateful ideologies,” Kripke said. “And the truth is there’s a lot of hate and negative thought these days, if you look online, that is packaged in really slick social media, attractive ways. And, you know, it’s not like old dudes with crewcuts in the 1960s news reels anymore. It’s a very real and slick and charming people that are trying to — young people who are trying to hook in a new generation, and we sort of wanted to reflect how insidious that is.”Cash said she trained for two months for the part.The Boys returns to Amazon Prime Video on September 4.More from Amazon this week:Amazon Prime Video debuted the official trailer for Mangrove, one of five films featured in Small Axe, the anthology series from Academy Award–, BAFTA-, and Golden Globe–winning filmmaker Steve McQueen (Hunger, 12 Years A Slave).Amazon Studios announced that it has ordered a pickup of the new hour-long series A League of Their Own, from Sony Pictures Television, with executive producers and co-creators Abbi Jacobson (Broad City), who also stars, and Will Graham (Mozart in the Jungle).Lovecraft Country&nbsp;Tackles Supernatural Demons and Real-World EvilLovecraft Country, creator Misha Green’s upcoming adaptation of the Matt Ruff horror novel, has plenty to show in the way of blood-thirsty demons and sci-fi beings. Out August 16, it also shows evil that is all too real.“I think that the monsters are a metaphor for the racism that’s kind of always been through America and even globally,” Green told journalists of her series that’s set during the Jim Crow era. “And I think that, for me, genre works best when it is the metaphor on top of the real-life emotions that you explore in the real-life problems. And I think that that was one of the things that was exciting to me about Matt Ruff’s book, is that he blended that very well, and we wanted to really honor that as we did the TV series.”Jurnee Smollett, who plays female lead Leti Dandridge in the show, added that “the story is so ancestral.”“Our heroes essentially are going on a quest to bring down white supremacy,” she said. “And we are still on that quest today in 2020 as Black Americans. Because racism is such a demonic spirit, you know, it’s something that we are still fighting off.”Like Green’s previous series, WGN’s Underground, the show also makes use of popular music and culture, be it a Cardi B song or the theme song to The Jeffersons. Green says she likes to use “modern music to bridge time; to take kind of a period piece off the wall [so that] it’s not a portrait anymore that you’re stepping into.”In other WarnerMedia news:The first trailer for Ridley Scott’s U.S. TV directing debut&nbsp;Raised By Wolves&nbsp;also premiered this week.&nbsp;The series centers on two androids tasked with raising human children&nbsp;on a mysterious virgin planet.Trailers for&nbsp;The Third Day limited series starring Jude Law and Emily Watson, and socially-distanced food program Selena + Chef, hosted by Selena Gomez, and a new teaser for The Undoing, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, were also released.WarnerMedia is bringing the British game show reboot of The Cube stateside with a series order, executive produced and hosted by NBA legend Dwyane Wade.Ava DuVernay will executive produce and narrate One Perfect Shot, an HBO Max documentary series that will chronicle the most memorable cinematic moments of film auteurs.&nbsp;In the series, inspired by a popular Twitter account of the same name,&nbsp;each episode&nbsp;spotlights one acclaimed director, who will use visual tools to pull back the curtain on their most iconic shots. Using state-of-the-art technology, the directors will literally enter each shot, walking through the scene in 360 moments that allow viewers to join an immersive exploration of moviemaking.Gritty&nbsp;Gangs Of London Takes a Cue from the GreatsComing to AMC+, the streaming service associated with AMC Networks, is the bloody, violent (or is it bloody violent?) British crime drama Gangs Of London. Co-created by Gareth Evans — who is best known for The Raid action movies — and Matt Flannery, it tells the story of feuding international crime families. And if that makes you think of a certain group of New Jersey hustlers, you’re not alone.“I think all crime television and film will have had something of a sort of influence on us,” Evans told journalists. “I tend to take more from Asian cinema, quite honest … But for sure, I mean like you know, we’re all&nbsp;fans of The Sopranos, we’re all fans of Peaky Blinders, we’re all fans of the workspace of Scorsese or Coppola. We consume crime films, we consume everything that comes our way. So naturally, I think, when you make it something that fits within this genre, within this world, there will be influences.”On October 1, the first three episodes of Gangs of London will hit AMC+,&nbsp;the company’s new premium subscription bundle available on Comcast and Dish Network/Sling, with additional episodes dropping weekly after that. The show will air on AMC next year.More AMC Networks news and info:Fall 2020 and winter 2021 premiere datesSoulmates, AMC’s episodic anthology series, premieres Monday, October 5 at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT and has been renewed for a second seasonthe four-part limited series The Salisbury Poisonings, which will initially premiere on AMC+, the company’s new premium subscription bundle available on Comcast and Dish Network/Sling on Thursday, October 1&nbsp;(debuts on AMC early next year)(Photo by Alex Telfer/BBC STUDIOS/BBCA)premiering in January 2021 on BBC America, the all-new original series The Watch&nbsp;(pictured) inspired by many&nbsp;of Sir Terry Pratchett’s famous “Discworld” creations, including the captain of The City Watch, Sam Vimes, played by Game Of Thrones’&nbsp;Richard Dormer; “The comedic yet&nbsp;thrilling series pits trolls, werewolves, wizards and other improbable heroes against an evil plot to&nbsp;resurrect a great dragon which would lead to the destruction of life as they know it.”animated special Doctor Who: The Faceless Ones&nbsp;uses archived audio and new animation to reconstruct the fourth season of Doctor Who, which&nbsp;starred&nbsp;Patrick Troughton and was&nbsp;missing four episodes in the BBC film archives;&nbsp;premieres Wednesday, October 7 at 8 p.m. ET/7&nbsp;p.m. CT and Thursday, October 8 at 8 p.m. ET/7&nbsp;p.m. CT(For more announced dates visit Rotten Tomatoes’ “TV Premiere Dates” calendar.)AMC Networks has inked true crime development deals with Mona Chalabi (The Fix, Vagina Dispatches), Naomi Ekperigin (Broad City, Couples Therapy), Cameron Esposito (Queery, Take My Wife), and Jena Friedman (The Daily Show, Soft Focus).Casting for AMC’s new series Pantheon,&nbsp;a first-ever animated primetime drama; Daniel Dae Kim, Katie Chang, Paul Dano, Rosemarie DeWitt, Aaron Eckhart,&nbsp;Taylor Schilling, Ron Livingston, Chris Diamantopoulos, Raza Jaffrey, and Scoot McNairy lead the cast.Ratched&nbsp;Star Says Series Tells a Noir Tale in TechnicolorRatched, the flashy Ryan Murphy-produced prequel to One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, premieres September 18 on Netflix. It stars Sarah Paulson as the infamous castrating nurse made famous by Louise Fletcher in the Milos Forman movie.“I thought about Louise Fletcher every day that we were shooting it,” Paulson said during the Ratched panel, “and I hope that in the coming season there will be some Louise Fletcher.”Whether that’s a tease to some stunt casting (and Murphy does love to stunt cast), audiences should know that there are other differences between this production and the 1975 movie (or Ken Kesey’s novel). Filming took place in Big Sur instead of Oregon, and the series is set in 1947 in Lucia, California. It also pays a good deal of homage to Alfred Hitchcock films.“I think there is something about the moment; just immediately after World War II [when] so much economic hope and horizons being so wide for America at that point,” said Cynthia Nixon, who co-stars in the series as the politically savvy Gwendolyn Briggs. “I watched the series with my 17-year-old son, and he said one of the things that he loved the most about it was it was so frightening and creepy, but … it was sort of the antithesis of film noir. It wasn’t shadows. It wasn’t black and white. It was Technicolor.”More from Netflix this week:&nbsp;(Photo by Kerry Brown/Netflix)The streamer released a first-look at Rebecca, based on Daphne du Maurier’s beloved 1938 gothic novel and starring&nbsp;Lily James, Armie Hammer, Kristin Scott Thomas, Keeley Hawes, Ann Dowd, Sam Riley, Tom Goodman-Hill, Mark Lewis Jones, John Hollingworth, and Bill Paterson. In it, “a young&nbsp;newlywed arrives at her husband’s imposing family estate on a windswept English coast and finds herself battling the shadow of his first wife Rebecca, whose legacy lives on in the house long after her death.”Netflix also&nbsp;dropped trailers from animated series Hoops; reality show&nbsp;DeMarcus Family Rules, featuring the family of Rascal Flatts’ Jay DeMarcus; and a tease&nbsp;announcing the 2021 premiere of director Guillermo del Toro’s Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, the final installment in Tales of Arcadia animated film trilogy.Woke&nbsp;Gives a Voice to Black&nbsp;NerdsHulu’s new dramedy Woke is based loosely on the life of cartoonist Keith Knight, who co-created the series. Premiering September 9, it stars New Girl’s Lamorne Morris as a rising artist in San Francisco who, after a traumatizing event, begins to see the injustice of the world.To hear Knight tell it, the show might also give a voice to Black people who may have trouble fitting in the white male–dominated geek culture.“The idea that alternative culture is white culture, I think that is just a mirage,” Knight tells journalists. “I think the true punk culture, the true rock culture, the true — American culture is Black culture … And if you even scrape the surface of the history of this country, you will see that Black people have had a part in everything, not just music.”An example? Knight, who is a hockey fan, says “I just found out that like, modern hockey was like — hockey transformed by the grandkids of slaves that emigrated up to Canada.”More Hulu news:The company also released a trailer for the upcoming season of Pen15.Hulu announced season 2 renewals for Love, Victor and Taste The Nation with Padma Lakshmi (see Rotten Tomatoes’ “Renewed and Cancelled”).Girl From Plainville, starring Elle Fanning (who also stars in Hulu’s The Great), and docuseries The Next Thing You Eat from James Beard Award–winning chef David Chang and Academy Award–winning documentary filmmaker Morgan Neville received straight-to-series orders.Selena Gomez has joined as star and executive producer of the upcoming Hulu Original comedy Only Murders in the Building alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short.Hulu also announced fall premiere dates for Steven Spielberg–executive produced Animaniacs, upcoming drama series No Man’s Land, Hulu Original documentary I AM GRETA, food series Eater’s Guide to the World, and horror anthology series Monsterland&nbsp;(see Rotten Tomatoes’ “Premiere Dates” calendar).Vindication for Pepe the Frog?Documentary Feels Good Man&nbsp;looks at the how cartoonist Matt Furie’s drawing of a smiling green frog unintentionally became a symbol for hate on the Internet.“This is something that has never happened before,” director Arthur Jones told journalists. “The Anti-Defamation League never has declared a meme a hate symbol before. It has never declared a copyrighted character a hate symbol before.”He says it was “a process” for Furie, who participated in the film, “to figure out how to handle this. He tried to handle that via his artistic community first. Then he tried to find a set of lawyers to collaborate with to enforce the copyright in a way that he felt was right for him. While he’s doing this, he’s an artist; he’s starting a family — there’s a lot of stuff going on.”Feels Good Man will air on October 19&nbsp;as part of PBS’ Independent Lens series.Coming to You from the Bat Cave …(Photo by National Geographic)Journalists caught glimpses of lots of celebrities’ houses through this all-virtual press tour. But only one panel&nbsp;streamed from inside a bat cave: bat scientist Kendra Phelps and epidemiologist Chris Golden introduced us to some new friends while speaking on the panel for National Geographic’s upcoming documentary, Virus Hunters.Airing November 1 to be a companion piece to that month’s issue of the magazine, the special will tell “the stories of those heroic experts on the frontlines who are racing to identify the chain of events that could cause the next global pandemic,” said&nbsp;Nat Geo Senior Vice President of Communications Chris Albert, who introduced the panel.“Virus Hunters will aim to offer solutions, and some of those could include the work that Kendra and Jim [Desmond, a fellow panelist and a wildlife veterinarian] are doing where there is monitoring and surveillance of what is actually unfolding naturally within ecosystems,” Golden said. “I think it will beg the question of further policy- and decision-making that would lean on us to really view conservation as an important tool for public-health interventions.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"FX, news, TV, Country, Adult, visit","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"tca-roundup-the-boys-woke-lovecraft-country-ratched-more"},{"id":"47611733430378","title":"Who’s Going to Win Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 2021 Oscars?","content":"Trophy Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Who's Going to Win Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress at the 2021 Oscars?Awards expert Jacqueline Coley breaks down a tight three-way race for one award and a potential upset in another.by Jacqueline Coley | April 20, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by © Focus Features)After eight months of upheaval and uncertainty, an awards season unlike any we have seen in recent memory is finally — thankfully — entering its final days. We watched as several marquee titles vacated the 2020 calendar due to COVID-19, effectively shutting down the theatrical box office, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences pushed back its awards ceremony to April.&nbsp;The ceremony&nbsp;itself will take place at satellite venues worldwide, with the bulk of the show taking place outdoors at Los Angeles’ Union Station.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.One result of all this change is that we have a host of titles and performances that many audiences – and a not-insignificant&nbsp;number of AMPAS voters – have yet to screen.With all&nbsp;that in mind, we decided to break down some of the top categories in the final days of the season&nbsp;and give our odds on who’s most likely to be going home with some hardware come Oscar night. Following our first list breaking down all the Actor categories, both Supporting and Lead, we&nbsp;look at the female performances of Oscars 2021, again in both the Lead and Supporting categories.Disagree with our picks and odds? Have at us in the comments.BEST&nbsp;ACTRESSViola Davis 98% Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020)The Role:&nbsp;Ma Rainey, the Mother of the Blues and leader of her band. The groundbreaking musician and LGBTQ icon was once dubbed the ugliest woman in show business, and with the aid of false teeth, horsehair wigs, elaborate gowns, and a fat suit, Oscar winner Viola Davis gave life to the woman whose voice would have hundreds queuing up for hours just hear her croon or catch a glimpse of her on stage. Davis embodied not just Rainey’s presence on stage but also her steadfast determination not to allow anyone to diminish or dismiss her worth.The Odds:&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;there isn’t a clear frontrunner for Best Actress. Andra Day won the Golden Globe, Carey Mulligan took home the Critics Choice, and Frances McDormand won the BAFTA, but we are giving Viola Davis’ win at the SAG Awards the most weight and&nbsp;believe she will be our likely winner. This is fitting as her pedigree and previous Oscar nomination warrant it, and her only win was for a Supporting Role; she is more than overdue to win for a lead turn.Andra Day 56% The United States vs. Billie Holiday (2021)(Photo by Takashi Seida/©Hulu)The Role:&nbsp;Legendary singer Billie Holiday, whose career and battles with addiction and — as the title suggests — the U.S. government form the basis of the second big-screen narrative feature about her life.&nbsp;The portrayal comes courtesy of Grammy Award-winning songstress Andra Day, whose natural vocal talent and physical commitment to the role — which included extensive acting classes and a 40-lb. weight loss — transformed her into Holiday at her prime.The Odds:&nbsp;Captivating and dynamic performances, particularly by female performers, are often able to rise above a lackluster film. Last year, Renee Zellweger snagged a second Oscar for a film many critics&nbsp;considered well done but not remarkable.&nbsp;The United States vs. Billie Holiday, however, is not&nbsp;Judy. Although&nbsp;Day is outstanding, the film’s pedestrian narrative takes her firmly out of contention to win among the likes of Frances McDormand, Viola Davis, and Carey Mulligan — all of whom have been previously nominated, with Davis and McMcDormand both having at least one Oscar at home.Vanessa Kirby 75% Pieces of a Woman (2020)(Photo by Benjamin Loeb/Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;A young female executive in the final hours of her first pregnancy suffers a sudden loss when her child does not survive the at-home birth. Documented in a visceral and unbroken opening 20-minute scene, the film’s central tragedy finds Vanessa Kirby channeling intense&nbsp;grief and numb detachment to give a&nbsp;true-to-life&nbsp;portrayal of a woman trying to piece herself back together while her well-meaning family tries and fails to help her along.The Odds:&nbsp;After a win at the Venice International Film Festival for Best Actress,&nbsp;Kirby was poised for a deep run, but troubling headlines about her co-star pushed the film to the lower rung of contention, and Kirby has been mostly absent from virtual campaigning this year. We have to assume this was by design. Such an abrupt&nbsp;disappearance from the circuit is assumed to be because everyone involved —&nbsp;including Netflix —&nbsp;agreed this was not the year for Kirby, who will likely be back soon enough with award-worthy work.Frances McDormand 94% Nomadland (2021)The Role:&nbsp;Fern, an aging widow who chooses to hit the road&nbsp;as a #VanLife nomad after the financial crisis of 2008 and&nbsp;finds peace in isolated communities&nbsp;with other older Americans facing similar hardships.&nbsp;Frances McDormand disappears into the role of Fern, who discovers a new strength and sense of self as she&nbsp;travels the open roads of the American West.The Odds:&nbsp;The biggest knock that has been leveled against McDormand’s performance is that Fern is a difficult character to embrace, as she spends most of the film distancing herself from human connection. But in this painfully authentic look at how people deal with tragedy, we find a side of the Oscar-winning actress we haven’t often seen on screen: unbridled vulnerability. If the next knock is that she already has two Oscars, odds are she is still very much in the thick of it, and a recent BAFTA win makes this more of a possibility than it appears at first blush.Carey Mulligan 90% Promising Young Woman (2020)(Photo by Merie Weismiller Wallace/©Focus Features)The Role:&nbsp;Cassie, an avenging angel haunted by her past who brings justice to “Nice Guys” who prey on drunken women. Carey Mulligan&nbsp;embodies&nbsp;this delicious anti-hero for the #MeToo era, a vision of chaotic good in a candy-coated and hilariously macabre tale of a grief-stricken woman out for revenge.The Odds:&nbsp;In what ultimately amounts to a three-way race in the Best Actress cateogory, Mulligan is&nbsp;essentially the dark horse in the running, as most of the heat for&nbsp;Promising Young Woman is radiating from writer/director Emerald Fennell (who has more than a fighting chance to upset Aaron Sorkin and The Trial of the Chicago 7 for Best Original Screenplay).&nbsp;The chances of Mulligan coming out on top are less likely, but only by a slim margin.BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESSMaria Bakalova 85% Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)(Photo by Amazon Studios)The Role:&nbsp;The guileless and ever ready-to-please but often maligned daughter in Sacha Baron Cohen’s&nbsp;Borat&nbsp;sequel. Maria Bakalova’s ugly duckling transformation and ability to match Cohen beat for beat, staying in character for hours on end, are unquestionably Oscar-worthy feats, though some of the outrageous stunts she had to pull should&nbsp;win some kind of award for sheer commitment.The Odds:&nbsp;After nearly sweeping the critic’s groups a few weeks ago, Maria Bakalova was the odds-on favorite, but she faded a bit with losses at the BAFTAs and Golden Globes, and we while we hope to see more from the Bulgarian starlet, her meme-ability is likely the biggest prize she will take from this season.Glenn Close 26% Hillbilly Elegy (2020)The Role:&nbsp;The wise and caring grandmother who plays adoptive mother to JD Vance during his formative years growing up in Appalachia while his mother, played by Amy Adams, struggles with bad men and addiction.The Odds:&nbsp;We&nbsp;love Glenn Close and are desperate for the 8-time nominee finally to win, but&nbsp;with a Razzie nomination for the same role, we can’t see her taking the Supporting Actress prize this year for, let’s say, not her best outing, at least&nbsp;according to the critics. A legacy win for her could also knock out&nbsp;Minari’s&nbsp;Yuh-Jung Youn, a five-decade&nbsp;veteran of Korean cinema who is just as deserving.Olivia Colman 98% The Father (2021)(Photo by ©Sony Pictures Classics)The Role:&nbsp;The adult daughter of Anthony Hopkins’s eponymous father, who suffers from Alzheimer’s.The Odds:&nbsp;Many had Glenn Close pegged to win the year that Olivia Colman took home the Best Actress prize for The Favourite, but alas, it was not in the cards for Close that year. The&nbsp;same thing could happen in 2021, as The Father has emerged late as an AMPAS — yup, we’re gonna say it — favourite, but with many not having seen the film, and with most of the heat on Hopkins and the screenplay, Colman’s odds are likely lower.&nbsp;Of course, we’ve been wrong about&nbsp;that before.Amanda Seyfried 82% Mank (2020)(Photo by Courtesy of Netflix)The Role:&nbsp;Marion Davies, rumored Citizen Kane subject William Randolph Hearst’s muse and mistress. The clever woman who was at times the only one truly working behind the scenes in Hollywood on behalf of the notorious newspaper publisher was given life and her just due by Amanda Seyfried. The First Reformed&nbsp;star also hid her pregnancy under the period costumes, never giving away her secret — just like the real-life woman she was playing on screen.The Odds:&nbsp;Someone online recently stated that, had Mank been titled Marion and centered on the sultry, scheming mistress of William Randolph Hearst, the film would have swept every category. As it is, Mank&nbsp;is unlikely to win outside of the craft prizes, which is a shame, as Seyfried does the best work of her career here — well, her best work since Mean Girls,&nbsp;anyway.Yuh-Jung Youn 98% Minari (2020)(Photo by ©A24)The Role:&nbsp;Soon-ja,&nbsp;an&nbsp;unconventional and hilarious grandmother based on writer/director Lee Issac Chung’s&nbsp;real-life grandmother, who preferred playing cards and cracking jokes over baking cookies.The Odds:&nbsp;If a win at the SAGs, BAFTAs, and our feature on her career weren’t enough to convince you that Yuh-Jung Youn could win the Best Supporting Actress prize, her pedigree and incredible performance add plenty more. Still, for us, her viral BAFTA acceptance speech during which she jokingly called the Brits “snobbish” is the cherry on top of her awards momentum, giving her just enough to stand above her peers, as many will&nbsp;vote just to see what she says next — at least, that’s what we would do, given the chance.The&nbsp;93rd Academy Awards&nbsp;ceremony&nbsp;will be broadcast at 5 pm PST/8 pm EST on April 24, 2021, on ABC.&nbsp;Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.On an Apple device?

As the home to Hereditary, The Babadook, Get Out, and The Blair Witch Project, the Sundance Midnight program has a bit of a reputation, leaving this year’s selection with some pretty big shoes to fill.This year, genre spread to other sections of the programming, as fans needn’t have stayed up late at the Park City Library to catch some disturbing — or just plain weird — movies. No matter what your favorite genre is, you were bound to find something up your alley, from unusual documentaries to scary movies to fantastical comedies. And the good news is that distributors and streaming services are likely to snatch them up and make them available to you soon, with some of them already on the way.With expectations high, the question of what will be this year’s Hereditary-style hit is constantly brought up. We checked out the films competing to become this year’s big breakout hit, and rounded up what the critics were saying, so you can begin preparing your watchlists of what Sundance films are most likely to make a big impression once they get released.His House (2020)  100%(Photo by Aidan Monaghan courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDNetflix’s big acquisition at Sundance is this tale of horror both supernatural and human. His House tells the story of a refugee couple who flee the horrors of the South Sudan civil war and come to England to start a new life. What they find is something that doesn’t want them there, with the very walls of the house exuding a sinister vibe. What makes the film truly special is how it balances the supernatural horrors of a haunted house movie with a poignant and equally devastating immigration story of survivor’s guilt. As Benjamin Lee wrote for The Guardian, “The haunting that takes place is one that’s tied to something that feels real.”&nbsp;Netflix will release His House some time later this year,&nbsp;and once it does, you can expect a movie “that will make audiences scream, all while getting people to empathize with a refugee couple’s story by way of a haunted apartment,”&nbsp;as RogerEbert.com’s Nick Allen puts it.Save Yourselves! (2020)  89%(Photo by Matt Clegg courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDWe are all obsessed with our phones; there’s no denying that. But what happens if we try to distance ourselves from the internet for a short time? According to Save Yourselves!, you may miss an alien invasion. Su (Sunita Mani) and Jack (John Paul Reynolds) are a hip Millennial couple, ruled by the technology at their disposal. When Su suggests they get away without technology in order to cleanse themselves during a life-reaffirming week, they find themselves having to fight off adorable poof-like aliens that remind us of a cuter version of Critters, as the rest of the world is already under attack.&nbsp;Rachel Wagner from Rachel Reviews writes that the film “is not only a very funny look at modern Millennial life but a sweet romance of a couple who become stronger through facing off with aliens.” Save Yourselves!&nbsp;is currently looking for distribution.Relic (2020)  92%(Photo by Jackson Finter courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDThe best horror often manages to be both a terrifying piece of entertainment&nbsp;and a poignant commentary on our reality. A remarkable debut by Natalie Erika James, Relic turns the haunted house story on its head, using the horror genre to tell an emotional story of dementia. Australian stage legend Robyn Nevin gives a terrifying yet emotionally devastating performance as a woman whose mind and body is slowly failing her,&nbsp;while a strange and eerie presence haunts her home. “Like Mike Flanagan before her”, writes Film School Rejects’ Rob Hunter, “Natalie Erika James flawlessly blends terrifying horror with the ache of humanity.” Rest assured, when Relic finally gets released, it will make you scream before it pulls on your heart strings.Run Sweetheart Run (2020)  73%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: BlumhouseRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDBlumhouse returns to Sundance with its second “Sweetheart”-titled movie in&nbsp;Run Sweetheart Run. Like last year’s Sweetheart, this movie finds a young woman having to go toe-to-toe with an inhuman monster, as we follow Ella Balinska’s Cherie&nbsp;on her first date in a while. The problem is that her date turns out less than stellar, and she is forced to run through the streets of Los Angeles for an entire night to escape the blood-loving monster she mistook for a chance at romance. Though critics note that the metaphors are thinly-veiled at best, Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro writes&nbsp;that “Run Sweetheart Run makes for an entertaining and cheeky trip centered around woman’s curse.”Bad Hair (2020)  62%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDA social thriller starring a killer weave, Bad Hair is a campy throwback to ’80s horror B-movies with a whole lot on its mind. Writer-director Justin Simien returns to Sundance with a film about the importance of and controversy surrounding hair in the Black community, focusing on a lowly assistant at a TV show who gets a new hairstyle that helps her move up in her career – with some deadly, bloodthirsty consequences. Writing for That Shelf, Victor Stiff explains that the film&nbsp;“is a delightful horror dramedy that interrogates black women’s struggle to be true to themselves in the face of a system hellbent on snuffing out their blackness.” Bad Hair is looking for distribution.Possessor: Uncut (2020)  93%(Photo by Karim Hussain courtesy of Sundance Institute)Release Date:&nbsp;TBDPlaying like a horror version of Inception, Brandon Cronenberg&nbsp;(yes, son of David) takes us on a disturbing, bloody nightmare that’s unlike anything you’ve seen before. The film stars Andrea Riseborough as a contract killer whose consciousness gets implanted into others so she can control them into committing murders for hire — that is, until she finds herself struggling to control a particularly difficult body. This is a movie that’s not for the faint of heart, as Slashfilm’s Chris Evangelista writes: “This isn’t a work designed to thrill and entertain. Instead, it’s meticulously crafted to horrify. The violence on display here is graphic to the extreme, yet it never feels cartoonish.” While the violence and blood may be too much for some viewers, critics agree that this film is a unique experience worth seeing; as Rob Hunter writes for Film School Rejects,&nbsp;Possessor “is fantastically and cruelly unforgettable.” Keep an eye out for Possessor as it looks for distribution.Into the Deep (2020)  100%(Photo by Courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: NetflixRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDThe rare documentary to play at the midnight slot, this bone-chilling film started as an homage to Danish amateur inventor Peter Madsen before turning into an exploration of evil when Madsen murdered and dismembered Swedish journalist Kim Wall during the time the doc was being shot. Emma Sullivan’s Into the Deep features stunning footage both pre-murder and in its immediate aftermath, dealing with the shock of the filmmakers realizing what kind of subject they’re following as their film begins to&nbsp;resemble something akin to a horror flick. Writing for Vanyaland, Nick Johnston says, “Into the Deep is a unique beast in a documentary landscape that’s more consumed than ever with the true-crime genre, and it is a must-watch for anyone even slightly curious about the events of this bizarre and tragic crime.” Netflix will release Into the Deep later this year.The Night House (2021)  88%(Photo by Elisha Christian courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: Searchlight PicturesRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDLike A Quiet Place&nbsp;in 2018, The Night House relies on sound to create a terrifying horror experience that will make your bones vibrate. After the loss of her husband, Beth (Rebecca Hall) begins to spend her nights plagued by strange dreams and creepy noises around the house. Critics spoke highly of Hall’s performance, with Birth.Movies.Death’s Ed Travis calling her a “scream queen.” They also commended the string of jump scares that shook audiences at the fest;&nbsp;Bloody Disgusting’s Meagan Navarro explains&nbsp;“[the film] leaves you breathless and your heart pumping hard.” Searchlight Pictures bought the distribution rights for the film and will be releasing at a later date.Scare Me (2020)  84%(Photo by Brendan Banks courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: ShudderRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDNo matter how elaborate or grand a horror movie is, the scariest memories most of us have still belong to the nights we spent as youngsters listening to scary stories after dark. Scare Me takes the tale of an aspiring horror screenwriter trapped in a snowy cabin with a best-selling horror novelist telling each other stories and turns it into an exploration of the creative process and even gender politics, all while delivering a minimalist yet still spooky experience. As Daily Dead’s Heather Wixson writes,&nbsp;“Scare Me is an absolute delight and a real gift for both horror fans as well as those of us who can’t get enough of hearing a good story.’” Shudder will release Scare Me at a later date.Spree (2020)  67%(Photo by Rylan Perry courtesy of Sundance Institute)Distributor: RLJE FilmsRelease Date:&nbsp;TBDEugene Kotlyarenko’s Spree asks, “What if Joker was a streamer and wannabe influencer?” The thriller-comedy, which is shot found-footage style, features&nbsp;Joe Keery doing his best&nbsp;Arthur Fleck impersonation as a guy obsessed with becoming internet famous by streaming a night of violent mayhem. It’s a commentary on our collective obsession with social media, privilege, and the darkness of comment sections. What makes the film more than just a&nbsp;Black Mirror&nbsp;episode is how it infuses&nbsp;jokes and gags into the horror – and then seems to ask why we’re laughing. Nick Allen wrote for RogerEbert.com that “Spree brilliantly shows influencer culture for the totally demented lifestyle that it is.” RLJE Films will release Spree later this year.Like this?

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.For the foreseeable future, the specialty box office and all theatrical releases will be on hold as we all make efforts to socially distance ourselves and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. With that in mind, we have reshaped our Indie Fresh List to reflect the specialty box office releases that are newly available on&nbsp;streaming services and VOD. This week we have a gender-bent alternative history&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Ned Kelly legend, a high school drama about embezzlement, and the long-awaited conclusion to the beloved Ip Man action saga. In our Spotlight section, we call back to a black and white horror tale that’s newly available to stream online and a horror-comedy starring Will Forte that you might have missed from earlier this year.Streaming This WeekendBad Education (2019)  94%&nbsp;Cory Finley follows up his standout debut&nbsp;Thoroughbreds&nbsp;with this&nbsp;dramatic retelling of the Roslyn School district&nbsp;embezzlement scandal, a salacious tale of sex, greed, and gross stupidity. Writer&nbsp;Mike Makowsky&nbsp;crafted the screenplay from his own experiences as a former student of the infamous elite&nbsp;school district&nbsp;that was embroiled in scandal when it was discovered the administration and Superintendent had stolen over $11 million in frivolous expenses via fraud.&nbsp;With noteworthy performances from&nbsp;Allison Janney,&nbsp;Blockers breakout&nbsp;Geraldine Viswanathan,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hugh Jackman&nbsp;in a&nbsp;career-best turn,&nbsp;the film and its cast look to be major contenders&nbsp;for Emmys in the fall. “A diabolically smart true-life crime drama that stars Hugh Jackman in his best performance since The Prestige,” writes David Ehrlich of Indiewire.Streaming on April 25 at 8pm on HBONow,&nbsp;and&nbsp;HBO Go.Ip Man 4: The Finale (2019)  84%Chinese megastar and&nbsp;fight choreographer&nbsp;Donnie Yen has been a bankable name in Chinese cinema for over three decades, but if you’re not an avid fan of Asian&nbsp;action films, you may have missed his jaw-dropping fight choreography and stunt work from films like Iron Monkey, Seven Swords, and Zhang Yimou’s epic masterwork&nbsp;Hero. Most Americans will recognize him from&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, where he played Chirrut Imwe, a blind&nbsp;warrior monk. However, Yen’s most synonymous and successful performance&nbsp;is&nbsp;his portrayal of Bruce Lee’s teacher, Ip Man, for the eponymous film series based on the life of the master martial artist. This weekend the supposed final installment of the series is available to rent on VOD. Each of the four films has been rated fresh on the Tomatometer and raked in impressive box office hauls due mostly to Yen’s performance and mesmerizing fight scenes. Douglas Davidson from Elements of Madness called the finale to the series “a closing tale that solidifies this series as one of the more innovative and emotionally compelling martial arts sagas in recent memory.”Rent or Buy on FandangoNOW&nbsp;(Discounted Series Bundle),&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.True History of the Kelly Gang (2020)  79%The story of Ned Kelly has been adapted over a dozen times for film and television, with everyone from Mick Jagger to&nbsp;Heath Ledger playing the legendary Australian outlaw. This latest version starring 1917’s&nbsp;George MacKay&nbsp;is a queer-bent&nbsp;mystical folk drama that sets itself apart from every iteration&nbsp;that preceded it. Dubbed the “Australian Jessie James,” Kelly serves as an enduring tribute&nbsp;to civil disobedience, and this new retelling is a singular piece of cinema based on&nbsp;Peter Carey’s equally impressive Booker Prize-winning novel.&nbsp;“A compelling, grubby outback Western revealing the ragged reality behind a folk hero [with] terrific performances, incredible visuals, and a reassertion of&nbsp;Justin Kurzel as a bold filmmaker most comfortable dealing with discomfort,” writes&nbsp;Nev Pierce&nbsp;of&nbsp;Empire Magazine.Available April 24 to&nbsp;rent or buy at&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.Fresh &amp; Available Now on VOD – Spotlight PicksExtra Ordinary (2020)  98%If you’re looking for your next indie comedy, now would be a perfect time to check out&nbsp;Extra Ordinary. In his first feature film lead role since the cult classic&nbsp;MacGruber,&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Forte is brilliant in this&nbsp;clever horror rom-com about a nervous widower&nbsp;and the&nbsp;driving instructor he encounters&nbsp;with supernatural “talents.” Throughout the narrative, the couple&nbsp;battles the spirit world and maybe falls in love.&nbsp;The film’s&nbsp;bizarre cast of characters, botched exorcisms, Satan worship, and truly cringe-worthy comedic moments likely won’t terrify, but will leave you in stitches. Writer/directors&nbsp;Enda Loughman&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Mike Ahern’s&nbsp;debut film is a hit with critics and still boasts a Certified Fresh 98% on the Tomatometer. “A defiantly odd piece of work, one that comes from a very unique sense of humor that works for most of its running time, even if this is the kind of thing that likely connects with the funny bone more on late-night cable than it does in the theater,” writes&nbsp;Brian Tallerico&nbsp;of&nbsp;Roger Ebert.com.Available to rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu, Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;and&nbsp;iTunes.&nbsp;The Lighthouse (2019)  90%&nbsp;Last week, Amazon Prime Video made the Oscar-nominated black and white horror tale&nbsp;The Lighthouse available to stream. It hits perhaps a little too close to home&nbsp;given the current situation, but watching Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe go crazy in a remote lighthouse might serve as a reminder of just how bad things&nbsp;could&nbsp;be. Following up his cult smash hit&nbsp;The Witch, Robert Eggers’ sophomore effort is a&nbsp;rain-soaked fever dream in which&nbsp;Pattinson&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dafoe&nbsp;star as two lighthouse keepers – or “wickies” – who are beset and tormented by unseen, or perhaps imaginary, dark forces while cut off from the outside world, with only their uneasy cohabitation to keep them sane. Or not. Heavily influenced by the early 20th-century painter Andrew Wyeth, Eggers (who co-wrote the film with his brother Max Eggers) utilizes 19th-century filming techniques and vintage&nbsp;camera equipment to give the film its distinctive period aesthetic.&nbsp;Lewis Knight of the&nbsp;Daily Mirror&nbsp;describes the film as&nbsp;“[A] gothic, dark fairy-tale, incomprehensible…and incredibly elusive throughout, which only serves to make it more hypnotic as it weaves its dark web before it reaches its chilling&nbsp;climax.”Available&nbsp;to&nbsp;stream now on&nbsp;Amazon; available to rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;and&nbsp;iTunes.Along with… Swallow (2020) , about an affluent housewife who develops a deadly case of pica — the urge to swallow inanimate objects.

Sam Mendes’ acclaimed WWI thriller, which is directed and shot to produce the illusion of a single take, was the leading horse going into the night with a total of nine nominations, and managed to win&nbsp;seven of those: Best Film, Outstanding British Film, Best Director for Mendes, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Production Design, and Best Cinematography for the legendary Roger Deakins.&nbsp;Bong Joon-ho’s&nbsp;Parasite won&nbsp;Best Film Not In the English Language as expected, but also Best Original Screenplay for Joon-ho and co-writer Han Jin-won over the heavily favored Quentin Tarantino.Joker&nbsp;was another big winner on the night, taking out not just Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix – at this point if you’re betting against him on Oscar night you must seriously dislike money – but also winning for Best Original Music for&nbsp;Hildur Guđnadóttir’s score and for Best Casting, the first time that awards has been given out. Among the other acting categories, things went as planned: Renée Zellweger, Laura Dern, and Brad Pitt all took home awards.&nbsp;Perhaps the biggest upset of the night, and one which might shake those feeling smug about their Oscar picks, came in the animated category, where&nbsp;Toy Story 4&nbsp;lost out to Netflix’s holiday film,&nbsp;Klaus.See the full list of winners nominees below and let us know what you think of the BAFTA picks below.&nbsp;BEST FILM1917 89%The Irishman 95%Joker 68%Once Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Parasite (Gisaengchung) 98%OUTSTANDING BRITISH FILM1917 89%Bait 100%For Sama 99%Rocketman 89%Sorry We Missed You 88%The Two Popes 89%OUTSTANDING DEBUT BY A BRITISH WRITER, DIRECTOR OR PRODUCERMark Jenkin, Kate Byers, Linn WaiteBait 100%Waad Al-Kateab, Edward WattsFor Sama 99%Alex HolmesMaiden 98%Harry WootliffOnly You 96%Álvaro Delgado-AparicioRetablo 100%FILM NOT IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGEThe Farewell 97%For Sama 99%Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) 96%Parasite (Gisaengchung) 98%Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu) 98%DOCUMENTARYAmerican Factory 96%Apollo 11 99%Diego Maradona 90%For Sama 99%The Great Hack 87%ANIMATED FILMFrozen II 78%Klaus 94%A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon 96%Toy Story 4 97%DIRECTORSam Mendes1917 89%Martin ScorseseThe Irishman 95%Todd PhillipsJoker 68%Quentin TarantinoOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Bong Joon-hoParasite (Gisaengchung) 98%ORIGINAL SCREENPLAYSusanna Fogel, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins, Katie SilbermanBooksmart 96%Rian JohnsonKnives Out 97%Noah BaumbachMarriage Story 94%Quentin TarantinoOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin-wonParasite (Gisaengchung) 98%ADAPTED SCREENPLAYSteven ZaillianThe Irishman 95%Taika WaititiJojo Rabbit 80%Todd Phillips, Scott SilverJoker 68%Greta GerwigLittle Women 95%Anthony MccartenThe Two Popes 89%LEADING ACTRESSJessie BuckleyWild RoseScarlett JohanssonMarriage StorySaoirse RonanLittle WomenCharlize TheronBombshellRenée ZellwegerJudyLEADING ACTORLeonardo DiCaprioOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodAdam DriverMarriage StoryTaron EgertonRocketmanJoaquin PhoenixJokerJonathan PryceTwo PopesSUPPORTING&nbsp;ACTRESSLaura DernMarriage StoryScarlett JohanssonJojo RabbitFlorence PughLittle WomenMargot RobbieBombshellMargot RobbieOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodSUPPORTING ACTORTom HanksA Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodAnthony HopkinsTwo PopesAl PacinoThe IrishmanJoe PesciThe IrishmanBrad PittOnce Upon A Time in HollywoodORIGINAL MUSICThomas Newman1917 89%Michael GiacchinoJojo Rabbit 80%Hildur GuđnadóttirJoker 68%Alexandre DesplatLittle Women 95%John WilliamsStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker 51%CASTINGShayna MarkowitzJoker 68%Douglas Aibel, Francine MaislerMarriage Story 94%Victoria ThomasOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%Sarah CroweThe Personal History of David Copperfield 92%Nina GoldThe Two Popes 89%CINEMATOGRAPHYRoger Deakins1917 89%Rodrigo PrietoThe Irishman 95%Lawrence SherJoker 68%Phedon PapamichaelFord v Ferrari 92%Jarin BlaschkeThe Lighthouse 90%EDITINGThe Irishman 95%Jojo Rabbit 80%Joker 68%Ford v Ferrari 92%Once Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%PRODUCTION DESIGNDennis Gassner, Lee Sandales1917 89%Bob Shaw, Regina GravesThe Irishman 95%Ra Vincent, Nora SopkováJojo Rabbit 80%Mark Friedberg, Kris MoranJoker 68%Barbara Ling, Nancy HaighOnce Upon a Time In Hollywood 85%COSTUME DESIGNChristopher Peterson, Sandy PowellThe Irishman 95%Mayes C.

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we find an inspiring feel-good comedy from Workaholics star Jillian Bell and rapper-turned-actor Utkarsh Ambudkar, as well as a documentary that chronicles the inception of one of Broadway’s most iconic musicals,&nbsp;Fiddler on the Roof. And in the new trailers section, we&nbsp;get our first look at Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Marriage&nbsp;Story, Noah Baumbach’s upcoming Netflix film – which will have a small theatrical run –&nbsp;plus a red band preview for a SXSW standout comedy about a wild night of drinking gone terribly wrong.Opening This WeekendBrittany Runs a Marathon (2019)  88%&nbsp;A bogus doctor’s visit prompts an overweight twenty-something to change her life. Inspired by a true story,&nbsp;Brittany Runs A Marathon follows Brittany, a hard-partying, underemployed woman who finds direction and meaning by training to compete in the New York City Marathon. Led by the hilarious Jillian Bell&nbsp;and coming from writer-director&nbsp;Paul Downs Colaizzo, this Sundance Film Festival Audience Award-winner has been a hit with critics since its debut in Park City earlier this year. Featuring two of our favorite Sundance performances&nbsp;from the festival, the movie has been described by&nbsp;Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly as “a&nbsp;whip-smart comedy that manages to deliver genuinely funny uplift without ever swerving away from its own dark side.” The movie was picked up by Amazon at Sundance.Playing&nbsp;limited screens this weekend, expanding on August 30.&nbsp;Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles (2019)  98%Fiddler on the Roof was one of Broadway’s longest-running and most beloved musicals (it’s still touring the country, and you can still see it Off-Broadway right now – in Yiddish!). Steeped in Jewish identity and marked by incredible set pieces and songs, the show also features one of musical theater’s most coveted male lead roles in Tevye, the put-upon father just trying to keep his family together and strong. Documenting the long road to bring the play to Broadway, and later to the big screen,&nbsp;Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles is&nbsp;directed by&nbsp;Max Lewkowicz&nbsp;and features interviews from Broadway legends Lin-Manuel Miranda,&nbsp;Harvey Fierstein,&nbsp;and Topol, who played the titular character in the 1971 film adaptation. “An exhaustive, emotional testament to the musical’s staying power as popular entertainment and its extraordinary thematic reach,”&nbsp;writes&nbsp;David Rooney in The Hollywood Reporter.&nbsp;Playing New York &amp; Los Angeles this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to limited screens on Aug 30.&nbsp;Give Me Liberty (2019)  89%Give Me Liberty&nbsp;puts audiences in the car with Vic, a Russian-born medical driver whose personal and professional lives collide when he must transport his immigrant family to a funeral along with his scheduled route of disabled passengers. A hilarious and hectic examination of disability, identity,&nbsp;and the microcosm that is America, Give Me Liberty is a&nbsp;crowdpleaser that was well received at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.&nbsp;Peter Debruge of Variety&nbsp;calls it a “warm, fiercely independent comedy-drama [that] eschews anything resembling formula in favor of a boisterous and freewheeling joyride.”Playing New York and Milwaukee this weekend; expanding to Los Angeles and Madison on Aug 28.Fresh and Still in TheatersOne Child Nation (2019)  98%Spotlight Pick!Still in theaters and expanding this week,&nbsp;One Child Nation shines an important spotlight on the effects of China’s “one-child policy.” To curb the ballooning population rate and protect the country from potential&nbsp;starvation, the government enacted the social experiment&nbsp;in the 1980s with militaristic zeal, and the collateral damage of&nbsp;the zero-tolerance policy is still wreaking havoc on the lives of Chinese people today, years after it was ended. In this acclaimed film, co-directors&nbsp;Jialing Zhang and Nanfu Wang carefully document the policy, its implementation, and thoughts from those it affected, including their own families.&nbsp;Eric Kohn of IndieWire&nbsp;calls&nbsp;One Child Nation a “brilliant combination of cultural reporting and interpersonal reckoning,” and it’s also a heavy favorite for end of year honors.Playing New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco, and Washington DC this weekend.&nbsp;Along with… The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) , a drama about a&nbsp;man with Down syndrome who befriends a drifter and flees his assisted living facility to pursue his dreams of professional wrestling stardom. Luce (2019) , a drama&nbsp;about a school paper that causes a teacher, a community, and a pair of adoptive parents to question a model student’s true motives. Mike Wallace Is Here (2019) , an acclaimed bio-doc on the award-winning&nbsp;journalist Mike Wallace. The Farewell (2019) , a&nbsp;dramedy about a family that opts to concoct an elaborate lie to spare their beloved matriarch and grandmother from the pain of a terminal diagnosis.New Indie TrailersThe Death of Dick Long (2019)  74%A series of unfortunate events places a pair of hapless rednecks in the midst of a murder investigation. The flick is directed by Daniel Scheinert, who made&nbsp;the hilarious and offbeat&nbsp;Swiss Army Man, so you know what you’re getting into.Raise Hell: The Life &amp; Times of Molly Ivins (2019)  95%This new trailer offers a first look at the hilarious documentary about Molly Ivins, a legend in journalism and a true Texas original. The doc pays tribute to the nationally syndicated columnist and is full of her trademark wit.Marriage Story (2019)  94%This week, Netflix released dual&nbsp;trailers for&nbsp;Noah Baumbach’s latest, Marriage Story,&nbsp;starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver as two halves of a bi-coastal couple in the midst of divorce.Like this?

And yes, we're betting on an upset or two!by Jacqueline Coley | April 22, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by © Focus Features)The big night is&nbsp;finally&nbsp;here, and we do mean finally, as this has been the longest season in Oscars History! (You’re feeling as drained as we are by awards season, right?!). The 93rd Academy Awards will be handed out on Sunday evening, and at long last, some of our biggest questions of the season will finally be answered: Who will be named Best Director? Will&nbsp;Nomadland&nbsp;keep up its pace for the final lap and win Best Picture after leading the race all year?&nbsp;And will&nbsp;Diane Warren finally get an Oscar to add to her huge trophy case filled with Grammys? (OK, maybe that’s not a question on everyone’s mind – but we certainly wanna know.)The length of the season and extended eligibility period were not the only big changes for Oscar this year; the ceremony will be different, too, taking place outside at Union Station in Los Angeles and at satellite locations worldwide. All five Best Original Song nominees will be performed during the show, though all were pre-recorded, and organizers have again gone with no host for the third year running. “The show must go on,” as they say, in some shape and form, and despite the pandemic disrupting every aspect of life, and the global box office, the world’s biggest stars will still be on hand to receive those statuettes potentially – from where, however, is still an open question.Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot with Tomatometer and Audience Scores or cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.To help you with your&nbsp;Oscar ballots&nbsp;– and perhaps to clue in most of the world that the Oscars are still happening – the Rotten Tomatoes team has made&nbsp;some educated guesses on who will win come Sunday night.

But the same was said of La La Land, Get Out, and Roma&nbsp;their respective years and all of them lost in the end. If there is a film that could unseat the Nomadland Goliath, it is Aaron Sorkin’s&nbsp;The Trial of the Chicago 7. An additional wrinkle is the fact many voters haven’t seen as much as they normally would, and apathy may trump inevitability. Be prepared, though: we&nbsp;could even see a shocker like Judas and the Black Messiah or Promising Young Woman winning it all come Sunday, but our&nbsp;money is still on Nomadland.&nbsp;Best Actor In a Leading Role(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win?Chadwick Boseman – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Though Anthony Hopkins is a potential spoiler for his turn as an Alzheimer’s sufferer in The Father, this Oscar is Boseman’s, which is what we’ve been saying since the film debuted last Fall. And while some will say he will win because of his untimely death, he deserves the win for his performance alone – and it will be a fitting tribute to his legacy.Best Actress&nbsp;In A Leading Role(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win?Viola&nbsp;Davis – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why?&nbsp;In truth, we don’t know about this one. Andra Day won the Golden Globe for The United States Vs. Billie Holiday, Carey Mulligan took home the Critics Choice for Promising Young Woman, Frances McDormand won the BAFTA for Nomadland,&nbsp;and Viola Davis took home the SAG Award. Without indicative wins to really give us a clear favorite, we are putting the most weight behind the SAG honor.&nbsp;As McDormand is listed as a producer for Nomadland, it is&nbsp;assumed she is not going home empty-handed given that film will likely win Best Picture, so&nbsp;why not give this one to Davis, who’s&nbsp;already down one Oscar after losing for her worthy work in Doubt.&nbsp;Best Actor In a Supporting RoleWho&nbsp;will win?Daniel Kaluuya – Judas and the Black MessiahAnd why?&nbsp;Daniel Kaluuya has been pretty unstoppable since the crime thriller committed to the season earlier this year.&nbsp;With wins at the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, SAGs, and Critic’s Choice Awards, if the Get Out star&nbsp;didn’t win by some fluke, it would be one of the biggest upset in Oscars history. (*whispers*: And that’s just NOT gonna happen.)Best&nbsp;Actress In A Supporting Role(Photo by © A24 / Courtesy Everett Collection)Who&nbsp;will win?Youn Yuh-jung – MinariAnd why?&nbsp;Sorry, Madam Glenn Close, we want you to get that golden statue as much as anyone, but Hillbilly Elegy was – let’s say – not your best outing, at least&nbsp;according to the critics. We’re even more determined she stay seated when the winner is read, as her&nbsp;win&nbsp;would knock&nbsp;out Youn Yuh-jung, brilliant as a grandmother like none you’ve met in Lee Isaac Chung’s moving family drama,&nbsp;Minari, and who is just as deserving as any other veteran for the work she’s given us over five decades.Best Animated Feature FilmWho will win? 95% Soul (2020)And why?&nbsp;In the past 10 years, only one film was able to stop the Disney/Pixar dominance of this category:&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.&nbsp;Nothing nominated the year has&nbsp;come close to that film’s momentum. Sorry,&nbsp;Wolfwalkers&nbsp;folk: the movie is brilliant, but Disney/Pixar’s Soul is taking it.Best&nbsp;Cinematography(Photo by ©Searchlight Pictures)Who will win?Joshua James Richards – Nomadland&nbsp;And why? Director Chloé Zhao has not met a vast landscape that she didn’t want to frame in a breathtaking shot, and Joshua James Richards executed every one of the many such moments we get in Nomadland flawlessly. We are giving it to the breathtaking vistas of the American West over the black-and-white craftsmanship of Mank on this one.Best&nbsp;Costume Design&nbsp;(Photo by David Lee/Netflix)Who will win?Ann Roth – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Roth has won every costuming prize this season, and as Ma Rainey’s dresses serve as a part of the character as much as any aspect of Viola Davis’ performance, we have to say this competition is – yeah, we are gonna do it – sewn up.Best&nbsp;Hair &amp; Make-up(Photo by David Lee / © Netflix)Who will win?Mia Neal, Sergio Lopez-Rivera, Jamika Wilson – Ma Rainey’s Black BottomAnd why? Wig-maker and hairstylist Mia Neal&nbsp;created over 100 wigs for&nbsp;Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom&nbsp;in less than three weeks. She styled every performer (including Viola Davis) with&nbsp;hairlines, hair textures, and color that were all authentic to the period. All of the nominees have award-worthy efforts, particularly the make-up work for Italian fantasy Pinocchio. Still, the stellar make-up of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom tops even that, so we’re putting our money on the Netflix musical drama.Best Director(Photo by Joshua Richards, 20th Century )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Chloé Zhao – NomadlandAnd why?&nbsp;Putting aside the fact that she shot, directed, and adapted the screenplay for a film that swept every major Director contest this awards season and is an odds-on-lock to win the big prize… actually, that’s it. That’s enough to call it over: Zhao’s winning. The win would make her the first Asian woman to win Best Director, and only the second woman ever to win the award, after Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt Locker.Best Documentary (Feature)Who will win? 97% My Octopus Teacher (2020)And why?&nbsp;After My Octopus Teacher took home the American Cinema Editors’ award for Best Documentary Editing along with a BAFTAs win for Best Documentary, those puzzled by the octopus love story/nature documentary had to resign themselves to the fact this unlikely contender was going to go all the way. As this prize has traditionally gone to films that have chronicled weightier subjects – the 2008 financial crisis, climate change, the Columbine school shooting, doping in Russian sports – it is a slightly unconventional choice, but with such momentum, who could bet against it? (Despite the fact the field – Collective, Crip Camp, The Mole Agent, and Time – is incredibly strong.)Best International Feature Film(Photo by © Samuel Goldwyn Films /Courtesy Everett Collection)Who will win? 92% Another Round (Druk) (2020)And why?&nbsp;The last five times that a director was nominated for&nbsp;both Best&nbsp;International Feature and Best Director, the film in question took home the International Feature prize – with two films, Parasite and Roma, taking both. So with a Best Director nomination for Another Round‘s Thomas Vinterberg, we are betting that his work on the dramedy, and Mads Mikkelsen’s now-iconic drunken dance on a pier, will keep the tradition going.Best&nbsp;Music (Original Score)(Photo by Disney / Pixar)Who will win?Jon Batiste, Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross – SoulAnd why?&nbsp;Once&nbsp;Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor (who worked on both&nbsp;Soul&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mank) emerged as double nominees for two of the strongest scores of the season, the question was down to which Oscar-nominated work the voters would prefer to honor.&nbsp;As Soul adds Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show bandleader Jon Batiste’s effervescent smile and incredible orchestrations to the winner’s dais, alongside Ross and Reznor, we are giving the edge to the jazzy Pixar themes of Soul, which also serve as an intricate&nbsp;part of the film’s storytelling.Best&nbsp;Music (Original Song)(Photo by ©Amazon)Who will win?“Speak Now”, Leslie Odom Jr. and Sam Ashworth – One Night in MiamiAnd why?&nbsp;Always a hard category, but this year, in particular, none of the nominees have captured attention like Lady Gaga’s “Shallow” from A Star Is Born or possess the rousing inspiration&nbsp;of the&nbsp;John Legend- and Common-penned Selma anthem “Glory.” However, Leslie Odom Jr., who began the season the odds-on favorite for Best Supporting Actor, has performed his tune “Speak Now” at every major televised ceremony this year, which has kept him – and the tune – top of mind. Diane Warren, who is bizarrely still winless after the 11 nominations, is a possible spoiler for “Io Si (Seen)” from&nbsp;The Life Ahead, but like Glenn Close in a certain other category, she is perhaps gonna have to give it a try next time around.Best Visual Effects(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Who will win? 70% Tenet (2020)And why? Tenet should win easily if&nbsp;voters aren’t holding a grudge against the film’s bungled summer box office rollout. If Midnight Sky, George Clooney’s forgettable space epic – with stunning visuals – comes out on top, we will reckon many voters are still harboring hurt feelings about what happened when Tenet director Christopher Nolan tried but failed to get audiences back into theaters during the pandemic summer.Best Sound(Photo by © Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will win? 97% Sound of Metal (2020)And why?&nbsp;Not to be simplistic, but: it’s in the title! The sound for Sound of Metal is a co-lead along with star Riz Ahmed, acutely illustrating his character’s rapid hearing loss over the course of the film. And with six nominations, including for Best Picture, you would have to assume it unlikely the film could go home empty-handed (though many have before), and sound without question is&nbsp;the drama’s most competitive category.Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay)(Photo by © Amazon Studios)Who&nbsp;will win?Sacha Baron Cohen and co-writers – Borat Subsequent MoviefilmAnd why?&nbsp;We just kinda like the ‘mess’ of it, and there is no clear frontrunner for Adapted Screenplay, and the Borat sequel joined the likes of The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II&nbsp; with writing noms for both the original&nbsp;and&nbsp;the sequel, so clearly the Academy is a fan. And who wouldn’t want to see Sacha Baron Cohen on stage accepting an award? It’s gonna be funny, we’re very sure of that. In all likelihood, The Father or Nomadland is the safer choice, but you gotta gamble with a couple of choices every ballot, and this is ours.Best&nbsp;Writing (Original Screenplay)(Photo by © Focus Features)Who&nbsp;will win?Emerald Fennell – Promising Young WomanAnd why?&nbsp;Aaron Sorkin, who penned&nbsp;The Trial of the Chicago 7, already has an Oscar and is viewed as one of our generation’s best screenwriters. Still, we are going with&nbsp;Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young&nbsp;Woman,&nbsp;a writing branch&nbsp;and&nbsp;seasoned AMPAS voter favorite. After&nbsp;picking up several wins for comparable categories at other shows this awards season, the only thing that could hold her back would be if folks remember that Fennell also played Camilla Parker Bowles in the last season of The Crown and want to hold a grudge against the actress&nbsp;playing a very much hated character. (So pretty much nothing – nothing holding her back from winning.)Best Editing(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win? 89% The Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)And why? For our Best Editing pick, we are going against the grain a bit and picking The Trial of the Chicago 7 to take this over&nbsp;BAFTA winner Sound of Metal. We are still not 100% convinced that&nbsp;Sound of Metal is the frontrunner everyone assumes it to be. The editing of archival footage in The Trial of the Chicago 7, coupled with Sorkin’s elevated dialogue, is the one-two punch we are betting knocks the Riz Ahmed drama down the ballot – particularly with a voting body comprised of many members who vividly recall the true-life events recreated on screen.Best Production Design(Photo by © Netflix)Who&nbsp;will win? 82% Mank (2020)And why? Ten nominations and decades to make it happened, but sadly Production Design is all that the Old Hollywood tale about the prickly Citizen Kane scriptwriter&nbsp;Herman J. Mankiewicz is likely gonna take home. Still, even in black and white, the incomparable commitment to detail and period authenticity in the backdrops of the David Fincher biopic is undeniable and places Mank far above other competitors in the category: The Father, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, Tenet, and News of the World.ShortsDOCUMENTARY&nbsp;SHORT SUBJECT – Do Not SplitLIVE ACTION SHORT SUBJECT – Two Distant StrangersANIMATED SHORT SUBJECT –&nbsp;BurrowThe&nbsp;93rd Academy Awards&nbsp;ceremony&nbsp;will be broadcast at 5 pm PST/8 pm EST on April 25, 2021, on ABC.&nbsp;Download Rotten Tomatoes’&nbsp;printable Oscar Ballot; cast your vote in our&nbsp;digital Oscar ballot.On an Apple device?

The movie about children seeing ghosts and escaping supernaturally scary narcos captured the imagination of horror film festival audiences, leading to its eventual theatrical run and streaming release on Shudder and then to On Demand.But the path to get her passion project to audiences was not a short one. In fact, the little girl who grew up watching Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Spielberg movies with her dad worked her way up in Mexico City’s film industry, making a name for herself first as a romantic-comedy director. But with an undying love of monsters, ghouls, and other things that go bump in the night, López made Tigers Are Not Afraid against all odds.Read more: Filmmaker Selects: Alma Har’el’s 10 Movies (and a Series) for Women’s History MonthRead more: Filmmaker Selects: Gina Prince-Bythewood’s 10 Movies for Women’s History MonthFortunately, the risks have paid off. Now, the director is juggling multiple projects with collaborators she admires and has many more scares for audiences in mind. As part of our “Filmmaker Selects” series, López spoke to Top Critic Monica Castillo in-between busy writing sessions about her career trajectory, her upcoming projects, and some of the movies she recommends fans check out for Women’s History Month.Monica Castillo for Rotten Tomatoes: Tigers Are Not Afraid is not your first movie, but it’s the film you took the biggest chance on. How did that become the movie you decided to make a new name for yourself?Issa López: As it happens with filmmaking, you have plans and you think things are going to turn one way, and they never ever, ever work that way. So finally, because I had been successful for a long time with comedies, I had enough influence in the Mexican industry and enough respect as a director and as a writer to get into serious subject matter. And I was developing a very ambitious movie about the origins of the cartels during World War II, between Mexico and the US. And I was going to write and direct.Issa López’s Tigers Are Not Afraid.And that, of course, fell apart horribly. Back then, I felt that it was the end of the world. I had invested five years [into the project]. It was my one hope to get away from only comedies. And I didn’t know yet that you can’t have one project or even two or three, you have to have more because they will stumble. So when these fell apart, I had nothing, and I was going through a horrendous breakup and my father had died recently. And I had to put my dog down. It was a mess. And the one thing that kept me sane was writing every day, because I didn’t have time for more in trying to resuscitate this giant. I would have squeezed writing one scene of a movie for my sanity, and that was Tigers. And eventually it came together and I looked at it and I realized I really had to make it. And I knew that it was going to be a very strange little animal – part horror, part political drama, part thriller, part fantasy, and investors and distributors hate movies that are part, part, part, part, part. They hate them. But I knew I had to bring it into the world.What were some of your favorite moments on set?López: There were so many of them. I was having a conversation a couple of days ago with my first AD, who is now a director in her own right and makes me incredibly happy. Her name is Hiromi Kamata, and she’s the director of Selena: The Series. I have to say that many of the best moments in that movie didn’t come from my mind. They came from the mind of my team. I love to create an environment where you trust the people you’ve called to this battle with you, and they come to you and they say, I have an idea of how this can work. And sometimes it doesn’t, and sometimes, it’s so much better than what you had in mind. So there’s a lot of her mind in that movie, but we were talking about experience, and it’s kind of extraordinary how in telling such a dark painful, scary story, we had such a great time. The kids were loving. It’s incredible, because you see them suffering throughout the movie, and they were having a blast. They loved it so much that at the day’s end, they came to me to pitch an idea for the sequel, because they just didn’t want to stop making the movie. And I know they were enjoying it. One of my producers was saying that they had Stockholm Syndrome.How did you pool all those ideas about how the world of the movie would look like to create an immersive experience for your audience?López: For me, it was the clash between horror and hope. It’s pretty much a war zone. These cities that have been abandoned by its inhabitants, either because they left or because they vanished or because they died. Entire sections of cities have become ghost towns. And these kids have taken them over and made them their own. They had decorated them with their totems and their warriors and their war paint to defend this turf. Eventually, in the movie, they move away because they are on the run into parts of town that had been taken over slowly by nature. You have rooms in which grass is growing inside and it becomes this dreamscape. I wanted to have ruin next to beauty, and that encounter gave me images like a flooded room, that idea of a broken chandelier in a pool where there’s wild koi fish is what created this landscape slowly.What was it like to finally bring Tigers Are Not Afraid to audiences?López: It was a complicated journey. I thought when I started production that the complicated part was going to be getting it made, and it was not. Once it was made and finished, me and my accomplices, my team, we looked at the movie and we were like, this doesn’t feel bad, and it doesn’t feel similar to other things. It feels pretty unique. We felt very cocky that we could get the movie into the festivals. We were at the beginning like, should we submit to Toronto or Sundance? And eventually we got rejected from all of them, all of them – Toronto, Sundance, Berlin, Venice, Tribeca, South by Southwest, all of the festivals. It was kind of shocking because we didn’t feel that necessarily we had a masterpiece, but we felt that we had something unique enough and decent enough to get in that. No.It got really painful because after getting a number of rejections, you have to question yourself. Eventually, it became funny, and I was ready to give up and make more comedies, which I will always go back to. And then I thought about the genre festivals, because it is a ghost story. And I sent it to Fantastic Fest. The first time that I saw the movie with an audience in my life was at Fantastic Fest, and I was hopeful, but I was not expecting what happened. The raw emotions I saw in the audience and the way people would stop me at the end in tears to talk to me about it, it was a beautiful shock, and it especially felt great after the journey of rejection that we had, and it snowballed from there. That long journey of trying to make a huge movie that failed, resulting in this strange tiny movie, making it, getting all the rejections, and then getting this reaction so many years later, just makes you feel that maybe karma exists, that if you never lose hope and vision of your ideals, you get there. It’s a dangerous thing to believe, but I’m starting to accept it.(Photo by Issa López's Tigers Are Not Afraid.)What was your experience like before taking on Tigers Are Not Afraid?López: I think that filmmakers can make a career in two very different ways. One is seizing the opportunities that you find along the path and taking whatever opportunity to try to say your own thing. The other one is the anarchist warrior that decides to make the movie that they came into the world to make. I admire those strange unicorns. I’m not that. And especially, it’s hard because you’re a woman, and it’s a lot harder to push those walls. Now, it’s easier – well, it’s less difficult, which is different. But when I started, that space didn’t exist. Very few movies were made in Mexico. When I went into film school, eight movies were made in Mexico and those eight movies were made by the same four guys. It was unthinkable to break into that. I had to build my own way and my way of going there was through the cracks. Telenovelas shaped half of the planet. That’s the truth. The only way for me to go into visual storytelling was telenovelas. And the only way to go into telenovelas was by ghost writing for other writers. I had to first ghost write then become a proper telenovela writer, then become a film writer.And at that point, Mexican cinema had a revival, but it was through comedy – romantic-comedy specifically. So I had to write rom-coms, which has never been my genre. And then I was like, okay, I can direct too. Eventually, I got a lot of respect as a comedy director. I love comedy, but the truth is that little girl that watched horror movies and genre, and a little bit of Bergman and perhaps too much of Tarkovsky wanted to make a movie for me, for that little girl. And that’s how Tigers happened.López cites Poltergeist as an early influence. (Photo by © MGM/courtesy Everett Collection)Jumping back in time, who were some of the first directors that influenced you?López: It was a very strange mix because I was, on one hand, a regular kid who just loved movies. And on the other hand, I was raised by my dad because my mom died when I was very young. My dad was obsessed with European cinema, art house cinema, and the big film masters. At the time, Tarkovsky was at the height of his&nbsp; popularity, everybody was discovering the next Tarkovsky movie and we would go when I was six, eight, 10-years-old, and I would sit and watch Solaris. Because your taste is not completely gelled at that age, I could completely enjoy Solaris without questions about pacing, because everything is new for you. At the same time, I was obsessed with Spielberg’s movies and I was completely captured by the idea of Poltergeist or The Goonies.I never thought I could make cinema by watching Bergman, but when I watched E.T., I was so completely floored and transported by that experience. I grew up in Mexico City, and I had this feeling that someone needs to do this [movie], but in Mexico. It hasn’t been done. Briefly, I entertained the idea that I was going to abandon my dream of becoming an archeologist to become a filmmaker. Then I decided I was going to be serious, be an archeologist. That was not serious though, and I went back to cinema. I discovered down the line that it was more about Raiders of the Lost Ark than what it was about archeology.You’ve alluded to it already a little, but this industry is not always welcoming to women. Has that changed at all in your experience?López: I believe that this year has been crucial. I think we’re seeing it in the awards season, and you can take it seriously or not, but it is a signal of something. It’s a sign of something. It’s signaling something. If you look at the hopefuls, you’re going to see a lot of women filmmakers in a way that you didn’t see even a couple of years ago. And I think that part of it is the awareness that started in 2017, which is the year I opened Tigers. And the awareness of how an entire industry had been brutally, not only unfair, but punishing for the entire female part of it.Tarkovsky’s Solaris. (Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Genre film has a macho reputation – it’s dominated by male filmmakers targeting male audiences. What has that side of the industry been like for women recently?López: Well, that was a particularly complicated landscape. First of all, the perception of genre has changed. Thank the gods on this one. When I first moved to LA to try to pursue making movies here, I had the first meetings with the studios and with reps and whatnot, I would mention that I loved horror and I had some horror ideas. Inevitably, the room would cool down, and they would be like, “Oh.” And eventually someone spelled it out to me, which is: Horror is great, but it was like the B-movies at that point, and I’m talking 10 years ago, not that long ago; if you have a chance of making anything non-horror, do that, because once you’re a horror director, that’s it, you’re a horror directorBecause it was perceived like a gritty B-movie universe, women really didn’t have a place there. It’s funny because if you look at the numbers of audiences that appreciate horror, so many of them are women. It’s funny that the vocal ones were guys, but so many women love a good ghost story. I’m not a huge fan of slasher films, but I know so many women are obsessed with the slasher movies. It’s this misconception about gender roles, it’s just not feminine to like movies with ax-wielding maniacs. Well, turns out it is. It is pretty f–king feminine, and we have this incredibly violent genre of movies being made by women.Could you tell us about some of the projects on the horizon for you?López: It’s a lot of things, too many. I did learn my lesson of, in Spanish we say, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, honey.” I don’t do that anymore, so I have a lot of baskets and a lot of eggs. I have a movie produced by Noah Hawley, who I didn’t know before. Noah is the writer and producer, creator of Fargo, the series, and of Legion. We have a project called The Book of Souls about how humanity runs out of souls to put in newborns and we can only get the souls of people who die and the mechanics that awakens in the world. It’s a meditation on privilege, too. All of these languages, all of those themes, resonated with me. So, that’s one thing.I have a thing with Jason Blum that is an adaptation of an amazing article that Epic Magazine published. The article is written by Daniel Hernandez, a really great journalist, and it’s about a Catholic school – this is a real case outside of Mexico City in a very, very poor area, a massive boarding school that recruits girls from all over Mexico, from the poorest areas, to give them an opportunity to study high school and advance in life. It’s a Catholic boarding school. In 2007, there was an epidemic of hysteric attacks where the girls became paralyzed and they couldn’t move. They would have extreme pain and seizures, and they were convinced they were cursed. It was a huge scandal in Mexico, and eventually it vanished, but what really happened with these 600 girls that felt they were cursed? At the same time, it’s about faith and the strange images Catholicism and ideas Catholicism puts in our heads. It’s about access, how you come from areas where you have no privileges, you have to accept whatever life puts in front of you. It’s about being a woman that is always at risk, be it in the fringes of society or even when you’re put under protection, you’re actually still at risk.One of López’s upcoming project will see her collaborate with Guillermo del Toro. (Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)I have a werewolf western with Guillermo del Toro, and that’s completely different. That’s a completely male story. It’s about male revenge, pain, and old, old debts that characters have to pay and the journey they go through that. In the end, it’s about the beast that we all try to keep controlled, but we really can’t control. I also have a project of my own. I think it’s very important as a filmmaker to always have one movie that nobody asked for, which was what Tigers was for me. That is called A Girl with a Thousand Names, and it’s all children. I’m super excited about that one.Who are some of the up-and-coming women directors people should keep an eye out for?López: Well, what Chloé Zhao is doing is insane, and as I was saying a moment ago, awards season is here and she’s going to take everything that she hasn’t taken yet. Here she already took everything and it’s fascinating, these contemplative, melancholic, incredibly lyrical movies. It’s not only about female characters. What she did last year was amazing, too. I’m very curious where she’s going to go with that. There’s Ana Lily Amirpour: A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night is so aesthetic and so badass and so absolutely unique and its own animal that I’m very curious about what she’s going to do. I personally know Coralie Fargeat (Revenge), who also can direct action and gore and violence like nobody’s business. She can make ugliness beautiful. I don’t know what Coralie is doing, I’m just so curious. She’s amazing.Mati Diop! Atlantics is, I’m pretty sure, is my favorite 2019 movie, and I was kind of disappointed that it didn’t get the attention I felt it deserved. That movie’s at the same time a whodunit, a ghost story, a love story, the political reality of what’s happening in the Arabian states where you have extreme riches and extreme poverty, and it’s beautiful to look at. It has everything. I think I’ve watched it like five times.And finally, who are some of the women directors that inspire you?López: First of all, and foremost, I’m going to go with St. Kathryn Bigelow, because I feel that she’s been doing this for a while. Another thing that I admire about Bigelow enormously is her ability to move between genres. She doesn’t care much about genre, but she cares about character and story. She started with horror, with vampires no less, and it’s very hard to make a vampire story that is not silly. She’s done heist movies, some of the best in the world, classics really at this point. And she’s done sci-fi and she’s done the most serious political thrillers that we’ve seen. Hurt Locker, for me, is really one of the best movies that I’ve seen. It’s, for me, top 10, that movie. It’s at the same time a character study, it’s a study of political conflict, of imperialism, of the seduction of violence, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It’s just amazing.Issa López’s Tigers Are Not Afraid is available now on Vudu and FandangoNOW.Issa López’s 10 Films for Women’s History MonthAtlantics (2019) 96%In Dakar, a group of construction workers abandon their work on a sky-scraper in response to months of withheld wages.

William James (Jeremy Renner), Sgt. J.T. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are members of a bomb-disposal unit in Baghdad. As their tour of duty enters its final weeks, the men face a set of increasingly hazardous situations, any of which could end their lives in an explosive instant.Critics Consensus: A well-acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow’s The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, written by Mark BoalThe Matrix (1999) 88%Neo (Keanu Reeves) believes that Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an elusive figure considered to be the most dangerous man alive, can answer his question — What is the Matrix? Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life.Critics Consensus: Thanks to the Wachowskis’ imaginative vision, The Matrix is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects.Written and directed by Lilly and Lana WachowskiCidade de Deus (City of God) (2003) 91%In the poverty-stricken favelas of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s, two young men choose different paths. Rocket (Seu Jorge) is a budding photographer who documents the increasing drug-related violence of his neighborhood. José “Zé” Pequeno (Leandro Firmino da Hora) is an ambitious drug dealer who uses Rocket and his photos as a way to increase his fame as a turf war erupts with his rival, “Knockout Ned” (Matheus Nachtergaele). The film was shot on location in Rio’s poorest neighborhoods.Critics Consensus: City of God offers a shocking and disturbing — but always compelling — look at life in the slums of Rio de Janiero.Directed by Kátia Lund and Fernando MeirellesOrlando (1993) 83%In 1600, nobleman Orlando (Tilda Swinton) inherits his parents’ house, thanks to Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp), who commands the young man to never change.

One morning, Orlando is shocked to wake up as a woman and returns home, struggling as a female to retain her property as the centuries roll by.Critics Consensus: Orlando can’t match its visual delights with equally hefty narrative — but it’s so much fun to watch that it doesn’t need to.Written and directed by Sally PotterAmerican Psycho (2000) 69%In New York City in 1987, a handsome, young urban professional, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), lives a second life as a gruesome serial killer by night. The cast is filled by the detective (Willem Dafoe), the fiance (Reese Witherspoon), the mistress (Samantha Mathis), the coworker (Jared Leto), and the secretary (Chloë Sevigny). This is a biting, wry comedy examining the elements that make a man a monster.Critics Consensus: If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis’s novel, American Psycho still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale.Directed by Mary Harron, written by Mary Harron and Guinevere TurnerSeven Beauties (Pasqualino Settebellezze) (1976) 72%In 1930s Italy, Pasqualino (Giancarlo Giannini), a low-level Sicilian thug, kills a man who disgraced his sister.

They form a bond that is as unlikely as it is heartfelt and meaningful.Critics Consensus: Effectively balancing humor and subtle pathos, Sofia Coppola crafts a moving, melancholy story that serves as a showcase for both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.Written and directed by Sofia CoppolaBig (1988) 97%After a wish turns 12-year-old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) into a 30-year-old man (Tom Hanks), he heads to New York City and gets a low-level job at MacMillen Toy Company. A chance encounter with the owner (Robert Loggia) of the company leads to a promotion testing new toys. Soon a fellow employee, Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), takes a romantic interest in Josh. However, the pressure of living as an adult begins to overwhelm him, and he longs to return to his simple, former life as a boy.Critics Consensus: Refreshingly sweet and undeniably funny, Big is a showcase for Tom Hanks, who dives into his role and infuses it with charm and surprising poignancy.Directed by Penny Marshall, written by Gary Ross and Anne SpielbergOn an Apple device?

Brown, and Two Pop Culture Documentaries Lead the WayCheck out the latest Fresh indie releases, including what's still in theaters and what's coming soon.by Jacqueline Coley | November 13, 2019 |  CommentsJoin us weekly as&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes reports on what’s opening, expanding, and coming to the specialty box office. From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we have an exciting new feature from the director of It Comes At Night, a couple of insightful documentaries, and a gripping political procedural from the man who&nbsp;penned The Informant!.&nbsp;In our spotlight section, Shia LaBeouf is back after his screenwriting debut earned a glowing reception, and in our indie trailer section, we have a new clip from filmmaker Jennifer Reeder.Opening This WeekendEverybody's Everything (2019)  100%Genre-bending musician Lil Peep’s music is difficult to categorize. Uniquely blending punk, emo, and trap, he was poised to revolutionize the music industry when his life was tragically cut short. Executive produced by Terrence Malick, Everybody’s Everything digs deep into Lil Peep’s upbringing and how, at&nbsp;the height of his fame, he tried to be all things to all people. The film features behind-the-scenes videos, live performances, and interviews with those closest to the artist,&nbsp;who died&nbsp;tragically of a drug overdose at 21 years of age. “The juxtaposition between Peep at home as a kid, and a not-much-older Peep cast out in front of the world, is both fascinating and heartbreaking,” writes Dan Caffrey of the Consequence of Sound.&nbsp;Playing New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, Phoenix, Tucson, Columbus OH, Birmingham, Knoxville, Portland, Orlando, Denver, Oklahoma City, Indianapolis, Tampa, Atlanta, &amp; Dallas-Ft. Worth&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to limited screens on November 22.Waves (2019)  84%Waves, the deeply personal, semi-autobiographical third feature from indie darling director Trey Edwards Shults, hits theaters this weekend. Starring an indie fave, a network TV superstar, a Hamilton alum, and an exciting newcomer, this stylized “love story” follows a young wrestler who battles familial pressures and the burdens of minority exceptionalism.&nbsp;Critics are lauding&nbsp;outstanding performances from&nbsp;Sterling K. Brown,&nbsp;Kelvin Harrison Jr.,&nbsp;Renée Elise Goldsberry,&nbsp;and newcomer&nbsp;Taylor Russell,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;inventive narrative is set to make – yeah, we’re gonna say it –&nbsp;waves this awards season. “A stunning achievement,” writes&nbsp;Joey Magidson of Hollywood News adding,&nbsp; “Shults’ filmmaking, the score from [Trent] Reznor and [Atticus] Ross, as well as the performances by Brown, Harrison Jr., [Lucas] Hedges, and Russell are exemplary.”Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to more screens on November 22.Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer (2019)  83%Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer should be consumed en masse, given the current climate of the media landscape, but it’s a meal that may prove to be an acquired taste. Chronicling the creation and rise to prominence of the notorious tabloid magazine,&nbsp;National Enquirer, documentary filmmaker&nbsp;Mark Landsman takes an unflinching look at how the paper’s popularity once, and still, shapes modern politics and journalistic practices. Former staffers detail how what went on behind the scenes was even more outlandish than what made the front page of the magazine, a&nbsp;sometimes hero and frequent villain in the national conversation. “A fascinating and essential examination of the media we consume and what consumes us,” writes Karen Peterson of Awards Circuit.&nbsp;Playing New York and Los Angeles, Miami, Washington DC, Lafayette, Austin, Sante Fe, Albuquerque, Denver Columbus, Birmingham, Seattle, San Fransico,&nbsp; Minneapolis, &amp; Boston&nbsp;this&nbsp;weekend.&nbsp;The Report (2019)  82%Fresh off Martin Scorsese dubbing him the “greatest actor of his generation,”&nbsp;and just days away from his&nbsp;worldwide media tour for the&nbsp;final chapter of the Skywalker saga,&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&nbsp;(in which he plays villain Kylo Ren), Adam Driver also has two Oscar-caliber performances set to hit theaters soon. One of them,&nbsp;The Report,&nbsp;hits theaters this week, and it was a big hit with critics when it premiered at Sundance earlier this year. From director Scott Z. Burns,&nbsp;The Report&nbsp;is the fictionalized retelling of how the 9/11 “Torture Report” was commissioned and eventually released to the American public, similar to other journalistic procedurals like All The President’s Men and Spotlight. Neil Pond of Parade Magzine,&nbsp;calls it “A&nbsp;crackling political intrigue thriller, about big issues that matter, made out of real-life characters and events from the not-so-distant past.”Playing New York, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dallas, Fort Worth, Denver,&nbsp; Houston, Indianapolis, Louisville, Philadelphia, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC,&nbsp;Miami,&nbsp;and other select markets&nbsp; this weekend.Fresh and Still in TheatersHoney Boy (2019)  94%SPOTLIGHT PICK!Last weekend,&nbsp;Shia LaBeouf‘s tale about his traumatic upbringing at the hands of his alcoholic father crashed into the specialty box office with sold-out shows, a $75,000 per-screen average, and over $300,000 in receipts. That’s right, Shia is&nbsp;back on the Indie Fresh List as our spotlight pick! Earlier this year, the&nbsp;Transformers&nbsp;star charmed his way back into our hearts&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Peanut Butter Falcon,&nbsp;playing a lovable drifter who accompanies a man with Down syndrome on a riverboat to fulfill his wrestling dreams.&nbsp;Last week, audiences finally got a glimpse at&nbsp;Honey Boy,&nbsp;his semi-autobiographical&nbsp;drama about his time as a child star and his tumultuous relationship with his father. In a screenplay&nbsp;he wrote as part of court-mandated therapy, LaBeouf plays his own troubled father, while Noah Jupe and&nbsp;Lucas Hedges&nbsp;play the fictionalized versions of the actor as a boy and young adult, respectively. Director&nbsp;Alma Har’el&nbsp;makes her narrative film debut here, and her music video and documentary roots served her well for this based-on-true-events tale. “Raw, uncompromising, and yet wholly non-judgemental,&nbsp;Honey Boy&nbsp;is a cinematic memoir for the ages,” writes&nbsp;Carmen Paddock from&nbsp;One Room With A View.Playing New York and Los Angeles&nbsp;this weekend;&nbsp;expanding&nbsp;to San Francisco and Washington, D.C. on November 15.Along with… Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019) ,&nbsp; a satire about a low-income family who try to hustle their way to a better life through their association with an affluent family. Pain and Glory (Dolor y gloria) (2019) , a drama about an aging director who reflects on his films, collaborators, and legacy after he’s sidelined by severe back pain. The Lighthouse (2019) ,&nbsp;a surreal psychological horror film about two men tortured by the elements and each other while isolated in a remote lighthouse.

Looking for something a little different than a broad comedy or candy-colored kid flick? If you’re willing to trek a little bit to your nearest arthouse or indie movie theater, you may be in luck, because there have been a wealth of outstanding independent films at the cineplexes this year, and more still to come.This week in particular is a strong one, with a pair of extremely Certified Fresh films (Hereditary at 94% on the Tomatometer and&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor at a whopping 99%) and a handful more that have amassed near universal critical acclaim. But we’ve also got a lot of incredible stuff in theaters right now, as well as some surefire hits coming up in the near future. With all that in mind, we decided to put together a small list of some of the best indie fare for you to seek out right now or plan to watch in the next few months.Opening This WeekWon't You Be My Neighbor? (2018)  97%(Photo by Jim Judkis/Focus Features)Make sure to pack some tissues for this warm,&nbsp;affectionate look at the life and career of Fred Rogers, the man behind the long-running, influential children’s show. It only opens in 29 theaters this week, so check your local listings to see if it’s playing near you. It’s already Certified Fresh at 98%, so if you can get to it, you’re sure to find it a rewarding experience.This movie is at once unapologetically admiring and intellectually rigorous.– A.O. Scott, New York TimesBy the end … no, I wasn’t crying, there was something in my eye.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesFor the many generations that grew up with Rogers’ friendly face as their guide, Won’t You Be My Neighbor is like peering into the past with renewed clarity and wishing his civility had caught on.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireHereditary (2018)  89%(Photo by A24)This is one indie you won’t have to go far to see, because it’s opening in fairly wide release this week, and according to critics, it’s well worth the price of admission if you’re looking for some scares. The film premiered to rave reviews earlier this year at Sundance, with particular praise for Toni Collette’s riveting performance as a mother whose family is devastated by tragedy and terrorized by unseen forces, and it’s likely to be one of the biggest horror hits of the year… at least, until&nbsp;Halloween and&nbsp;Suspiria are unleashed.Where other actresses would play a single note, Collette plays a symphony of emotions. She will nearly bring you to tears and then make you laugh before you know it. Academy Awards don’t even feel like enough of a plaudit for this kind of performance.– Katie Walsh, Tribune News ServiceHereditary is that rare thing – a smart horror movie that doesn’t outsmart itself by refusing to deliver. Its mood is dark and forbidding and just keeps building. Its scares are genuinely shocking. And the ending…– Stephen Whitty, New York Daily NewsA deeply unsettling film, the kind of horror movie that pulls from relatable human emotions like grief and resentment to ultimately become an absolute nightmare.– Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.comHearts Beat Loud (2018)  92%(Photo by Gunpowder &amp; Sky)Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) and Kiersey Clemons (Transparent,&nbsp;Dope) star in this heartfelt comedy about the rift that develops between a father and his college-bound daughter when they start a band together and find unexpected success,&nbsp;only for the father to&nbsp;have second thoughts about letting his daughter go. This was another Sundance favorite — incidentally, it also co-stars Toni Collette — with critics calling it a sweet and earnest story strengthened by pair of excellent performances at its center.Frank and Sam make beautiful music together. No, that’s not a metaphor; it’s an accurate description that’s central to what makes Hearts Beat Loud&nbsp;such an engaging endeavor.– Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles TimesThere’s not a rough edge in sight – and, for many viewers, that will be just fine.– Jeannette Catsoulis, New York TimesMusic is the tie that binds a Brooklyn father and daughter in a film that refuses to go sappy on us thanks to the tough core of intelligence and wit that Nick Offerman brings to the party.– Peter Travers, Rolling StoneIn Theaters NowFirst Reformed (2018)  93%Ryan FujitaniThe past couple of years have been quite strong for Ethan Hawke, and he added to his already impressive filmography with this Certified Fresh drama written and directed by Paul Schrader. Here, he plays the pastor of a historic New York church who, in addition to having a bit of a troubled life of his own, also struggles with a crisis of faith, until he sees the chance for redemption in a pregnant parishioner (Amanda Seyfried) who comes to him for help. Critics have called this Schrader’s best film in decades and one of Hawke’s finest performances.First Reformed, a mesmerizingly austere drama of one man’s apocalyptic crisis of faith, feels like the movie Paul Schrader was put on this planet to make.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostFirst Reformed&nbsp;is an amazing examination of faith, a film that stays with you long after you have left the theater.– Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona RepublicIt is an exquisite piece of filmmaking and also a blunt, pulpy instrument, a despairing, fully sustained howl of a movie that is easily this director’s finest work in years.– Justin Chang, Los Angeles TimesRBG (2018)  93%(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)Like&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, this documentary focuses on&nbsp;an influential public figure — albeit a decidedly more divisive one — from a personal angle.&nbsp; The subject, of course, is Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an accomplished academic and legal scholar who became a vocal advocate for gender equality and civil rights before she was appointed as a Supreme Court Justice in 1993. It may not appeal to those opposed to her politics, but critics call it an insightful and inspiring profile of a fascinating, exceptional woman.I left the theatre informed, inspired, and eager to go to sleep at a normal hour.– Sheelah Kolhatkar, New YorkerFinding reciprocity — in the eyes of the law, your partner, your colleagues — is the essence of this documentary, one that comes at a moment that desperately lacks it.– Joshua Rothkopf, Time OutGiven the partisan divide, the documentary probably will be of interest only to people who already admire Justice Ginsburg, but it’s a good story that will inspire many and should appeal to anyone with an open mind.– Mick LaSalle, San Francisco ChronicleUpgrade (2018)  88%(Photo by Blumhouse)Some of the best genre fare comes from independent studios (e.g.&nbsp;Hereditary), and Blumhouse has made a nice little home for itself in horror. This Certified Fresh sci-fi revenge thriller comes from Blumhouse offshoot BH Tilt, and it stars Logan Marshall-Green as a mechanic who&nbsp;suffers a deadly mugging attack that leaves him paralyzed and his wife dead, undergoes experimental treatment that grants him — ahem —&nbsp;upgraded abilities, and sets out to hunt the baddies who got him. It’s pure B-movie fluff, but critics say it’s well-executed, compelling, and worth a watch.Upgrade, an irresistibly gory science-fiction melodrama, is B-movie schlock done right.– Simon Abrams, RogerEbert.comA great and grimy little screw-turner of sci-fi schlock, the kind that they truly don’t make anymore, the kind that would make Carpenter and Cameron proud.– Emily Yoshida, VultureUpgrade is hugely enjoyable and delivers just about everything it promised. In another summer of computer-generated blockbusters, it’s a handmade blast of entertainment.– Rafer Guzman, NewsdayAmerican Animals (2018)  88%(Photo by The Orchard)Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan star in this Certified Fresh heist caper about four privileged college students&nbsp;in Kentucky who decide to rob their university’s library of its priceless book and art collection. Based on real events that happened in the early 2000s, the film intercuts interviews with the real people involved in the botched amateur job to add a documentary element, and critics say it&nbsp;does an admirable job of digging into the boys’ motivations and crafting a narrative that’s fun, fascinating, and ultimately a little mind-boggling.A stylish and engaging caper.– Mara Reinstein, Us WeeklyAmerican Animals is one fact-based heist frolic with a youthful slant that works in spite of itself.– Rex Reed, New York ObserverA riveting college-boy crime caper that speeds along on pure movie-movie adrenaline, before U-turning into a sobering reflection on young male privilege and entitlement.– Guy Lodge, VarietyComing SoonEighth Grade (2018)  99%Ryan FujitaniComing to&nbsp;theaters on&nbsp;July 13You’ll find no shortage of quirky coming-of-age stories in the independent movie scene, and it usually takes something special to stand out from the very crowded field. Bo Burnham appears to have done just that with his latest, a charming comedy that follows graduating eighth grader Kayla (Elsie Fisher) as she navigates the awful final week of her already awful middle school career. The film has drawn comparisons to last year’s&nbsp;Lady Bird — albeit a slightly younger version — which is already a good sign, and it doesn’t hurt that out of 35 reviews so far, not a single one is negative.Eighth Grade&nbsp;isn’t a documentary, but it hews as close to the modern coming-of-age experience as currently seems possible.– Kate Erbland, IndieWireFisher delivers a glorious symphony of awkward poignancy, from Kayla’s cringe-worthy attempts to chat up a popular girl to her ultimately sweet connection with her kind, befuddled single dad.– Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesBurnham’s accomplished debut offers plenty for viewers of all ages, along with a filmmaking vision that is well beyond many of his comedy peers.– Nick Allen, RogerEbert.comLeave No Trace (2018)  100%Ryan FujitaniComing to&nbsp;theaters on June 29Ben Foster has always quietly snuck around the periphery of the A-list, popping up here and there in smaller, well-regarded films like&nbsp;Rampart,&nbsp;Lone Survivor, and&nbsp;Hell or High Water&nbsp;and acting the hell out of them —&nbsp;Leave no Trace is his latest winning effort. Here he stars opposite Thomasin Mackenzie in Debra Granik’s sobering drama about a military veteran living off the grid in the forests of Oregon with his 13-year-old daughter until they are discovered, forced into social services, and flee to make a break for the wilds. Count this another film that has earned unanimous praise from critics so far, adding another great entry in the filmographies of everyone involved.As a depiction of a certain corner of American life, Leave No Trace is vivid and true.– A.A. Dowd, AV ClubAn absorbing, delicately directed and acted father-daughter drama.– Jon Frosch, Hollywood ReporterIt might not have the genre elements that helped make Winter’s Bone something of a breakout, but Leave No Trace rivets and terrifies in its own way.– Bilge Ebiri, Village VoiceSorry to Bother You (2018)  93%(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Coming to&nbsp;theaters on July 61990s hip hop heads will remember the brash, politically charged music of Oakland-based The Coup, and now that group’s frontman, Boots Riley, has delivered an equally incisive satire on film. Starring&nbsp;Atlanta‘s LaKeith Stanfield, this surreal comedy centers on a black telemarketer who learns the quickest way up the&nbsp;corporate ladder is to adopt a “white voice” on the phone, but professional success may come at the price of his integrity. The supporting cast includes Tessa Thompson, Armie Hammer, Terry Crews, and Steven Yeun, and critics have raved about it since its Sundance debut. It’s a somewhat experimental film with lots of inventive touches, so it may catch some viewers off guard, but it’s likely to be a conversation starter for anyone daring enough to check it out.What the movie lacks in focus it makes up for in flipped-bird absurdity.– David Fear, Rolling StoneSorry to Bother You is a house party of a movie, some rooms more lively than others, some you wish you could spend more time in, some downright unforgettable in the best way.– Emily Yoshida, VultureSorry to Bother You is already a whip-smart satire of racial dynamics in the workplace when it’s about a black telemarketer who uses a white voice to improve his business. Then the naked human-horse mutants show up.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireDamsel (2018)  68%(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)Coming to theaters on June 22The brotherly duo of David and Nathan Zellner do it all, from writing to directing to acting, and their new film is something of an odd twist on the traditional western. Set during the American Old West, this off-kilter comedy stars Robert Pattinson&nbsp;and Mia Wasikowska as Samuel and Penelope, a couple about to be wed when Penelope is kidnapped and Samuel embarks on a journey across the frontier to save her. The Zellners have an eccentric rhythm to their comedy that critics say is fully employed here to upend common conventions of the genre, resulting in an unusual adventure with enough surprises to keep things interesting.It takes a bit to get accustomed to the Zellners’ style – but once you do, boy, does Damsel&nbsp;really blossom.– Sara Stewart, New York PostDavid and Nathan Zellner have crafted an anti-western, lovingly poking fun at its foundation while slyly pulling the rug under the audience in humorous, forward-thinking, and genre-redefining fashion.– Jordan Raup, The Film StageDamsel manages to import any number of modern notions into a surprisingly traditional western structure, recognising the appeal of the genre while not being afraid to steer it into some distinctly modern channels.– Nick Roddick, London Evening StandardThe Miseducation of Cameron Post (2018)  86%(Photo by FilmRise)Coming to theaters on August 3Chloë Grace Moretz stars in this drama&nbsp;adapted by&nbsp;writer-director Desiree Akhavan (Appropriate Behavior) from a young adult novel about an orphaned high school girl — named Cameron Post, of course — who is sent by her guardians to a&nbsp;gay therapy center when she’s discovered making out with the prom queen. Critics so far have praised the film for its decision to focus on Cameron herself, peppering moments of humor and joy to balance out the absurd reality of her situation. It’s not lighthearted viewing by any means, but it’s an earnest, confidently directed and acted film that proves YA novels don’t have to be about the end of the world to be compelling.It beautifully articulates the need for young people to realize the validity of who they are, and even more beautifully crystalizes the moment when that starts to happen.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireGenerously peppered with biting humor and warmed by a generous spirit that extends understanding, if not forgiveness, even to the religious zealot characters.– Leslie Felperin, Hollywood ReporterWhat it is… is an honest reflection of harrowing uncertainty, broken up by moments of unbridled joy — which Akhavan captures like lightning in a bottle — as lost souls push back against a seemingly universal unfairness.– Siddhant Adlakha, Slashfilm","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"war, toy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"fight-summer-blockbuster-fatigue-with-these-acclaimed-indie-movies"},{"id":"47612043808936","title":"Certified Fresh Indie Gems You Might Have Missed In Theaters, Now Streaming","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Certified Fresh Indie Gems You Might Have Missed In Theaters, Now StreamingDo not sleep on flicks like Disobedience, Lean On Pete, and The Insult, which could sneak into awards conversations.by Jacqueline Coley | July 31, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Scott Patrick Green /© A24 )Fall is when&nbsp;indie cinema and awards chatter kicks into high gear, with the Toronto International Film Festival signaling our first look at the&nbsp;year’s likeliest awards contenders and theaters suddenly showing a slew of movies that don’t feature explosions.&nbsp;The highly competitive awards calendar usually squeezes movies that come before the fall out of contention, but there are some&nbsp;films among this group that you should keep an eye on – and that are available on streaming right now. (It’s hot out anyway, and you were looking for an excuse to stay in, right?) Check out these Certified Fresh indie gems you shouldn’t let fly under your radar.&nbsp;The Insult (L'insulte) (2018)  86%What happens when a minor offense spirals out of control.&nbsp;That is the question that Ziad Doueiri’s The Insult&nbsp;asks and the brilliantly answers.&nbsp;A simple splash of dirty water morphs into a sensational courtroom drama that threatens to divide a country.&nbsp;The fact the two male leads&nbsp;sit&nbsp;on opposite sides of the political and religious divide in Lebanon further heightens the tension:&nbsp;Tony is a right-wing Christian and Salameh’s a Palestinian.&nbsp;Katie Walsh of Tribune News Service called The Insult, “A powerful and impeccably crafted tale arguing for the crucial importance of addressing history and facing down trauma.”The Death of Stalin (2018)  95%Armando Iannucci, the creator and writer of The Thick of It and&nbsp;Veep, is a master of political satire.&nbsp;Earlier this year, Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin&nbsp;made its way into theaters with a stellar cast including Steve Buscemi, Jason Issacs, and Andrea Riseborough, and a story that chronicled&nbsp;the death of Joesph Stalin and the&nbsp;power struggle that followed in its wake. Adam Graham from Detroit News called it a “deep farce,&nbsp;but it is rooted in enough political reality that it hardly feels sensationalized.”&nbsp;Unsane (2018)  80%Steven Soderbergh returned from his self-imposed retirement completely recommitted to independent filmmaking.&nbsp;After The Knick was canceled he quickly returned to theaters with his redneck Ocean’s Eleven, Logan Lucky, and&nbsp;followed it up with&nbsp;avant-garde thriller&nbsp;Unsane.&nbsp;Claire Foy stars as Sawyer, a young woman who is&nbsp;involuntarily committed to a mental institution and who spends the movie’s runtime&nbsp;questioning what’s real and what’s a product of her delusion. The movie was shot entirely on an iPhone and the hype around the technical achievement may have overshadowed the quality of the film (trust us: it’s really good).&nbsp;Julian Wood of FILMINK reminded us to not let the marketing distract from the power of Soderbergh’s work,&nbsp;writing that the “iPhone opus is a worthy addition to the longstanding but problematic mental health thriller subgenre.”&nbsp;Chappaquiddick (2018)  81%John Curran’s Chappaquiddick was an unfortunate victim of miscalculation and lousy timing.&nbsp;Originally slated to premiere last fall with an awards season push, Entertainment Studios swapped the date for Chappaquiddick for&nbsp;Hostiles, starring Christian Bale.&nbsp;Neither would go on to make much money, or much of an awards-season splash. Which is a shame because both are worthy of attention.&nbsp;In this fictional retelling of Edward Kennedy’s Chappaquiddick scandal, Jason Clarke perfectly embodies the younger iteration of the man who would become the Lion of the Senate.&nbsp;Stephanie Zacharek of TIME Magazine wrote, “Clarke makes us feel plenty of things we’d rather not.&nbsp;His eyes are shadowed with profound decency one minute and hollowed out in the desperate calculation the next.”&nbsp;Lean on Pete (2018)  90%Here we’re going to make an impassioned plea for everyone to see this&nbsp;story about a boy and his horse. At 17,&nbsp;Charlie Plummer read the script for Lean on Pete and sent a letter to the director, Andrew Haigh, expressing his passion for the project; after a few minutes watching him on screen as Charley you’d have trouble imagining anyone else in the role.&nbsp;Charley struggles through hardship but finds belonging and friendship while caring for an aging racehorse named Lean On Pete; the movie follows his journey to find a home for the both of them. Expect to be moved.&nbsp;Danny Leigh of&nbsp;The Financial Times likened Lean On Pete to “Dickens, under a starry and menacing American sky.”Disobedience (2018)  84%A trio of Certified Fresh films centered on the Hasidic branch of Judaism premiered in 2017: Menashe, One of Us, and Disobedience.&nbsp;In his follow up to the Academy Award-winning A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio directs Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams as two Jewish women who reconnect and fall back in love.&nbsp;An initial childhood affair between the two results in Ronit’s (Weisz) banishment and Esti’s (McAdams) marriage to Dovid, their childhood friend and rabbinical protege.&nbsp;Upon the death of Ronit’s father, she returns to London and her feelings for Esti are rekindled, placing Esti in the difficult position of choosing between her faith and her one true love.&nbsp;David Ehrlich of Indiewire praised both Weisz and McAdams, calling the film a “fraught and emotionally nuanced love story about the tension between the life we’re born into and the one we want for ourselves.”Gemini (2018)  72%Hollywood noir gets a post-millennial update in Gemini.&nbsp;A young starlet’s (Zoe Kravitz) personal assistant (Lola Kirke) is tasked with solving a crime while she staves off an equally clever police detective (John Cho).&nbsp;Aaron Katz has been delivering consistently entertaining arthouse cinema for years now, but has yet to&nbsp;get much&nbsp;attention for his work outside of the festival circuit.&nbsp;The&nbsp;LA backdrop he creates here is tinted and reimagined, and the suspenseful story plays out as if behind a stylish Instagram filter.&nbsp;Not every aspect of the film lands quite so well as the look,&nbsp;but Kirke delivers a standout performance.&nbsp;Jesse Hassenger from the AV Club said: “As visually appealing as much of Gemini is, it wouldn’t work nearly so well without Lola Kirke playing Jill.”&nbsp;Revenge (2018)  93%Revenge is the type of film that happens when you point the female gaze squarely at the revenge genre, and aim to make something as bloody as possible, and mad as hell.&nbsp;Jen (Matilda Lutz) is enjoying a romantic getaway with her boyfriend when a series of events (that we don’t want to spoil) leaves her for&nbsp;dead.&nbsp;Jen miraculously survives and embarks on a no-holds-barred assault to reap furiously unrelenting wrath upon her attackers.&nbsp;In her debut film, Coralie Fargeat marries Mad Max landscapes with Tarantino-style action for sensational and disturbing results.&nbsp;Kristy Puchko of Riot Material called Fargeat’s debut “a jaw-dropping thriller that’s both nail-bitingly brutal and fiercely feminist.”The Rider (2018)  97%Chloé Zhao is incomparable when comes to sculpting raw talent.&nbsp;For the follow up to her impressive debut, Songs My Brothers Taught Me,&nbsp;she again enlisted amateur or first-time actors.&nbsp;Under her direction, these novice performers portray their characters so authentically that you might mistake this fictionalized true story&nbsp;for&nbsp;a documentary.&nbsp;Writer and director Zhao met Brady Jandreau during Songs My Brothers Taught Me and wanted to cast him.&nbsp;After an accident left him with life-changing head injuries, she decided to base the script for her next film on his story;&nbsp;Jandreau adds depth and emotion to this poignant western.&nbsp;Chandler Levak of The Globe commended Jandreau: “[He] disappears into a role largely based on his own experiences, oozing empathy from his pores.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, chucky, motion, Spectrum, on, DC, The, Warner, doctor, drama, school","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"certified-fresh-indie-gems-you-might-have-missed-in-theaters-now-streaming"},{"id":"47612152976571","title":"Ewan McGregor in Talks for Disney+ Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars Series","content":"TV Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ewan McGregor in Talks for Disney+ Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars SeriesPlus: trailers for Bourne-universe series Treadstone and American Horror Story: 1984, an NBCUniversal streaming service update, and casting news.by Jean Bentley | August 16, 2019 |  CommentsThis week in TV news includes a major Star Wars story, new trailers, a Hemingway adaptation, and plenty of casting news.Ewan McGregor is in talks to reprise his role as a younger version of Obi-Wan Kenobi in a potential event series for Disney+.

An organization made up of film enthusiasts, industry professionals, academics, and filmmakers, the NBR’s is one of the first winners lists announced in 2018, quickly following Monday night’s Gotham Awards. Breaking from The Gothams’ and The Independent Spirit Awards’ smaller film focus, the National Board Review voting body favored studio awards features, with A Star is Born and Green Book sweeping the top categories&nbsp;– the latter was voted the Best Film of 2018. Last year, The Post swept the top awards categories but was shut out come Oscar night. Additionally, big winners The Shape of Water and Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri were omitted entirely from the NBR picks, so exercise caution in placing too&nbsp;much stock in today’s list for Oscar indictions.

It’s the last in a trilogy of films based on author Jenny Han’s young adult novels, which follow the starry-eyed Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor) as she accidentally — and then on purpose — falls in love with her perfect suitor (or, at least as perfect as a high school relationship can be).The films are extremely popular. The first two, which were released in 2018 and 2020, have respective Tomatometer scores of 96% and 75% and are both Certified Fresh. Fans became obsessed with Yakult, the so-called&nbsp;“Korean yogurt smoothie” that Lara Jean and her family drink in the films, and they especially became captivated with Noah Centineo, the actor who plays love interest Peter Kavinsky. In doing this, To All the Boys has followed in the tradition of other rom-coms – some of which it actually references, like Always and Forever’s re-creation of John Cusack’s boom box moment from 1989’s Say Anything … – in crossing the line from being a sweet flick to an endearing part of pop-culture canon.(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“I think that people crave conflict, but not too much conflict.”But why are some rom-coms so addictive?“I think that people crave conflict, but not too much conflict,”&nbsp;Han says. “When the outside world is so tumultuous, people don’t necessarily want to be stressed out when they’re watching a movie, and they have a couple of hours just to relax… Because, ultimately, regardless of whether the two people get together in the end — which they usually do, but not always — you know that it’s still going to be like an optimistic ending.”This is further confounding because these movies’ viewpoint is diametrically opposed to the way more people have reportedly begun to feel about monogamy. Marriage rates have been dropping for years for a number of reasons and a pre-coronavirus report from the Pew Research Center&nbsp;found that “fewer than one-in-five U.S. adults say being married is essential for a man or a woman to live a fulfilling life.”(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“Rom-coms, like mainstream teen films, female friendship films, bromance films and others, are ‘feel-good films.'”And yet, just because people are more woke to the complexities of modern-day relationships doesn’t mean that they haven’t traditionally been eager to watch something light and fun.“The rom-com has a long history in Hollywood back to the screwball comedies of the 1930s, the sex comedies of the 1950s, the anxious rom-coms of the 1970s and the nostalgic rom-coms of the 1980s and ‘90s,” says Shelley Cobb, an associate professor of film at England’s University of Southampton and a feminist film and media studies scholar.Cobb says that while “their popularity waxes and wanes over time” these films stick in the zeitgeist because of the promise of “the comfort of predictability, the satisfaction of a happy ending, and the comedy.”“Rom-coms, like mainstream teen films, female friendship films, bromance films and others, are ‘feel-good films,’” Cobb says, adding that “even if the relationships on screen don’t look exactly like your own, we know what it’s like to love and hate people in our lives and to be sad and be happy because of those people.”(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“People have this pressure that they have to find&nbsp;the one.”But does the genre also bring with it a risk of false hope? Are some movie-goers who relate to To All the Boys’ Lara Jean raised to obsess over meet-cutes and promposals? (And then perhaps feel depressed if things don’t work out that way in real life?)Julie Spira, a Los-Angeles based matchmaker and online dating coach who runs CyberDatingExpert.com, says she still has clients who “expect me to have this digital magic wand that, you know, within three days or three weeks, they’re gonna find the one.”“People have this pressure that they have to find the one,” Spira says, adding that, especially now that we’re in a pandemic, “I’m saying you just need to expand. You need to cast a wide net. You need to expand your social circle. You need to find a pen pal; you need to find a digital pen pal. And that person is going to be a friend. And, maybe, that friendship will turn into romance. Maybe it won’t. But your life can be enriched by having a great person in your life.”It’s also helpful that the genre of romantic comedies is expanding. These films are increasingly more queer inclusive (see 2018’s&nbsp;Love, Simon&nbsp;or&nbsp;2020’s Chemical Hearts&nbsp;and Happiest Season, for example) and To All The Boys is one of many recent examples that strove for racially diverse casts.(Photo by Katie Yu/Netflix)“Singles are saying that they’re looking for a meaningful relationship, a long-term relationship, more than ever.”This series also makes a point of telling the story of a teen girl – not a couple.Michael Fimognari, who directed the second and third To All the Boys movies and was the cinematographer on the first one, says that while the films’ plots have included a love triangle and will they/won’t they dynamics, the intent of the filmmakers was always to “show the full Lara Jean Covey story” and that “it was always about her dealing with being in a real relationship.”Fimognari came to these films after a career that included a lot of horror titles – another genre that’s seen a shift in recent years – and says that “maybe, you know, 30 years ago, rom-coms could get made on the big studio level and get put out and you had [names associated with them like] John Hughes and you have these big theatrical releases with stars.” Now, he says, streaming services like Netflix have “thrived on being able to allow people to see the movie they want to see.”But does this coalesce with what the viewing public expects for its own life?Dating expert Spira says a focus on commitment-free courtships had a moment, but since COVID-19 locked people indoors, “singles are saying that they’re looking for a meaningful relationship, a long-term relationship, more than ever.”“I’m very curious to see if that will continue as things open up,” she says. “I have a feeling it will, because peoples’ brains have been rewired into thinking that they want one meaningful person to spend your life with, or at least during a crisis.”Or maybe they’ve just been stuck at home re-watching old rom-coms.On an Apple device?

Plus, news on two new seasons of Atlanta, Jessica Chastain to play Tammy Wynette, and more of the week's biggest TV and streaming news.by Jean Bentley | September 11, 2020 |  CommentsJust because the flagship is coming to an end doesn’t mean there won’t be more of The Walking Dead: AMC has announced that there are not one but two new spin-offs in the works. Other major developments this week include an update on the production of Atlanta‘s much-delayed third season, a big new TV role for former Veronica Mars guest star Jessica Chastain,&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;update, and much more.&nbsp;Read on for the biggest stories in TV and streaming from the past week.TOP STORYThe Walking Dead Gets Two New Spin-offs(Photo by Jackson Lee Davis/AMC)The Walking Dead might be ending after an expanded 11th season, but the world of the AMC hit will live on in two new spin-offs —&nbsp;including an anthology series and one based on fan favorite duo Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride).The two original cast members will return for the latter series, which was created by TWD universe boss Scott Gimple and current TWD showrunner Angela Kang and is set to premiere in 2023.“It’s bittersweet to bring The Walking Dead to an end, but I could not be more excited to be working with Scott Gimple and AMC to develop a new series for Daryl and Carol. Working with Norman Reedus and Melissa McBride has been a highlight of my career, and I’m thrilled that we get to keep telling stories together,” Kang said in a statement announcing the news.The second spin-off, Tales of the Walking Dead, is an anthology that will allow the franchise to dig into the backstories of existing characters, introduce new ones, and tell new stories in the world in standalone episodes or arcs.McBride said in a statement that she’s thrilled she’ll get to explore the “Caryl” dynamic further in a spin-off with Reedus, her fellow original cast member.“Their shared history is long, and each’s own personal fight to survive, even longer — the more obvious aspect of what has kept them close and loyal,” she wrote. “But there is also a rather mysterious aspect to their fondness for one another that I enjoy, and their playfulness when the world permits.”Reedus’ statement was similar, singling out his character’s unique relationship with Carol.“Daryl’s relationship with Carol has always been my favorite relationship on the show — sorry, Rick. I love the way these characters interact and relate to each other on so many levels and can’t wait to see where their ride goes from here.”Atlanta Season 3 Is Delayed Again —&nbsp;But There’s Good News, Too(Photo by Guy D'Alema/FX)Fans of Donald Glover‘s groundbreaking comedy Atlanta are no stranger to delays —&nbsp;the second season premiered a full two years after the first —&nbsp;but the planned third season, which was supposed to film in 2020 and premiere in early 2021, has been pushed to an undetermined date thanks to COVID-19.There’s good news, though: Because of the delay, Glover and his writing team have written all of season 3 —&nbsp;and all of season 4, too.FX Networks chairman John Landgraf told reporters on Wednesday that the complications have come from scheduling all of the series’ in-demand stars, including Brian Tyree Henry, LaKeith Stanfield, and Zazie Beetz.“One of the things that’s been an unexpected boon from COVID-19 is that writers have had a lot of time to write,” Landgraf said. “However, the availability [of actors] has been pushed back because of the [pandemic].The third season will take place mainly in Europe, as Henry’s Al and Glover’s Earn flew overseas for a tour at the end of season 2, but season 4 is set back in Atlanta. The current production plan will see both seasons filmed concurrently — 10 episodes for season 3 and eight for season 4 — so they’ll both be in the can for future premiere dates.Game Shows Are Back on TBSOoooh baby, guess who’s the new host of @Wipeout on @tbsnetwork? pic.twitter.com/YKVvYrzzy8— nicole byer (@nicolebyer) September 10, 2020TBS is going really, really big with Go-Big Show, its new hourlong “extreme talent competition” featuring “monster trucks, alligator trainers, stunt archery and other radical feats, the program celebrates daring acts alongside personal, behind-the-scenes stories from the challengers as they battle head-to-head to impress the judges and advance toward the finale’s ultimate $100,000 prize.”Celebrity judges include Snoop Dogg, Rosario Dawson, Jennifer Nettles, and “The American Nightmare” Cody, and the series is hosted by comedian Bert Kreischer.

The duo will provide commentary as contestants complete the series’ trademark wacky obstacle courses (big balls included), with Camille Kostek acting as field reporter.The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but SeriousThe upcoming original cast reunion isn’t the only new Fresh Prince of Bel-Air content headed to TV: Will Smith announced this week that Peacock has ordered two seasons of a dramatic reboot called Bel-Air.According to Peacock, the new series is a “serialized one-hour dramatic analogue of the ’90s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air that leans into the original premise: Will’s complicated journey from the streets of West Philadelphia to the gated mansions of Bel-Air. With a reimagined vision, Bel-Air will dive deeper into the inherent conflicts, emotions and biases that were impossible to fully explore in a 30-minute sitcom format, while still delivering swagger and nods to the original show.”And it’s all based on a viral parody trailer from Morgan Cooper, who will also direct, co-write, and co-executive produce alongside showrunner Chris Collins.The CW, Freeform, and Kal Penn Want the Youths to VoteFreeform has teamed up with Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle&nbsp;star (and former Barack Obama White House staffer) Kal Penn for a new unscripted series, Kal Penn Approves This Message, that will help reach out to Millennial and Gen Z voters.

But after careful consideration, we here at RT have narrowed down our picks for who will win – as well as who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win&nbsp;– in&nbsp;all 24 categories. We looked to our Awards Leaderboard and the Tomatometer for guidance, along with historical voting patterns, the state of the conversation right now, and insights from the Rotten Tomatoes staff — which is why our staff predictions in a couple of the categories differ from the recommendations in the video above. Don’t agree with our picks?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments.Follow us on social all day Sunday, February 24th for reactions, and check back with Rotten Tomatoes&nbsp;after the ceremony to hear our take on memorable moments, and the biggest snubs and surprises.Best Picture(Photo by @ Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;Win?Roma (2018)  95%What should&nbsp;win?The reigning champion of our Awards Leaderboard is also our pick to win it all. Everyone at RT agreed that Alfonso Cuarón’s semi-autobiographical period piece deserved the honor. With high-profile Academy members like Steven Spielberg still criticizing the streaming giant for competing for an Academy Award, let alone&nbsp;winning&nbsp;one, a late-season shocker&nbsp;could&nbsp;happen, but our money is still on Cuarón’s masterpiece.Best Actor(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will win?Rami Malek – Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should win?After wins at the SAGs, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, Rami Malek has run away with the season, despite the fact that Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;has&nbsp;the lowest Tomatometer score of any film nominated in the top five categories. The Mr. Robot actor’s turn as Queen’s late frontman Freddie Mercury has eclipsed early front runner Christian Bale’s performance as former Vice-President Dick Cheney. We do agree Bale&nbsp;should&nbsp;be the one to win on Sunday, but history and momentum tells us that’s not likely.Best Actress(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Glenn Close – The Wife (2018)  86%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?To paraphrase a quote from her fourth Oscar-nominated performance in&nbsp;Fatal Attraction: “Glenn Close is not gonna be ignored.” After a surprise win and moving speech at the Golden Globes in January, there has been nothing stopping Glenn Close on the road to her seventh Oscar nomination and likely her first win. Adding a SAG win for Lead Actress has helped her pull away from early favorite Lady Gaga, with whom she tied at the Critics Choice Awards. In our staff discussion, there was much praise for Gaga’s take on the role played by Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand,&nbsp;but we ultimately voted that Close also&nbsp;deserved&nbsp;to win, for her entire career (which we&nbsp;chronicled in a extended chat with her earlier this year) as much as for what she did in&nbsp;The Wife.Best Supporting Actor(Photo by @ Universal Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Mahershala Ali – Green Book (2018)  77%Who&nbsp;should win?Firmly in the driver’s seat for the award season, Academy Awards winner Mahershala Ali is most likely going to win another golden statue. Green Book has had a bumpy road, but the nonsensical gaffes, Twitter apologies, and accusations of historical inaccuracy have&nbsp;had little effect on Ali’s Oscar chances. A clean sweep of the major awards (BAFTA, HFPA, Critics Choice, SAG) makes him our pick to win.&nbsp;In discussions, however, nearly our entire staff agreed that Richard E. Grant&nbsp;should&nbsp;be crowned instead. After 32 years as a working actor, Grant has melted our collective hearts with his childlike glee&nbsp;during the grueling campaign season. When we sat down with him last year to chat about the nomination, we noted how humbled he was to be in contention for his work in&nbsp;Can You Ever Forgive Me?,&nbsp;and that just makes him all the more deserving.Best Supporting Actress(Photo by @ Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Regina King – If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?It is good to be the King. While at the Oscar nominee luncheon earlier this month, Regina King was noticeably popular&nbsp;among her fellow nominees. (The loudest applause breaks were for her and Mahershala Ali, as they walked to stage for the iconic Oscar class photo.) As Sharon in Barry Jenkins’&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk, she embodied the best of what a mother should be while&nbsp;simultaneously breaking our hearts with her tear-wrenching performance. The BAFTA and SAG snubs had us concerned, and there was more than a little love for Rachel Weisz in&nbsp;The Favourite among RT staff,&nbsp;but in the end, Regina is winning – as she&nbsp;should.&nbsp;And we have been saying as much since our&nbsp;interview last year.Best Director(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Alfonso Cuarón – Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Why did it take so long for the Academy to nominate Spike Lee for Best Director? We may never know.&nbsp;In the end, it was BlacKkKlansman, not Do The Right Thing or Malcolm X, for which the Brooklyn director finally got his due.&nbsp;Thought-provoking and hilarious, the 1970s-set buddy cop tale of a Black police officer infiltrating the KKK has provided Lee with his best reviews since&nbsp;Inside Man.&nbsp;Everyone at RT agreed Lee&nbsp;should’ve&nbsp;won long ago, and we’re glad to see him finally recognized in this category, but this year Alfonso Cuarón is&nbsp;winning for Roma, as he&nbsp;should,&nbsp;no question.Best Original Screenplay(Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/Fox Seachlight Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Deborah Davis, Tony McNamara – The Favourite (2018)  93%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?In a surprise late-season surge, The Favourite emerged as our pick for&nbsp;Best Original Screenplay. Losing at the WGA Awards to Eighth Grade dampened the hopes of Oscar nominees Green Book, Roma, and Vice. As The Favourite was deemed ineligible by the WGA, a surprise win by Bo Burnham’s debut&nbsp;screenplay, effectively crowned Yorgos&nbsp;Lanthimos’ period dramedy as the one to beat. As far as who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win, RT staff agreed with the writers guild. We thought&nbsp;Eighth Grade&nbsp;should&nbsp;be vying for the Oscar – it&nbsp;should win – and we’re still heartbroken that it isn’t.Best Adapted Screenplay(Photo by Focus Features)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Charlie Wachtel, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott, Spike Lee –&nbsp;BlacKkKlansman (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should win?We predicted Spike Lee would fall short of the Best Director Oscar, but the Academy is likely to make up for it here. For all the reasons we said earlier, Spike should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. We also thought that it was a shame, however, because that meant Barry Jenkins would lose. We all agreed Spike will win but we were split 50-50 on who should between Jenkins or Lee.Animated Feature(Photo by Sony Pictures Animation)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)  97%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Another near-unanimous vote. We picked&nbsp;Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse&nbsp;as the best Animated film of 2018. It should win and we think it will.Documentary Feature(Photo by National Geographic Documentary Films)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Free Solo (2018)  97%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?A staff viewing of&nbsp;Free Solo, the tale of an elite climber who attempts a “free climb” (no ropes or nets) on Yosemite’s El Capitan,&nbsp;sealed it for most of us. On pace to be the highest grossing documentary of the year, it’s our pick to walk home with a golden statuette. RBG has its fans in the Academy, but&nbsp;Free Solo&nbsp;is the kind of doc that leaves you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. That said, we are still stunned the Mr. Rogers biodoc&nbsp;Won’t You Be My Neighbor?&nbsp;failed to gain a nod. We still think it was the best doc from last year, and it’s our pick for what&nbsp;should&nbsp;win – despite the fact the Academy snubbed it.Foreign Language(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Roma. We are more certain of this win than Best Picture. Even if the Netflix naysayers win out in the Best Picture race, they have little chance of shaking Cuarón’s hold on this one.Original Score(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Nicholas Britell – If Beale Street Could Talk (2019)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Justin Hurwitz’s snub for First Man left the door wide open for Nicholas Britell’s score, one we all agreed was haunting and brilliant. It should and will beat the others; including the Black Panther score, which also had its defenders among the RT staff.Original Song(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?“Shallow” by&nbsp; Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper – A Star Is Born (2018)  90%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?“HAAA AH AH AH AAAH” We’re off the deep end, watch Gaga will win. There’s no chance she’s losing now!In all seriousness, Laga Gaga has won every contest this year for her and Bradley Cooper’s mega-hit “Shallow.” Our only pick for&nbsp;A Star is Born is also the strongest pick we have on the ballot.Sound Editing(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer/Paramount )Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?A Quiet Place (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?With a premise that relied on silence — and the occasional interruption of that silence — A Quiet Place only worked as well as it did because of its top-notch sound editing, which was essential for heightening the terror of the horror hit. There was also a ton of love for First Man&nbsp;at RT, but the Academy has been fairly resounding in its rejection of the Neil Armstrong biopic. We&nbsp;agree it’s more technologically impressive and&nbsp;should&nbsp;win, but sadly won’t.Sound Mixing(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Our staff (all of&nbsp;whom can correctly describe the difference between Sound Mixing and Sound Editing) had to admit, what was done in Bohemian Rhapsody was exceptional. Taking home the top prizes at both the sound guilds early this month only further confirmed it as our pick&nbsp;for what will and&nbsp;should win.Makeup and Hairstyling(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Vice (2018)  65%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Like Gary Oldman last year in&nbsp;Darkest Hour, Christian Bale was unrecognizable as Dick Cheney in Vice – due in large part to the exceptional make-up. So, just as Darkest Hour won last year, we predict&nbsp;Vice will take it this year. We adored Border’s makeup&nbsp;as well and think it should win, but the modern-day ‘fairy-tale’ has&nbsp;little chance of beating Vice.Costume Design(Photo by Yorgos Lanthimos/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?The Favourite (2018)  93%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We will be the first to cheer if our pick for Best Costume Design is wrong, as we think Black Panther and Ruth E. Carter should win. But Sandy Powell is nominated twice for The Favourite and Mary Poppins Returns.&nbsp;Couple that brag-worthy achievement with the Academy’s history of picking period costumes over fantasy, and&nbsp;The Favourite&nbsp;is the safer bet.Cinematography(Photo by Netflix)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Roma (2018)  95%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Roma again. If a black-and-white movie feels rich and vibrant, it’s usually due to one thing: world-class cinematography. Roma will add to its accolades as the one that should and will win for Best Cinematography.Production Design(Photo by Marvel Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Black Panther (2018)  96%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?Our only pick for Black Panther&nbsp;comes in Production Design, as Hannah Beachler has swept the guilds and critics associations. The throne room in Wakanda alone puts her above all other contenders&nbsp;as the one to who should and will win.Film Editing(Photo by Alex Bailey/20th Century Fox)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Bohemian Rhapsody (2018)  60%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?We predict another win for Bohemian Rhapsody, which brings the unconventional Oscar contender’s total to three — the tight editing of its Live Aid sequence is unmatched. Though we agreed Spike Lee’s longtime editor, Barry Alexander Brown, who is enjoying his first nomination,&nbsp;should take home the prize, Bohemian Rhapsody is the hands-down favorite.Visual Effects(Photo by Marvel Studios)Who&nbsp;will&nbsp;win?Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  85%Who&nbsp;should&nbsp;win?One day, we will be able to honor&nbsp;motion-capture performances with an Oscar. Until then, we’ll have to settle for a visual effects Oscar for what Josh Brolin did as Thanos in&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War.&nbsp;Avengers is taking it, as we think it should. It’s worth noting that the very influential Steven Spielberg helmed Ready Player One, and his pedigree may sway voters (plenty of our staff picked it), but the majority voted for the first part of the Russo brothers’ Marvel epic.The Shorts(Photo by Netflix)For this section we relied on the truly obsessive members of our staff who has seen all (or most of the shorts). These are their picks and likely your&nbsp;best bet if you haven’t seen any of them.Documentary Short –&nbsp;Period.

Fan favorite Bohemian Rhapsody was a big winner, taking home four trophies, including a Best Actor win for star Rami Malek. But it was Peter Farrelly’s Green Book and Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma that came away with the highest honors — the former took Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, and and Best Original Screenplay, while the latter took Best Director, Best Cinematography, and Best Foreign Language Film. Another massively popular film, Black Panther, also scored three wins, including historic wins for costume designer Ruth E.

But for now the focus is a series set in the fictional African country, which is also the focus for the Black Panther sequel movie Coogler is currently at work on.The Wakanda series would be the latest in a long line of Marvel series coming to Disney+.

(Variety)George Clooney May Star in Buck Rogers Reboot Series(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)George Clooney and his Smokehouse production company partner, Grant Heslov, have joined with Brian K. Vaughn for a reboot of the 1979-81 Gil Gerard and Erin Gray sci-fi drama series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. All three will serve as executive producers on the project, and Clooney may star in the title role, if Legendary TV has its way, according to The Wrap. Meanwhile, if the series is a hit, Legendary could move forward with a Buck Rogers movie and an anime series spin-off,&nbsp;THR.com reports.There is a potential glitch in the plan to launch a new Buck Rogers universe. The trust that oversees the Buck Rogers estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Legendary, Deadline reports, informing Legendary that the trust already has an agreement with Skydance Productions — home of Top Gun: Maverick, the most recent Star Trek films, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and Terminator: Dark Fate — to “exploit the property” of Buck Rogers.Related: Nominations for 2021’s Golden Globes, SAG AwardsPBS Preview: Hemingway, My Grandparents’ War, and The Black Church — Plus, More Miss Scarlet?&nbsp;(Photo by PBS)PBS presented previews of its upcoming 2021 programming for TV critics this week in a virtual Television Critics Association winter press tour, and there’s plenty coming. For starters, Masterpiece executive producer Susanne Simpson teased that although she doesn’t have any official announcements about a potential second season of the currently airing Miss Scarlet and the Duke, that fans should “wait for it —&nbsp;we’ll have something soon, I think.” She also highlighted the eclectic nature of Masterpiece’s 50th anniversary.“One of the things we tried to do with our 50th anniversary was we tried very hard in January to really show off the different types of programs that we do. We felt it was a bit of a gift to our audience to do that on our 50th. So, we had [Elizabeth Is Missing&nbsp;with] Glenda Jackson, who obviously is one of the top actors of our time, so we wanted to tell everybody we’re still showing off acting royalty in Masterpiece. We have All Creatures Great and Small&nbsp;— that’s a very heartwarming show for a family audience. I think Miss Scarlet and the Duke is terrific, because it’s a woman character that’s very feisty for her time and kind of fighting off roadblocks. And then we have The Long Song, which is a really important show, very powerful, very moving.”Other highlights from the public broadcaster’s upcoming slate: Hemingway, the latest from Ken Burns and Lynn Novick featuring narration from Jeff Daniels as the famous writer and attempts to deconstruct Hemingway’s hyper-masculine image: “I think the persona of the wild man, the drunk, the bar guy, the big game hunter, the big sea fisherman is what we inherit, the baggage we carry. But almost immediately we began to see how thin and frail that was, not just for him but in fact,” Burns said.The upcoming My Grandparents’ War features stars Helena Bonham Carter, Mark Rylance, Carey Mulligan, and Kristin Scott Thomas as they trace the journeys of their grandparents during World War II, and Bonham Carter, whose family history is traced in the season premiere, said the experience helped her learn about her grandparents in a more intimate way.“I had a vague approximation, myths almost, of both my grandparents that we followed. This just filled in a lot of the detail and bought them very vividly to me,” she said. “Violet, my grandmother, I would have been her age when the Second World War happened. So I met them almost as peers. It was really extraordinary.”The two-part documentary The Black Church: This Is Our Story, This Is Our Song from Henry Louis Gates Jr. traces the history of the Black church in America through historical figures and contemporary celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, John Legend and Jennifer Hudson. Said Gates: “We wanted to make a series about the sheer transcendent power of belief, and never has that message been more important than now.”NEW TRAILERS: Maggie Returns to The Walking DeadIn the bonus episodes of The Walking Dead’s 10th and penultimate season, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) returns, which almost certainly means she’s going to have an issue with Negan’s (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) new role among her group of friends.

Night Shyamalan and&nbsp;Servant&nbsp;Cast Provide New Details on Scary New Apple TV+ Series(Photo by Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for ReedPOP)Apple TV+ has released teasers for its upcoming M. Night Shyamalan thriller series, Servant. The first two were&nbsp;unnerving in different ways:&nbsp;The first, “The Rocker,” features a baby rocking in front of a TV (happy enough, but set to some traditional horror movie sounds). The second, “Cricket,” features the sound of a ticking clock as a woman sees a cricket while brushing her teeth — “something bad [is] coming,” a voiceover warns. Apparently, it’s coming on November 28, when the series premieres on the streaming service.A third teaser, “Solitude” (above), debuted at the series’ New York Comic-Con panel on Thursday night. It features a brightly lit, sterile-feeling shot of a suspiciously still newborn baby being changed. The spot features&nbsp;an unnerving aesthetic from Shyamalan, who announced the late November premiere date during the panel — just in time to terrify your family after eating way too much turkey at Thanksgiving dinner — and revealed the first real details about the series.Servant&nbsp;follows a Philadelphia couple in mourning after an “unspeakable tragedy creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home,” according to the official description.&nbsp;Lauren Ambrose and Toby Kebbell play the well-off suburban Philadelphia couple at the center of the story, and creepy things start happening when they hire a new babysitter (Nell Tiger Free) to take care of their infant, according to a CBR.com report. Rupert Grint plays the “brash, outspoken, and blunt” brother of Ambrose’s character. The entire series will feature just those four characters and will take place in the couple’s home.Shyamalan executive produces and directs two episodes of the series alongside creator and writer Tony Basgallop.

We’ve got to let her go.”Another place we’re expecting her to revisit the role: On Saturday, when she hosts SNL for the first time. Come on, don’t you think a filmed Fleabag skit is happening?

I really enjoyed). I have almost no doubt based on his coy evasiveness that he will be in the Obi Wan Disney+ series. I’ve seen many an actor playfully evade. I’m placing a big bet that Owen will be back.— Josh Horowitz (@joshuahorowitz) October 1, 2019The upcoming Obi Wan Kenobi Disney+ series could see another face familiar to the Star Wars universe: Joel Edgerton. When asked whether he could reprise his role as Owen Lars, the adoptive father of baby Luke Skywalker first introduced in Attack of the Clones and who was entrusted with baby Luke after Padme’s death in Revenge of the Sith, Egerton was “coy.”“Evasiveness definitely feels like a confirmation by default, or at least a hint that Edgerton has at least been in talks with Lucasfilm and Disney,”&nbsp;/Film speculated.

Other films with impressive showings include&nbsp;The Death of Stalin,&nbsp;God’s Own Country,&nbsp;I Am Not a Witch, and&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.&nbsp;The BIFA awards will be handed out on Sunday, December 10.&nbsp;Best British Independent FilmThe Death of Stalin 95%God's Own Country 98%I Am Not a Witch 96%Lady Macbeth 88%Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best DirectorArmando IannucciThe Death of Stalin 95%Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Martin McDonaghThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best ScreenplayArmando Iannucci &amp; David Schneider &amp; Ian MartinThe Death of Stalin 95%Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Martin McDonaghThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri 90%Best ActorJamie BellFilm Stars Don’t Die in LiverpoolJosh O'ConnorGod’s Own CountryAlec SecareanuGod’s Own CountryJohnny HarrisJawbonePaddy ConsidineJourneynanBest ActressEmily BeechamDaphneRuth WilsonDark RiverMaggie MulubwaI Am Not A WitchFlorence PughLady MacbethFrances McDormandThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriBest Supporting ActorSteve BuscemiThe Death of StalinSimon Russell BealeThe Death of StalinIan HartGod’s Own CountrWoody HarrelsonThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriSam RockwellThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriBest Supporting ActressAndrea RiseboroughThe Death of StalinJulie WaltersFilm Stars Don’t Die in LiverpoolKelly MacdonaldGoodbye Christopher RobinNaomi AckieLady MacbethPatricia ClarksonThe PartyMost Promising NewcomerHarry MichellChubby FunHarry GilbyJust CharlieCosmo JarvisLady MacbethNaomi AckieLady MacbethLily NewmarkPin CushionThe Douglas Hickox Award (Debut Director)Francis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Thomas NapperJawbone 96%William OldroydLady Macbeth 88%Deborah HaywoodPin Cushion 90%Breakthrough ProducerBrendan Mullin &amp; Katy JacksonBad Day for the Cut 92%Jack Tarling &amp; Manon ArdissonGod's Own Country 98%Emily MorganI Am Not a Witch 96%Fodhla Cronin O’ReillyLady Macbeth 88%Gavin HumphriesPin Cushion 90%Best Debut ScreenwriterFancis LeeGod's Own Country 98%Rungano NyoniI Am Not a Witch 96%Johnny HarrisJawbone 96%Alice BirchLady Macbeth 88%Gaby ChiappeTheir Finest 90%The Discovery AwardEven When I Fall 100%HalfwayIn Another LifeIsolaniMy Pure Land 94%Best DocumentaryAlmost HeavenHalf WayKingdom of Us 100%Uncle Howard 91%Williams 93%Best International Independent FilmThe Florida Project 96%Get Out 98%I Am Not Your Negro 99%The Square 85%The winners of the British Independent Film Awards 2017 will be announced on Sunday, Dec. 4 at Old Billingsgate in London.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sundance, indiana, Holiday, CW, Nickelodeon, period, TV, Extras, Hear, serial, movie, television, renewed, Masterpiece","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"british-independent-nominations-announced-lady-macbeth-dominates-with-15-noms"},{"id":"47612381916389","title":"Best Movies Off the Radar 2017","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best Movies Off the Radar 2017A selection of 12 staff favorites that might not have played at your local multiplex.by RT Staff | December 28, 2017 |  CommentsThere are a lot — and we mean a lot — of movies that are released during any given year, and with all the marketing money going to big budget blockbusters and awards hopefuls, a lot of smaller films come and go without eliciting so much as a curious glance from moviegoers. With that in mind, we here at RT have picked just a handful of our favorite movies that were, for one reason or another,&nbsp;mostly overlooked by audiences at large this year. From carnivorous Polish mermaids and stray cats in Turkey to bombastic action in India and supernatural horror in Norway, here are some of the best movies of 2017 that you&nbsp;might not have seen.American Fable (2017)  75%Yes, there is a faun in American Fable (not a spoiler, you can see it in the trailer and the movie’s poster), and the story is told from the point of view of a young girl, but don’t be too quick to write it off as a Guilllermo del Toro knockoff. Gitty is the eleven year old protagonist of this film, and her life is pretty inauspicious and carefree, despite the palpable tension within her family. Then she comes upon a man in business attire, imprisoned in an abandoned silo on the family’s ailing farm. City meeting country is a common motif in horror films, but American Fable isn’t quite a horror, and writer-director Anne Hamilton manages to create a moody, enigmatic, and mysterious world that blends fairy tale with 1980s rural America. American Fable is the rare young girl’s coming-of-age film that doesn’t involve romance, where the growing up comes from gaining a greater understanding of the world around her and the many-faceted people who inhabit it. While the story may not pay off for all viewers, it’s still a striking, hypnotic representation of a point of view and a part of America that is often overlooked.&nbsp;I would be hesitant to call American Fable one of the best films of the year, but it is one of those films that you come away from in anticipation of what the director will accomplish in future endeavors. —&nbsp;Sara AtaiiyanAvailable on:&nbsp;Amazon, NetflixBaahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017)  86%Baahubali 2:&nbsp;The Conclusion plays like a shotgun wedding between Ben Hur&nbsp;and Kung Fu Hustle, seasoned with bits of Shakespeare, Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton. In other words, it’s a blockbuster that’s both gigantic and lighter than air. The story of The Beginning&nbsp;was as simple as a fairy tale and as resonant as a myth, but with The Conclusion, director S.S. Rajamouli has cranked everything to 11; rarely have action sequences this gravity- (and logic-) defying been captured on film. What separates this epic (which was a massive hit in India and within the South Asian diaspora) from its American brethren is its sincerity and optimism: its righteous titular hero (played by Prabhas) and his band of honorable men and women clash with scheming, corrupt bad guys, and it feels alternately old-fashioned and refreshingly bold. It’s the kind of film that reminds us why we love going to the movies. —&nbsp;Tim RyanAvailable on: Amazon, NetflixBirdboy: The Forgotten Children (Psiconautas, los niños olvidados) (2017)  94%2017 was a great year for animation. Pixar had Coco. Cartoon Saloon gave us the gorgeously moving The Breadwinner. At some point, there was a Boss Baby. And hidden behind them&nbsp;all was GKIDS’&nbsp;Birdboy: The Forgotten Children. Based on the Spanish graphic novel, Psiconautas, los niños olvidados, Birdboy follows four young ones as they navigate a post-ecological fall out world, and though it’s ultimately&nbsp;a coming-of-age story, that’s one of the only things it has in common with many of its animated contemporaries. It’s a haunting exploration of what happens to those left behind in society, warts and all, and the ways in which our inner selves and outer perceptions do not always align within the twisted, gorgeous landscape that surrounds us. Despite themes not often handled in animated features (including mental health issues, drug use, and sexual undertones), Birdboy finds a spark of hope amid the desolation. It’s got dashes of dark humor and a heartbreakingly beautiful finale which reminds us that, even in the darkest of times, there’s always a light that’s worth keeping alive. — Haña Lucero-ColinIn select theatersColossal (2017)  81%I can’t say it was the most obscure movie I saw this year, but Colossal was one of the most surprising. I’m constantly on the lookout for kooky stuff, so I was initially attracted by its odd premise, which essentially boils down to “a woman discovers she is psychically linked to a Kaiju.” It didn’t hurt that the woman in question was Anne Hathaway, that the supporting cast included Dan Stevens, Tim Blake Nelson, and Jason Sudeikis, and that the director was Nacho Vigalondo, who has something of a penchant for, yes, kooky stuff. But while Colossal does trade in goofy antics from time to time, there’s a real pathos at the center of the story, which sets Hathaway’s character on a path of self-examination in ways that are unexpectedly poignant and seemingly incongruous with its nutty high-concept premise. The film does stumble a bit in its attempt to deliver an “A-ha!” moment towards the end, but Hathaway is so good in her portrayal of a woman dealing with alcoholism, abuse, and the sins of her past that it was easy for me to overlook any minor quibbles. Colossal is a weird movie, and it’s not going to appeal to everyone, but it’s also a pretty effective exploration of stunted emotional maturity anchored by a phenomenal performance. And it’s got giant monsters. —&nbsp;Ryan FujitaniAvailable on:&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Amazon, HuluColumbus (2017)  97%Stillness pervades Kogonada’s&nbsp;Columbus, in the steady, observant shots surveying the modernist architecture and public art that has given the city its prominent reputation among art lovers. This same impression of serenity spills over into the suspended lives of the two main characters: Jin, returning abruptly from a job abroad to watch over his comatose father, and Casey, a recent high school graduate who remains in Columbus in a self-imposed state of obligation, caring for her formerly drug-addicted mother. Their chance meeting is as natural as the relationship that follows, as the pair wanders from one architectural marvel to the next, confiding in one another but also challenging their respective inertia.&nbsp;Columbus&nbsp;poignantly depicts the difficulty of gazing inward and facing one’s fears, feelings that are particularly evident in Haley Lu Richardson’s luminous performance as Casey. Richardson’s facial nuances are a throwback from the silent era, subtly shifting from enthusiasm for the beloved buildings in her hometown to a fearful realization that she may never leave them behind. It’s this depth of emotion that makes&nbsp;Columbus&nbsp;feel like a conversation you can’t stop eavesdropping on.&nbsp;—&nbsp;Jenny JedinyAvailable on: Hulu,&nbsp;Amazon VideoThe Farthest (2017)  100%Out of all the cool stuff the movies have thrown at us this year, it hardly seems likely that one of 2017’s best limited-release films would be a documentary about the NASA nerds who launched the Voyager mission in 1977. Yet while The&nbsp;Farthest&nbsp;is definitely about space and math and stuff, it’s also about so much more: as director Emer Reynolds subtly yet persuasively makes clear, this is a group of people who overcame incredible odds — and technological constraints that may seem absurd to younger viewers — to assemble one of the most awe-inspiring quests for knowledge undertaken in all of human history. In these divided times, it’s nothing short of stirring to see a positive example of what we can do when our priorities align; when some of those NASA nerds start tearing up while looking back on the brilliantly curious spirit that fueled their life’s work, don’t be surprised if you find yourself reaching for a tissue too. —&nbsp;Jeff GilesAvailable on: Amazon, NetflixKedi (2017)  98%Ceyda Torun’s directorial debut follows the life of seven stray cats in Istanbul, a city that for centuries has lived harmoniously with the hundreds of thousands of owner-free cats who go about their business in the streets like any human. Kedi is definitely a film for cat lovers, but it’s also a treat for those who love to travel and learn about different cultures, those who are interested in History, and even those in search of&nbsp;something heartwarming to watch.Visually, Kedi is gorgeous. Torun and cinematographer Charlie Wuppermann create a beautiful portrait of the feline life, often shot from their perspective — at whisker’s height, offering a fresh picture of the city and its many peculiarities. The best part of Kedi, though, is how it depicts the very unique relationship between humans and cats in the city, something that feels almost magical to foreign eyes. There’s much to learn about cross-species respect and camaraderie from this movie, and it will most likely make you rethink the way you see the non-human citizens in the world around you. — Júlio de OliveiraAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Lure (Córki dancingu) (2017)  89%Countless foreign films wash up on our collective shores each year, and as cinephiles, we pick through the flotsam and jetsam, occasionally stumbling upon some real treasures. Agnieszka Smoczynska’s The Lure is such a find from Poland. This mature fairy tale follows a pair of mermaids, Golden and Silver, who swim ashore after hearing a rock band play on the beach. They are soon employed at a nightclub, a catalyst for their grounded coming-of-age story. With musical numbers that range from large and lavish to intimate and dreamlike, The Lure introduced me to a killer pop-goth-rock soundtrack that I’ve been humming all year long. The film is colorful yet murky, with a camera that seems to float along with the action; it’s as if the mermaids brought their underwater sensibilities to the production itself. In a year of remarkable directorial debuts (Lady Bird, Get Out, Ingrid Goes West) this one still strikes me as the most confident and daring. Smoczynska has already arrived as a filmmaker, and I eagerly await to see what she bottles up next. If nothing else, I guarantee you won’t find a better Polish horror musical mermaid tale in 2017. —&nbsp;J.S. LewisAvailable on: AmazonMayhem (2017)  84%Rip and tear! For all you corporate drones out there suffering from chronic employment, here’s an antidote: Mayhem, director Joe Lynch’s jagged little pill of blood, guts, and TPS reports. Steven Yuen, having found sweet release from The Walking Dead‘s pervasive mediocrity, is now settled into a nice high-rise office as a heartless lawyer. But a virus (maybe you’re the problem, Steve) has invaded the building. So just as he’s about to be thrown into the street as the fall guy for some botched business, his coworkers devolve into uninhibited psychos lusting for cathartic sex and total carnage. Call it casualty Friday. The premise doesn’t hold up under any real scrutiny and the budget is barebones, but Mayhem‘s&nbsp;bone-breaking renegade filmmaking only needs the purpose and passion witnessed here for it to work. It’s a primal scream from your empty screen that departs with an impact. Literally. — Alex VoAvailable on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;AmazonMommy Dead and Dearest (2017)  100%There’s been an influx of true crime docs in the last few years, but if there’s one that’s absolutely worth watching, it’s Mommy Dead and Dearest. Dee Dee, a model mother, and Gypsy, her chronically ill daughter, live what looks to be a seemingly normal life. Interviews with neighbors, doctors, family members, and Gypsy herself prove that nothing and no one are what they seem. It’s like if Hannah Montana was Mischa Barton from The Sixth Sense, but was also kind of a murderer — er, a murderer’s apprentice, if you will. (That is the most accurate description anyone will ever give you.) The story picks up in the aftermath of what looks like your standard Law and Order: SVU-type plot: Daughter meets guy online, guy convinces daughter to run away, mother stands in the way, all hell breaks loose. But once the details start to surface, a drastically different tale begins to emerge. Mommy Dead and Dearest not only provides an interesting look into the kind of toll Munchausen Syndrome by proxy takes on an individual, but also takes a deep dive into the inner workings of fraud, emotional and physical abuse, and the state of both the healthcare and criminal justice systems in the United States. —&nbsp;Zoey MooreAvailable on: FandangoNOW,&nbsp;AmazonNorman (Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer) (2017)  88%The latest by critically acclaimed director Joseph Cedar (Footnote, Beaufort) could be an ideal way to close out your year, with what quickly became my favorite Richard Gere performance yet. Gere plays Norman Oppenheimer, an aging Jewish wheeler and dealer in New York thrown into political mayhem when his new friend becomes elected Prime Minister of Israel. A classic tragic arc is made contemporarily relatable with a poignant stew — equal parts funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking. The feeling walking out of the theater (or finishing the stream, as the case may be) is a darker one than expected at the start, and Gere somehow manages to turn one of those borderline abrasive characters that we’d often ignore in life into someone worth rooting for. — Kerr LordyganAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThelma (2017)  93%I went into Thelma cold, only knowing that it had an intriguing poster that made me feel the same kind of fascination I felt with the VHS cover for Prom Night II (look it up, I was obsessed). Eili Harboe plays Thelma, a young woman in college who comes from a religious background. The movie is elegant and restrained, and compelled me to “solve” it. Thelma has a seizure at school, and things begin to get noticeably odd… or do they? Was I assigning value to something that meant nothing? Was this horror, sci-fi, coming-of-age, or all three? The fact that the movie takes its time to answer, while trusting the audience enough to draw some of their own conclusions, made me love it. Thelma’s journey into self-discovery is a measured kind of realistic, beautiful, and a little creepy. Watching it not only entertained me, but helped me understand how I watch films, and how wonderful moviegoing can be when you experience it rather than figure it out. —&nbsp;Grae DrakeIn select theaters","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"travel, movies, Country, Endgame, indiana, hard, Fire, Opinion, Plus, All, Musical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2017"},{"id":"47612431913201","title":"The 10 Scariest Horror Movies Ever","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 10 Scariest Horror Movies EverWe asked, you voted. From demonic possessions and cursed TVs to haunted hotels and killer clowns, here are movies that scared RT users the most.by RT Staff | October 29, 2020 |  CommentsIf you were poking around RT a week and a half or so ago, you might have come across a little poll we were taking on the site to try and determine the Scariest Movie Ever. Based on other lists and suggestions from the RT staff, we pulled together 40 of the scariest movies ever made and asked you to vote for the one that terrified you the most. As it happens, a British broadband service comparison website decided to conduct a science experiment to determine the same thing, and their results were… surprising, to say the least. Did Rotten Tomatoes readers agree with the findings? Read on to find out what our fans determined were the 10 Scariest Horror Movies Ever.1. The Exorcist (1973)(Photo by ©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)You may not agree&nbsp;that&nbsp;The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever, but it probably also&nbsp;isn’t much of a surprise to see it at the top of our list — with a whopping 19% of all the votes cast. William Friedkin’s adaptation of the eponymous novel about a demon-possessed child and the attempts to banish said demon became the highest-grossing R-rated horror film ever and the first to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars (it earned nine other nominations and took home two trophies). But outside of its critical and commercial bona fides, the film is well-known for the mass hysteria it inspired across the country, from protests over its controversial&nbsp;subject matter to widespread reports of nausea and fainting in the audience. Its dramatic pacing and somewhat dated effects may seem quaint compared to some contemporary horror, but there’s no denying the power the film continues to have over those who see it for the first time.2.&nbsp;Hereditary (2018)(Photo by ©A24)Writer-director Ari Aster made a huge splash with his feature directorial debut, a dark family drama about the nature of grief couched within a supernatural horror film. Toni Collette earned a spot in the pantheon of great Oscar snubs with her slowly-ratcheted-up-to-11 performance as bedeviled mother Annie, but the movie’s biggest shock came courtesy of… Well, we won’t spoil that here. Suffice it to say&nbsp;Hereditary struck such a nerve with moviegoers that it instantly turned Aster into a director to watch and shot up to second place on our list.3.&nbsp;The Conjuring (2013)(Photo by Michael Tackett/©Warner Bros. Pictures)James Wan has staked out a place among the modern&nbsp;masters of horror, directing films like&nbsp;Saw,&nbsp;Dead Silence,&nbsp;Insidious, and this inspired-by-true-events chiller based on the experiences of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Warrens, best known for their work on the strange case that inspired the&nbsp;Amityville Horror movies (which played a part in The Conjuring 2), were portrayed by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who grounded the effective jump scares and freak-out moments with a believable world-weariness. Together, Wan and his co-leads found fresh terror in familiar genre tropes, and the end result is a sprawling cinematic universe that only continues to grow.4.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Shining&nbsp;(1980)(Photo by ©Warner Brothers)Literally dozens of Stephen King’s novels and stories have been adapted for the big screen, and several of those films are considered classics today, like&nbsp;Carrie,&nbsp;Misery, and&nbsp;Pet Sematary (and that doesn’t even account for non-horror stuff like&nbsp;The Shawshank Redemption and&nbsp;Stand By Me). But the mother of them all is easily Stanley Kubrick’s adaptation of&nbsp;The Shining. A marvel of set and production design and a genuinely unnerving take on the traditional haunted house story,&nbsp;The Shining features a host of memorable images and an iconic Jack Nicholson performance. The film’s relatively few jumps scares are still absolutely chilling, but its true power lies in the way it crawls under your skin and makes you experience Jack Torrance’s slow descent into madness. It’s rightfully considered one of the greatest horror films ever made, and it ranked fourth in our poll.5.&nbsp;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)(Photo by Everett Collection)While the top four movies on this list collectively garnered 42% of the total votes counted, they were followed by six films that all earned around 3% of the vote each. In other words, these last six films were separated by no more than 60 votes. The first of them is&nbsp;this low-budget slasher directed and co-written by Tobe Hooper, very loosely inspired by the crimes of Ed Gein.&nbsp;Texas Chainsaw’s grimy aesthetic helped lend it an air of authenticity, which made it all the more frightening (“This could&nbsp;actually happen, you guys!”), and the massive, menacing presence of Gunnar Hansen’s Leatherface paved the way for other brutes like Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. Multiple attempts have been made to breathe new life into the franchise — and we have another one on the way — but none have equaled the original in sheer, over-the-top, power tool-inspired terror.6.&nbsp;The Ring (2002)(Photo by ©DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)It’s always a tricky proposition to take something that works well for one culture and try to translate that formula successfully for another, but Gore Verbinski managed that with&nbsp;The Ring. A remake of Japanese director Hideo Nakata’s acclaimed thriller about a cursed videotape,&nbsp;Verbinski’s take kept the original film’s striking visual imagery — the&nbsp; ghost of a young girl in a white dress with long black hair covering her face — and found that it scared the hell out of audiences no matter where they were from. While the film wasn’t as well-regarded as its predecessor, it features a committed performance from a then up-and-coming Naomi Watts, and for many, it served as an introduction to East Asian horror cinema.7.&nbsp;Halloween (1978)(Photo by ©Compass International Pictures)Coming in at the seventh spot on our list is the film that introduced the world to all-time scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and put John Carpenter on the map.&nbsp;Halloween is frequently cited as one of the earliest examples of the slasher genre as we know it today, and while it may not feature the same kind of realistic gore we’ve come to expect of films in that category, it packs a lot of tension and some inventive thrills in a relatively small-scale package. The film’s legacy is also fairly untouchable: Michael Myers’ mask has become the stuff of legend, and the giant, unstoppable killer and the “final girl” have become ingrained in the horror lexicon. There’s a reason the franchise is still going after more than 40 years.8.&nbsp;Sinister (2012)(Photo by ©Summit Entertainment)For those who didn’t read the “scientific study” mentioned at the top, we’ve finally come to the film it crowned the scariest. Before he joined the MCU with 2016’s&nbsp;Doctor Strange, director Scott Derrickson had racked up a few horror films, a couple of which earned cult followings. One of them was this small-scale haunted house/possession story about a true-crime writer (Ethan Hawke) who moves his wife and kids into a house where a family was murdered, only to discover the new place might already have a rather evil tenant. Writer C. Robert Cargill was reportedly inspired to pen the script based on a nightmare he had after watching&nbsp;The Ring, and the story does share a minor similarity with that film, what with the creepy snuff film angle. But for many who saw it, the dramatic reveals and creepy set pieces far outweighed any recycled genre tropes that might have been present. Plus, there’s at least one report out there that says it’s the scariest movie ever made, so that must count for something.9.&nbsp;Insidious (2010)(Photo by ©FilmDistrict courtesy Everett Collection)James Wan has already shown up higher on the list, but before he and Patrick Wilson made&nbsp;The Conjuring, they worked together on this supernatural thriller about a young boy who falls into a coma and begins to channel a malevolent spirit. The bare bones of the story weren’t the most groundbreaking, but frequent Wan collaborator Leigh Whannell infused it with a compelling enough mythology that it spawned three more installments. Wan also stated that&nbsp;Insidious was meant to be something of a corrective to the outright violence of&nbsp;Saw, which compelled him to craft something on a more spiritual level, and the end result is an effective chiller featuring what is frequently regarded one of the best jump scares ever put on screen.10.&nbsp;IT (2017)(Photo by Brooke Palmer/©Warner Bros.)The fear of clowns is a very real thing, even if it’s become so commonplace to announce it that it feels disingenuous. If you needed any further evidence, we direct you to the box office haul of 2017’s&nbsp;IT, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, which went on to beat&nbsp;The Exorcist’s 44-year record as the highest-grossing horror film ever. Oh, and of course, its 10th-place finish on this list.&nbsp;Andy Muschietti’s big-budget adaptation drew on nostalgia to tell its story of children scarred by trauma, while Bill Skarsgard’s take on Pennywise the evil, shapeshifting clown was bizarre and unsettling in all the right ways. Add a healthy dose of jump scares, a handful of impressive set pieces, and some top-notch CGI, and you’ve got a recipe for a horror film that’s both fun and full of scares.Thumbnail image&nbsp;by&nbsp;©FilmDistrict courtesy Everett CollectionOn an Apple device?

But that’s why god invented the sidekick. They are the color to the protagonist’s black-and-white, the fiery, funny fools who often drive the story’s complications, as the protagonist runs around putting out all the fires.Because a fair number of horror films feature female leads, many of these sidekicks are also female characters. Sometimes they bolster the protagonist’s confidence, sometimes tear it down. Occasionally they take on traits of a villain, only to be revealed as the true center of the film. Often they perish, and their deaths trigger an extra significance: If this person with quick wit and endearing flaws can die, then things are about to get serious.One of the greatest – to our mind – is Barb, played by Margot Kidder, in&nbsp;the original&nbsp;Black Christmas. As we prepare for the&nbsp;release of Blumhouse’s&nbsp;Black Christmas&nbsp;remake&nbsp;this week, here are 15 of the most colorful sidekicks of horror cinema.Barb&nbsp;in&nbsp;Black Christmas (1974)  71%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection )Played by Margot KidderVery few horror films possess the kind of joy Bob Clark’s Black Christmas emits when resident alcoholic and prankster Barb (Margot Kidder) patiently explains to a befuddled cop that her phone number begins with the word “fellatio.” Nor do they revel in a character’s tangential knowledge as much as when Barb interjects with some serious turtle-sex facts while a father is grieving his missing daughter. Barb may not be the final girl, but she fills our stockings with delightful coal.Tatum&nbsp;in&nbsp;Scream (1996)  79%(Photo by © Dimension Films )Played by Rose McGowanWes Craven consistently delivered some of the best female sidekicks, but Tatum (Rose McGowan) earns a spot for her 1990s “girl power” feminism that had her trying to convince her boyfriend, Casey (Matthew Lillard), that the new Woodsboro slasher could be a woman, because girls can do anything boys can do. Her kid-sister vibe – she’s literally Dewy’s kid sister – makes her a sparkling verbal sparrer, and she’s talking s–t right up until the very garage-door end.Annie and Lynda in Halloween (1978)  96%(Photo by © Compass International Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection)Played by Nancy Kyes and&nbsp;P.J. Soles&nbsp;Before slashers were a thing, John Carpenter and producer Debra Hill’s prototype for the genre showcased the possibilities for fully fleshed-out sidekicks with sporty Lynda and sarcastic Annie, the bad and badder devils on Laurie Strode’s shoulders. They poke fun at the latter’s virginal purity with the kind of ribbing realistic for angsty teen girls. Both act as comic relief, proving there can and should be more than one funnywoman in the group.Pam in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection )Played by Teri McMinnTobe Hooper specifically asked for actress Teri McMinn’s costume to be backless and short to show off most of her “meat,” giving her a visually vulnerable feel in this slaughterhouse classic. Pam is a small role, but McMinn fills her out with a genuine openness and curiosity, a young woman of the perilous 1970s whose kind and trusting nature leads her to disaster.Juno Kaplan in&nbsp;The Descent (2006)  86%(Photo by © Lionsgate)Played by Natalie MendozaJuno is both the sidekick and the foil of Neil Marshall’s spelunking disaster. It’s her fiery, fierce, and selfish nature that draws her estranged best friend Sarah into the unexplored caves, but also the spirit that gives Sarah the will to leave her as bait and escape. Natalie Mendoza’s empathetic performance speaks to what one is capable of when scared, but not so much that her fate doesn’t seem a little fitting.Lambert in&nbsp;Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by © 20th Century Fox / courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Veronica CartwrightJoan Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) was the navigator of the USCSS Nostromo, and she spent just as much time trying to guide the crew of the ship in the right direction. She was the first to say exploring that distress call was a bad idea and the first to say they should “get the hell out of here.” Her hysterics are a natural and appropriate reaction to an alien attack and an extension of the audience’s reactions, so Lambert becomes the lens through which we view the film.Jeryline&nbsp;in&nbsp;Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight (1995)  38%(Photo by MCA/Universal Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection.)Played by&nbsp;Jada Pinkett-SmithJeryline (Jada Pinkett-Smith) may be a criminal on work release at a rural hotel, but she’s got more smarts and morals than many.&nbsp;Demon Knight&nbsp;is the rare horror movie willing to off its protagonist, and Jeryline steps up from sidekick to lead, showing off her cunning by using the demon’s Don Juan charm against him and ultimately saving the night.Tina Gray in&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)  94%(Photo by © New Line Cinema)Played by&nbsp;Amanda WyssIf you’d only watched the first act of Wes Craven’s A Nightmare on Elm Street, you’d think Tina Gray (Amanda Wyss) were the protagonist of the film, but she’s in actuality the sidekick and catalyst for the film series. She exudes both vulnerability and strength, which is why her iconic demise and subsequent use as a puppet for Freddy Krueger’s mind tricks is a huge punch to the gut.Helen Shivers in&nbsp;I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)  43%(Photo by © Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Sarah Michelle GellarThe key to Helen Shivers’ success as a sidekick is her unabashed and shameless vanity. Sarah Michelle Gellar’s portrayal of the character paints her as the beauty queen with depth, the most likely to succeed. She’s the woman with the plan to track down the killer and the guts to charge into the crowd of the Croaker Queen Pageant talent competition to save her friend. Unfortunately, luck just wasn’t on her side.Paige in&nbsp;House of Wax (2005)  26%(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Played by Paris HiltonWhen it was announced that Paris Hilton would play a supporting character in Jaume Collet-Serra’s remake of House of Wax, there was a resounding cheer that audiences would get to see this real-life heel bloodily sacrificed for the movie gods. The thing is: Hilton killed it. She infused Paige with the same detached and fascinating poppy materialism she possessed in her reality show, becoming the best love-to-hate-’em sidekick.Vasquez in Aliens (1986)  97%Played by Jenette GoldsteinThe descriptor “badass” is tossed around for really any female character who demonstrates anything remotely “strong.” But Jenette Goldstein’s Vasquez is potentially the only character worthy of being called a badass. Her barbed quips and buff biceps are perhaps the most memorable aspect of an extremely memorable film. She exudes fearlessness and feels nearly immortal… until she doesn’t.Yara in&nbsp;It Follows (2015)  95%(Photo by © RADiUS-TWC/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Olivia LuccardiOlivia Luccardi’s Yara is more than a sidekick, she’s the one-woman Greek chorus of It Follows. At first, she seems like a typical tech-obsessed, disinterested teen, constantly reading things on her fictional clamshell e-reader, occasionally glancing up to sneer at her friends’ poor choices. But nearly everything Yara reads aloud to her friends contains a philosophical key to their situation, advice, and omens.Alexia in Raw (2017)  92%(Photo by © Focus World /courtesy Everett Collection)Played by Ella RumpfThe genius of Ella Rumpf’s Alexia in Julia Ducournau’s Raw is that Alexia at first seems the antagonist of the film, the source of all of her sister’s problematic cravings, but it turns out she’s really the sidekick. She’s a cutting bully who can turn on a dime to become the doting and generous big sister. Even as she emotionally tortures Justine, Alexia clearly wants to snap her sister out of her goody two-shoes demeanor and have some fun.Lily in&nbsp;Black Swan (2010)  85%(Photo by © Fox Searchlight Pictures)Played by Mila KunisJust like Alexia in Raw, Lily’s the false antagonist, the projection of all the protagonist’s fears and anxieties. In reality, she’s a smart, grounded ballet dancer, probably the sanest of the bunch, whose only hope is to nab the lead role and maybe coax Nina out of her cocooned and infantile life. In a story of paranoia and delusion, Lily’s the realest of the real.Nam-joo&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Host (2007)  93%(Photo by ©Magnolia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)Played by&nbsp;Bae Doo-naThere are few things more admirable about director Bong Joon-ho than his ability to create characters who are both wildly inept and also extremely vain and self-satisfied with their limited abilities. Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) as the protagonist’s gold medalist archer sister who rubs her mediocre success in his face is one of Bong’s greatest creations. It’s impossible for her to swallow her pride, even as she’s face-to-face with a monstrous adversary.Black Christmas&nbsp;is in theaters December 13, 2019Like this?

See the trailers and find out when they're being releasedby Matt Cabral | June 14, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by CD Projekt Red)Every year in late spring, gamers and press from around the globe converge on the Los Angeles Convention Center to get a sneak peek of the latest and greatest video games being revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.For E3 2019 this week, heavy hitters Microsoft, Nintendo, and Ubisoft broke out the big guns for their latest projects, but a number of movie- and TV-based games have emerged as some of the week’s most promising prospects. Game developers no doubt hope to score the same sort of critical acclaim as last year’s Marvel’s Spider-Man.Here are 10 of those pop culture–centric projects — and&nbsp;two honorable mentions — that already have our thumbs twitching in anticipation!STRANGER THINGS 3: THE VIDEO GAMEDeveloper: BonusXPPublisher: En Masse EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: July 4Following their ravenous consumption of new Stranger Things episodes this summer, fans can dive deeper into the sci-fi horror series’ third season in a new game releasing day and date with the show. Featuring a charmingly retro visual style, complete with a pixel-perfect Sheriff Hopper, as well as solo and co-op play, Stranger Things 3: The Video Game invites fans to solve puzzles, battle supernatural baddies, and uncover Hawkins’ — and the Upside Down’s — darkest secrets.MARVEL ULTIMATE ALLIANCE 3: THE BLACK ORDERDeveloper: Koei Tecmo Games, Team NINJAPublisher: NintendoPlatforms: Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: July 19Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order easily earns its title, as it allows players to assemble teams of iconic characters from all corners of the Marvel Universe. Playing solo — or as part of a four-player super-team — fans can choose from nearly 40 characters, from the Avengers and Fantastic Four to the X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy. Dynamic action-RPG gameplay, a gorgeous visual presentation, and an original Thanos-thwarting tale round out this fan-pleasing package.BLAIR WITCHDeveloper: Bloober TeamPublisher: Lionsgate GamesPlatforms: Xbox One, PCRelease Date: August 30The future of the&nbsp;Blair Witch&nbsp;franchise might be in limbo, but the cult-favorite&nbsp;film series’&nbsp;faithful followers can return to the Black Hills Forest this summer. A story-driven, psychological horror entry from the team behind the nerve-fraying Layers of Fear games, Blair Witch weaves a fresh, frightening tale, complete with shaky camcorder footage, atmospheric environments, and the sort of imagery that will take up permanent residence in your nightmares.STAR WARS JEDI: FALLEN ORDERDeveloper: Respawn EntertainmentPublisher: Electronic ArtsPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 15Gaming’s latest take on the galaxy far, far away puts players in the role of Cal Kestis, a Padawan on the run from the Empire’s Jedi-hunting Inquisitors. Set shortly after the events of Episode III, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is a single-player, story-driven action-adventure featuring familiar faces from both the light and dark sides, dynamic lightsaber combat, Stormtrooper-crushing Force powers, and an adorable companion droid that could top BB-8 on the cuteness scale.JUMANJI: THE VIDEO GAMEDeveloper: FunsolvePublisher: Outright GamesPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: November 15Landing ahead of the holiday season’s highly-anticipated Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle sequel comes a new game based on the family-friendly franchise. Embracing the action, humor, and exotic environments of the films, the game features four-player co-op (both online and local) and a delightfully stylized take on the films’ colorful cast of characters.THE WALKING DEAD ONSLAUGHTDeveloper: SurviosPublisher: SurviosPlatforms: Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VRRelease Date: Fall 2019Given virtual reality’s immersion-ratcheting nature, it’s not surprising so many game developers have leveraged the tech to scare the pants off players. The Walking Dead Onslaught aims to up the ante in this regard, putting brave fans face-to-rotting-face with the franchise’s brain-craving foes. Sporting visceral combat — supported by a “progressive dismemberment system” — and a new story, the game also puts players in the boots of their favorite survivors from the AMC series.THE DARK CRYSTAL: AGE OF RESISTANCE TACTICSDeveloper: BonusXPPublisher: En Masse EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: 2019The Dark Crystal renaissance continues with a new game based on the cult-favorite film’s 10-episode prequel series set to hit Netflix this summer, The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance. Dubbed Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance Tactics, the title combines strategy-focused combat with deep role-playing game elements, all brought to life by a charming visual presentation that should please fans of the original Jim Henson– and Frank Oz–directed film.CYBERPUNK 2077Developer: CD Projekt RedPublisher:&nbsp;CD ProjektPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date:&nbsp;April 16, 2020Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t find its genesis in film and TV, but the title scores whoa! points for hiring thespian&nbsp; Keanu Reeves to anchor the game. Reeves plays rocker Johnny Silverhand, a high-profile NPC who personifies the malware infecting the biochip in the player’s character. The Matrix&nbsp;trilogy star, just off Certified Fresh hit&nbsp;John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, is soon to appear in 2020&nbsp;film&nbsp;Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music. Plus, CD Projekt Red is the company behind the hugely popular Witcher&nbsp;video game series,&nbsp;which is being turned into a Netflix&nbsp;show starring Henry Cavill (Justice League).Read Also: “Upcoming Video Game Movies and TV Adaptations”MARVEL’S AVENGERSDeveloper: Crystal Dynamics, Eidos MontrealPublisher: Square EnixPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: May 15, 2020Avengers Endgame has come and gone, but Marvel fans will get to reassemble Earth’s Mightiest Heroes in this ambitious action-adventure from the folks behind the rebooted Tomb Raider franchise. Whether saving the day solo or teaming up online with a co-op crew of four, players will unleash the skills and powers of Captain America, Black Widow, Iron Man, and the Hulk in a brand new, cinematic story that further expands on Marvel’s rich universe.LEGO STAR WARS: THE SKYWALKER SAGADeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros. Interactive EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: 2020The enormously popular and prolific LEGO video game series kicked off with 2005’s LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. That legacy now comes full-circle with the sprawling Skywalker Saga, a collection of nine brick-based games from a galaxy far, far away. On top of revisiting previously released entries based on Episodes 1-7, the Death Star–sized compilation — which will allow fans to begin the story at any point — brings The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker to block-y life for the first time.JOHN WICK HEXDeveloper: Bithell GamesPublisher: Lionsgate Games, Good Shepherd EntertainmentPlatforms: PC, (conoles TBA)Release Date: TBAIf you were expecting a game based on the blockbuster John Wick franchise to be a brainless, button-mashing shooter, you’d be wrong. Dead wrong. A brilliant blend of&nbsp;gun-fu action and strategy, John Wick Hex will have players plan every trigger-pull behind each precision shot, just as the Baba Yaga would. Toss in a stylized visual presentation and universe-expanding story and this smart shooter is right on target. Players are the titular assassin, played by Keanu Reeves in the&nbsp;film franchise (no word on his participation here).ELDEN RINGDeveloper: FromSoftwarePublisher: Bandai Namco EntertainmentPlatforms: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: TBAAnother title not&nbsp;based on an existing film or TV property, this dark fantasy entry deserves a mention for George R.R. Martin’s involvement. A brand-new universe created by Game of Thrones mastermind Martin and From Software’s Hidetaka Miyazaki (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice) Elden Ring has the potential to be a pretty big deal. At the very least, it gives Martin’ fans — patiently waiting for his next book and/or suffering withdrawals from HBO’s GoT conclusion — something new to obsess over.Like this?

Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)In Wes Anderson movies, dogs usually get the short end of the whimsy stick. The rampage began in The Royal Tenenbaums, when the family beagle is crushed by a car driven by Owen Wilson on mescaline. Since then, dogs are routinely killed, poisoned, and abandoned. As if to repent, Anderson is releasing a new stop-motion adventure all about dogs…who are crushed, killed, poisoned, and abandoned. But, hey, it’s called Isle of Dogs, a pun when said aloud about how much Anderson loves man’s best friend. Sure, dude.Seriously, though, Isle of Dogs is a terrific tribute to the purity and loyal spirit of dogs, one that also can’t help take a few potshots at cats . The cats versus dogs debate has been raging since time immemorial, but today we’re going to solve it like true 21st century people: by throwing up a bunch of numbers on your screen! We’ve taken the 20 highest-rated dog movies, and the 20 highest-rated cat movies, and averaged out a Tomatometer for each list. The animal has to be the main crux of the plot, and movies where the dogs and cats share top billing are not included — so no Incredible Journeys or Milos &amp; Otiseses.20 Best Dog MoviesOld Yeller: 100%101 Dalmatians: 98%Heart of a Dog: 96%Lassie Come Home: 94%Best in Show: 94%Lassie&nbsp;(2006): 93%Snoopy, Come Home:92%White Dog: 92%Lady and the Tramp: 90%My Dog Tulip: 90%Bolt: 89%White God: 89%Lassie&nbsp;(1994): 88%Frankenweenie: 87%Benji: 86%Wendy and Lucy: 85%A Boy and His Dog: 75%My Dog Skip: 73%Eight Below: 72%White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf: 71%AVERAGE: 88%20 Best Cat MoviesKedi: 98%Born Free: 94%The Rabbi’s Cat: 94%That Darn Cat!: 93%Duma: 93%The Lion King: 92%The Cat Returns: 90%Harry and Tonto: 88%The Black Cat: 87%Puss in Boots: 84%A Cat in Paris: 82%Two Brothers: 78%Keanu: 78%A Street Cat Named Bob: 76%The Lion King 1 1/2: 76%The Cat from Outer Space: 75%Disneynature African Cats: 71%Roar: 70%The Aristocats: 67%Cat’s Eye: 67%AVERAGE: 82%The Tomatometer speaks (or barks, in this case): Dog movies get the edge over cats! But why stop there? Continue on as we break down the stats even further.RUFF SKETCHES &amp; FE-LINE DRAWINGBuena Vista Pictures/courtesy Everett CollectionAnimated dog movies: 101 Dalmatians, Snoopy, Come Home, Lady and the Tramp, My Dog Tulip, Bolt, FrankenweenieAverage Tomatometer: 91%Animated cat movies: The Rabbi’s Cat, The Lion King, The Cat Returns, Puss in Boots, A Cat in Paris, The Lion King 1 1/2, The AristocatsAverage Tomatometer: 84%With a little imagination, you can draw a line from the earliest cave drawings to Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back. Since the beginning, we’ve observed and studied animals around us, for re-creation on whatever canvas available. So it’s no surprise that cartoons, our updated cave art, are synonymous with talking animals, and that a significant portion of the top 20 cats and dog movies are animated. For our canine pals, the average Tomatometer for the seven animated movies is 91%. For our kitty compatriots, the T-meter for the six animated movies equals 84%, thanks to Walt Disney (The Lion King), Studio Ghibli (The Cat Returns), and Dreamworks (Puss in Boots). Why has Pixar not made the effort? Are they secretly running some anti-cat ring from their basement dungeon in Emeryville? Look into it, people.DOGS &amp; CATS LIVING TOGETHER, MASS HYSTERIAOscilloscope/courtesy Everett CollectionDog documentaries: Heart of a DogTomatometer: 96%Cat documentaries: Kedi, African CatsTomatometer: 88%Two documentaries pop up on the cat list: Kedi, an endearing look at strays in Instanbul, and African Cats, featuring cheetahs and lions in Kenya. From the streets to the tundra to your apartment, cats remain in our eyes independent, mysterious, and almost otherwordly. Probably why we make more documentaries about them than dogs. Dog movies revolve around their connection with humans, good fodder for tugging at the heart strings in narrative films. And the only dog documentary here, Heart of a Dog, is indeed about a dog’s bond with its master, artist Laurie Anderson. It’s 96% on the Tomatometer, while the two cat documentaries average 88%.KILL YOUR (ANIMAL) DARLINGSMovies where the dog dies: Old Yeller, White Dog, My Dog Tulip, My Dog Skip, Eight BelowAverage Tomatometer: 86%Movies where the cat dies: The Lion King, Harry &amp; Tonto, The Black CatAverage Tomatometer: 88%Some people refuse to watch movies knowing the dog is going to die. But how does canine death affect the Tomatometer? Movies where a dog is killed (on-screen or off) average 86%, two percentage points down from the top 20’s 88%. But when the cat dies, the average Tomatometer actually goes up, also to a healthy 88%. What happened to the stereotype of film critics being cat people? Or is this all some twisted projection of resentment upon their own pets? You be the judge.BITING THE HANDCriterion CollectionMovies where the dog bites someone: White God, 101 Dalmatians, White Dog, A Boy and His Dog, White Fang 2Average Tomatometer: 85%Movies where the cat scratches someone: Two Brothers, Puss in Boots, Roar, Cat’s EyeAverage Tomatometer: 75%Enough about killing your pets. What happens when feral instinct rears its furry head and cats and dogs attack people? With dogs, critics seem pretty okay with it: the average Tomatometer only drops to 85%, and frankly, some of the people deserve it, like the burglars in 101 Dalmatians. And we’re including Blood from A Boy and His Dog; he doesn’t bite anybody, but he does help himself to some human delicacies, if you catch our post-apocalyptic drift. Meanwhile, critics are no fans of cat scratch fever: the average rating drops to 75% in movies where cats go on the offense. Keep those claws in your paws, kittens.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Rom-Com, Biopics, love","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"cats-vs-dogs-which-one-has-the-better-movies"},{"id":"47612605745439","title":"On DVD This Week: Keanu, The Lobster, The Knick, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Keanu, The Lobster, The Knick, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | August 1, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a high-concept comedy, some really solid television, a handful of noteworthy smaller releases, and the late Garry Marshall’s final film.

In this week’s Further Reading, Kim Newman celebrates The King of Kong.This is the most exciting, audience-involving film of any kind I’ve seen this year. At none of the previews of the summer’s blockbusters was I part of such a vocal, enthusiastic and wholly-gripped crowd as I was at a relatively small screening of a picture which has made its UK debut as a DVD retail item.The King of Kong is an aptly ragged-looking documentary which takes a completely uninviting subject — a controversy in the world of retro-computer gaming about whether longtime Donkey Kong champion Billy Mitchell should cede his title to contender Steve Weibe — and makes it the stuff of legends. Donkey Kong, for those who don’t remember, is (or, rather, was) an early, fiendishly difficult game from the Super Mario Bros stable, in which the plumber tries to ascend various ladders to rescue a princess, while avoiding missiles tossed by a malign ape. From the DVD extras, I learned that the game was originally supposed to feature Popeye, Olive Oyl and Bluto, but the Japanese designers couldn’t get the rights to the characters and came up with their own.Billy Mitchell, hailed as ‘the gamer of the century’, is a reptilian, faux-cool smarm-bucket who invokes fanatical loyalty from longtime rivals and associates, including Brian Kuh (the third-highest DK scorer), who scuttles around with Renfield-like devotion to his master, and Walter Day, the bizarre Roberts Blossom lookalike who has taken on the mantle of definitive judge for the field (an accolade confirmed when he strikes an alliance with the Guinness Book of Records).Though a patriot, a family man, a successful hot sauce tycoon and rated as ultra-cool by his circle, the goateed and distinctively coiffed Mitchell comes across onscreen as a classic villain. Even his closest friends call him devious, but he is also tragically puffed up in his idea of celebrity, flirting with the interviewer and referring to himself in the third person as if he were a world leader planning a counter-coup rather than a probable saddo whose highest achievement (a perfect Pac-Man score) means less and less with every passing minute.Wiebe, by contrast, is a classic underdog: following a run of near-miss careers in baseball and music, he took up the game after being laid off, then reinvented himself as a science teacher loved by his students. Crucially, in this showing at least, he doesn’t even seem to think that much of his knack for DK, though he is clearly as obsessively devoted to chasing the record as Mitchell is to keeping it.Director Seth Gordon intended a more general inside-retro-gaming documentary but lucked into an astonishingly potent storyline and must have sorted through acres of footage to get stuff this good. So good, in fact, a dramatised remake is reportedly in the works. It has vivid supporting characters, including Roy Schild (aka ‘Mr Awesome’), a secondary ‘evil mastermind’ in Wiebe’s camp and Wiebe’s amazing children (a young son who shouts ‘stop playing Donkey Kong‘ as Dad is on his first record-breaking attempt, a tweenage daughter who wryly observes that a lot of people ruin their lives trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records).You also get as many ups and downs as a sports fiction film, with the added plus that since it’s a true story the outcome isn’t decreed by cliché — though there are triumphs and disasters near the end, the story goes on and you can’t stop yourself looking up on the internet to find out who reigns as the current King of Kong. Everyone, including the near-saintly but not sanctimonious Wiebe, reveals more about themselves than the average reality TV contestant would, with many jaw-dropping statements about epochal achievements and grand calamities that took place in a world of game-playing marginalised by the end of the 1980s.Mitchell and cohorts act in such a way that, even if it turned out Gordon manipulated and edited the hell out of the footage, it would be impossible for your conclusions about these people not to be — to some extent – horribly true. When Wiebe sends in a tape of his first record-breaking score, Day has agents talk their way into his house to assess his personal DK machine to see if it’s been tampered with, Mitchell claims only scores achieved in public count and the record doesn’t go into the books. When Wiebe does it again at a games convention, Mitchell has protégé Doris Self (an 80-year-old Q*Bert whizz) hand over a blurry, splicey tape in which he purportedly sets a higher record which Day and company accept within ten minutes.I don’t see how this incident could be spun in a way which doesn’t suggest the tiny sub-culture was stacked against the outsider, though there’s a subtle thread later in the film, which I suspect comes from a dawning awareness of what they look like on the record, as Day and his crowd (except the loyal Kuh) begin to feel the long-time champion has been less than honest with them and respond to Wiebe’s essential decency even as they consistently mispronounce his name.There’s a stunning moment when the antagonists almost meet, for the only time in the film, as Wiebe is openly friendly to Mitchell, who cruises by ignoring him at a games machine while making a snide remark to his wife; it may be that when the cameras weren’t on them, these men have played each other or treated each other courteously, but the audience I saw it with hissed a pantomime villain and cheered for the decent contender. Even Mitchell’s obviously genuine decency towards Doris, a little old lady whose gaming career he enabled and championed, doesn’t take the sting out of his Dick Dastardly act elsewhere.It makes good use of 1980s inspirational pop music, and — like the best of these ‘American weirdo’ documentaries (American Movie, Spellbound) — works up a vein of melancholy sympathy for folks who fanatically and unselfconsciously pursue goals that seem absurd. The middle-aged guy dressed like a teenager who wistfully remembers thinking that the guys who racked up big arcade scores would have hot babes clustering about them perfectly encapsulates the delusional, funny-sad heroism of the world of Kong.Good documentaries can be made about significant subjects, like the recent Iraq/torture-themed Standard Operating Procedure and Taxi to the Dark Side, but sometimes outstanding true life films spin gold out of ostensibly ridiculous, trivial material.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Best, TV, Tubi, reviews, batman, Superheroes, Comedy, natural","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"further-reading-celebrating-the-brilliance-of-the-king-of-kong"},{"id":"47612579569944","title":"National Society of Film Critics Award Winners Announced: Lady Bird Wins Best Picture","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})National Society of Film Critics Award Winners Announced: Lady Bird Wins Best Pictureby RT Staff | January 8, 2018 |  CommentsOn Saturday, January 6, the National Society of Film Critics announced the recipients of their annual awards.

Some of the smaller movies do boast the festival accolades or the requisite star power either behind or in front of the lens to rack up some awards buzz, but far more of them flutter away without much fanfare. With that in mind, we here on staff at RT have chosen our favorite films that went mostly&nbsp;unnoticed by audiences at large in 2016. Read on for the full list of our Off the Radar picks of the year.American Honey (2016)  79%At once epic and intimate, American Honey is a film that’s completely of the moment, like a series of snapshots from the forgotten corners of America. Andrea Arnold’s episodic road movie about a group of throwaway teenagers crisscrossing the country to sell overpriced magazine subscriptions door to door has a palpable sense of discovery and danger, along with an almost tactile sense of dry heat, sweaty clothes, and buzzing insects. At the heart of everything is Sasha Lane, the preternaturally gifted actress that Arnold plucked off a beach to star in her film; as Star, Lane is alternately headstrong and naïve, tough and thoughtful. Some might be put off by the film’s nearly three-hour runtime, or by its meandering plot, or perhaps by Lane’s co-star Shia LeBeouff (who’s terrific, by the way). Me, I’d love to spend even more time in the van with these kids, just to see what else lies in store somewhere down the highway. — Tim RyanAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Boy And The Beast (Bakemono No Ko) (2016)  88%Even casual fans of modern anime have seen&nbsp;director Makoto Shinkai&nbsp;declared “the new Hayao Miyazaki,” as&nbsp;Shinkai’s newest release Your Name&nbsp;becomes Japan’s&nbsp;second-highest grossing film behind Miyazaki’s Spirited Away. But with Your Name not hitting American theaters until 2017, I’m recommending a film you can see&nbsp;right now: The Boy and the Beast by Mamoru Hosada, the other new Miyazaki. Like the master himself, Hosada rose through television ranks (working on Samurai Champloo and Digimon), honing his action storytelling craft into eventual features like the breathless Summer Wars. The&nbsp;Boy and the Beast itself hews close to Spirited Away, a contemporary tale of disaffected youth in Japan who discover portals into an alternate world populated by monsters and fantastic creatures. It’s a showcase for Hosada’s punchy battle sequences and family drama, without excessive sentimentality. — Alex VoAvailable on: AmazonGimme Danger (2016)  95%Gimme Danger is an appreciative look at Iggy and the Stooges, viewed through the loving lens of filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who considers them the greatest band of all time. Even non-devotees will enjoy the Stooges’ story, as told by Iggy Pop (aka Jim Osterberg),&nbsp;his bandmates (including Scott Asheton, Ron Asheton, James Williamson and Steve Mackay), and others close to the group during its rise and fall. Gimme Danger features great footage, excellent music, entertaining interviews, and a surprising amount of humor. Iggy Pop’s memory is a wonder to behold, especially considering everything he’s been through. His detailed recollection of the band’s origin and misadventures take you on a great rock-and-roll journey of a band discovered, lost, and then found again. It’s a great reminder, lest anyone forget, of the sweeping influence that Iggy and The Stooges continue to have to this day. And for those who are lucky enough to be learning about them for the first time, Gimme Danger is a fantastic place to start. — Beki LanePreorder on: AmazonHunt for the Wilderpeople (2016)  97%New Zealand writer, director, and actor Taika Waititi has soared off the radar with releases Boy (2012), What We Do in the Shadows (2015), and this year’s Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Hilarious vampire “documentary” Shadows went straight for the comedy jugular and scored cult status almost immediately. Wilderpeople, about a 12-year-old New Zealand boy in the foster-care system, shares a quirky pathos with 1980s-set Boy. The film stars young newcomer Julian Dennison as the hip-hop loving city kid Ricky Baker, who goes to live in the country with Bella (Rima Te Wiata), a foster mom with a heart of gold, and irascible Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). When events turn and threaten to send him to a foster care institution, Ricky runs away into the bush with Uncle Hec not far behind, kicking off a national manhunt that brings the two closer together. It’ll be interesting to see how Waititi employs his talent for storytelling as director on 2017 superhero release Thor: Ragnarok. And if you haven’t yet seen Boy and What We Do in the Shadows, get to it, you egg. — Debbie DayAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Lobster (2016)  87%This is one of my favorite movies of the year. &nbsp;I’m reluctant to describe much of the plot, because I think there are sublime surprises in this movie. &nbsp;Suffice to say that it may be the darkest and sharpest satire about love and relationships that I’ve ever seen. &nbsp;Colin Farrell gives us a subtly hilarious performance as a man desperate to find love, and there are excellent supporting turns from Rachel Wiesz and John C. Reilly, among others. &nbsp;As the reviews came in, we saw references to Franz Kafka and Charlie Kaufman, which should give you an idea as to what you’re in for. &nbsp;If you like your satire with a generous helping of black humor, you’re going to love this one. — Matt AtchityAvailable on: FandangoNOW, Amazon, Amazon PrimeSing Street (2016)  95%Give John Carney this much: the man knows his niche. With 2007’s Once and 2013’s Begin Again, he demonstrated a talent for telling bittersweet yet ultimately hopeful stories about bruised hearts bonded by music — and as evidenced by this year’s Sing Street, he’s still honing his craft. Set in 1980s Ireland, it uses the travails of a pop-obsessed working-class kid as the solid underpinnings for a coming-of-age drama that’s part early MTV-era jukebox musical, part Commitments-style band picture, and part swooning romance — all bound together by a talented cast and an irresistibly uplifting story that sinks its hooks in you as deep as the effortless homages on its sing-along soundtrack. — Jeff GilesAvailable on: Netflix, FandangoNOW, AmazonSwiss Army Man (2016)  72%Swiss Army Man is one of the best bromantic comedies of the year. It’s Bridget Jones’s Diary if Bridget Jones were a suicidal castaway (played here by Paul Dano), Colin Firth was a girl on a bus (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Jude, Shazza, and Tom were actually just a dead (and kind of gassy) Daniel Radcliffe. It’s a terrific, captivating story about friendship, love, mortality, and catharsis. The directing duo, Daniels, known for their music video for DJ Snake/Lil Jon’s “Turn Down for What,” have found a way to seamlessly weave in and out of humor, sadness, whimsy, and vulnerability. The film — original, musical, and absurd — will take you on a purely imaginative and surreal journey that you’ll continue to think about once the credits have rolled. Yes, it has been dubbed the “farting corpse” movie, but it is well worth your time. — Zoey MooreAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonTrain to Busan (Busanhaeng) (2016)  94%An intense, action-packed zombie story told from a unique and terrifying perspective,&nbsp;Train to Busan&nbsp;revolves around a self-centered businessman who travels with his young daughter to visit her mother, but has his plans (and life) altered by a widespread viral outbreak that infects both passengers and the world around them, forcing him to put aside his selfish behavior and work with the other passengers to survive. Even though it only had a brief theatrical life span in the US, the movie quickly became a smash hit in South Korea, where it’s now the top grossing film of the year, having earned over $80 million in the box office. It’s a “when you think things can’t get worse, be sure that they will” kind of movie that’s guaranteed to entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. —&nbsp;Júlio de OliveiraAvailable on: FandangoNOW, AmazonThe Wailing (Goksung) (2016)  99%He isn’t as well known in the West as Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, The Handmaiden) or Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer), but South Korean director Na Hong-jin made a name for himself with 2008’s The Chaser, and his most recent release, this year’s The Wailing, earned widespread acclaim. The story, about a rural cop investigating a string of mysterious — and possibly supernatural — murders in his small town, takes its time, but never drags, and it successfully pulls off a couple of uncommon feats. First, the beginning&nbsp;of the film is unexpectedly funny, incorporating dry wit and elements of slapstick as two bumbling police officers try to make sense of a grisly murder. But&nbsp;over time, the story&nbsp;sheds its oddball humor and shifts into pure, bloody terror, and the transition is so seamless and effective that you hardly notice it. Second, The Wailing borrows from several genre predecessors, from zombie flicks to The Exorcist, but maintains its own distinct personality, so that you never feel like the film is merely paying lip service to its inspirations. The homages feel organic, and they’re hidden under subtle enough layers that they are recognizable without being obvious. The end of the film does raise some perplexing questions, but that’s what makes it perfect for repeat viewings. It’s well-acted, beautifully shot, atmospheric, funny, a little bizarre, and ultimately chilling, and it’s well worth a watch. — Ryan FujitaniAvailable on: Netflix, FandangoNOW, AmazonWe Are Twisted F***ing Sister! (2016)  80%Most metalheads likely don’t even know the story of Twisted Sister prior to the legendary Stay Hungry album. They were the famous New York headlining heavy metal act that was destined to stay local until the end of time. But TS fought that destiny and their struggle is the highly entertaining focus of this rock doc. The ever-engaging rivalry between band founder Jay Jay French and hired-hand vocalist Dee Snider starts off the story, showing Snider’s quick ability to become the band’s leader once his talent or stamina were questioned. Who knew that telling someone the new song he wrote was “cute” could motivate him to become one of the most famous shaggy-haired metal idols of the time? And when A&amp;R reps from big recording labels are told they’ll be fired if they ever mention the name Twisted Sister again, we — knowing the outcome — can’t help but be amused with an “I told you so” level of anticipation.

Their new creature feature opens with a scene that shocks audiences in ways&nbsp;that echo the Spielberg&nbsp;film’s famous first scene, and even goes one step further, breaking one of the biggest rules of horror (and nope, we’re not saying which).The scene was not in the original screenplay, say co-writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods; it was something Krasinski added himself in the rewrite phase. “I’ve got to give props to John for just being a crazy person,” says Beck. “I think he just really wanted, like, the opening of&nbsp;Jaws — let’s establish this monster right out the gate, and get really, really dark.” Woods adds: “You pull that on an audience and you instill this instinctual fear: These characters are fair game, so watch around every corner.”Is it one of the scariest openings, ever, though? Time will tell — we need a few years and a lot of perspective to make those kinds of calls. For now, we at Rotten Tomatoes have voted on our favorite scary opening scenes up to now, and ranked them according to just how pinned-back-in-our seats we were the first time we saw them.20. My Bloody Valentine (1981)  58%(Photo by © Paramount)This is Quentin Tarantino’s favorite slasher flick and it’s not hard to see why: It’s gruesome as hell. It’s set in a mining town, and the slasher wears a mining get-up and uses mining tools, which means a lot of inventive swinging pickaxes and nail-gun use (so much so that the MPAA had the filmmakers slice out 9 minutes of gore from the original cut). The opening is basic, over in barely two minutes, and may have suffered a touch because of those cuts. But&nbsp;its simplicity and directness is kind of&nbsp;the point: This film isn’t wasting any time, and it didn’t come to play.19. Scream 2 (1997)  81%How did director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson choose to up the ante on awesome openings in this sequel, which is actually slightly higher on the Tomatometer than the original? They showed us that original opening again, this time as a movie-within-the-movie (Stab!), starring Heather Graham as Casey Becker, who had been played in the original by Drew Barrymore. Confused? So is Jada Pinkett Smith’s Maureen, the actual victim of this super-meta opening. She just came out to see a dumb scary movie, and has no idea why her boyfriend&nbsp;has just stabbed her and the audience is doing absolutely nothing about it. Seriously, worst movie theater audience ever.18. Final Destination (2000)  35%(Photo by (c) New Line)Movie rule #96: When a flight steward says it’s going to be fine, you can bet that it really, really isn’t. This opening set the standard for the rest of the Final Destination franchise, and was believed at the time to be inspired by the explosion of TWA Flight 800 in 1996. Like the flight shown in the movie, that real-life 747 was on its way to Paris and carrying high school kids when it blew up shortly after takeoff.17. Final Destination 3 (2006)  44%(Photo by (c) New Line)It’s hard to pick the best of the Final Destination openings — replace plane with car with roller coaster and so on and they’re essentially the same — but the Rotten Tomatoes staff votes have the third installment, starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead, nudging out the others. This time we’re at an amusement park, and the latest set of unlucky teenagers is killed (or not) on a roller coaster. It’s brilliantly staged, zeroing in on virtually every “could it happen?” thought that runs through your mind when&nbsp;strapping into a fast-moving ride:&nbsp;Will the wheels come loose? What if my seat lock comes undone? The film’s Devil’s Flight roller coaster was actually a ride called the Corkscrew in Playland in Vancouver, which was made to look higher — and much deadlier — in post-production.16. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%Nothing really happens in the opening few minutes of Tobe Hooper’s infamous low-budget 1974 horror flick, and yet rarely has a movie evoked so much dread so quickly. There’s that (rather long) text scroll, laying out the movie’s “maybe-based-on-a-true-story” credentials, and then those camera flashes, shocking us to life with grisly images of decomposing eyes and&nbsp;other bits and bobs. Finally, Hooper pans out to reveal a ghastly, barely-human sculpture sat upon a grave marker. Fun fact: The Narrator is none other than John Larroquette, who has said he was paid for his efforts with a marijuana joint.15. 28 Weeks Later... (2007)  71%While 28 Days Later opens in an empty London, its sequel begins in a packed house somewhere in the countryside. We’re quickly introduced to the occupants, a sweet-seeming family and a Walking Dead-style crew of likable survivors. And then all hell breaks loose. It’s not just that director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo throws everything at the scene —&nbsp;“name” actors bite it, Scream-style, and kids are in no way off limits —&nbsp;that makes it such a gut punch. It’s the way the filmmakers upend expectations, particularly when it comes to our “hero”, played by Robert Carlyle. With each choice he makes, he reveals himself to be anything but a Rick Grimes. And frankly, when the dust settles, we’re leaning #TeamZombie.14. Jeepers Creepers (2001)  46%Did you know Victor Salva’s monster flick is based on a true story? Well, the opening scene, in which the Creeper gets into his truck to tail two kids who catch him dumping a victim, was inspired by one. In 1990, Ray and Marie Thornton were driving on a Michigan road when they spotted Dennis DePue dumping what looked like a body behind an abandoned schoolhouse (it turned out to be his wife). In their court testimony, the Thorntons said that DePue proceeded to follow them in his van for miles.13. Black Christmas (1974)  71%(Photo by (c)Warner Bros.)Scream and When A Stranger Calls may have horror-dom’s most famous problem callers, but Black Christmas’s pervy “moaner” is a close runner-up. The film’s opening sequence meanders a little, lurching from one cliché (stalker cam!) to another (hiding in the closet!), with detours into calls with mom and a bit of bathroom boozing. But when the sorority sisters circle around the phone to listen to the stalker —&nbsp;who goes from static-y groans to screechy vulgarities that we won’t repeat here — it’s as transfixing as it is disturbing.12. The Stepfather (1987)  88%(Photo by ©New Century Vista Film)Sometimes seeing the aftermath of a horrible act can be even more terrifying than witnessing the act itself. The opening sequence of The Stepfather is a case in point. With each shot we’re given an awful little breadcrumb clue to what has just happened in this bland-looking suburban home. There’s the blood on Terry O’Quinn’s face. An out-of-place toy boat. A dial tone. And then… We won’t give it away. Director Joseph Ruben would go on to make more chillers in this vein — including Sleeping with the Enemy&nbsp;and The Good Son — but none would come close to creating moments as chilling as The Stepfather’s (very) cold open.11. Piranha (1978)  69%(Photo by ©New Century Vista Film)A couple decides to go skinny dipping at night and it ends badly thanks to something bite-y in the water. Sound familiar? There is a lot that sounds and looks familiar about this Roger Corman-produced answer to Spielberg’s Jaws. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun in its own right —&nbsp;and memorable. A bunch of the Rotten Tomatoes staff saw this one when they were kids, and the opening scene left a mark.10. Ghost Ship (2002)  16%(Photo by (c) Warner Bros.)What’s worse than an iceberg —&nbsp;right ahead? A wire, right onboard. In the best part of this pretty mediocre movie, almost an entire ship’s worth of passengers is wiped out in one fell swoop when a wire snaps and slices across a dance floor packed with revelers. It takes the well-dressed folk a few seconds to realize they’ve all been cut in halves and quarters and thirds (depending on height), and when they do, the makeup department goes to work. Side note: The little girl who survives (she was just short enough to escape) is Emily Browning.9. The Witch (2016)  90%Robert Eggers’ unnerving opening plays on every parent’s —&nbsp;or babysitter’s —&nbsp;greatest fear: A child that vanishes the second you look away. Here, a game of peak-a-boo takes a dark turn when Thomasin’s (Anya Taylor-Joy) baby brother disappears and is then seen in the clutches of a witch. Said witch is then doing something to the baby that we can’t quite make out until… wait, is that a knife?8. 28 Days Later (2003)  87%How exactly did Danny Boyle&nbsp;film in a completely empty —&nbsp;and completely eerie —&nbsp;central London? He had some help from his then teenage daughter, it turns out. Boyle has explained that in lieu of traffic marshals and police, which he couldn’t afford, his daughter and her friends tried to hold back traffic during the seven early mornings over which they shot the sequence.7. Carrie (1976)  93%High school is terrifying, and rarely has it been as terrifying as in the opening sequence of Brian De Palma’s Carrie. The film is no conventional horror flick, and the scene is no conventional horror opening, but its mark is indelible: Just try to wipe the image of a screaming Sissy Spacek begging for help from your memory.6. Dawn of the Dead (2004)  76%Online snarks have said that Dawn of the Dead’s opening seven minutes were the peak of director Zack Snyder’s career. Frankly, they’d be the peak of most directors’ careers as far as we’re concerned. In the absolutely brutal sequence, Sarah Polley’s Ana wakes to discover her neighbor’s daughter is a ravenous zombie (the fast-moving 28 Days Later kind) who isn’t making any sort of distinctions between family and food. Eyes out for the “Here’s Johnny!” nod and ears out for the excellent use of Johnny Cash’s “When the Man Comes Around” over the killer credit sequence. [Editor’s note:&nbsp;This story originally said that Ana woke to find her own daughter was a zombie — we have corrected, and regret, the error.]5. It Follows (2015)  95%It Follows opens with an almost two-minute tracking shot that coldly&nbsp;observes&nbsp;a young girl running for her life on an idyllic suburban street. We eventually join her as she gets in her car and later find her next alone on a beach. Cut to… well, just watch it. There are no big scares or jumps or monsters in these few minutes. The key horror here is mystery: Why is she running? What is she running from? And what the hell did that to her?4. Halloween (1978)  96%(Photo by © Compass International Pictures)John Carpenter told Rotten Tomatoes recently that you have two options for opening a horror film: “You can slow things down, lull people into a false sense of security, and then smack them in the face with it,” or “kick it into gear straight away —&nbsp;let’s go!” For 1978’s Halloween, he went with the latter approach, opening with a stalker-cam single shot that took him and his crew some eight hours to execute.&nbsp;Carpenter says he was inspired by long tracking shots in films like Orson Welles’ Touch of Evil.3. It (2017)  86%Director Tommy Lee Wallace’s 1990 miniseries adaptation of Stephen King’s It doesn’t open with Georgie and Pennywise’s drain-side chat —&nbsp;it begins instead with the disappearance of a little girl and a memorably abandoned tricycle —&nbsp;but it does get to the scene eventually. When the moment does come, Wallace plays it TV safe: We see Tim Curry’s clown bearing his teeth and advancing on his victim before we cut to the next scene. Andy Muschietti takes the road less traveled in his treatment of the scene, which opens 2017’s It, showing Pennywise’s attack on poor Georgie in all of its gory glory. Yes, that’s a child getting his arm chomped off —&nbsp;and Muschietti isn’t letting us look away.2. Scream (1996)  79%Wes Craven’s big comeback film kicked off a slasher revival and gave the horror genre one of its most famous lines (“What’s your favorite scary movie?”). Most of that was thanks to the opening scene, penned by horror fanatic Kevin Williamson, which plays out like a mashup of Jeopardy and the last half hour of Halloween. It was always going to be a nerve-shattering ten minutes; what made it more than that was the casting of Ghostface’s first big target, Casey Becker. Craven said he wanted to have the film’s biggest star die straight out the gate, and had considered offering the role to Alicia Silverstone. But when Drew Barrymore, who was set to&nbsp;take the lead role, said she wanted to do the opening scene, the plan changed and Craven had his “No they didn’t!” moment.1. Jaws (1975)  98%It took a lot of innovating to pull what is arguably cinema’s most famous opening together: Actress and stuntwoman Susan Blacklinie had hooks attached to her Levi’s so that drivers could pull her to and fro to get that jerked-by-a-Great-White effect; Spielberg employed a devastatingly effective predator’s-eye view to put us inside the hungry mind of the shark; and John Williams’ score did the rest of the work. The scene was a direct lift from the opening pages of Peter Benchley’s bestselling book. In those pages, the reader —&nbsp;like Spielberg’s camera —&nbsp;mostly inhabits the perspective of the beast (the opening line reads, “The great fish moves silently through the night.”). On page,&nbsp;the opening scene is as brutal and mysterious an attack as on screen. “At first, the woman thought she had snagged her leg on a rock or a piece of floating wood,” writes Benchley. “There was no initial pain, only one violent tug on her right leg. She reached down to touch her foot, treading water with her left leg to keep her head up, feeling in the blackness with her left hand.” Then comes the kicker: “She could not find her foot.”Which scary opening scene is your favorite?

Below are their selections and why they mean so much to them, beginning with a reflection from TV writer, journalist, and author Maria Lewis.“We are the original storytellers,” Taika Waititi said as he closed out his Oscars acceptance speech when he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in 2020 for Jojo Rabbit. Waititi famously – and by his own admission – talks a lot of s–t. Yet of all the s–t he has talked over the past two decades of his career, this was the most important. Why? Because on arguably Hollywood’s night of nights, up there on a global platform, a man of mixed Māori and Jewish heritage reminded everyone that, for “Pacific Islanders” specifically, telling stories is not just something we do, it’s an integral part of who we are, what we are, and where we come from.It’s currently AAPI – Asian American Pacific Islander – Heritage Month, which is an insanely large acronym to try and group two hugely diverse and complicated ethnicities under, but hey, it’s either this or not being acknowledged you exist… The Pacific Islander term is loaded with a complicated colonial history that is probably best broken down by Kristian Fanene Schmidt in a recent Instagram video. (Kristian’s choices can be found below, too.) For those of you playing at home, essentially it’s meant to refer to every brown person living on any one of the thousands of islands that span from Palau to Easter Island.(Photo by Anita Narbey)It’s a lot of geographical space, it’s a lot of different cultures and beliefs and languages and mythologies and history, and it’s a lot of stories to cram under one “Pacific Islander” tag. Which is why the best way to celebrate the many cinematic accomplishments of such a beautiful and broad expanse of people is not to ask one person, but many, to reflect on the movies that mean the most to them – for each to talk to stories they have connected with and have celebrated, informed by their specific lived cultural experience. Which is what we have done here.As a woman of mixed descent growing up in Australasia, the films that have shaped me, defined me, lured me, are extremely personal and they are not universal, just as “Pacific Islanders” are not universal. They’re films like 2010’s Boy, now one of the lesser-known Waititi joints but a breakthrough at the time for its equal-parts hilarious and heartbreaking portrayal of absentee fathers. They’re films like 1994’s&nbsp;Once Were Warriors, a&nbsp;brutal yet important film not just for the telling of largely untold domestic&nbsp;stories and residual&nbsp;Colonial trauma, but the ripples of opportunity that the film created for talent like Temuera Morrison, a now veteran character actor and vital part of the Star Wars universe, and director Lee Tamahori, the first person of color to direct a film with a budget over $100 million in Bond movie Die Another Day.They’re films like Whale Rider, which brought the work of one of New Zealand’s great novelists, Witi Ihimaera, to the big screen and gave us a still bafflingly great performance from Keisha Castle-Hughes, who became one of the youngest Academy Award nominees for Best Actress when she was just 13 years old. She remains only the second Polynesian actress to be nominated for an acting Academy Award, following Jocelyne LaGarde in her first and only acting role in 1966’s Hawaii. They’re films like Moana, which put an amalgamation of “Pacific Islander” culture on the world stage and gave a generation of children dolls and merchandise and characters that looked like them. For all its imperfect ambition, a glossy Disney animated feature being translated into language is invaluable for the culture now and in the future.(Photo by © Magnolia Pictures)They’re films that have slipped under the radar for many, like Toa Fraser’s heart-racing The Dead Lands, from 2014, which is best described as a Māori Apocalypto and saw its own television adaptation on Shudder just last year. It’s Born To Dance, which in 2015 spotlighted the skill and significance of movement to the culture with the work of Parris Goebel, Tia Maipi, and countless others. It’s even Training Day, maybe weirdly, but for the scene-stealing performance of Cliff Curtis as Hillside Trece gang leader Smiley and what that enabled him to do for the next 20 years as a stealthy Polynesian star in Hollywood and as a producer helping shepherd the next generation of stories like The Dark Horse. It’s the work of Chelsea Winstanely, top to bottom, the first Indigenous woman ever nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award for her work on Jojo Rabbit and her tireless efforts as a storyteller to make sure that those who came before – like Merata Mita – are featured in their own stories, such as the 2018 documentary Merata: How Mum Decolonised the Screen.It’s the Jemaine Clement of it all,&nbsp;infiltrating&nbsp;Hollywood with&nbsp;Flight Of The Conchords, then crafting a very weird and specific legacy with his skills as a&nbsp;musician, as a producer, and as an entirely&nbsp;unpredictable performer who elevates everything he’s in: whether&nbsp;that’s&nbsp;Legion or&nbsp;Men In Black 3. (I said what I said). It’s the award-winning short films by women and about women, like Purea and Hinekura; it’s the rom-coms like Sione’s Wedding; it’s the documentaries like Poi E: The Story of a Song and Dawn Raid that spotlight the impact of our music.It’s endless and infinite, which is why it’s crucial to iceberg this: skim the surface and then plunge deeper based on the suggestions and cinema recommended. Because “Pacific Islander” identity is not one thing, as the career of Dwayne Johnson demonstrates. Hollywood has long struggled to understand what to do with us, but The Rock cemented (sorry) a future where one day an Indigenous kid won’t have to be grateful for the slightest crumb of representation (looking at 13-year-old me, getting pumped over Skinny Pete in The Italian Job remake). They can be a global wrestling superstar, they can be a businessman and a business, man, they can be the franchise savior, they can be the biggest star on the planet, and they can do it all while being proudly one of the “original storytellers.”—Maria Lewis is a best-selling author, screenwriter and film curator13 Pacific Islander Movies that Showcase the Richness and Diversity of Pasifika CinemaOnce Were Warriors (1994) 93%Undoubtedly one of the most important New Zealand films of all time.&nbsp;Once Were Warriors – based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Alan Duff, with a powerful screenplay from Riwia Brown – became such a cultural touchstone that it made international stars out of its central cast (trio of Rena Owen, Temuera Morrison, and Cliff Curtis) and&nbsp;catapulted Lee Tamahori into becoming one of Hollywood’s most sought-after directors. It’s a challenging film to revisit in basically every sense given its brutal portrayal of domestic violence, poverty, sexual assault, suicide, and alcoholism for an urban Māori family. That’s not to say any of these things are untrue, yet such was Once Were&nbsp;Warriors‘ impact, they almost become over-represented and stereotyped on screen in the&nbsp;decade following. An unflinching and uncompromising look at the continued impact Colonialism has on Indigenous peoples globally.—Maria LewisSione's Wedding (Samoan Wedding) (2006) 83%To me, Pacific Islanders have an innate sense of comedy – they never take themselves too seriously and are always up for a laugh. Which is why Sione’s Wedding is so special to me, because it’s the first movie I saw where the story and characters revolved around Polynesians being funny. The premise of the film is simple and of its early 2000s time period: four largely immature friends are banned from their best friend’s wedding unless they can find girlfriends. It’s the Samoan Wedding Crashers meets The Hangover. What could go wrong?–Tali AualiitiaBoy (2012) 88%It always upsets me when someone tells me they’re a Taika Waititi fan, but haven’t seen Boy: It is the best Waititi movie and it’s a hill I will die on. Set in the 1980s, Boy centers on an 11-year-old Michael Jackson fan desperately seeking the approval of his criminal father, who re-enters his life to collect a stash of money he hid before going to jail. Of course it’s funny, but there are also moments of incredible innocence and vulnerability that make this well-rounded movie both a joy and a heartbreak to watch. Come for the laughs, stay for the Māorified version of Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” dance complete with haka and poi.–Tali AualiitiaMoana (2016) 95%I&nbsp;would be remiss not to talk about Disney’s Moana. Set in Ancient Polynesia, the movie tells the story of Moana, who must enlist the help of demigod Maui to lift the curse on her island by navigating the oceans and restoring the heart of Te Fiti. Yes, it’s inclusive Disney. Yes, it’s got a powerful strong independent female lead. But for me, it’s the music. Disney enlisted music group Te Vaka’s Opetaia Foa’i to be the voice of the Pacific, and listening to Foa’i open “We Know the Way” in Samoan instantly made it feel new and exciting, but also home and familiar. Also, the movie serves as a constant reminder that my ancestors navigated the oceans using the stars while I can barely get Google Maps to work.–Tali AualiitiaIsland Soldier (2017)In being given the task to help create a “Guide to Films from the Pacific Islands,” I wanted to be very intentional in amplifying lesser known voices and issues. While Island Soldier wasn’t directed by a Pacific Islander, it is an important documentary that gives viewers a reliable insight into the exploitative and destructive nature of US militarism in the Pacific, specifically Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia. It’s becoming more and more common for this type of content to be what tips the scales in changing policy, so I encourage audiences to take the time and educate themselves by watching stories like this one and Anote’s Ark, on climate change in Kiribati, as well as Out Of State, on addiction and incarceration in Hawai’i, all of which share colonization and capitalism as the root of our problems. These are just some of our realities that don’t get the attention and certainly not the reparation they deserve.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtVai (2019) 100%Released in 2019, Vai is a beautiful collection of eight shorts spanning the Pacific, tied together by a common thread of mana wahine. What I love most about this film is that in addition to being directed by nine Pacific women, we get to see dark-skinned grandmas, mothers, daughters, and sisters in such fullness and beauty, thanks to Solomon Islands filmmaker Matasila Freshwater and Fijian filmmakers the Whippy Sisters, respectively. Due to colorism that permeates every nation, Melanesians often get erased and excluded from Pacific discourse, so I’m looking forward to seeing more content like this and the Vanuatu love story Tanna! Vai is actually a follow-up to another great movie showcasing eight Māori women directors, Waru. Be sure to watch them together, and keep an eye out for a third installment with a focus on our Aboriginal whānau coming soon.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtKumu Hina (2013)Kumu Hina&nbsp;follows the life of Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu, a Native Hawaiian activist and teacher (and also the Haku Mo’olelo and narrator of this documentary). As a queer Samoan, I would be remiss not to include a narrative that speaks to the diversity in gender expression and sexuality in the Pacific that has long been demonized and outlawed because of the church and colonization. Hina is māhū, and while some māhū may identify as trans or nonbinary, I’m going to resist labeling her as such because not all do. (The trouble with using Western terms to describe Indigenous peoples is that they do not necessarily relate to them nor are they neat translations.) Navigating a world she seldom finds acceptance in, Hina is steeped firmly in her role as a cultural and spiritual leader, fighting for her people while holding true to who she is. We’re now starting to see a rise of queer Pacific content, as evidenced by another documentary made by the same creators,&nbsp;Leitis in Waiting, along with the animated short&nbsp;Kapaemahu, in which Hina serves as both a directer and producer. Hopefully there’ll be more to come.–Kristian Fanene SchmidtPatu! (1983)This year marks the 40th anniversary of the South African Springboks 1981 Rugby Tour of New Zealand – a tour met by huge anti-Apartheid protests in NZ – and it’s time to remember this watershed of mass civil disobedience. It’s also timely to remember and honor the Māori woman, single mum, self-taught filmmaker, activist and teacher, and global Indigenous film icon, Merata Mita, and how she captured on film one of the most essential documents of civil unrest in cinema history. Māori cinema exists because of her. PATU! reminds me as a Polynesian Māori woman just what Merata sacrificed and how she and a handful of creatives bravely ushered in a new age of Māori nationalism using celluloid to tell our stories. Manaaka me te Honore.–Sonja HammerNo. 2 (Naming Number Two) (2008) 58%This is Toa Fraser’s cinematic love letter to his Fijian matriarchal culture, another part of Pasifika that is rarely represented in cinema. The film is set in the largest Polynesian city on the planet, Auckland, aka Tamaki Makaurau, “The Place of Many Lovers.” Twenty years ago, every language from Te Moana-A-Kiwa (Māori for the Pacific Ocean) could be heard in its inner-city suburbs, like Ponsonby, Grey Lynn, Freemans Bay, and Toa’s own Mount Roskill – where the filmmaker grew up and the film is set – with Tongans, Samoans, Tokelauans, Niuean, Kuki Airani, and Fijian voices. These groups, once labelled as “overstayers” and FOBs ( “Fresh off the Boats” ), today are the blended cultures of post colonial Aotearoa. Toa’s on-screen neighborhood re-imagines those Islander communities I remember where beautiful elder matriarchs like Nanna Maria – the matriarch of the Fijian family in the film – sustained them with bounties of kai and plenty of aroha.–Sonja HammerThe Orator (OLe Tulafale) (2011)This legendary film made by a Samoan, spoken in Samoan, explores the Fa’a Samoa way of life. Director Tusi Tamasese’s debut is the tale of a taro farmer, Saili, a little person who exists along with his banished wife Vaaiga and daughter as outsiders, ridiculed and stalked by nearby villagers. A showdown between the chiefly hierarchy of the village and Saili comes in the form of an oratory face off. The movie’s lingering pace and profound depth of emotion – along with its authentic sense of “Island Time” – signaled that a new age had arrived in Pasifika cinema: stories about us, told through our ways of seeing.–Sonja HammerTongan Ninja (2002)Okay, disclaimer: my heritage is Tongan. So, you know, there is an obvious bias here. But any movie with “Tonga” or “Tongan” in the title? I’m there watching it and supporting it from the jump. Sure, this New Zealand-made movie may not be up there with cinematic greats like Whale Rider or Boy, but its low-budget charm and slapstick comedy does give you a hearty chuckle. Oh, and speaking of Boy, see if you can spot a super-young Taika Waititi playing a cook in the kitchen scene.–Hau LatukefuThe Legend of Baron To'a (2020) 100%Another disclaimer: the actor in the lead role, Uli Latukefu, is my little brother. Regardless, this is a gem of a movie. Also filmed in New Zealand, The Legend of Baron To’a is a story of love, loyalty, and legacy, following the story of a man who must recover his father’s championship wrestling belt after it is stolen. The humor is on point, so too the emotional beats, which is important because those dual elements are what make up your your average Pacific Islander. Laughing one minute, crying the next.–Hau LatukefuFor My Father's Kingdom (2019)A genuine heartstring-puller. If you’re like myself, a child born outside of the islands and whose father still has a strong connection and responsibility to the homeland, then you will relate to this. As a matter of fact, you don’t have to be from the islands to feel this one: the message is universal and specific at the same time. At its core, My Father’s Kingdom explores the culture clashes that generations experience when growing up between two different worlds. Misunderstanding and miscommunication can strain relationships, and the film makes you feel that sense of frustration and hurt when watching the families go through it. Yet in the end, like all family stories, there’s still a lot of love.–Hau LatukefuMeet the Contributors:Maria Lewis is an author, journalist, screenwriter, and film curator based in Australia.

Plus, we’ve got some notable smaller releases, including an Oscar-nominated animation, a well-received David Gordon Green drama starring Nic Cage, and a handful of other indie films. Read on for details:The LEGO Movie 96%The LEGO Movie could have easily turned into a 100-minute toy commercial, but in the capable hands of co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street), it became a loving tribute to the power of imagination. Chris Pratt voices Emmet, an everyman LEGO figure who stumbles into the role of LEGO savior when a mystical object fuses itself to his back. With the help of an eclectic team of “builders,” Emmett attempts to foil the nefarious plans of the evil President Business (Will Ferrell). Critics were positively charmed by The LEGO Movie, rewarding it with a Certified Fresh 96% on the Tomatometer thanks to imaginative animation, a hilarious script, and a surprisingly thoughtful conclusion. The Blu-ray includes a funny and informative commentary track featuring the directors, Pratt, Will Arnett, Charlie Day, and Alison Brie; a couple of making-of featurettes; and lots of short video tidbits, including an “Everything Is Awesome” sing-along. If you opt for the “Everything Is Awesome” Edition, you’ll also get the 3D version of the film, a 3D cast of Emmet’s face, a LEGO figurine of Vitruvius, and an exclusive “Meet the LEGO Builders” featurette.The Grand Budapest Hotel 92%A story within a story within a story, The Grand Budapest Hotel recounts the tale of Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes), the charismatic concierge of a luxurious mountain hotel who frequently offers his “services” to wealthy aging women. When one of them (Tilda Swinton) dies and leaves Gustave a precious painting in her will, her family becomes irate and attempts — by any means necessary — to retrieve the painting. Critics declared Grand Budapest — Certified Fresh at 92% — another triumph for Wes Anderson, replete with his trademark visual flourishes, wry wit, and a sprawling cast full of veterans like Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, and many more. The Blu-ray includes three featurettes, three short vignettes to accompany the film, and a 4-minute short following Bill Murray as he tours the various film shoot locations.Ernest &amp; Célestine 98%One of this year’s ill-fated nominees for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, Ernest &amp; Célestine is a French-Belgian animated film that takes place in a world populated by anthropomorphized bears (who live above ground) and mice (who live below). All young mice are taught that they are a choice snack for bears, but when a young orphan named Célestine is separated from her peers and encounters a hungry bear named Ernest, the two form an unlikely bond. Though the original film is voiced in French, American audiences were treated to a cast that included Paul Giamatti, Lauren Bacall, William H. Macy, and, in the lead roles, Forest Whitaker (Ernest) and Mackenzie Foy (Célestine). Critics were positively charmed by Ernest &amp; Célestine, calling its story sweet and its old-fashioned visual aesthetic delightful. The main bonus features are a 52-minute long making-of doc and a feature-length animatic (essentially a storyboard recreation of the film).House of Cards – Season TwoNetflix had itself a bona fide hit with House of Cards, whose first season ended with Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood accepting the post of Vice President while journalists Zoe, Lucas, and Janine (Kate Mara, Sebastian Arcelus, and Constance Zimmer) probed deeper into his shady activities. Season two finds Frank eager to remove himself even further from any possible scandal, as he deftly continues to manipulate his way up the chain of power. Critics rated this most recent season Certified Fresh at 85% on the Tomatometer, noting that the series continued to deliver the kinds of powerful performances, strong writing, and crisp cinematography typical of contemporary premium cable drama. Extras on the season boxset include a glimpse of the show’s table reads and featurettes covering the differences between the series and the original 1990s British miniseries that inspired it, Frank’s habit of breaking the fourth wall, and more.Also available this week:David Gordon Green’s Joe (83%), starring Nicolas Cage and Tye Sheridan in a Certified Fresh drama about an ex-con who befriends a teen and becomes his protector.The Machine (78%), a sci-fi thriller about two programmers who create a self-aware AI, only to have it commandeered by the government.Walk of Shame (13%), starring Elizabeth Banks and James Marsden in a comedy about a news reporter who gets stranded in the wrong part of town after a drunken one-night stand.Authors Anonymous (7%), starring Kaley Cuoco and Chris Klein in a comedy about a support group for unpublished authors whose members are rankled when one of them becomes an overnight success.And lastly, a whopping three releases from the Criterion Collection: Georges Franju’s 1963 crime thriller Judex (100%) is available for the first time in a DVD/Blu-ray combo pack, and Peter Weir’s Picnic at Hanging Rock (94%) and Peter Davis’s documentary Hearts and Minds both get new DVD/Blu-ray re-releases. Also, an additional note for all of your Criterion aficionados out there: As per a recent announcement, The Criterion Collection will resume separate DVD and Blu-ray packages, beginning with their September releases later this year.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Super, horror, comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-lego-movie-and-the-grand-budapest-hotel"},{"id":"47612875503949","title":"New on DVD & Blu-Ray: Edge of Tomorrow, Million Dollar Arm, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Edge of Tomorrow, Million Dollar Arm, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | October 6, 2014 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a well-received sci-fi actioner starring Tom Cruise, a feelgood sports drama starring Jon Hamm, and a western spoof starring Seth MacFarlane. Then, we’ve got loads of TV and number of noteworthy indie films, as well as a Disney classic fresh from the vault. Read on for details:Live. Die. Repeat./Edge of Tomorrow 91%Based on the popular Japanese novella All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka, Edge of Tomorrow (or, alternately, Live. Die. Repeat.) was one of the early surprise hits of this summer. Tom Cruise stars as William Cage, a military PR man who finds himself thrown into the heat of battle in a suicide mission. Through a chance encounter on the battlefield, Cage discovers he can relive the day over and over each time he?s killed, and uses the opportunity to team up with a veteran soldier (Emily Blunt), train, and change the outcome of the war. Though the premise could have quickly worn out its welcome, critics found the film quite clever and surprisingly funny, and thanks to solid performances from Cruise, Blunt, and a strong supporting cast, Edge of Tomorrow thrilled its way to a Certified Fresh 90 percent on the Tomatometer. The DVD/Blu-ray combo pack includes three featurettes on the armor worn in the movie, the aliens, and the pivotal battle sequence; a short doc on the making of the film; and a handful of deleted scenes. (If you’re wondering why the title is listed that way, that’s pretty much how it’s written on the packaging.)Million Dollar Arm 65%Jon Hamm is certainly a charming fellow, so it makes sense to tap his font of likability for a feelgood based-on-true-events sports drama like Million Dollar Arm. Part underdog tale, part fish-out-of-water comedy, Arm follows struggling sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) as he travels to India to recruit the country?s best cricket bowlers as prospective pitchers in the MLB. He finds two potential winners and brings them back to the US in hopes of prepping them for the big leagues. The themes at play are familiar, and Million Dollar Arm hits all the right story beats of its genre; for some critics, this made the film too predictable to enjoy, but others were willing to overlook that for Hamm’s good guy charisma and the film’s overall pleasantness. The Blu-ray includes a look at the actors’ training sequence, a profile of the real events of the story, outtakes, deleted scenes, and more.A Million Ways to Die in the West 33%Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane made his big screen directorial debut with Ted, a live action comedy that nevertheless found MacFarlane voicing the titular stuffed bear, and the result was a sizable hit. Earlier this year, MacFarlane directed himself in the flesh for the first time in the western spoof A Million Ways to Die in the West, and the result was less impressive. When a timid sheep farmer loses his girlfriend after he backs out of a duel, he befriends a beautiful newcomer (Charlize Theron) to the town who helps him discover his courage. The only problem is, said beautiful newcomer is the main squeeze of the most dastardly outlaw (Liam Neeson) around, and he don’t like nobody touchin’ his lady. Critics acknowledged the talented cast MacFarlane was able to assemble, but lamented its overlong, meandering plot and hit-or-miss juvenile gags, resulting in a disappointing 33 percent Tomatometer. Bonus features include an alternate opening and ending, alternate scenes, a gag reel, a commentary track, and a look behind the scenes.Also available this week:Disney is releasing a new Diamond Edition DVD and Blu-ray of Sleeping Beauty (92 percent), for those who may have missed it the last time it made its way out of the vault.To Be Takei (90 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary profiling the charismatic Star Trek actor, political activist, and social media icon.Obvious Child (88 percent), starring Jenny Slate in a Certified Fresh comedy about a young stand-up comic dealing with the loss of her job, a breakup, and a new pregnancy all at once.Supermensch: The Legend of Shep Gordon (76 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary chronicling the career of the influential talent manager.Sharknado 2: The Second One (56 percent), starring Ian Ziering and Tara Reid in the follow-up to the wildly popular Syfy shlock movie about a tornado full of sharks.Season two of The History Channel’s first foray into fiction storytelling, the historical adventure series Vikings (92 percent) is available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season two of A&amp;E’s Psycho spinoff/prequel Bates Motel (86 percent) is also available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season three of Ryan Murphy’s horror anthology series American Horror Story (81 percent), subtitled “Coven” and focusing on witches, is also available on DVD and Blu-ray.Season six of The Following (47 percent) is available on DVD and Blu-ray.Psych: The Complete Series is available in a 31-disc DVD collection and comes with a ton of bonus features on every disc.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Pacific, Awards, Cinematographers, franchise, Logo, Mindy, jamie, Grammys, New, scene, Countdown, Company, Turner, awards, Unbreakable","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-edge-of-tomorrow-million-dollar-arm-and-more"},{"id":"47612921742686","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Warm Bodies and A Good Day to Die Hard","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Warm Bodies and A Good Day to Die HardPlus, a road trip comedy, an animated flop, and few worthwhile collections.by Ryan Fujitani | June 4, 2013 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got one big franchise blockbuster and a Certified Fresh comedy, plus two more big releases that didn’t fare so well with critics. On top of that, our reissues this week are fairly impressive, even if a lot of them are films you may already own. See below for this week’s ultra-short list.A Good Day to Die Hard 14%The original Die Hard is considered by more than a few to be the greatest action film ever made, and when the franchise was brought back to life in 2007 after a 12-year hiatus, many were surprised by how good it was. Unfortunately, this year’s follow-up to that film, A Good Day to Die Hard, left most wishing the series would just (ahem) die already. Bruce Willis reprises his role as supercop John McClane, who heads over to Russia after learning his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) is in trouble with the law. Before father and son are properly reunited, however, they’re thrust into the middle of a violent political conspiracy whose agents chase them across Eastern Europe. A Good Day jumps right into the action and rarely lets up, but for the most part, critics found it tiresome and full of predictable clichés. At 15% on the Tomatometer, it’s the lowest-rated installment of the franchise, and probably won’t do much for anyone looking for a decent story to go along with their explosions.Warm Bodies 81%Over the past several years, romantic comedies have earned a reputation for uninspired cookie-cutter storytelling and vapid, one-dimensional characters, so it’s always refreshing to see a new spin on the genre. Warm Bodies, based on the novel by Isaac Marion, comedically explores the post-apocalyptic star-crossed love between a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) and a young zombie who goes by “R” (Nicholas Hoult). R and his fellow zombies retain bits of humanity within them, and after being initially drawn to Julie, repeated interactions with her begin to bring him back from the dark side, so to speak. Directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50) and co-starring Rob Corddry, John Malkovich, and Dave Franco, Warm Bodies charmed a good number of critics, who called it surprisingly sweet and praised the cast for immersive performances. Certified Fresh at 80%, this isn’t your average rom-com, but it’s all the better for it.Identity Thief 19%Jason Bateman hasn’t had the best of luck at the multiplex recently, at least in his starring roles, and Melissa McCarthy hasn’t fared much better, which is troubling considering how likable both of them are. Putting them together in Identity Thief, unfortunately, didn’t pan out quite the way they’d hoped. Bateman plays Sandy Patterson, unwitting victim of identity fraud when a Florida woman named Diana (McCarthy) assumes “Sandy” is a woman and begins living the lavish life on Sandy’s funds. When criminal charges begin showing up on Sandy’s record, he drives down to Miami to confront Diana and bring her back to clear his name. As you might expect, both stars do their best with the material they’re given here, but they’re able to wring precious few laughs from the film’s meandering script and plot contrivances. It currently sits at 20% on the Tomatometer, which is a disappointment for all involved.Escape From Planet Earth 35%Rainmaker Entertainment’s biggest claims to fame to date are probably the popular Transformers TV series Beast Wars and the number of Barbie-themed movies they’ve produced for Mattel, but this year they tried their hand at a feature-length animated film with Escape From Planet Earth. Anchored by the voice talents of Brendan Fraser, Ricky Gervais, Jessica Alba, Rob Corddry, Sofia Vergara, and more, the film focuses on the efforts of an alien astronaut named Scorch (Fraser) from the planet Baab, who is sent to Earth (the “Dark Planet”) to trace the origins of a mysterious SOS call. When Scorch goes missing, his pal Gary (Corddry) mounts a rescue mission; cue lots of fish-out-of-water humor and Area 51-related gags. The animation and artwork is all great to look at, many critic concede, but Escape simply relies on too many elements we’ve seen before in better movies. At 26%, this might work as a colorful distraction for the kids, but don’t expect to be similarly enthralled if you’re old enough to vote, and don’t expect Rainmaker to be competing with the likes of Pixar or Dreamworks anytime soon.Also available this week:Warner Bros. has a couple of new Blu-ray sets, the first of which is a collection of the beloved Mad Max trilogy: Mad Max (1979, 95%), Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981, 100%), and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985, 81%).The second WB collection is a boxset of 20 Clint Eastwood films, ranging from his starring roles in Pale Rider (1985, 92%) and Dirty Harry (1971, 95%) to his directorial efforts like Mystic River (2003, 87%) and Letters From Iwo Jima (2006, 91%). Included in the set are also more recent films like Invictus (2009, 76%) and Trouble With the Curve (2012, 52%), as well as two feature-length documentaries: The Eastwood Factor and Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story.Likewise, Universal is also putting out a good number of reissues this week, beginning with a Blu-ray set titled Alfred Hitchcock: The Essentials Collection. The set includes five of Hitchcock’s most celebrated films — Psycho (1960, 97%), Rear Window (1954, 100%), North by Northwest (1959, 100%), Vertigo (1958, 98%), and The Birds (1963, 96%) — and a quite a hefty helping of bonus features.Universal is also offering new Blu-rays of a handful of its classic creature features, including The Invisible Man (1933, 100%), The Mummy (1932, 92%), and Creature From the Black Lagoon (1954, 83%).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Holidays","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-warm-bodies-and-a-good-day-to-die-hard"},{"id":"47612877083982","title":"New on DVD & Blu-Ray: John Wick, Dracula Untold, Ouija, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: John Wick, Dracula Untold, Ouija, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | February 2, 2015 |  CommentsThe biggest home video release this week is a surprisingly satisfying action flick starring Keanu Reeves, but outside of that, most of the big releases received pretty poor reviews. That said, the smaller films on this week’s list are the real highlights, with three acclaimed Certified Fresh picks and another trio of highly rated films. Read on for details:John Wick 86%John Wick is about as pure a revenge flick as you’re going to get, and critics were quite pleased with that. The story is simple: Keanu Reeves plays the titular former mob hitman, who’s mourning the death of his wife when the son of a local kingpin breaks into his home, kills his new puppy, and steals his car. This is the last straw for Wick, and he unleashes a most brutal temper tantrum upon anyone foolish enough to stand between him and the puppy-killing car thief. Directed by longtime stuntmen Chad Stahelski and David Leitch, John Wick is a stylish flurry of point blank shots to the face and brooding Keanu Reeves grimaces, and for most critics, the combination was a match made in heaven. Toss in a bit of the much talked-about “world-building” and a colorful cast of side characters, and you have the makings of an action franchise. At 83 percent on the Tomatometer, John Wick surprised a lot of folks and even took home the Golden Tomato Award in the Action/Adventure category.Dracula Untold 25%Though ostensibly not part of Universal’s plan to reboot all of their classic monsters in a shared universe (kind of like The Avengers of horror), Dracula Untold doesn’t bode well for the studio’s future efforts in the genre. Untold purports to tell the “origin story” of the famous literary bloodsucker, in which Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans), the prince of Transylvania, enters into a blood pact with a vampire to receive the power necessary to turn back a Turkish invasion and save his son. Critics didn’t buy it, for the most part; while the visuals were sometimes impressive, they also tended toward bad video game imagery, and the narrative lacked both the edge and the necessary dramatic heft to justify its epic scope. At 22 percent on the Tomatometer, Dracula Untold is a poor attempt to put a fresh spin on a familiar tale.Ouija 6%As long as you’ve got a working knowledge of horror movie mechanics, a decent cinematographer, and a few million dollars to spare, you stand a chance at making a tidy profit, regardless of what the critics say. At least, that was the case for last year’s Ouija, which was produced for about $5 million and earned a mere 7 percent on the Tomatometer but went on to gross over $95 million at the box office. This PG-13 tale of terror revolves around a group of young friends who use a Ouija board to make contact with a malicious spirit; as the participants of the original séance begin dropping one by one, the remaining survivors struggle to identify the spectre and figure out a way to defeat it. Critics found the film egregiously derivative of better movies, filled with telegraphed jump scares and bland storytelling, even if it did sport a nice professional sheen. This is probably the kind of fluff that teen horror novices might eagerly devour and quickly forget, but more discerning adults will find little in the way of a real scare here.The Best of Me 12%Don’t look now, but they’ve gone and made another Nicholas Sparks adaptation, and following recent tradition, it did not perform well with critics. At all. This would-be tearjerker stars James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan as star-crossed teenage lovers Dawson and Amanda, who are reunited after 20 years apart when a mutual friend passes away. Between flashbacks to their past relationship, the pair rekindle their romance, only to discover it’s not so easy to shake off the past and move forward. By now, most folks know where they stand with Sparks’s weepy formula, and critics agree that if you’re a fan, you’re in for more of the same, and you’ll likely be pretty satisfied with the final product. If you’re anyone else, though, you probably already know you’re going to avoid this like a snotty handkerchief, so the 8 percent Tomatometer score is somewhat irrelevant.Also available this week:Nas: Time Is Illmatic (100 percent), a documentary about the prolific and influential hip-hop artist and the creation of his seminal debut album.Starred Up (99 percent), starring Jack O’Connell and Ben Mendelsohn in a Certified Fresh drama about a violent 19-year-old inmate who is transferred to the same prison as his estranged father.The Overnighters (98 percent), a Certified Fresh documentary focusing on the rush to find jobs during the North Dakota oil boom and the hardships experienced by prospective workers there.Dear White People (92 percent), a Certified Fresh satire of race politics about a mixed-race writer and radio show host at a mostly white university who causes a stir when she becomes the head of the all black house on campus.The Retrieval (34 percent), a Civil War-set drama about a 13-year-old boy working with white bounty hunters who unexpectedly finds himself on the run with a runaway slave after he’s been sent to lure him back to the South.ABCs of Death 2 (75 percent), the follow-up omnibus film featuring 26 horror segments — one for each letter of the alphabet — helmed by 26 different directors.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Elton, Animation, foreign, News","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-john-wick-dracula-untold-ouija-and-more"},{"id":"47612931252577","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: The Wolf of Wall Street, Delivery Man, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: The Wolf of Wall Street, Delivery Man, and MoreAn Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film and a handful of smaller movies complete the list.by Ryan Fujitani | March 25, 2014 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a couple of Oscar nominees (only one of which, unfortunately, took home a trophy) and a sweet but predictable comedy starring Vince Vaughn. Then we’ve got the latest seasons of Californication and Veep, as well as a handful of smaller films, including a couple of actioners starring old school stars. Read on for the full list:The Wolf of Wall Street 79%Back in the late 1980s and 1990s, a charismatic, ambitious, and ultimately greedy young man named Jordan Belfort made gobs and gobs of money as a stockbroker before he went to jail and served 22 months for fraud. Somewhat timely in its subject matter, Martin Scorsese’s latest film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Belfort, chronicling every sleazy aspect of Belfort’s rags-to-riches story in glorious, uproarious detail. Though it courted some controversy and drew some criticism for its assorted debaucherous depictions of sex, drug use, and animal-related shenanigans, most critics found room to praise DiCaprio and Jonah Hill in particular for a couple of brazen performances, and both of them earned Oscar nods (DiCaprio for Best Actor, Hill for Best Supporting Actor) for their efforts. Wolf earned three more nominations — for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay — and though it didn’t take home any hardware on Oscar night, it’s Certified Fresh at 77%, and critics say it’s yet another winning collaboration between Scorsese and DiCaprio.The Great Beauty 91%The second of the Criterion Collection’s contemporary home video releases this year comes in the form of the Italian winner of this year’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, The Great Beauty. Paolo Sorrentino’s thoughtful, sensuous film has drawn comparisons to the work of Federico Fellini, which is understandable: its central figure, successful one-time novelist Jep Gambardella (Toni Servillo), is a charming fixture in Rome’s social scene who, on the night of his 65th birthday, finds himself wandering the city streets and reflecting on his life. The result is a timeless portrait of Rome and its nightlife, framed by gorgeous cinematography and backed by an evocative score. Though critics concede The Great Beauty‘s strengths lie in its lush, stylish images rather than its narrative, most found the visuals so striking that they overcame any thematic shortcomings, and the film sits at a Certified Fresh 91% on the Tomatometer. The Criterion DVD/Blu-ray combo includes interviews with Sorrentino, Servillo, and co-writer Umberto Contarello, as well as some deleted scenes.Delivery Man 40%Vince Vaughn’s a pretty likable guy, and he often uses that to his advantage, playing characters we might otherwise find annoying in real life but for the fact that he’s just so charming. In Delivery Man, a remake of Canadian film Starbuck, Vaughn plays David Wozniak, a delivery man (of course) for his family’s butcher shop who discovers he’s fathered 533 children via sperm donations he made in college, and that 142 of them have filed a lawsuit demanding his identity be revealed. Unfortunately for Vaughn, his relatable everyman persona only went so far in Delivery Man, as critics couldn’t help but compare the film to its source material and found a bit too predictable and schmaltzy to measure up. At 39% on the Tomatometer, it isn’t a big winner by any means, but if you’re just looking for something super sweet and you don’t mind a bit of telegraphed comedy, this might make a good rental.Also available this week:The Punk Singer (83%), a documentary about Kathleen Hanna, the lead singer of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre who became a feminist icon.Odd Thomas (34%), starring Anton Yelchin in a Dean Koontz novel adaptation about a fry cook who can see dead people and leaps into action to thwart an apocalyptic evil who’s arrived in his small town.The Truth About Emanuel (28%), starring Jessica Biel and Alfred Molina in a thriller about a woman who becomes obsessed with her new neighbor, who looks just like her dead mother.Welcome to the Jungle (25%), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme in an action comedy about a corporate retreat in the wilderness gone awry.Walking with Dinosaurs (25%), a CGI film based on the BBC Earth series of the same name, featuring dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous period.Season two of HBO’s Veep (83%), starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus in a comedy about the trials of a put-upon female vice president and her eccentric staff.Season six of Showtime’s Californication, starring David Duchovny as a lecherous, alcoholic novelist trying to navigate his various relationships.And in addition to The Great Beauty, the Criterion Collection is also releasing new DVD/Blu-ray combo packs of Ingmar Bergman’s Persona (92%) and the 1925 Harold Lloyd film The Freshman (88%).","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Exclusive, dark, Watching, of, 2021, nightmare, Black, Month, 4/20, thriller, Video, documentary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-wolf-of-wall-street-delivery-man-and-more"},{"id":"47612934208866","title":"Robert Englund’s Stuck-At-Home Binge Guide: True Terrors and Fairy Tales to Watch Now","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Robert Englund's Stuck-At-Home Binge Guide: True Terrors and Fairy Tales to Watch NowOne, two, Freddy's coming for you... with some excellent creepy recommendations for what to watch while you're hanging at the homestead.by Aaron Pruner | March 18, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Travel Channel)Social distancing can be a nightmare.

The 72-year-old actor pivots from the world of horror fiction to that of bizarre fact when he begins his run as host of&nbsp;Travel Channel’s&nbsp;new historical anthology series, True Terror With Robert Englund.Featuring reenactments of news articles and tabloid stories from the 19th and early 20th centuries, Englund describes the new series as Unsolved Mysteries meets Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, and with tales that include Teddy Roosevelt’s Sasquatch sighting to the rampage of New Orleans’&nbsp;Axeman — the serial killer was portrayed by Danny Huston in American Horror Story: Coven — it’s easy to see that some of these stories&nbsp;will get pretty wild.Englund acts as the narrative glue to the series.“I bring a little bit of my Vincent Price attitude and with the little bits of the Rod Serling rhythms in the writing that I get to play with, we kind of echo Unsolved Mysteries, but for a 21st-century audience with 21st-century sensibilities,” he told&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes. “What does that creepy, that underbelly, that dark side mean to a more contemporary audience as opposed to a more innocent audience back in the day?”He may be known for portraying monsters and killers on the big screen, but much like contemporary audiences the world over, Englund is a fan of binge-watching. And of the many genres available at the click of a button, Nordic criminal dramas (like Bordertown) is one of his absolute favorites.“I love Scandinavian serial killer shows,” he said. “Or as I call them, ‘Blood and Snow with Volvos.’ They’re always really dark and really good.”Read on for&nbsp;Englund’s bingeable list of&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;programming.Parasite (Gisaengchung) (2019)  98%I use subtitles when I’m watching those Scandinavian shows, or a favorite like Peaky Blinders, whenever there’s access, because I want to learn the names, especially if they’re foreign names. It’s really opened a whole new world to me. I think that was something we all learned from the Oscars. You know, when Bong Joon-ho was so grateful for people using their subtitles for Parasite. People aren’t afraid of subtitles anymore. I love that movie, and I wouldn’t want to miss that for the world.Blue Ruin (2014)  96%Blue Ruin, oh man.&nbsp;It’s directed by Jeremy Saulnier, and just — oh my god, this guy! He’s got some great stuff, this guy. He’s working with a whole group of people out of North Carolina that are just making some extraordinary stuff. They’re really talented people.Penny Dreadful  91%The English series takes place in turn-of-the-century London. It has Dorian Gray, Dracula and Renfield, the Wolfman, and Dr. Frankenstein — along with both of his Frankenstein creations — and they’re all in Jack the Ripper London, together. It’s with Eva Green, and it’s just phenomenal.Hold the Dark (2018)  70%The dark little horror movie is, I think, maybe a year/a year-and-a-half old. Jeffrey Wright&nbsp;from Westworld&nbsp;is the star. And it’s got Alexander Skarsgård, the guy from True Blood and Big Little Lies. So it’s got that guy, Jeffrey Wright, and the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, Riley Keough. Skarsgård and Keough are a white-trash couple living in a trailer park on this Indian Reservation in Alaska. They’ve been indoctrinated, seduced, and recruited into a Native American wolf cult. To keep their child out of the cult, they send for Jeffrey Wright, who’s an expert at this type of stuff. It’s this amazing, dark, crazy movie. And it’s like nobody’s seen it but me. It has the single best shootout in the history of American cinema — or the history of cinema period.Carnival Row  56%I’m surprised that more of the Harry Potter&nbsp;fans, the Game of Thrones&nbsp;fans, the Lord of the Rings fans, and the fantasy fans haven’t been attracted to this show. What’s it about? Well let me put it this way: “fairy” is a dirty word on the show. So it’s a world where fairies are real, but they’re like slaves. It’s this kind of industrial, rebellious, steampunk world. It has humans and it has fairies, and it has another caste of people who have ram’s horns on their heads.Hinterland I just started watching this weird, dark, Welsh one. It’s about a London cop who’s the fish out of water. And he’s got some secrets that we don’t really know yet, but everybody’s very, very real. And it’s real creepy, incestuous, and strange.True Terror with Robert Englund premieres&nbsp;Wednesday, March 18 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on the Travel Channel","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"dramedy, Sundance, space, know, Arts, america","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"true-terror-robert-englund-binge-guide"},{"id":"47613014440319","title":"RT’s Oscar Picks 2013 – Results","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT's Oscar Picks 2013 - ResultsHow did we fare this year in our Academy Awards predictions?by RT Staff | February 25, 2013 |  CommentsWe at Rotten Tomatoes freely admit we’re not the world’s greatest Oscar prognosticators. Still, we did a bit better than usual this year; while there were some surprises (Sound Editing was a tie?!) and a few winners that aren’t all that surprising in retrospect, most of our predictions came true at the 85th Annual Academy Awards. Read on to see how our forecast squared with the final results! 96%Best Picture: ArgoMomentum has been building for Argo in the past few weeks; it took home best picture honors at the Golden Globes, the BAFTAs, and the Critics’ Choice Awards (and not to toot our own horns, but it won the Golden Tomato Award for Best Wide Release as well). Argo hits several sweet spots that the Academy voters find irresistible: it’s inspirational, but loaded with historical gravitas; it was both a mainstream hit and a critical favorite; and, perhaps most importantly for voters, it’s a celebration of the power of movies and the people who make them. Lincoln and Silver Linings Playbook have enjoyed some dark horse cache, but we think Argo will be the first film since Driving Miss Daisy to win Best Picture without garnering a Best Director nod.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Actor: Daniel Day-Lewis for LincolnThis category has been in the bag since the ink was dry on Daniel Day-Lewis’ contract.CORRECTSilver Linings Playbook 92%Best Actress: Jennifer Lawrence for Silver Linings PlaybookThis was the toughest category for RT editors to whittle down. At opposite ends of the age bracket, Emmanuelle Riva and Quvenzhané Wallis each gave remarkable performances, and Riva in particular could muster some votes. Even more likely is Naomi Watts, whose physically grueling work in The Impossible has also generated buzz. Early on, it looked like Jessica Chastain had this category all sewn up, as critics societies around the country were heaping praise on her. However, in the last couple months, all the Oscar mojo has seemingly shifted toward Jennifer Lawrence; with a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice, and a SAG award under her belt, we think Lawrence will walk away with the Oscar as well.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Supporting Actor: Tommy Lee Jones for LincolnEach of the nominees has an Oscar to his credit, so there aren’t any unjustly ignored sentimental favorites to choose from. Christoph Waltz won the BAFTA and the Golden Globe, but it seems unlikely he’ll win just a few short years after his breakout role in Inglourious Basterds. Robert DeNiro has a strong chance, especially since his work in Silver Linings Playbook helped to erase memories of the great actor’s string of mediocre films. However, we think Tommy Lee Jones – who was already honored by the Screen Actors Guild –will ultimately claim the Oscar.INCORRECT – Christoph Waltz, Django Unchained. We shouldn’t have discounted Waltz’s previous award season victories.Les Misérables 70%Best Supporting Actress: Anne Hathaway for Les MisérablesAnne Hathaway has enjoyed almost universal Oscar buzz since before Les Misérables even hit theaters, and her wins at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs confirm her status as the front-runner here. It’s possible, though unlikely, that either Helen Hunt or Jacki Weaver will steal this category; if Weaver wins, it could be an early sign that Silver Linings Playbook will have a huge night.CORRECTLincoln 89%Best Director: Steven Spielberg for LincolnSince Ben Affleck was inexplicably snubbed in this category, we think Steven Spielberg will take home the hardware as a consolation prize.INCORRECT – Ang Lee, Life of Pi. It just wasn’t Lincoln‘s night, and the Academy was obviously more enamored with Life of Pi overall. It’s still a mystery why Ben Affleck wasn’t even nominated in this category. 87%Original Screenplay: Django UnchainedThe Usual Suspects, Fargo, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Juno… The screenplay awards are the place where the Academy honors innovative stuff that’s a little too wild and wooly for Best Picture. Quentin Tarantino’s consolation prize for Pulp Fiction losing to Forrest Gump was a Best Original Screenplay trophy, and he’ll pick up another one for Django Unchained this year.CORRECT 96%Adapted Screenplay: ArgoFollowing up on the last entry, we must make note of the fact that because there are two screenplay awards, it makes sense that one goes to something a little left of center, and the other goes to whatever won Best Picture. So chalk up Argo for the Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay).CORRECT 93%Best Foreign Language Film: AmourGiven that Amour was also nominated for Best Picture (not to mention noms for Michael Haneke in the direction and screenwriting categories), this one seems like a lock.CORRECT 95%Best Documentary: Searching for Sugar ManThis was another contentious award for RT editors. In a year of particularly strong choices, we think it’s down to a three-way race between Searching for Sugar Man, The Invisible War, and The Gatekeepers, with the feel-good vibes of Sugar Man carrying the day over its more somber, issue-oriented peers.CORRECT 78%Animated Feature: BraveAnother tough call. We think the competition is ultimately between Brave and Wreck-It Ralph. However, because graying Academy voters can’t tell Call of Duty from The Call of the Wild, we’re gonna go with the little redhead. (It must be noted that RT editor-in-chief Matt Atchity insists Frankenweenie will win, loudly telling the rest of the staff, “You’re all wrong.” Sure thing, chief.)CORRECT 86%Best Cinematography: Life of PiLife of Pi‘s visual splendor is so mind-blowing that it seems improbable that anyone could steal this category from its cinematographer, Claudio Miranda.CORRECT 96%Best Film Editing: ArgoArgo already took home the BAFTA in this category, and we think three-time nominee William Goldenberg will add to the film’s Oscar haul.CORRECT 89%Best Music – Original Score: LincolnJohn Williams is one of the most nominated figures in Academy history, and hasn’t won in a long time. We think he’ll win Oscar number six, but Mychael Danna’s eclectic score for Life of Pi could surprise some people.INCORRECT – Life of Pi. We had a feeling Mychael Danna could steal this one, especially since John Williams has so many Oscars to his name already. 92%Best Music – Original Song: SkyfallThese days, award shows exist for one reason, and one reason alone: to bestow trophies upon Adele.CORRECT 63%Best Production Design: Anna KareninaThis looks like a tossup between Anna Karenina and Les Misérables. We decided to go with the period piece based on a classic novel. And when we realized we were being forced to choose between two period pieces based on classic novels, we picked Anna Karenina, because Leo Tolstoy had cooler facial hair than Victor Hugo.INCORRECT – Lincoln. We got this one completely wrong. Probably should have considered the painstakingly recreated period detail of Civil War-era Washington. 63%Best Costume Design: Anna KareninaTake this one to the bank, comrades.CORRECT 91%Best Sound Editing: Zero Dark ThirtyThe controversy over Zero Dark Thirty‘s politics have hurt its Oscar chances in a number of categories. Still, few questioned the film’s technical brilliance, and we think it’s here that Zero Dark Thirty will take home the hardware.HALF CORRECT – Ties are rare in Oscar history, but not unprecedented. Zero Dark Thirty split the honor with Skyfall. 70%Best Sound Mixing: Les MisérablesA big deal was made about the fact that the cast of Les Misérables sang their songs live on camera. That’s pretty tough to record, especially with canons going off everywhere.CORRECT 86%Best Visual Effects: Life of PiDude, remember the tiger in that movie? It was all CGI. Pretty cool, huh?CORRECT 64%Best Makeup and Hairstyling: The Hobbit: An Unexpected JourneyThose ears didn’t get pointy all by themselves.INCORRECT – Les Misérables. We were so focused on the pointy ears we neglected to take note of the grit and grime that accumulated on the faces of the actors portraying 19th Century Gauls.Best Short Film – Live Action: CurfewAn idiosyncratic dramedy about a depressed writer tasked with babysitting his precocious niece, Curfew has racked up a bunch of festival awards, and we think it will add an Oscar to its haul.CORRECTBest Short Film – Animated: PapermanPaperman is the wistful tale of an office drone who goes to great lengths to reconnect with a beautiful woman he glimpsed on the subway. It’s sweet, it’s beautifully animated, and it had the benefit of being the opening act for Wreck-It Ralph in theaters.CORRECTBest Documentary Short: Open HeartThis is a particularly solemn year for documentary shorts. We think Open Heart, the tale of eight Rwandan children traveling to Sudan for heart surgery, will earn both tears and votes from Academy members.INCORRECT – Inocente, the story of a homeless girl who dreams of becoming an artist, took home the Oscar.FINAL TALLYCORRECT: 18INCORRECT: 6For our full Oscar coverage on the day, go to RT’s Awards Tour pageWritten by Tim Ryan","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Baby, Comedy, Sundance, Kids, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rts-oscar-picks-2013-results"},{"id":"47612945526118","title":"Best Movies Off the Radar 2013","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best Movies Off the Radar 2013RT staffers pick the little-seen gems from 2013 that deserve another look.by RT Staff | December 27, 2013 |  CommentsIt’s the end of the year, a magical time in which critics and awards voters are hard at work making their selections for the finest that cinema had to offer. However, we at RT decided to take a slightly different tack. We’re giving some love to a few of the overlooked, underappreciated, and, in some cases, critically dismissed movies that made an impression on us. Read on for a rundown of lesser-known gems from 2013 that we think deserve another look. 77%Simon KillerTim Ryan, Senior EditorWhen we first meet Simon (Brady Corbet), he’s explaining to an acquaintance what he’s doing in Paris: he’s a recent graduate who’s in Europe trying to clear his head after a bad breakup with his long-term girlfriend. At first, he seems like a decent, intelligent guy, but it doesn’t take long for us to notice that something is a bit… off about him. We watch him lie about seemingly trivial things. Then we see him manipulate people, most notably Victoria (Mati Diop), an escort who clearly has feelings for him. Then we watch as he becomes a blackmailer and scammer. Then… well, no spoilers, but the movie’s called Simon Killer for a reason. Movie psychopaths tend to be diabolical and charming, but what makes Simon truly frightening is that he’s nothing like Hannibal Lecter or Patrick Bateman; instead, he epitomizes what Hervey M. Cleckley called “the mask of sanity.” Simon Killer is a slow-burning character study that’s not pleasant to watch, but it’s fascinating regardless. Director Antonio Campos’ visual sense is assured but unobtrusive, and he maintains a dispassionate tone that allows us to observe a monster without distraction or embellishment. It’s an uncommonly audacious and disturbing film. 60%John Dies at the EndGrae Drake, Senior EditorThis film adaptation of David Wong’s ridiculously off-the-wall book is all about Soy Sauce — but this stuff doesn’t come for free from a Chinese food place. It’s actually a drug that sends its users across time and dimensions, really giving them their money’s worth. Unfortunately, it simultaneously makes them inhuman. In every kind of body-snatchers-y type story, you need a hero with their feet planted firmly on the ground to save the world. Instead of that, you get John and David. They’re not the type of guys you want saving us from certain destruction — but that’s what makes this movie fun. John Dies at the End is directed by Don Coscarelli of Bubba Ho-Tep fame, and it features performances by Chase Williamson, Rob Mayes, and Paul Giamatti that are rock-solid, bizarre, and much better than one might expect from an indie movie about drugs named after condiments. Check this one out, and buckle up. 94%A Band Called DeathRyan Fujitani, EditorEvery year, there are a number of noteworthy documentaries that some might say go criminally underseen, and 2013 was no different. One of the mid-year triumphs of the genre, A Band Called Death gestated in distribution limbo after its 2012 LA Film Festival premiere until it finally saw a limited release in June of 2013. The film chronicles the formation, marginal success, and subsequent rediscovery of a proto-punk band comprised of an unlikely trio — three black brothers from the heart of Detroit. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, while their contemporaries were getting their funk on, Motown style, David, Dannis, and Bobby Hackney dared to play fast, trippy rock and roll, inspired by the likes of Alice Cooper and The Who. Unfortunately, this band called Death failed to gain much traction due to its controversial name, and, unwilling to compromise his artistic integrity, David, the eldest Hackney and visionary leader of the band, eventually succumbed to alcoholism. While the film does chart the musical successes and failures of the Hackneys’ professional careers, it’s also a tender, sometimes heartbreaking testament to the power of family bonds, adding a profound humanistic touch to a story that would nevertheless have been a fascinating rock doc in its own right. 83%LeviathanLuke Goodsell, International EditorGotta admit, I’m not really sure for whom certain movies are “on” or “off” the radar, because this was certainly one of my most anticipated of the year. Nonetheless, with only a handful of screens and less than $100,000 at the US box office, I’m guessing Leviathan qualifies. A lot of documentaries claim to trade in “objectivity,” but this one really is as close as a movie can get to purity. Directors Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel attached GoPro cameras to everything they could on a North Atlantic fishing trawler — rigs, nets, fisherman, you name it — and the result is cinema like you’ve never seen before. It’s queasy viewing at times, to be sure — hilariously, there were a lot of walkouts at my screening, presumably from people who thought they’d paid to see a gentle nature doc about seagulls — but for anyone into adventurous, next wave moviemaking, this is the real deal. 31%Gangster SquadAlex Vo, EditorDespite the big-name cast (Sean Penn, Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone) and Zombieland‘s Reuben Fleischer in the director’s chair, Warner Bros had to steer Gangster Squad under the radar. Originally set as a late 2012 summer release, Gangster Squad‘s trailer had gentlemen in trench coats blasting Tommy guns through a movie theater screen, a trailer that was seen by every victim of the Aurora, Colorado Dark Knight tragedy. Subsequently, WB pushed Gangster Squad out to January and shot a new ending. The movie is a quirky cocktail: the wardrobe and production capture the smoky, languid flavor of L.A. noire, but the storytelling is strictly western classic. Mythic heroes, public showdowns, children in the crosshairs, and even a sharp-shooter cop in the form of Robert Patrick complete with revolver holster and cowboy hat. It’s not perfect by any means, but Gangster Squad is a unique ode to classic genres. 93%This Is Martin BonnerJeff Giles, Associate EditorIt tells far too quiet and uneventful a tale to make much of an impact at the box office during our tentpole-driven times, but for those who can hold their craving for CG spectacle at bay for 90 minutes or so, This Is Martin Bonner offers some of the most richly rewarding filmmaking you’re liable to see in 2013. Driven by Chad Hartigan’s empathetic direction and powered by a pair of note-perfect performances from Paul Eenhoorn and Richmond Arquette, Bonner offers a gentle plea for acceptance — not only of other humans with their idiosyncrasies and their flaws, but of ourselves, and the way our changing relationship with the world around us can provoke unexpected circumstances. 86%Much Ado About NothingBeki Lane, Editorial CoordinatorI’m not quite sure how any Joss Whedon movie can wind up “off the radar” in 2013, but that’s exactly what happened with his adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. Shot in secret at Whedon’s house over two quick weeks while on break from filming The Avengers, this film features many Whedon regulars, including Nathan Fillion, Clark Gregg, Sean Maher, Amy Acker, and Alexis Denisof. It was also a family affair; the movie was co-produced by his wife, Kai Cole, who also designed the home where the film is set, and the soundtrack features songs performed by his brother Jed. The result is a film that makes many bold choices: it’s filmed in black and white, it’s set in contemporary times, and it’s performed with modern American speech. It takes a few minutes for such anachronisms to settle in, but once they do, this Much Ado About Nothing is an interesting ride that keeps you engaged throughout, even if it’s just to see what they do with this unique setup. The cast’s ability with Shakespeare is varied; many are good (and Nathan Fillion is brilliant; I wish he’d been playing Benedick, but the scenes with Dogberry are hands-down the best) and a couple are painful, but that’s all part of the fun and charm if you go in understanding the intended spirit of the film. And it’s Certified Fresh at 84 percent, in case you need any extra convincing. 56%Frankenstein’s ArmyKerr Lordygan, Review AggregatorIn the final days of World War II, Russian troops discover some revolting developments in an abandoned German town. On behalf of the Nazis, Dr. Viktor and a group of scientists had been building an army of patched-together soldiers constructed from humans merged with found objects, including, in some cases, regular household appliances. No plane propeller or blender is safe! Some viewers may want to bring Dramamine to watch Frankenstein’s Army — this is a hand-held found-footage film that might induce occasional motion sickness. But I was so intrigued by the innovative creatures (the designs are terrifying) and humor (Czech actor Karel Roden is remarkable in his ability to make Dr. Frankenstein likeable) in this low-budget feature that I became a fast fan. And I didn’t even need a bucket. 66%The IcemanCatherine Pricci, Review AggregatorChris Evans as a serial killer? Sign me up! Ok, so he’s not the main character in The Iceman, but the only other time I’ve seen Evans play a bad guy was in Fierce People, so I had to check this out. Oh, and did I mention he’s barely recognizable as the ruthless hitman Mr. Freezy? Alright, let’s move on to the actual film itself. Michael Shannon brilliantly portrays Richard Kuklinski, an infamous contract killer who’s also a devoted family man. He starts out doing small jobs for Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) but after being asked to cut back, he goes out on his own to kill. That’s when he teams up with Mr. Freezy and the two are a truly dynamic serial killing duo. Shannon’s performance is fantastic — he manages to make me feel for him even after he gets caught. It was clear he loved his family and the fact that his extracurricular activities were on the illegal side tested my moral judgment when it came to his undoing. Winona Ryder stars as his wife, and there’s a surprising cameo from David Schwimmer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Freeform, batman, indie, Bowl, RT, Comedy, movies, frames, die, PlayStation, Countdown, and, football, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2013"},{"id":"47617856058865","title":"Play Ball With RT’s Top Sports Movies!","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

With The Act of Killing arriving on Blu-ray and DVD this week — and collecting an Oscar-nomination for Best Documentary — we spoke with Oppenheimer on how the film has generated new forms of dialogue with audiences, the nature of what he calls “the humanity of evil,” and his conflicted relationship with his “star” — charismatic mass murderer Anwar Congo.It’s been a tremendous year for this film: people are still discussing it, it topped Sight and Sound‘s year-end poll — even though you got a bad review in the magazine. How does it feel to still be talking about The Act of Killing, all this time later?Joshua Oppenheimer: Well, above all it’s been pleasing, and a great honor, that viewers and critics — but especially viewers all over the world, above all in Indonesia but everywhere — have opened themselves to the film’s painful, mysterious, and complicated message. By allowing themselves to approach men like Anwar Congo and his friends through my intimacy with them, through my closeness with them, they choose to become close to Anwar and his friends, and see a small part of themselves in men like Anwar. I think in that moment something else happens that I think is pretty radical — the whole paradigm in which we divide up the world into good guys and bad guys collapses, and people start to ask all kinds of questions about their own humanity and the nature of evil. I think that reaction, and the courage that it takes people to go through that, is really heartening to me. Especially when that reaction has taken place in Indonesia.So yes, it’s a long time to be talking about the same thing [laughs], but I’ve learned a lot about the film through the audience. You finish a film not in the editing, but in the conversations that audiences have with themselves — and in that sense every viewer is making a slightly different film. And that’s wonderful. I’ve learned a lot. Of course, there is some repetition, but above all it’s invigorating, because the film that took eight years to make has grown millions of manifestations of itself when everyone sees it.It’s interesting that you say the film invites a dialogue with the audience, because it doesn’t take the easy path of condemning these men. What’s something you learned about the film from that dialogue — say from an audience reaction — that you perhaps didn’t think about before?Oppenheimer: That’s a really good question. How would I answer that? There’s so many things I’ve learned, but what’s the most interesting thing I’ve learned from an audience reaction? Two things, I guess, and they’re related. First of all, there was a very striking moment when someone said, “You have forgiven Anwar.” And I said, “I don’t feel that that’s my role. I don’t feel like either forgiving or condemning is my role. It’s not my purpose, for me to do that; I’m not a court.” And the viewers have corrected me there on a number of occasions, and said, “No, by seeing the human being beyond the actions, that is forgiveness. That is what forgiveness is.” And that left a pretty strong impression on me as I thought about who I am after making this film. And whatever viewer told me that — I don’t remember, for such a precious lesson it’s a pity I don’t remember who told me that — that left a strong impression on me.The other thing that’s somehow related to that is about where Anwar is at the end of the film. I’ve resisted the notion that Anwar is in any way redeemed, and I think that’s correct — I don’t think that he is redeemed. I think that some people have been quick to say that there’s this catharsis at the end. It may be cathartic for the viewer to discover in Anwar that, despite everything, there remains this indigestible residue of humanity that physically and morally rejects what he’s done. Once I was asked very, very plainly, “Does Anwar regret what he’s done?” Instead of saying “Did Anwar feel remorse?” which would involve Anwar more reflectively considering his own feelings, the question “Does he regret what he’s done?” stood out as immediately easy to answer. I said, “Yes, of course he regrets what he’s done; he’s been tormented by it for years.” That also was a discovery.And then of course, what I was trying to emphasize, the biggest discovery about the film was its capacity to stand as a mirror for people. The whole method is that it’s a dark mirror for Anwar, but it’s also a dark mirror for Indonesian society as a whole, and it’s a dark mirror for all of us. And perhaps that capacity of the film to stand as a mirror, and the willingness of people from all over the world to look into that mirror, however dark the image they see there, has been really heartening and, by implication, a real discovery for me.It’s that familiar scenario that many have commented on: the banality of evil. Because the killers are very human, it makes it possible for an audience to see themselves in them.Oppenheimer: You made a leap there, which is good, but I think that it’s worth pausing and reflecting on. The film shows something by approaching Anwar and his friends as human beings. Unless we see them as human we won’t be able to understand how we do this to each other, and the effects — how we as humans, after having done such things, live with ourselves, and the effects of the stories, the lies, we tell ourselves to justify our actions because we’re human. You talk about the banality of evil, but what I think the film is really exploring, somehow, is the humanity of evil; the involvement of our humanity and morality — not immorality — in the practice of evil. And what I mean by that is, I think one of the most frightening things the film witnesses, and you see it all the more starkly in the longer director’s cut of the film, is the way that because we’re human, after we commit atrocities we have to lie to ourselves to justify what we’ve done. And that is not a sign of our immorality, that’s a sign of our humanity, and our morality — our vulnerability to the tormenting effects of guilt.Anwar and his friends have won, and in having won they’re been part of writing a victor’s history. As one of them says in the film, If you can get away with killing and you get paid enough for it, go ahead and do it. But then you must make up an excuse so you can live with yourself afterwards, and you must cling to that excuse for dear life. Well Anwar and his friends — and there’s a whole section about the anti-communist propaganda in the longer version of the film — have clung to the lies justifying what they’re done for dear life, so that they can live with their selves. Although they know they’re false, they’ve acted as if they’re true, because that’s the only way that they can live with themselves. To maintain those lies, it inevitably leads to a downward spiral of further lies and corruption that can only end, somehow, in a moral vacuum. Now they have to blame their victims for what they’re done, because that’s what the propaganda says — that it’s the victim’s fault. They have to dehumanize the victims, because it’s much easier for them to live with themselves if the victims are not fully human in their eyes. And above all, they must kill again, or torture again, because the government now says to Anwar and his friends, “Kill this group of people, for the same reason that you killed the first group.” If they refuse, it’s equivalent to admitting it was wrong the first time.So the repetition, this hypothetical repetition that I’m talking about, happens not because Anwar is a sadistic monster who carries on blindly committing evil, but because he’s a human, and being human he knows what he’s done is wrong and he can’t cope with that. So we see here, in the longer cut of the film, in the terrible sequence of film noir scenes that culminates in Anwar playing the victim at the end. In that movement through sadism, before Anwar finds himself in the victims’ chair, I think we somehow start to feel that remorse that he starts to feel in the nightmare sequences when he burns down the village. Remorse is painful for Anwar. Instead of reacting to it with more remorse, he reacts to it with sadism. He pushes it away. He gets angry, because he feels hurt. Having killed has damaged him, and who does he blame for that? He blames the victims, and throws himself all the more readily and despairingly into his sadism, and finds himself playing the victim. If there’s a single omission from the shorter version of the film, it’s that sequence. The whole rhythm of the director’s cut, the pace, the peculiar pauses that allow you to rest after moments of real violence, the whole structure and pace is all building up to that final descent into Hell.But both versions of the film witness that so much of what we call evil may stem from our morality. And this is counter-intuitive and it’s very frightening, because it shows that not only are there not evil people among us who we could somehow deal with if we could find them, but evil is not a sectioned-off part of ourselves — it is an integral part of who we are, and it has something to do, I think, with despair, and surrender, and anger. It ultimately comes down to humanity, and in witnessing that last act in The Act of Killing, certainly in the long version, viewers are seeing “Oh no, this is who we are” in a very frightening way.Next, Oppenheimer on how he got access to the death squads to tell their stories, and his thoughts on the relationship he’s developed with Anwar Congo.The scene is frightening because, like a lot of the film, it’s mixed up in not only real terror but a very dark humor at the same time. There’s something I did want to ask you about, for the people who perhaps haven’t read this before. Going back to the beginning, you originally set out to make a documentary on the survivors of the massacres, before you were put in touch with these guys. Did you come up against any resistance? Weren’t they suspicious of you?Oppenheimer: Oh yeah, that’s right — when we began making the film. Did I come up against resistance when I started working with the perpetrators? I started this whole project working with survivors in this small plantation village, and when the army got wind of the fact that the survivors were participating in the film, they told them not to participate any more. They survivors with whom I was living said, “Okay, Josh — if you can’t film with us, before you give up you should try and film the aging death squad leaders living around us, because they may be able to tell you how our loved ones were killed.” So I approached these men — one of them was living directly across from where I was staying — I approached these men cautiously, unsure if it was safe to talk to them about the past and the killings, but to my horror every single one of them was immediately open and boastful about what they’d done. I don’t know why those first perpetrators I met weren’t suspicious of me, given that I was living with the relatives of the people they’d killed, but perhaps that coexistence was so normal to them that it didn’t signify much. Perhaps the army, not wanting to worry them, hadn’t told them that I was exploring that stuff that happened in 1965.In any case, we got away with it in the first village. Then, when I showed that footage to those survivors that wanted to see it, and the human rights community, they told me to continue. They said, “Keep filming the perpetrators, you’re on to something terribly important. Through this material you can expose the entire regime.” So I obliged and filmed every perpetrator I could find over two years, by which time I’d moved far enough away from the orbit of the small community of survivors that there wasn’t so much of a risk of people finding out what I was up to. If I was being monitored by the military or the government, I had worked myself so far up the chain of command of the perpetrators that I thinking the low-level intelligence officers — if they were monitoring me — wouldn’t dare raise suspicions with such powerful men at that level. Some of them will be in my next film, which is forthcoming. So through the process I don’t think there was much suspicion of me.What was your pitch?My pitch was very simple. As I filmed perpetrator after perpetrator they would tell me stories, often with smiles on their faces, often in front of their wives, children or little grandchildren, and then afterwards say “Hey, I can take you to the place where I killed?” and the next day we would go. At the location they would tell me what they had done and then launch into these sort of spontaneous demonstrations of how they killed, and often they would bring along props. If they’d forgotten to bring along props they would complain: “Oh, I should have brought along a machete.” Sometimes they’d bring along friends to play victims, as well. So the scene on the roof with Anwar, where he shows how he killed the wire and dances the Cha, Cha, Cha, that in fact was the very first day that I met him; that was typical of a first day of filming with a perpetrator in North Sumatra. Anwar was the 41st perpetrator I’d filmed, so by that time I’d filmed dozens, and long before I’d said to them, “Look, you’ve participated in one of the biggest killings in human history, I want to understand what it means to you and your society; you want to tell me what you’ve done, so go ahead and show me in whatever way you wish. I will film the process, but I’ll also film you and your fellow death squad members talking about preparing those reenactments. In that way I’ll make a film that shows what this means to your society, and how you want to be seen.”I could be that open with them because they were that open with me — if not about their feelings about what they’d done, but at least about the facts of what they’d done. The method was not a trick to get them to open up — this method of reenactment — it was a response to their openness, a way of trying to understand why they’re so open. I lingered on Anwar, not because I was looking for the right main character, but because his pain was close to the surface — even if he was doing something as grotesquely boastful as dancing where he’d killed hundreds of people. In fact, it’s not boastful — it’s a manifestation of radical denial. I started to intuit that his boasting was not really a sign of pride, but a sign of the opposite — that all of these men know what they’ve done is wrong. They’re boasting because they’ve never been forced to admit it was wrong by some invading army or a court.The oblivion that Anwar and Herman exist in often makes them come off like big kids. It reminded me a little of Idi Amin. Did you ever see the Barbet Schroeder documentary on him?Oppenheimer: Yeah, it’s wonderful. One of my very, very favorite films.In that film, even though you know what Amin’s up to, you can’t help but laugh because he’s very charming — albeit in an entirely deranged manner. I felt a little of that in Anwar, although, as you say, you can see the denial bubbling under.Oppenheimer: I’ve always talked about that humanity, but I think with Idi Amin there’s something else going on with his enjoying an act. There’s a way with which Idi Amin is filmed enjoying an act. And Anwar is enjoying his act, and enjoying acting in the film, but because he’s told us that he would walk out of the cinema, out of an Elvis Presley vehicle in 1965, and enjoy the intoxication of his cinematic identification with Elvis and dance across the street and kill happily, there’s a kind of radical denial into which Anwar slips, into which I slip with him, as he enjoyed the act of making the film much in the same way as he would have enjoyed the act he had to throw himself into in order to carry out the act of killing.There’s a very strong sense that you’re empathizing with Anwar as the film progresses, and I know that you’ve stayed in touch with him. Did you find yourself at a point where you were enjoying making this film? Not in the sense that you were enjoying the subject matter, but that perhaps you had warmed to Anwar’s company.Oppenheimer: There were many levels of enjoyment in making the film. I had the most wonderful Indonesian crew. They were my second family and dearest friends. We had a lot of fun making this film, although it was very painful as well. The making of this film gave many of us pretty tough nightmares and insomnia and so on. Of course I could enjoy Anwar as another human being: he’s funny, he’s charming; you’ve seen it in the film. That open view to Anwar is an essential part of how the film works. We open to Herman and Anwar because they’re funny, they’re generous, they’re charming — and then they do something terrible, and we’re forced to confront the humanity of evil. I opened to him as well. I think I had to, in order to deal honestly with him as a human being. I made a decision that I would never make the leap from thinking because Anwar has done something monstrous I will treat Anwar as a monster at all times; I will treat him as human at all times. And to treat someone as human is to be open to them and allow yourself to be close to them and be charmed by them or to like them. So of course I liked Anwar at times; of course I liked parts of Anwar. The frightening aspect of that is what that reveals: that liking somebody — whether someone’s likeable or nice — is wholly immaterial. In fact, being likeable and nice may make it easier for some people to commit evil. It’s the very thing I was saying earlier: committing evil does not depend on being a monster. And yet I will say one thing as well. I would feel a deep internal resistance every time I would have to go back to Anwar unexpectedly. If, say at the end of a day of shooting I’d forgotten something at his house and I had to go back and collect it, or if I had to call Anwar an extra times, or if I had to go visit — and even now I stay in touch with him; I want to stay in touch with him; I care for him — I’m conflicted about it.The Act of Killing is released on Blu-ray and DVD this week, and is available through iTunes, Netflix and VOD.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Awards, Fresh, Brie, Skip, heist, of, Tumblr, TV+, Classic, camera, slashers, Games, golden, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"interview-oscarnominated-act-of-killing-director-on-the-humanity-of-evil"},{"id":"47612997762424","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-ray: Haywire and Joyful Noise","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-ray: Haywire and Joyful NoisePlus, a music legend's biopic, Madonna's latest directorial effort, and something for Tim Burton fans.by Ryan Fujitani | May 1, 2012 |  CommentsThis week on home video brings us a couple of gems and a couple of duds. Some notable Blu-ray reissues hit stores this week: Clueless, Men in Black II, Jeremiah Johnson, Pillow Talk, and About a Boy. But we’ll be focusing on the brand new releases, which include Steven Soderbergh’s gritty actioner, Garry Marshall’s latest holiday-themed rom-com, a gospel musical, Madonna’s second directorial effort, a Beatle biopic, and a collection of Tim Burton’s Warner Bros. films. See below for the whole shebang.Haywire 80%Steven Soderbergh expanded his resume to cover the action genre with Haywire, and the result was a critical (if not quite commercial) success. Soderbergh spotted MMA fighter Gina Carano on television and approached her about doing a film, specifically about a government contract operative (Carano) who is double crossed and must uncover the truth about the betrayal. With Soderbergh at the helm, Carano performing all of her own stunts, and a top notch supporting cast, Haywire earned a Certified Fresh 80% and provided an early-year adrenaline boost for moviegoers.New Year’s Eve 7%If critics were unkind to Garry Marshall’s last holiday-themed ensemble rom-com, Valentine’s Day (18% Tomatometer), they displayed downright contempt for New Year’s Eve, a similarly constructed collection of loosely interconnected stories populated by famous people like Halle Berry, Robert De Niro, Ashton Kutcher, and Sarah Jessica Parker, among many others. New Year’s Eve earned a paltry 7% on the Tomatometer, leaving many to wonder if Marshall might finally achieve the rare 0% with his next feature. Arbor Day, maybe, or Ash Wednesday if we’re really lucky.Joyful Noise 32%Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton make an interesting, if unlikely, duo in Joyful Noise as two women battling to decide the direction of their competition-level church choir. Critics sung the praises of the film’s two leads, whose chemistry — along with a few solid musical numbers — was one of the few good things about Joyful Noise. It’s not subtle, and it doesn’t do anything you wouldn’t expect from a feelgood musical film, but if you’re looking for a simple, pleasant time-waster, there are those who would say you could do worse.W.E. 12%Everyone ultimately wants “to direct,” and Madonna is no different. Her first effort, 2008’s Filth and Wisdom, was considered ambitious but wildly incoherent, and if you thought she couldn’t do much worse, critics say you’re wrong. W.E., about a young woman (Abbie Cornish) obsessed with the romance between King Edward VIII and his American divorcee lover, earned a 13% from critics, who again offered up a chorus of, “It’s ambitious and it’s got style, but she doesn’t really know what she’s doing here.” The movie intercuts between the present and the past, but it’s a convention you’ve likely seen pulled off more effectively elsewhere.George Harrison: Living in the Material World 86%When former Beatle George Harrison died in 2001, his wife Olivia turned away various would-be documentarians, explaining that he had wished his story to be told through videos from his personal archive. Then came Martin Scorsese, who earned Mrs. Harrison’s blessing and slowly began to piece together what would eventually air on HBO in two parts as George Harrison: Living in the Material World. The response was overwhelmingly positive, earning an 89% on the Tomatometer and inspiring critics to call it not only an insightful and fascinating rock doc, but also a worthy entry in Scorsese’s filmography.Tim Burton Collection – Blu-RayArriving exclusively on Amazon is a new Blu-ray collection of director Tim Burton’s work, featuring movies made under the Warner Brothers banner. While this means a few of his most beloved films, like Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, won’t be included, there are still some good picks here, like Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure, Batman, and Beetlejuice, along with Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Corpse Bride, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The set also comes with a “premium hardcover book,” making this a decent pickup for die hard Burton fans.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Turner, cancelled, VOD, 72, action, thriller, USA, Series, streaming, comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-haywire-and-joyful-noise"},{"id":"47613046068616","title":"Awards Tour 2012: Writers Guild of America Awards Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour 2012: Writers Guild of America Awards Nominationsby RT Staff | January 5, 2012 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) have announced nominations for outstanding achievement in writing for the screen during 2011.

Whether you’re looking for dumb fun, Academy darlings, arthouse favorites, or something for the kids, we’re sure you’ll like the selection hitting stores tomorrow. We’ll just start off by listing the five (that’s right, five) Certified Fresh new releases: The Descendants, The Adventures of Tintin, Melancholia, My Week with Marilyn, and Young Adult. Not bad, eh? Then we’ve got two not-so-well-reviewed films, but they’re both geared towards the younger demographic, so that may not matter. And lastly, we’ve got a controversial Scorsese film getting a shiny hi-def upgrade in the Criterion Collection. See below for the full list!The Descendants 87%We kick off this week with an Oscar-winner, made by and starring previous Oscar-winners, and though The Descendants only took home one of the five trophies for which it was nominated, most still agree it’s a thoughtful drama worth watching. Best Actor nominee George Clooney plays Matt King, a lawyer in Hawaii about to complete a significant family real estate deal when his wife suffers a boating accident that leaves her in a coma with no hope of waking. With his wife now hospitalized and on the verge of passing, Matt must reconnect with their two daughters, come to terms with the fact that his wife was unfaithful to him, and decide whether or not to go through with the land sale. Based on the novel of the same name by Kaui Hart Hemmings and directed by Academy Award-winner Alexander Payne (Sideways), The Descendants not only nabbed the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, but also earned a Certified Fresh 89% on the Tomatometer, with critics calling it funny, moving, and beautifully acted. Kudos also went to young Shailene Woodley, playing Matt’s older daughter, and the supporting cast is solid all-around.The Adventures of Tintin 74%Up next, another Oscar nominee (for Best Original Score) and Steven Spielberg’s first foray into motion capture technology, The Adventures of Tintin. An animated 3D spectacle, Tintin is based on a series of classic Belgian comics bearing the same title, and features a young journalist (Tintin, voiced by Jamie Bell) and his faithful dog sidekick Snowy as they travel the globe in search of a sunken treasure from the 17th Century. Featuring an all-star voice cast that includes Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost, Tintin drew comparisons to an earlier Spielberg franchise starring a certain treasure-hunting Archaeology professor by the name of “Indiana,” which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Fortunately, most critics chose to look at it as a good thing, and the film earned a Certified Fresh 74%, marking it as a nice little animated throwback to classic adventure serials with some serious visuals to boot.Happy Feet Two 45%Back in 2006, WB had a hit with Happy Feet, an animated film about an emperor penguin named Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) who couldn’t sing worth a lick, but who could tap dance his tail off. Fast forward five years, and the inevitable sequel, Happy Feet Two, hit theaters last November. This time around, Mumble is all grown up with a kid of his own, Erik (Ava Acres), who refuses to dance like his papa and runs away, only to meet Sven (Hank Azaria), a unique penguin who can fly. When the entire population of emperor penguins is trapped by an iceberg, Mumble must bring all his friends together to save the day and win back his son’s respect. Unfortunately, while the first film was Certified Fresh and took home the Oscar for Best Animated Film, critics weren’t too thrilled with Happy Feet Two, calling its narrative noisy and incoherent, even if its animation was expectedly top notch. At 44%, it’s not terrible, but it won’t be taking home any awards either.My Week with Marilyn 83%Michelle Wiliams sure has come a long way since her days on network television. The former Dawson’s Creek star has come into her own, and her feature film career of late has proven her to be an indie movie darling, with acclaimed roles in films like Wendy and Lucy and Blue Valentine. Her latest is a turn as iconic starlet Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn, a profile of the week she spent with filmmaker Colin Clark (played by Eddie Redmayne), fresh out of college on his first movie gig as an assistant director to Sir Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh) on 1957’s The Prince and the Showgirl. The nuanced portrayal of the Hollywood legend earned Williams her third Oscar nomination (and second specifically for Best Actress), and Kenneth Branagh earned his second for acting (Best Supporting Actor), though neither took home the statue. At a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer, My Week with Marilyn is worth seeing, if only for the fantastic performances.The Three Musketeers 26%Paul W.S. Anderson’s name isn’t exactly synonymous with what one might call “quality cinema;” despite the fact that the Resident Evil franchise (only two installments of which Anderson directed) has gained a cult following, he has never been behind the camera of a Fresh movie. So it was no surprise that his rock ’em, sock ’em 3D update of Alexandre Dumas’ The Three Musketeers was met with tepid reviews; even the Oscar-winning talent of Christoph Waltz could do little to save it. The story, pretty much recycled and beefed up with big action sequences and CGI, is familiar: Brash, young D’artagnan (Logan Lerman) must team up with the titular trio (Ray Stevenson, Matthew MacFayden, Luke Evans) to take down the scheming Cardinal Richelieu (Waltz), who has disbanded the musketeers. Throw in a big supporting cast that includes Orlando Bloom, Mads Mikkelsen, Milla Jovovich, Juno Temple, Til Schweiger and more, and one would think it had a chance. Unfortunately, critics found Anderson’s The Three Musketeers had nothing new to set it apart from the long line of adaptations that preceded it, yet executed what it did have so poorly that it earned a meager 26% on the Tomatometer. In other words, almost any other version is probably better than this one.Melancholia 80%Danish director Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves, Dogville) got into a bit of trouble last year when he made some controversial comments at the Cannes Film Festival, where he had previously enjoyed a great deal of success with his films. It’s unfortunate, because the film he premiered there, Melancholia, was well received, even earning its lead, Kirsten Dunst, the festival’s award for Best Actress. The film, split into halves, focuses on two sisters — Justine (Dunst), whose wedding reception makes up the first half of the film, and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), in whose house the reception is held and where Justine spends the second half of the movie suffering from depression. At the same time, Earth is on a collision course with another planet called Melancholia, guaranteeing the end of human life, and each character finds different ways to cope. Melancholia earned a Certified Fresh 78% on the Tomatometer, bolstered primarily by Dunst’s powerhouse performance and by von Trier’s distinct and personal vision of depression and destruction. It’s not what you would call a “feelgood” movie, but it’s poignant and beautifully shot, for those who are interested.Young Adult 80%Jason Reitman’s got quite the streak going. After achieving critical success with his debut (Thank You for Smoking) in 2005, Reitman proved he wasn’t a one-hit wonder by earning Academy love for his next two films, Juno and Up in the Air. In his latest effort, Young Adult, Charlize Theron stars as Mavis Gary, a selfish, self-absorbed former prom queen-turned-writer who returns to her hometown in hopes of winning back her happily married high school sweetheart (Patrick Wilson), instead reconnecting with a former classmate (Patton Oswalt) she barely remembers. Working from a script by Oscar-winning Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody, Young Adult drummed up a little bit of early awards buzz, but ultimately got no love, despite a Certified Fresh 81% on the Tomatometer. Some have speculated that audiences didn’t quite know how to respond to the film’s bittersweet themes, and Mavis is such an unlikable character that it may have turned off others. At the end of the day, most agreed that Theron’s performance was outstanding and that the story is both funny and powerful enough in its examination of prolonged adolescence to warrant a watch.The Last Temptation of Christ – Criterion Collection Blu-Ray 81%The Last Temptation of Christ remains Martin Scorsese’s most controversial film to date; a scene in which Jesus (Willem Defoe), in a dream, forsakes the cross to marry Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) drew thunderous protests from religious groups before the movie was even released in 1989. However, The Last Temptation of Christ was hardly an empty provocation; while the film deviates from Scripture, it’s a sincere, deeply-felt attempt by Scorsese, a dedicated Catholic, to explore the mysteries inherent in Jesus’ tale — most notably, the grey area between his divinity and his humanity. The Last Temptation of Christ is austere, serious moviemaking, and though it isn’t always easy to watch, it’s a brilliant example of Scorsese’s ability make transcendent cinema out of inner tumult. The new Criterion Blu-ray contains plenty of bonus goodies, including an audio commentary from Scorsese, Dafoe, and screenwriters Paul Schrader and Jay Cocks, on-set footage shot by Scorsese, and an interview with Peter Gabriel, who composed the film’s score.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"docudrama, Freeform, of, on, DC, the, crossover, serial, christmas, strong, movies, high","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-The-Descendants-Tintin-and-More"},{"id":"47613016393088","title":"2013 Academy Awards Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2013 Academy Awards Winnersby RT Staff | February 24, 2013 |  CommentsThe 85th Academy Awards are scheduled to take place on Sunday, February 24th in Los Angeles, and if you’re looking for the winners, you’ve come to the right place.

The biggest news we have is that Martin Scorsese’s latest, a family film and loving tribute to the cinema, is available tomorrow, after having taken home five statues last night. After that, we’ve got a spy spoof sequel, a failed bromance (of sorts), a critically acclaimed Mexican drama, and a new Criterion edition of a Louis Malle film. See below for the full list!Hugo 93%The 84th Academy Awards are officially in our collective rear view mirror, and though Hugo didn’t take home statues for any of the top honors, Martin Scorsese’s love letter to the cinema did score a solid five Oscars (Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and Visual Effects). Based on the best-selling Brian Selznick novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film stars Asa Butterfield as the titular boy, the orphaned son of a clockmaker who loved the films of Georges Melies. In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Moretz) whose toymaker godfather (Ben Kingsley) may or may not be intimately connected to his father’s automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese’s very personal love for the magic of the movies, and Certified Fresh at 93%, it’s a delightful treat for all families, whether they’re full of cinephiles or not. Now, it is available in Blu-ray 3D, but whether or not it will be able to duplicate the lush effects seen in theaters is still sort of up in the air; here’s hoping they re-release it for a post-Oscar run. For those curious about the extras, the Blu-ray 3D package comes with a handful of featurettes, including a making-of doc and short videos dedicated to the automaton, Georges Melies, one of the special effects shots, and Sacha Baron Cohen.Johnny English Reborn 38%Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was… born. Critics, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson’s comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you’re familiar with Rowan Atkinson’s previous work, then you know what you’re getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichés, and if that’s your thing, then have at it. But at 37% on the Tomatometer, there’s no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic.I Melt With You 16%Early Bret Easton Ellis novels (please, forgive us this comparison) and their subsequent film adaptations (like Less Than Zero and The Rules of Attraction) were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life. Now, imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing, and you’ve got I Melt With You. Rob Lowe, Jeremy Piven, Thomas Jane, and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday, but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them, they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past. Most critics would tell you to steer clear of I Melt With You, which earned a mere 13% on the Tomatometer; they generally agree that the film’s laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material. For better or for worse, it’s available this week.Miss Bala 87%Mexico’s entry for this year’s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar (though it didn’t make the cut), Miss Bala is another one of those movies you probably haven’t heard of, much less seen, unless you keep close watch on our weekly Critics Consensus and live in a major city. Loosely based on true events, the film follows a young Mexican beauty queen who becomes wrapped up with a gang of drug-runners as she competes for her crown. Though it received just a little buzz and opened for a short time in limited release, critics found a lot to praise about the movie; it’s a loaded film whose subject matter is already heavy, but is made even more powerful by some interesting directorial choices and an assured filmmaking style. Certified Fresh at 89%, Miss Bala is an unflinching, timely look at a side of Mexican culture much talked about but rarely explored in this fashion.Vanya on 42nd Street – Criterion Collection 89%Vanya on 42nd Street‘s highbrow credentials are impeccable: it’s a modern take on Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya, adapted by David Mamet, directed by French maestro Louis Malle, and featuring Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (the later three were responsible for the minimalist classic My Dinner with Andre). If that sounds like a snooze to you, it’s your loss; Vanya is a deliciously unconventional filmed play featuring some of New York’s finest stage talent (and Julianne Moore in a key early role). A new Criterion Blu-ray features a fresh digital transfer of the film, plus a making-of documentary that includes interviews with the actors.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, what, Spike, 78th, MCU, adventure","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Oscar-winner-Hugo-Hits-Shelves"},{"id":"47613085614487","title":"Sam Taylor-Wood talks John Lennon and Nowhere Boy","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sam Taylor-Wood talks John Lennon and Nowhere BoyThe British director on the journey to her debut feature, a biopic of the teenage rock icon.by Luke Goodsell | October 8, 2010 |  CommentsEarly on in her career, British visual artist Sam Taylor-Wood and her then-partner recreated the famous portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, originally taken by Annie Leibovitz for Rolling Stone just hours before the Beatle was shot dead. “What was I thinking?” Taylor-Wood laughs. Now, of course, that art project has a whole other meaning for the director, who makes her feature film debut with this week’s Nowhere Boy, a depiction of the teenage life of the young John Lennon. Set in 1950s Liverpool, the movie presents a displaced Lennon (Aaron Johnson) torn between two key women — long-time guardian Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and free-spirited birth mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) — and how that turmoil fed into the creation of the rock ‘n’ roller he would become.We caught up with Taylor-Wood and asked her about some of the pressures surrounding the project, casting her leading man, and what Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney thought of her handiwork.RT: At what point did you decide to take on this film?Sam Taylor-Wood: Well, I’d been looking for material. I’d been reading so much crap, basically, and this one was given to me by a fellow director, Joe Wright, who directed Atonement, and he said to me: “I’m looking for my film and I’ve read this but it’s definitely your film, not mine.” That was such a blessing from him. I read it and just thought it’s the most powerful script I’d read, and felt completely and utterly compelled to make it. And then I had to fight for it because there was another director on it. So there was a little bit of drama before I got there.Why did Joe think it was your film?I don’t know, I think it was mainly because he knew a little bit of my background. I’d made a short film about two teenagers losing their virginity to Buzzcocks records, so I guess this was a coming-of-age story centered around music. So there might have been a similarity there.The script was written by Matt Greenhalgh, who also wrote [Joy Division film] Control, and there’s a similarity between those two in that they’re both about the influence that two different women had on a musical icon. Was that something that also appealed to you?Oh definitely. I had seen Control. It was definitely something that interested me because it was a great thing to think, “Behind every great man,” you know. [laughs] This was two very interesting women. I think the contrast between the two women was also very interesting to me — one being very stoic, post-War, and the other a seemingly free-spirited, pre-’60s kind of woman, very vivacious and larger than life; especially with Lennon looking for his mother and then finding this completely exotic woman who was different to the one that had brought him up. All of that was really fascinating to me.The film is very much about the influence of the “two mothers,” so to speak. Was there ever a point where you were thinking of pushing it more toward the music?I was trying to strike a balance between the emotional content and the coming-of-age story with the birth of a musician and rock ‘n’ roll and Lennon as we know him, and trying to give the music fair play and also the influence of rock ‘n’ roll on his life. So all of that was kind of in the melting pot together to try and create this.This is the rather obvious question, but was it a daunting subject, John Lennon?Yeah, it was. Well — you know what — it wasn’t daunting when I read it. I just thought, “Wow, this is such an incredible script; this is the film I wanna make.” And then because I had to fight for it I kind of lost sight of the fact that it was about Lennon; I was more just trying to get my hands on this project, and when I did I was caught up in the whirlwind of excitement that I had the film. It wasn’t until I went to Liverpool and put my feet on the earth that I suddenly felt the weight of the icon on my shoulders, you know: going to The Beatles museum, and every second thing is Beatlemania, and every person I met had their opinions here and there. So that was when I started to really feel the weight. And then second to that was when I then wrote to Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney for whatever memories they wanted to share, or their blessing, or whatever; that was when it started to dawn on me.Speaking of the weight of expectations. So, Yoko approved the use of songs for the film — what was her initial take on it?I don’t think she read the script; she might have, but she told me to remember one important thing: Aunt Mimi had been very demonized in a lot of biographies, and she said, “You have to be fair to Aunt Mimi because she really loved John; and John really loved her.” And that was all she needed to say, really, for me to have a better understanding. Here was a woman who, yes, was formidable and stern, but who was also the woman that nurtured and loved and cared for him. The other detail that Yoko gave me was that Aunt Mimi had taught John about poetry and painting, about Van Gogh and Oscar Wilde and all those things, so it sort of gave me a much more rounded picture of her than I’d had before.Along with Yoko’s approval to use songs, you had obtain permission from Paul McCartney. What were his thoughts?Well, he was reluctant at first, because I felt that he was nervous as to how he was going to be portrayed in the film, or about another film on The Beatles — which it wasn’t. At first he was very forthcoming with details, and said, “Lennon was like this… ” and offered some funny stories, and then he gave me details of equipment, and really valuable things. And then both he and Yoko I felt got nervous and sort of stepped away and let me get on with it. Then at the end, he saw it, and we’d shot three scenes without music rights — rather frighteningly, the whole film had to be done and dusted without music rights for them to approve. It was a nerve-wracking experience, because we either did or didn’t have a film depending on what McCartney and Yoko would say. Thankfully he liked it enough to give us the rights, so that was enough of a validation.Aaron said that Paul couldn’t remember being punched in the face by John, as happens in the film. Was that a little embellishment?Yeah, it was. In the scene following that scene, it was important for us that we have a scene in which Lennon and McCartney come together in a sort of recognition that they’d both lost their mothers. And to get to that moment, without it being sappy and wet, Matt had written this whole angry, violent outburst by Lennon; so it came from that. It kind of needed a crescendo to reach that moment. Someone hits someone, and of course, our film is about Lennon, so… [laughs]The way the shot pulls out on them embracing is great.Yeah, that’s one of my favorite shots that one, because it’s such a moment of two men just having that moment of loss and acknowledging that.You’ve said that you knew Aaron was Lennon when he walked in the door. What was it about him, especially as he was in the middle of filming Kick-Ass at the time?He’s a perfectionist, as I’ve since come to know. When we were auditioning I knew he was shooting Kick-Ass so I didn’t have high expectations, because I thought he’d be in the world of, you know, Superbad and that kind of genre, and be that kind of geeky kid. So when I opened the door to him and he was already talking and being Lennon-like, I was already impressed. I thought for him to pull that off in such a short space of time was kind of incredible. He just had an intensity and a slight sort of madness to him, because he was sitting there talking to himself, as Lennon, and having conversations with himself. He didn’t want to speak to me as Aaron, so I just had to listen to him be Lennon. It showed me that he had the intensity to take on the role — and also the courage to take on the icon.The film opens with the chord from “A Hard Day’s Night” — was that a sort of wink that, “This is a music film, but it’s not really about the music?”Well, yeah — there was a slight “Eureka!” moment when I was editing. I knew that opening scene needed something else and I thought, “People are coming to this film, or a lot of people, because they’re Lennon or Beatles fans,” and it was almost like an acknowledgment of who this film was about and who he goes on to become. So in a way, that whole opening scene, I wanted it to be like a vision of the future, if you like — so he’s sort of running, with the girls screaming and the noise in his head. Slightly dream-like. I just wanted to get the heartbeat thumping of all the fans. [laughs]Nowhere Boy is out now.Click here to read our chat with Nowhere Boy star Aaron Johnson, and find out his Five favorite Films.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Teen, Thanksgiving, Company, FOX, television, Land, Tubi, The, Syfy, GIFs, name, Sundance, fiction","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sam-taylorwood-talks-john-lennon-and-nowhere-boy"},{"id":"47613068068239","title":"5 Family-Friendly Holiday Movies You Might Have Missed","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Family-Friendly Holiday Movies You Might Have Missedby Alonso Duralde | December 16, 2015 |  CommentsWhile the holidays are certainly all about tradition – wearing the same sweaters, baking the same cookies, playing the same Andy Williams CD, washing your hands with the same fir-scented liquid soap – sometimes it makes Christmas better to throw a little something new into the rotation. As you spend time with the kids this month, or even just park them in front of a TV so you can get some decorating done, check out these family-friendly movies that might be new to you and/or the young’uns. (And for more seasonal film options, check out my book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.)Arthur Christmas (2011)  92%Released at the same time as the bigger-budgeted Hugo and Tintin, and saddled with both a terrible marketing campaign and a titular pun that doesn’t really work outside the UK, this import from Aardman fell between the cracks in its original Stateside release, although its cult among Yanks grows every December. Arthur (voiced by James McAvoy) is the son of the current Santa Claus (Jim Broadbent). Santa’s older son Steve (Hugh Laurie) has turned the gift-distribution functions of the North Pole into a ruthlessly well-oiled machine, but it’s Arthur who keeps the spirit of Christmas alive, especially when one final present needs to be delivered before the sun rises on December 25.Lassie (2006)  93%This is not the “What’s that? Timmy’s trapped in Dead Rock Canyon?” Lassie that you’ve gotten to know from the American TV series; this sweeping (and tear-jerking) British movie faithfully adapts the original novel by Eric Knight. Director Charles Sturridge (the Brideshead Revisited&nbsp;miniseries) assembles a powerhouse cast that places talented newcomers alongside vets like Peter O’Toole, Peter Dinklage and Samantha Morton. The brave collie makes her way across Scotland and England to be reunited with her impoverished young master – but will she come home in time for Christmas?Millions (2005)  88%With a filmography that ranges from Steve Jobs to Trainspotting&nbsp;to Slumdog Millionaire, director Danny Boyle generally defies categorization, although you might not necessarily apply “kid-friendly” to his work – unless you’ve seen this delightful 2004 comedy. Young Damian (Alex Etel) is reeling from the recent death of his mother when a satchel of money falls down from heaven (actually, a passing train). With the clock ticking toward the New Year, when the UK will convert from pounds to Euros – this is a fantasy, after all – Damian has to figure out what to do with the money while staying a step ahead of the gangsters who want it back.Prancer (1989)  67%The British don’t have a monopoly on the genre; this made-in-the-USA tale introduces us to Christmas-obsessed Jessica (Rebecca Harrell), who’s convinced that the ailing reindeer she’s nursing back to health is actually Prancer, who has somehow gotten separated from his brethren at the North Pole. With an ensemble that includes Sam Elliott, Cloris Leachman and Abe Vigoda, this disarming movie captures the magic and the power of childhood belief without ever overstating its case or getting too precious about it. And even adults might want to keep a hanky on hand.Unaccompanied Minors (2006)  29%After Freaks and Geeks and before Bridesmaids, director Paul Feig crafted this energetic and clever farce about a group of kids stuck at a snowed-in airport on Christmas Eve. While it’s been unfairly lumped in with other post–Home Alone comedies about kids outsmarting adults, this one’s actually based on a story from All Things Considered, and Feig once again casts some amazing young actors (including Tyler James Williams of Everybody Hates Chris and Dear White People) alongside an army of comic greats, including Mindy Kaling, Jessica Walter, Lewis Black, Teri Garr, Rob Corddry and three of the Kids in the Hall, to name just a few.Alonso Duralde is the author of the quintessential holiday film guide Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.

And while the idea of mixing comfort and joy with jolts and screams might seem unusual, there’s a proud tradition of Yuletide scares.After all, one of the most popular stories at this time of year is Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, in which four ghosts appear to frighten Ebenezer Scrooge into embracing the real meaning of the holiday. And even the original Christmas story has that whole slaying-of-the-firstborn undercurrent to it. (That’s a combination Bible epic/slasher movie that some exploitation filmmaker is bound to get around to one of these days.)So if your idea of a holiday hero is Jack Skellington rather than George Bailey, here’s a list of five entertaining horror movies that will bring an extra chill to your December. (For a more complete&nbsp;list of scary, funny, exciting, sad, and pretty much every other kind of holiday movie, check out my book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.)Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010)  90%In this fiendishly funny and frightening Finnish import, an excavation team makes a mysterious discovery while a young boy researches Santa Claus, only to discover that the old man is a fearsome legend who exists to punish naughty children. As strange events begin occurring around town, the boy fears that the diggers have uncovered Santa’s resting place, and that the man in the red suit plans to exact a hideous revenge.Watch TrailerBlack Christmas (1974)  71%Director Bob Clark is probably best known for the beloved A Christmas Story, but his first foray into Christmas stories was this pre-Halloween slasher classic about a group of sorority girls being tormented by an obscene phone caller just before winter break. Plucky Olivia Hussey is the valiant Final Girl, but the cast also includes Keir Dullea (2001), veteran comic actress Andrea Martin (who got stunt-cast in the far inferior 2006 remake), and the scene-stealing Margot Kidder, whose wry line readings are unforgettable.Watch TrailerChristmas Evil (1980)  75%&nbsp;(aka You Better Watch Out)This Santa-slasher horror movie is one of John Waters’ favorite movies, and it might just become one of yours, too. Brandon Maggart (a Tony nominee and Fiona Apple’s real-life dad) plays Harry, a toy factory employee obsessed with Santa Claus, giving himself a beard made of shaving cream and keeping tabs on which of the neighborhood kids have been nice and naughty. When he loses his job, Harry snaps and starts eliminating the people he thinks are lacking Christmas spirit, leading to a must-be-seen-to-be-believed finale. Ho ho ho!Watch TrailerGremlins (1984)  85%What would happen if you crossed It’s a Wonderful Life and a monster movie? Screenwriter Christopher Columbus (who would go on to direct another seasonal fave, Home Alone) and director Joe Dante decided to find out, subjecting the idyllic town of Kingston Falls to an invasion of the mogwai, creatures that start out cuddly but then turn nasty and start spawning offspring when they get wet. This movie has a nasty streak a mile wide, but its combination of dark laughs and genuine horror has made this one a Yuletide fave. (It also – in combination with another Steven Spielberg production, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom – helped usher in the PG-13 rating.)Watch TrailerJack Frost (1996)  7%Forget every other film you’ve ever seen about a serial killer who gets turned into a homicidal snowman: this one’s the real deal. Stemming from a genuinely ludicrous concept, this story about a prisoner whose DNA mixes with experimental acid in the Snowman Capitol of America finds the humorous in the horrific, and vice versa. Keep an eye out for a pre–American Pie Shannon Elizabeth, who turns up to get assaulted by the titular monster. (Not to be confused with the Michael Keaton movie of the same name – that one’s arguably even creepier.)Watch TrailerFollow Alonso Duralde on Twitter at @ADuralde.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Festival, king, Vudu, Dead, hidden, comic, Lionsgate, Con, binge, Awards, Travel, Nominations","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"5-christmas-horror-movies-from-the-sublime-to-the-ridiculous"},{"id":"47613136228774","title":"Julianne Moore’s Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Julianne Moore's Best-Reviewed MoviesWe run down the Kids Are All Right star's biggest critical winners.by Tim Ryan | July 23, 2010 |  CommentsFew actors in Hollywood boast a track record for excellence comparable to that of Julianne Moore. After a successful stint on As the World Turns, Moore made the leap to the big screen, where she’s raked in awards nominations and worked with some of the best directors in the business, including Robert Altman, Paul Thomas Anderson, the Coen Brothers, and Todd Haynes. Most recently, she’s picked up more strong notices in the Certified Fresh The Kids Are All Right, a dramedy about the ties that bind a non-traditional — but instantly relatable — contemporary family. Could another Oscar nomination be in the works? Time will tell, but for now, let’s look back on the best-reviewed work of one of Hollywood’s finest actresses.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1093531[/tomatometer]10. MagnoliaAmbitious, rambling, sprawling, and indulgent, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Magnolia is a movie that remains divisive to this day. But if some found its multi-stranded story perplexing, few can deny the power of its performances from such accomplished players as Tom Cruise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, and Moore, who plays the strung-out wife of an aging TV producer in the final stages of cancer. Recounting Magnolia‘s plot would take more space than is allotted here, so suffice to say that Moore creates a remarkably vivid portrait of a psychologically fragile woman looking for anything to assuage the pain of her husband’s condition – as well as her guilt over a dark secret in her past. Magnolia is “an impressive piece of work with some fine acting that makes holding our interest for three-plus hours seem easy,” wrote Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1086986[/tomatometer]9. Cookie’s FortuneWhen you think of Robert Altman, “light comedy” isn’t usually the first thing to come to mind. But that’s just what Cookie’s Fortune is – it’s a Southern-fried murder mystery featuring a group of wacky eccentrics that’s surprisingly bereft of the biting humor we generally expect from the auteur. One of the aforementioned oddballs is Cora (Moore), who hatches a scheme to make her aunt’s suicide look like a murder to preserve the family’s reputation. It sounds like dark stuff, but the cast (which includes Glenn Close, Liv Tyler, and Charles S. Dutton) help to make Cookie’s Fortune “a charming, quirky tale of small-town intrigue featuring a crackerjack cast,” according to Margaret A. McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1064254[/tomatometer]8. SafeMoore’s fruitful collaboration with director Todd Haynes began with Safe, a chilly, quietly sinister meditation on modern malaise that helped establish both its director and star as talents to watch. Moore plays Carol, a well-to-do housewife with a big problem: she believes her environment is making her both physically and mentally ill. As her condition worsens, she looks for fixes, including a cultish self-help retreat in the middle of the desert. But is Carol’s illness psychological, or is itreally the result of various chemicals in her home? Safe is ambiguous on that point, but it’s an undeniably creepy satire of bourgeoisie lifestyles and values, and Moore excels in creating a character that’s both pitiable and pitiful. “Todd Haynes takes what might have been a deadly disease-of-the-week movie and turns it into a chic postmodern chiller,” wrote Rita Kemply of the Washington Post.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1218217[/tomatometer]7. A Single ManColin Firth and Tom Ford got the lion’s share of praise for the success of A Single Man, a character study about a closeted professor in 1960s Los Angeles, but Moore wasn’t totally lost in the shuffle. She picked up a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her turn as Charley, a close friend of the grieving George (Firth), who’s attempting to recover from the recent death of his longtime companion. Charley and George once had an affair, and she never totally got over it — despite their closeness, she’s never truly accepted George’s homosexuality. Moore pulled off a complex role with typical aplomb, in a film that Bob Mondello of NPR called “wrenching and ravishing… An exquisite, almost sensual grief suffuses every frame.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1091577[/tomatometer]6. An Ideal HusbandThere’s no denying that the Oscar Wilde’s wit has worn very well over the years, but if you’re going to revive one of his works, you need a sense of panache – and actors able to pull off his razor-sharp dialogue. Fortunately, Oliver Parker’s 1999 take on An Ideal Husband had the latter in spades, with Moore, Cate Blanchett, Rupert Everett, and Jeremy Northam bringing energy and brio to what could have been a staid period piece in the wrong hands. As Mrs. Cheveley, Moore is a blackmailer and schemer with a vendetta against a prominent politician; this being a Wilde play, repartee, comic misunderstandings, and convoluted scheming is the order of the day. The result is a film that’s deft, sprightly, and impeccably acted; James Berardinelli of ReelViews called An Ideal Husband “an irresistible concoction of brilliant dialogue, sumptuous set design, top-notch acting, and a plot littered with Machiavellian twists.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1059540[/tomatometer]5. Vanya on 42nd StreetVanya on 42nd Street‘s highbrow credentials are impeccable: it’s a modern take on Chekhov’s classic play Uncle Vanya, adapted by David Mamet, directed by French maestro Louis Malle, and featuring Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn (the later three were responsible for the minimalist classic My Dinner with Andre. If that sounds like a snooze, it’s your loss; Vanya is a deliciously unconventional filmed play that features acting of the highest order — notably Moore. As Yelena, the young wife of a retired professor, she more than held her own among some of New York’s finest stage talent, and attracted the eye of Robert Altman, who cast her in Short Cuts. “Moore is simply outstanding, composed and modulated,” wrote Time Out. “There’s more power [in Vanya] than in all the multi-million dollar fireworks of Hollywood.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1117120[/tomatometer]4. Far From HeavenNominated for four Oscars (including a Best Actress nom for Moore), Far From Heaven found Todd Haynes paying tribute to the 1950s small town melodramas of Douglas Sirk — and especially the potent emotions buried just beneath the surface of their flowery veneers. Moore stars as Cathy Whitaker, a Connecticut housewife whose suburban existence has all the trappings of perfection. But there’s trouble in paradise – her husband is closeted, and she finds herself falling for Raymond (Dennis Haysbert), the son of her former gardener who happens to be — gasp! — African-American. The look and feel of Far From Heaven is uncanny — it could have been a lost film from the era it portrays. But it’s a reminder that there can be hard truths buried within melodramatic scenarios; Moore takes a role that could be a cheap caricature and creates a woman filled with internal conflict, self-doubt, and, ultimately, great decency. “Beyond its value as a political critique of ’50s America or a commentary on film history, Haynes’ movie is an old-fashioned tearjerker of the first order,” wrote Jason Anderson of Eye Weekly.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1079858[/tomatometer]3. Boogie NightsLook past its sleazy content and you’ll find that Boogie Nights is, at core, the tale of a group of lonely souls coming together to form a kind of makeshift family dynamic. As veteran porn star Amber Waves, Moore personifies this theme — she plays a woman locked in a vicious custody battle with her husband, who disapproves of her lifestyle, while acting as a mentor to some of her younger co-stars — most notably Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg). Moore received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance, and the film helped put director Paul Thomas Anderson on the map; he’d work with Moore again in the Altman-esque Magnolia. “Boogie Nights is truly audacious because Anderson doesn’t beat you over the head with his daring,” wrote Charles Taylor of Salon. “In the first half, he goes about turning conventional morality on its head nonchalantly, almost sweetly.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1159246[/tomatometer]2. Children of MenWhile Children of Men contains many of the trappings of your average dystopian sci-fi flick, it’s worlds deeper. It’s also an action flick, a thriller, a road movie, and a meditation on faith and the War on Terror that’s populated with characters of fearsome intelligence and strength – particularly Moore, who plays Julian, the leader of a rebel group intent on protecting immigrants. In a grim future in which people can no longer reproduce, Julian enlists her estranged husband Theo (Clive Owen) to transport the last known pregnant woman to safety. In a film loaded with strong performers, Moore shines as a no-nonsense woman selflessly intent on saving the human race. “Instantly up to speed and powered by that rarest of cinematic fuels — intelligent action — Children of Men is a nativity story for the ages, this or any other,” wrote Rick Groen of the Globe and Mail.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1047213[/tomatometer]1. Short CutsSince so many of Robert Altman’s films are ensemble pieces, singling any one actor out for credit might seem to undermine the overall effect he’s going for. That said, Altman always had a knack for getting remarkable, multifaceted performances despite limited screen time — and such is the case with Short Cuts. Based on Raymond Carver’s short stories, Short Cuts features an embarrassment of acting talent — it seems half of Hollywood shows up at one point or another in this three hour masterpiece. Moore plays Marian Wyman, a painter whose marriage to a doctor might not survive a burning secret from their past. Hers is just one fine performance in a remarkably rich film; as Variety’s Todd McCarthy wrote, “As the grand ringmaster… Altman passes the baton to his actors, whose behavioral insights are critical to the film’s success.”In case you were wondering, here are Moore’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Big Lebowski — 93%2. Magnolia — 88%3. Short Cuts — 87%4. Benny and Joon — 85%5. Boogie Nights — 84%6. The Hours — 83%7. Children of Men — 81%8. A Single Man — 79%9. Far From Heaven — 78%10.

Those with a High School Musical fetish should check out Zac Efron’s more grown-up vehicle (17 Again), while you twee cineastes have a new reason to worship Zooey Deschanel (Gigantic, also starring Paul Dano). Go European with a few highly rated imports (Oscar nominee The Class; Paris 36; London to Brighton) or go lowbrow with a direct-to-DVD college comedy sequel (Road Trip: Beer Pong). Lastly, check out everyone’s favorite heroes on a half-shell (the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 25th Anniversary set) and a few sci-fi throwbacks (the retro spoof Alien Trespass; Starman on Blu-ray).I Love You, Man—82%Paul Rudd and Jason Segel (who last co-starred in 2008’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall) team up again in this romantic comedy of sorts about a super nice girls’ guy (Rudd) on a desperate search for a best man who finds an unlikely BFF in a carefree bohemian bachelor (Segel). Naturally, the odd couple bond over poop jokes, the music of Rush, and plenty of Apatow-styled comedy (minus the actual involvement, and some argue, the edginess, of Judd Apatow himself). This Certified Fresh valentine to the bromance — the unabashed man-love between two or more straight men — comes to DVD with even more laughs, thanks to a wealth of additional footage that includes alternate take after take of ad-libbed lines and a particularly cozy commentary track with Rudd, Segel, and director/co-writer John Hamburg (pictured in the exclusive snapshot above recording the DVD commentary on a special man-date in Hollywood). Watch an exclusive deleted scene below!Next: Zac Efron grows up (and Matthew Perry gets younger) in 17 Again17 Again—57%Disney star Zac Efron continues to transition out of the ‘tween niche with 17 Again, his first starring vehicle after hitting stardom as the singing jock in the High School Musical films (a supporting role in Hairspray earned kudos, as did the forthcoming Me and Orson Welles, which was directed by Richard Linklater and debuted at the Toronto Film Festival). In 17 Again, an unhappy former basketball star (played in middle age by Matthew Perry, who we hope Efron doesn’t grow up to resemble) wishes his way back into his 17-year-old body (Efron) to relive the glorious high school life that he once had. The only catch? Save his grown-up geek of a best friend (Thomas Lennon), nobody knows who he really is, including his estranged wife (Leslie Mann) and his two teenage children. Truth be told, the formulaic fantasy wasn’t as bad as some critics feared, thanks in great part to Efron’s winning charm, resulting in a Tomatometer rating just shy of Fresh. For a handful of Zac-tastic bonus features (including a commentary track with Efron available on BD-Live, OMG) you’ll have to pick up 17 Again on Blu-ray.Next: Zooey Deschanel as Paul Dano’s manic pixie dream girlGigantic—38%Anyone already tired of the Zooey Deschanel Manic Pixie Romance Film (see: Elf, (500) Days of Summer, Yes Man, The Go-Getter, etc.) should go ahead and skip this one on principle, seeing as Deschanel plays a beautiful, quirky love interest yet again — and what’s more, her character’s name is “Happy.” All others will find that Gigantic is on quirky indie overload, from its plot (28-year-old man-child mattress salesman adopts Chinese orphan baby) to its supporting cast (John Goodman as Happy’s millionaire father, Ed Asner as a mushroom-hunting senior citizen). Only a few extra scenes have been included, making for a fairly sparse DVD menu.Next: France’s Oscar nominee, The ClassThe Class—97%One of the best-reviewed films of last year, this French drama not only earned an impressive 97 percent Tomatometer (and Certified Fresh seal of approval), it also won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film. Partially filmed documentary-style, The Class (AKA Entre les murs) follows an inner city teacher, played by Francois Begadueau (who wrote the original book from his own experiences) over the course of a year within the walls of a Parisian school where racially diverse students examine themselves and each other. Director Laurent Cantet cast an impressive group of non-actor teens, lending a natural energy to his film; their own self-portraits and actors’ workshop are a few of the fascinating extra features included in the release.Next: Moulin Rouge-esque nostalgia in Paris 36Paris 36—58%Moulin Rouge devotees might like this similarly-themed and -set musical comedy about a ragtag group of locals who attempt to restore a Parisian theater with a fantastic vaudeville show in 1936. Pure Francophiles are the target audience here, as the more bourgeois in taste might find the frothy proceedings too light and whimsical for their liking, and the multi-strand plot altogether too jumbled. However, if you’re in the mood for an unapologetically nostalgic fantasy filled with fabulous costuming, intricate musical numbers, and Amelie-like adornments (and who isn’t, really?), give Paris 36 a rental.Next: The gritty, taut crime thriller London to BrightonLondon to Brighton—71%The titular train route is what two young prostitutes hope will take them away from trouble when a job goes horribly awry in Paul Andrew Williams’ directorial debut. Taut and grim (very grim, according to critics), this British crime thriller makes brutal use of cinematic realism, peeling back the layers to tell a story not just about two women on the run, but one about the sordid world of street kids and criminals on the hustle in England’s underworld. A making-of featurette, deleted scenes, director commentary and more highlight the special features.Next: Road Trip gets a sequel in Beer PongRoad Trip: Beer Pong—N/AShockingly, it took nine years to get a sequel to the Breckin Meyer-Seann William Scott college comedy Road Trip (thanks, if you can call it that, go to Paramount Vantage for seizing the rights to make this long-awaited follow-up). With the sole exception of a cameo by Road Trip‘s DJ Squalls, Road Trip: Beer Pong assembles a new crew of college kids who hit the road for an adventure full of shenanigans, this time headed for the National Collegiate Beer Pong Championship. Personally, we’d rather rack up our own cups than watch some actors throw down (or watch these guys hit some impossible trick shots), although in real life, there are no “Bodacious Babes of Ta Tas” at our beer pong/Beirut tourneys. An unrated cut, bloopers, and a beer pong tutorial are just some of the illuminating special features in the release.Next: Retro creatures featured in Alien TrespassAlien Trespass—35%Conceived and presented as part homage, part spoof to the bygone creature features of the 1950s, Alien Trespass sets itself up as a “lost” film from the era, a conceit that it never quite surmounts. Boasting an “all-star” cast (headlined by Eric McCormack, Robert Patrick, and Dan Lauria), this faux-B movie alights on a desert town where an alien spacecraft crashes, releasing two passengers: a galactic police officer of sorts, and the fugitive monster who could destroy the entire planet. But the nostalgic charm wears off too soon, leaving stilted dialogue and inconsistent special effects and direction — what one might consider not just unintentionally campy, but altogether bad.Next: The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles complete film set!Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie 4-Pack—N/ALovers of sewer-dwelling martial arts-mastering mutant turtles should jump at the chance to own all four of Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo’s feature films, released this week in a 25th Anniversary edition box set, but will they? Children of the ’80s (now full-fledged grown-ups) can capture a little bit of that bygone turtle power with 1990’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (46 percent), the first live-action film to translate the pizza-loving heroes from animation to the big screen (as a bonus, you may delight in the fact that the Blu-ray set discs are presented in the form of different kinds of pizza). One of our personal favorites, however, was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: The Secret of the Ooze (36 percent), and yes, it is because of Vanilla Ice’s Ninja Rap. Perhaps we can all agree to give a pass to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (32 percent), because no sequel ever goes to Japan and succeeds (as the Bad News Bears and the 3 Ninjas can attest). Rounding out the collection is the 2007 animated update TMNT (33 percent).Unfortunately, the only advantage to picking up this TMNT set on either DVD or Blu-ray is the additional promo swag included in each set (temporary tattoos and bandannas in the DVD set, collectible cards, a Kevin Eastman-signed sketch and beanie in the Blu-ray box). Cowabungle, dude.Next: John Carpenter’s Starman hits Blu-ray!Starman (Blu-Ray)—78%After directing such genre classics as Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, John Carpenter turned his attention to a much gentler kind of science fiction; the result was 1984’s Starman, a fish-out-of-water tale about an alien (Jeff Bridges) who mimics the form of a grieving widow’s (Karen Allen) late husband and kidnaps/asks her to drive him cross-country to a homebound rendezvous ship. Although the 1980s-era special effects seem a bit dated (exception: Bridges’ shape-shifting transformation from infant human form to grown man in the span of a minute is still as creepy as ever), and its dialogue is frequently corny, Starman looks great in HD and is a worthy addition to your sci-fi geek Blu-ray collection. (Sadly, there are zero bonus features on the disc.)Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Moore, Winners, boxoffice, nature, Channel, york, 2017, media, ABC, motion, documentaries, Walt","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-A-Sweet-I-Love-You-Man-Deleted-Scene-Zooey-Deschanels-Latest-and-More"},{"id":"47613194103234","title":"Win Preview Tickets to Miyazaki’s Ponyo in Sydney","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Win Preview Tickets to Miyazaki's Ponyo in SydneyWe've got 15 double passes to give away to the Japanese animation guru's latest filmby RT Staff | August 16, 2009 |  CommentsNo one’s more highly regarded in the world of animation than Japan’s Hayao Miyazaki, the director behind such classics as My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke (to name just a few).If you live in Sydney, here’s your chance to see his latest masterpiece Ponyo, a sweet childhood fantasy about a little fish who wants to become a human girl.We’ve got 15 double passes to give away to a special preview screening at the Dendy Cinemas in Newtown next Monday, August 24, at 6:30pm.To win, just tell us in 25 words or less who your favourite Miyazaki character is, and why.

Lucky Jake was then transferred permanently into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.In the decade since, children have grown up and parents have welcomed grandchildren waiting for sequels that never arrived. Snapchat launched. The Cubs won a World Series. Why the interminable delay? Cameron, a renowned perfectionist, had to wait until the technologies for underwater CGI caught up to his ambitious visions of a world completely submerged in H2O. Now that it finally has, Cameron’s master plan is in place: he’s shooting four sequels back to back, two at a time.To say this is the longest anticipated wait for a sequel in movie history would not be an understatement: Avatar remains the highest-grossing movie of all time with $2.8 billion worldwide at the box office.Speaking at a Vivid event in Sydney, Cameron told vfxblog,&nbsp;“I guarantee one thing: Avatar 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all going to be in 3-D and they will look sumptuous… they will be, to the best of my ability, the best 3-D that’s possible to make.”Who’s In Them?(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, and CCH Pounder will reprise their original roles, with Sigourney Weaver, who played Dr. Grace Augustine in Avatar, expected to return in a different role. Notable newcomers include Titanic star Kate Winslet, Game Of Thrones’ Oona Chaplin&nbsp;(granddaughter of Charlie Chaplin), David Thewlis (the Harry Potter films), and Cliff Curtis (Fear The Walking Dead).If your favorite character died in the first film, not to worry. Cameron is bringing back Stephen Lang as Col. Quartich, last seen expiring from two arrows embedded in his chest, for all four films.&nbsp; The director sounds pretty excited about it, as he told Empire Online:“The interesting conceit of the Avatar sequels is it’s pretty much the same characters…. There are new characters and a lot of new settings and creatures, so I’m taking characters you know and putting them in unfamiliar places and moving them on this greater journey. But it’s not a whole bunch of new characters every time. There’s not a new villain every time, which is interesting. Same guy. Same motherf–ker through all four movies. He is so good and he just gets better. I know Stephen Lang is gonna knock this out of the park.”What Are They About?(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Plotlines are being kept under wraps, but we know the films will be set on Pandora. A year ago, Cameron gave a thematic overview to Gizmodo:&nbsp;“I found myself as a father of five starting to think about what would an&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;story be like if it was a family drama, if it was&nbsp;The Godfather… So, that’s really what it is. It’s a generational family saga. And that’s very different from the first film.”And way back in 2010, Vulture quoted Cameron discussing his plans for Avatar 2. “Part of my focus in the second film is in creating a different environment — a different setting within Pandora. And I’m going to be focusing on the ocean on Pandora, which will be equally rich and diverse and crazy and imaginative, but it just won’t be a rain forest. I’m not saying we won’t see what we’ve already seen; we’ll see more of that as well.”What Were The Technical Challenges?(Photo by Mark Fellman/20th Century Fox)Shooting with complicated underwater motion-capture technology is, as you might expect, difficult. Cameron told Collider, “The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and the water, which forms a moving mirror… Basically, whenever you add water to any problem, it just gets ten times harder.”While Cameron says that water will be a part of Avatar 4 and 5, the real emphasis will be on&nbsp;2&nbsp;and&nbsp;3.When Will They Come Out?(Photo by 20th Century Fox)As reported in May of 2019, Avatar 2 is currently still set to&nbsp;premiere on December 17, 2021, almost 12 years to the day after the original’s premiere, although production in New Zealand was&nbsp;put on hold in March of 2020 due to coronavirus concerns. Sequels 3, 4, and 5 will roll out December 2023, December 2025, and December 2027 respectively.Like this?

But sometimes, with the right mix of talent, visual effects and strong storytelling, a great film is born of a beloved story. This week’s animated adaptation of Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs has surprised critics to do just that, turning a kids’ favourite into a smart, energetic confection that bursts off the screen. And with Spike Jonze’s much-awaited adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are beginning its rumpus in cinemas next week, we decided to revisit 10 of our favourite children’s book adaptations.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1029112[/tomatometer]Alice in WonderlandAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland was written in 1865 by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. This Disney adaptation was loosely based on that book, and on elements from the writer’s 1871 sequel Through the Looking Glass. Despite the story’s nonsensical nature, Alice‘s rich fantasy elements and memorably absurd characters have seen it made into scores of film and television adaptations, including silent films, a Sesame Street special, and Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer’s dark, brilliantly surreal stop-motion version. Disney’s animation managed an adventure packed with weird visuals and eccentric characters, with the kind of trippy sequences you wouldn’t imagine the Mouse House endorsing today. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will bring their distinctive vision to Carroll’s world with a 3-D Alice, due in March next year.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1014840[/tomatometer]The Neverending StoryGerman writer Michale Ende’s 1979 novel Die unendliche Geschichte (The Neverending Story) was adapted into a feature by director Wolfgang Peterson in 1984. The film follows Bastian, a young, modern day kid who escapes his troubles when he discovers an ancient book that transports him to the land of Fantasia — and, later, on the ride of his life aboard the giant luck dragon, Falcor — where his imagination must save a land ravaged by a terrible darkness. The filmmakers chose to ignore elements of the book’s plot and characters, prompting Ende to request that they stop production or change the name of the film completely. When they did neither, he sued, only to lose and end up simply being able to remove his name from the opening credits of the film.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1189949[/tomatometer]CoralineDrawn from fantasy author Neil Gaiman’s awarded 2002 novel, Coraline is like a new age version of Alice in Wonderland: incorporating horror, humour and fantasy, Henry Selick’s film is blend of frights and visual thrills that impressed adults and children alike with its detailed stop-motion technique — perfectly pitched in the world of three-dimensions. Coraline’s journey through a secret door and into the amazing-but-treacherous universe of her “other” family is a stark lesson in dispelling the idea that the grass is always greener. Look out for great cameos from the likes of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders as busty, retired actresses.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1107906[/tomatometer]ShrekWith its overload of cute pop culture references, talking animals and adult themes, it’s easy to think that Shrek was an idea conjured in the offices of DreamWorks executives. Not so — in actual fact, the movie was adapted from a picture book, written by William Steig in 1990. Shrek was such a success that it encouraged a revival in the use of fairytales for film, and a seemingly endless string of animations based in pop culture parody. Not since The Princess Bride had audiences seen so much winking adult humour in children’s films — Farquaad’s name, for one, is surely not intended for playground use.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1132921[/tomatometer]Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanPrisoner of Azkaban stands as the most critically acclaimed adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s entire series of books thus far. It was the first film to hint at a possible darker side to Harry as he misuses magic and hints towards the possibility of murder — shocking! The Dementors are also quite frightening, possibly due to the visual styling of director Alfonso Cuarón, who went on to make the dystopian science fiction film, Children of Men. Fantasy maestro Guillermo del Toro was also asked to direct this gloomier (and much more adult) Harry Potter instalment, but surprisingly turned it down because he found it to be too bright and happy.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1023730[/tomatometer]Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryRoald Dahl adapted his own novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory into the screenplay for this, retitled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to promote the “Wonka Bar” and to avoid associations with the Vietnam War. This first adaptation of Charlie’s trip to the factory after winning a Golden Ticket still resonates across generations, thanks to Gene Wilder’s charming, offbeat performance, the memorably haunting songs delivered by the Oompa Loompas, and some marvellous, psychedelic sequences that border on scary. It’s a world filled with wallpaper that is lickable and tastes like Snozberries, fizzy drink that lifts you up off the ground, and a geese that lay golden eggs — not to forget Wonka’s biggest secret of all, everlasting gobstoppers.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1090486[/tomatometer]The Iron GiantThis atomic-era tale of friendship between a small boy and a giant robot was based on the 1968 story “Iron Man” by British poet laureate — and husband of Sylvia Plath — Ted Hughes. Adapted for the screen by animator and former Simpsons writer Brad Bird, making his feature debut, the movie tells a complex and morally curious story that both enthrals kids and satisfies the intellectual appetites of adults. Despite its pedigree and all-round excellence, however, the film was a flop at the box-office. No matter, as it’s since become a cult favourite, and paved the way for Bird’s next feature, Pixar’s fantastic The Incredibles.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1065598[/tomatometer]BabeDick King-Smith’s book, The Sheep Pig, imagines a world not unlike that of Charlotte’s Web, in which the hero Babe can speak to the other animals and uses this ability to marshal the farmer’s flock. The story gently introduces children to the politics and harsh realities of farming and country life — a valuable lesson, especially for city kids who wouldn’t otherwise know where their Saturday morning bacon and eggs originally came from. Produced by George Miller and filmed in the luscious landscape of the small Australian town of Robertson, Babe was a massive box-office and critical success, earning seven Oscar nominations — including Best Picture.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1029830[/tomatometer]The WitchesSome remarkable films have been made from Roald Dahl’s work — including Henry Selick’s James and the Giant Peach and Wes Anderson’s upcoming Fantastic Mr. Fox — but this certainly remains one of the best. Angelica Houston is in her element as the aloof, child-hating Grand High Witch who is on the war path to wipe out every child in England by turning them into mice. There’s no reason given for her irrational hate for children, apart from the fact that to witches, children smell of dogs droppings. Directed by British maverick Nicolas Roeg (Don’t Look Now, The Man Who Fell To Earth), this was the last film made under the supervision of the late puppet master Jim Henson, and also the last of Dahl’s book’s to be adapted before his death. Rumour has it that Guillermo del Toro and Alfonso Cuarón are in the early stages of developing a stop-motion animation adaptation that promises to stay more loyal to the book — Dahl hated the happy ending and actually protested outside cinemas for people not to watch it.[tomatometer]MuzeID= 1092277[/tomatometer]The Wizard of OzThe Wizard of Oz was based on a children’s pictorial novel written by L. Frank Baum, about Dorothy’s adventures through the Land of Oz. With the help of incredibly beautiful illustrations by W.W. Denslow, we are taken on a voyage to Dorothy’s self discovery and the friends that she meets along the way. There is a depressed Tim Man who needs a heart, a Cowardly Lion who needs courage, and a Scarecrow who needs a brain. Together they journey along the yellow brick road to find the wonderful Wizard of Oz, who will give them all that they desire. Dorothy, much like Alice and Coraline, feels bored and alienated with her reality until she experiences a terrifying and challenging other realm which teaches her that “there is no place like home”. The 1939 film adaptation was shot distinctively in three-strip Technicolor technology. There are a few notable differences between the book and the film. Firstly, in the book Oz is a real tangible place; however, in the film it is a dream land. Dorothy’s famous slippers were made ruby red to take advantage of the new vibrant Technicolor process; in the original novel, they were silver. And the Dorothy of the film is a passive damsel in distress who requires others help to get out of trouble, while the Dorothy of the book was a feminist who was actually the one to rescue everybody else! Regardless, the film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz retains its status of one of the most treasured family films of all time.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Hear, Disney, Valentine's, thriller, Country, fiction, sag","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"total-recall-childrens-book-adaptations"},{"id":"47613186630078","title":"D.C.

Insiders Call Veep the Most Realistic Show About PoliticsPaleyFest Panel Reveals Bizarre Ways Veep Intersects With Real-Life Washingtonby Sarah Ricard | March 29, 2014 |  CommentsTo anyone who criticized Veep for not taking a realistic enough approach to D.C. politics: you may want to read this.During Thursday night’s PaleyFest panel at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, Veep‘s creator, producer and head writer Armando Iannucci sat down with a panel moderated by senior editor Stacey Wilson of the Hollywood Reporter. Cast members Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Selina Meyer), Tony Hale (Gary Walsh), Reid Scott (Dan Egan), Timothy Simons (Jonah Ryan), Matt Walsh (Mike McLintock), Sufe Bradshaw (Sue Wilson), Kevin Dunn (Ben Caffrey) and Gary Cole (Kent Davison) also attended.While comedy — especially the role that improvising plays on the show — was one of the recurring topics of the night, the intersection that Veep has with real-life politics was most interesting. And terrifying.“You’ll do a storyline, and you’ll think it’s the most ridiculous story you’ve ever come up with, and it comes out, and [a D.C. insider] will say, ‘How did you find that out?'” Iannucci told the audience. “It’s been gratifying to hear people who are watching it say it’s accurate — frightening — but gratifying.” Iannucci didn’t say which moments in the show accidentally echo real life, but anyone who watches Veep knows it can’t augur too well for American politics.Keeping specific names out of the discussion, Iannucci also explained how real-life politicians have requested to appear on Veep. The answer is no — although Iannucci made a comment that Arnold Schwarzenegger would be a fine casting choice for POTUS (Kevin Dunn said he’d like to see Gary Busey in the role). Any instance in which a politician appeared on the show would raise too many questions.“If a living politician — a recognizable politician — turned up, you then say, ‘Well, he’s a Democrat. So, is Obama the president?’ The whole thing starts unraveling.” So, don’t expect any Joe Biden cameos, Parks and Rec-style. “There’s a ban on politics in the show, actually,” Iannucci said.Still, Beltway insiders quickly identify the characters on the Hill. “I’ve been told by Obama’s press office that they’ve just come out of a meeting and there were two Jonahs and three Dans there,” Iannucci said. Timothy Simons who plays West Wing wanna-be Jonah said that real-life politicians who think Veep satirizes every politician but themselves are exactly the right target for the show. “We’re definitely making fun of them,” Simons said.Even President Bill Clinton loves the show, according to Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Clinton told Dreyfus at an event, “You know what’s great about your part [as VP] is that there are no term limits.”The cast has met a few D.C. players seduced into the world of politics by the world of television. Timothy Simons, Reid Scott and Matt Walsh recalled going to a Washington Wizards basketball game with D.C. staffers and asking them what drew them to politics. Their answer? The West Wing. Folks on the Hill are also watching Scandal, which according to Scott, they enjoy for the melodrama, House of Cards for the “drama-drama” and Veep because “it’s the most accurate.” Scott concluded with a laugh, “We’re all screwed.”Kevin Dunn, who plays the President’s chief of staff, later said: “People really want to deny even if they’re aware that D.C. is a lot like that because if they do draw connections, they’d be so depressed they would no longer engage in the political process.”Veep is back on HBO, Sunday, Apr. 6, if you’d like to check out that political process for yourself.

In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all. In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series,&nbsp;Up&nbsp;director Pete Docter tells us how the “Carl and Ellie” sequence evolved from a jokey, slapstick tale into something that broke both hearts and ground.&nbsp;VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLTHE MOVIE:&nbsp;Up (2009)  98%Pixar was on arguably the hottest streak in the history of movies leading into 2009. The 2000s saw the fabled animation studio release instant classics like&nbsp;Finding Nemo and&nbsp;The Incredibles, and increasingly mature fare like&nbsp;WALL-E&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ratatouille. And yet when audiences learned about&nbsp;Up, there was some concern the streak could be at an end: Why&nbsp;was the team that had given us talking toys and elastic superheroes and heartwarming Clownfish now giving us… a&nbsp;grumpy old man? Any concerns were quickly put&nbsp;aside&nbsp;when audiences and critics finally saw the film about a man named Carl, a boy named Russell, and a house that floats away on a mega-cloud of balloons.&nbsp;Up, directed by&nbsp;Monsters, Inc.&nbsp;helmer Pete Docter and released on May 29, 2009, would become another Pixar classic – it is Certified Fresh on the Tomatometer at 98%, with an Audience Score of 90% – and earn almost $300 million at the U.S. box office, the second-biggest haul for a Pixar film at that time. It was a wildly inventive tale, full of aerial battles and exotic locales and Dug, the kinda-talking dog, but a decade later it is the movie’s grounded opening moments that linger in the memory, and still draw those tears. Here, Docter&nbsp;talks about the moment of lift off for&nbsp;Up.Carl, Russsell, and Dug in what would become Up‘s iconic image. (Photo by ©Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett Collection)“Man it would be fun to do something with a grouchy old man.”“The idea for the film came from Bob Peterson, who is great collaborator that I worked with all the way through Up. He and I thought, ‘Man it would be fun to do something with a grouchy old man.’ And that’s really where the film started. That and… through Monsters, Inc., which was the first film I directed, at the end of the day I would crawl under my desk and just huddle up into a ball. And I had a lot of daydreams of just floating away, and so this idea of a house floating into the sky with balloons, coupled with the appeal and fun that Bob and I both thought we could have with a grouchy old man, that’s where the film started. And then we asked ourselves, ‘Well, why is he floating away? Where is he going? And why couldn’t he just take the train or something?’”“There are high points and low points, difficulties and successes; we really wanted to portray the full breadth of that relationship.”“The relationship [between Ellie and Carl] was drawn largely from both Bob Peterson’s relationship with his wife and my own relationship. There’s high points and low points, difficulties and successes, and so we really wanted to portray the full wide breadth of that relationship. [There were] two relationships in particular that we focused on. Marc Davis was one of Disney’s nine old men. He and Alice have a sort of fabled marriage and getting to know them was amazing. We got to visit their studio and talk about a little bit of their life together. And, actually, the two of them traveled to Papua, New Guinea. They went on these fantastic adventures as well as both being artists. So they were a great inspiration. [The other relationship was that of] Joe Grant, who was a guy that was head of story basically on Dumbo. He developed Fantasia, all these amazing films, was second in position down with Walt Disney in the ’30s and ’40s. And I got to know him late in his life as well and he had a wonderful relationship with his wife. So just looking around us at all these great role models and people, you realize, ‘OK, nobody’s perfect. Everybody has their bumps.’ I think that’s what makes the sequence feel a little bit more real for people.”Pete Docter says he knew Carl had to have a reason to go on his adventure. (Photo by ©Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett Collection)THE MOMENT: Carl and EllieOver the last three decades, the animator-tormenters at Pixar have been jerking the tears from our eyes with precision. Think of Jessie’s “When Somebody Loved Me” sequence from&nbsp;Toy Story 2, or&nbsp;the moment Bing Bong fades away in&nbsp;Inside Out. Or the final moments of&nbsp;Toy Story 3. Or any of the other dozens of times the studio has turned on our waterworks. Chief among these moving moments is the opening sequence of&nbsp;Up, which sees Carl and Ellie “meet cute” as roughhousing kids, then court, marry, and persevere through some very dark times, ultimately living out a happy life until eventually Ellie dies, leaving Carl alone. It’s beautiful and wrenching stuff, and goes to places few expect a family movie to go (at one point, we see the couple visit a doctor and learn that they cannot have children). Docter says the sequence underwent a number of changes before taking its final form. An original slapstick-style approach was ditched, as was most of the dialogue, and the filmmakers debated just how far they could push their audience when it came to the darker side of life.Ellie and Carl meet as kids at the beginning of the sequence. (Photo by ©Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett Collection)“[Originally] Carl was, in the very first bit, trying to catch a bird and Ellie came to the bird’s defense and punched him. Now Carl was out for revenge.”“The first draft of this was showing how their relationship [started]. So we introduced the characters to each other. We saw them as kids when they first saw each other. And it became kind of a battle. In fact, Carl was, in the very first bit, trying to catch a bird and Ellie came to the bird’s defense and punched him.&nbsp;So now Carl was out for revenge. It became a back-and-forth of punching contests in the most unlikely places; in the middle of a Christmas pageant or taking the trash out. These very innocent scenes – the characters would surprise each other and punch each other. We thought it was hilarious, but [then] we showed it to the audience – we do a screening here at Pixar as we’re making the films, we screen them about every three months – and it just kind of went over like a lead balloon. Nobody really laughed. So we thought, ‘Well, this has to be shorter anyway because it’s taking too long to get to the main action of our film.’ As it turned out that sequence really reduced down to about four-and-a-half minutes. It’s really not too long but it also becomes the emotional bedrock on which the rest of the film relies to move forward.”“Ronnie del Carmen, who was our head of story, came to me and said, ‘I think this would work better with no dialogue.’”“That sequence started fully scripted. We wrote multiple short little scenes where they were finishing each other’s sentences and discussing stuff. Then as we started to storyboard it, Ronnie del Carmen, who was our head of story, came to me and said, ‘I think this would work better with no dialogue.’ And I said, ‘No, I think you’re wrong. I think we should continue with the direction we set.’ But he eventually talked me into it and boy, the further we went… We initially had sound effects and we took those out. We basically stripped it down just to music.&nbsp;My theory is, and it’s a somewhat crackpot theory probably, but I grew up watching Super 8 films that my parents had taken of all of us, and there’s something about stripping away some element that makes it more emotional. Similarly, I have some audio cassettes that my parents recorded of us when we were kids and you can’t see but you can hear. Something about having something lacking makes the audience have to fill in. They have to be an active participant and get involved in a way.”Ellie and Carl as their relationship progresses in the opening sequence. (Photo by ©Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett Collection)“The pain and loss of that situation bonded those characters together and made you empathize more with them.”“There’s one moment in that montage where Ellie has to go to the doctor and it’s sort of implied that they can’t have children for whatever reason. We didn’t spell it out because we didn’t feel like that was necessary. That raised some eyebrows even here at work as we were developing the film. Someone – it was an anonymous person – it must have hit too close to home and [they] got very upset. So, we did experiment with taking it out. And we thought, ‘Well, maybe [the sequence] could still work [without it] because there’s some really charming stuff.’ But the strange thing was, not only did we not feel the emotion as strongly in that one little sequence, but as we watched the rest of the film the whole film lost a little bit. I can’t really fully explain that other than to say it was a real dark, low moment for them that I think made that relationship feel more real. The sort of pain and loss of that situation bonded those characters together and made you empathize more with them.”THE IMPACT:&nbsp;Life’s Complexities, DistilledThe accolades came quickly for&nbsp;Up. The movie became at the time only the second animated movie ever to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards (it would take home Best Animated Feature, as well as Best Original Score for Michael Giacchino, whose composition, “Married Life,” is so key to the success of the opening sequence). Just as quickly, it entered the canon of Pixar greats, right alongside&nbsp;Finding Nemo,&nbsp;Toy Story,&nbsp;Wall-E, and the rest. But for Docter, the&nbsp;real&nbsp;lasting legacy of&nbsp;Up is felt in&nbsp;the form of letters and fan interactions, not shiny awards,&nbsp;when he sees first-hand how the moving moment that he helped create has affected and helped others.“She said it was very cathartic and that she felt as though she got to spend some time with her husband in a weird way.”“When we start out making these films, we’re just trying to make something funny and entertaining and hopefully with a bit of heart and emotion to it. But they sometimes really tap into people’s own lives in ways that are completely unexpected. There was a woman who wrote to me who said her husband had just died and so she went to the film just needing a break from life to get away from the sorrow. As I’m reading the letter I’m thinking, ‘Oh no’ – the wife dies and so it’s mirroring her own life experience. But in the long run she said it was very cathartic and that she kind of felt as though she got to spend some time with her husband in a weird way. Even though this is a bunch of pixels on the screen and none of it actually exists. Part of what I really love [about] making animated films is that none of it exists. It’s all a big trick. And yet when done well we can really make the audience care about these characters, believe in them as though they’re real people.”Pete Docter at the Los Angeles premiere of Up in 2009. (Photo by Michael Germana/Everett Collection)“These films are dress rehearsals for life for a lot of people.”“These films in a way are dress rehearsals for life for a lot of people. I know when kids play house or cars or whatever, they’re kind of acting out what they’re looking [at] around them. They’re kind of trying this suit on, and I think films are a little bit the same way. It’s a way of understanding the world. We’ve had a lot of people respond, both on Up and especially on Inside Out, talking about how their autistic children really use these films in very significant ways to understand emotion, to understand interaction, relationships. I think because you can watch it over and over. This is something animation does; we try to distill down all the complexity and nuance and messiness into something clean and easy to see. It’s like a caricature. In three lines, Al Hirschfeld would do these amazing caricatures of people that looked more like them than their own face did. That’s what we’re striving to do with animation: to take all the messiness of life and make it more pure and easy to understand.”Up&nbsp;was released on May 29, 2009.&nbsp;Buy or rent it at FandangNOW.Like this?

Now, the wildly inventive screenwriter behind Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) turns to directing with Synecdoche, New York.A complex, aching meditation on aging and the artistic process, Synecdoche stars Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as Caden Cotard, a theater director in upstate New York who, during a period of tension with his wife (Catherine Keener), works to mount a sprawling, wildly ambitious play that encompasses his life and the lives of virtually everyone around him — often with multiple actors and actresses playing or standing in for other characters. Kaufman sat down with RT to discuss the nexus between art and life, the nature of autobiographical storytelling, and the process of staying true to one’s vision.What was the initial idea you had in creating Synecdoche, New York?Charlie Kaufman: Spike Jonze and I were approached by Sony to do a horror movie. We talked about things that we thought were really scary in the world, as opposed to horror movie conventions. We talked about things like mortality and illness and time passing and loneliness and regret. We kinda went in with that, and we got assigned to go off and write it, and I spent a couple years trying to explore those notions, and that’s what the movie is.A lot of your writings deal with the juncture between art and life.CK: In this case, and maybe in other cases, these are worlds that I know, so I utilize them. I think that people create the world that they live in. Your existence is very subjective, and you tell stories and organize the world outside of you into these stories to help you understand it. I don’t think the world objectively exists the way we think it exists, you know? There’s a constant sort of storytelling process. So in that sense, what Caden is doing in this movie is larger than the issue of the creative process in the arts. It’s the creative process of existence. He’s trying to sort through — like everybody is — his life, and trying to assign meaning to it, and aging in the process, and trying to deal with the issues that come up in his life, and trying to understand them.Philip Seymour Hoffman as Caden Cotard in Synecdoche, New York.How autobiographical are your scripts?CK: I mean, I think they’re autobiographical in that anything that anybody writes is autobiographical. You can’t get away from it. The things that are of interest in this movie are things that are of interest to me. I’m not Caden Cotard. I’m not that person. But a lot of his concerns are my concerns, and I don’t know how it could be otherwise. The alternative would be to write about things that don’t interest me, which I don’t think any writer does.You’ve probably heard the whole “meta” label a million times at this point. Are you tired of it? Or is it something you strive for, to create films that work outside the way that other movies operate?CK: I’m interested in trying to explore what I think is the truth at a given time in my life, and part of the process of being honest is — in my mind — talking about the idea that you’re watching a movie. You’re sitting here watching a movie. And I like that. It appeals to me intellectually, and also in a way I can’t even explain. It tickles me, you know? It’s always tickled me, and they’re ideas I get excited by, and you go toward what you’re excited by, I think, when you’re writing. It’s an intuitive process for me. People say, “Why John Malkovich in Being John Malkovich?” Well, because I thought it was funny, you know? And if you think something is funny, then there’s some resonance there. You hope at some point when it goes out into the world that it resonates with other people, but really, the only gauge that you have is what you think. To not pander. As a writer, or as a filmmaker, you have to present yourself, and part of what yourself is is what you’re interested in, or what you think is funny, or what you think is sad, or what you think is horrible.How much is Nicolas Cage like the real you in Adaptation? One can’t help but think about that when watching the movie…CK: …And I put that situation out there to be thought of because obviously I named him after me. On a very surface level, there are many things about what happened in that story that happened. I mean, I did get stuck writing this thing. I struggled in the way that he did. I came up with the idea to put myself in there. I do have, at different times, a certain kind of self-consciousness in the world, an insecurity. [But] once I was there with that world, I was free in my mind to make things up, and to blur the line, because that’s interesting to me. So yeah, there are things, obviously, about the character of Charlie that aren’t true. I don’t have a twin brother, for example. It’s a device. And once I came up with it as a device to give Charlie someone to talk to, because he’s a writer living alone with no friends, then it excited me, because I thought, “Well, what if this opposite version of him decides that he wants to be a writer?” And then all of a sudden, all this other stuff opened up for me that was fun to think about.What’s the difference between writing and directing? Do you think you can get more of what’s in your head on the screen when you’re directing?CK: I wanted to try. I think directing and writing are very different jobs, and that is very apparent to me now. It probably was before, but now I understand more so why they’re different. Obviously, directing is a more social and managerial job. The other thing about directing is that it’s a very, very pragmatic job, and writing isn’t. You spend most of your time as a director trying to move forward with the movie. It happens on a daily basis, if not more than once a day, that you are struggling with budgetary constraints. Whereas when you’re writing, the limitation that you have is your imagination. So it’s decidedly non-pragmatic.Charlie Kaufman (second from left) on the set of Synecdoche, New York.Synecdoche, New York seems a lot darker than the other stuff you’ve done. That’s not to say your other films were necessarily light-hearted…CK: Depending on the audience, it seems to get a lot of laughs. But yeah, I think I know what you’re saying. One of the things is that I’m moving — as a person and as a writer — through time. I’m a different age now. I’m thinking about different things. I have different life experiences. I’m trying to get closer to being honest. And by closer I mean that at different ages I have different ideas of what the truth is, and at any point I’m trying to express that at that moment in time. I think one of the things I wanted to do in this movie was not have an out for people. If there are any expectations for things that I write, I think there’s an expectation that there’s going to be some sort of thing that the audience gets at some point that is like a clever thing that is kind of an out, like, “Oh yeah! I get it now. OK, I can go home now. That’s clever,” if they like it. I decided not to do that this time. I wanted to tell the story, and I wanted it — within the realm of realm of the dream logic and the surreal stuff in the movie — I wanted it to be true. And the truth of it was, this man goes through his life, and there isn’t a moment where you go, “Oh! That’s what this is about. Now I feel safe.” This would be a like a free fall until the end of his life, and that’s what I did.What are you working on now?CK: I’m trying to write something new, but it’s very early on. I don’t know what it’s gonna be yet.When I was watching the film, it kind of reminded me of Luis Bunuel‘s That Obscure Object of Desire, in that there was a certain fluidity to some of the characters; some would seem to act as proxies for others.CK: I’m not sure that I’ve ever seen that movie. I’m getting these things that I’ve never seen. A lot of people say [the film reminds them of] 8 1/2, which I’ve never seen. I’ve heard All That Jazz [as well]. And in fact, if I see another movie, and I see that I’m thinking along the lines of something else, I won’t do it. For example, I really like David Lynch. He deals with dream reality a lot. But my dreams and David Lynch’s dreams are not the same. I didn’t want to incorporate his dreams. As much as I love them, they’re his. I’m trying to find my own. I want to do my own thing, and I’m trying to get closer to realizing that as a filmmaker.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"finale, spanish, John, Sneak, awards, Awards, HBO, frames, Exclusive, Oscars, Globe, BBC, Western, Red","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-interview-charlie-kaufman-on-synecdoche-new-york"},{"id":"47613199103428","title":"Exclusive: Oscar Nominee Jeff Bridges on Crazy Heart – The RT Interview","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Exclusive: Oscar Nominee Jeff Bridges on Crazy Heart - The RT InterviewThe Iron Man star on his latest awards-friendly turn.by Rosamund Witcher | March 1, 2010 |  CommentsWith an impressive career spanning 50 years, Jeff Bridges started out as a young whippersnapper on his dad’s 1960s TV series, The Lloyd Bridges Show. Since then, he’s starred in classics such as Tron, Bad Company, The Fabulous Baker Boys and The Last Picture Show, for which he was Oscar-nominated. But he will continue to be best remembered for his iconic turn as The Dude in the Coen Brothers’ The Big Lebowski.This month, Bridges received his fifth Oscar nomination for Scott Cooper‘s Crazy Heart. He stars as down-on-his-luck country singer “Bad” Blake and is favourite to take home the statuette for a brilliantly vanity-free performance. RT grilled him about the role, and about the forthcoming Tron Legacy and True Grit.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1200453[/tomatometer]Congratulations on the Oscar nomination. How important is it to win this time?Jeff Bridges: That’s not really important to me personally. But it would be great because the more attention I get for this role, the more attention the movie gets.In your Golden Globe acceptance speech, you thanked your dad, actor Lloyd Bridges, for getting you into acting…JB: My dad loved showbiz and he encouraged all of us to go into it. One of the toughest things in acting is getting your first job so I’m a product of nepotism, basically. As a kid, I didn’t enjoy having a famous parent. But, looking back, I’m glad I listened to the old man. If I hadn’t, I might have gone down the music path because that’s what I loved.Were you tempted by the Bad Blake lifestyle?JB: Very much so. I put an album out a few years ago, called Be Here Soon. It’s wasn’t quite like Bad Blake, but my Beatle moment was when I played the Lebowski Fest. It was wild: I played to a sea of Dudes. Very surreal, but it was wonderful.Did you enjoy putting on weight to play Bad Blake?JB: It was a double-edged sword. Obviously it’s fun to let yourself go and eat that pint of Haagen Dazs, but being healthy feels the best. Sobriety and health is the greatest thing. I’ve got to watch my back, so I can’t put on too much weight.Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal in Crazy Heart.Did you get drunk for the drunken scenes?JB: No, I never drink while I’m working. But one of the ways I prepare for a part is to think about what I put in my body. So I would definitely have that second drink the night before. A little hangy would work for the role. It was great being able to have that input because Scott Cooper is a first-time director. His directing style was very inclusive. He even allowed me to come in during the editing process. Not that he would just roll over, but he was very open to our ideas.Would you like to direct?JB: I have thought about it, but I might be too lazy. Directing takes a lot of time. You spend three or four times as long on a film as an actor does. And I feel that I’m getting my vision realised in my acting already, especially working with guys like Scott who let me have a lot of input. If I find something that really grabs me, maybe I’ll do it.What was it like working with Colin Farrell?JB: He was a joy. I met him the day before we started filming and we’re supposed to have had this long relationship so we had to establish that. There are some actors that want you to call them by their character’s name and they have no relationship with you outside of the character. But I like to get to know who I’m working with so that we can relax together, and it’s more fun. Colin works that way too.Jeff Bridges in Crazy Heart.How much does award recognition affect your decision when choosing a script?JB: I don’t think about it in those terms. In fact, I’ll try my damndest not to do a movie because I know how much effort it is. Work takes me away from my wife, Sue, and my life in Santa Barbara. I realised the other day that, last year, we were apart for 11 months. But I was offered four movies that were just too interesting to turn down. It’s like that line in The Godfather: “make him an offer he can’t refuse.” Sue agreed that I couldn’t turn them down but it is hard being away from her. So, usually, I do my best to not work at all. That’s the Dude side of me.You certainly have some exciting projects coming up. Tell me about True Grit.JB: It’s really terrific to be working with the Coen brothers again. They’re masters. They make it look so easy. They’re doing a Western, which is something they’ve never done before, and I love making Westerns. It’s a great cast too: Matt Damon and Josh Brolin. I’m really excited about it.And, before that, we’ll see you in Tron Legacy. How was the experience of making it different to making Tron in 1982?JB: It couldn’t be more different. Like the original Tron, it’s all about cutting edge technology and we used some of this motion capture thing. You have to dress in a leotard with sensors all over it, with 200 dots on your face and a helmet. You don’t have the benefit of costumes or location: it’s all in your mind. Then everything is done in post-production. I have no idea how it’s going to turn out. With King Kong in 1976, I was acting at blue screen so you don’t really know what you’re reacting to. But this is like a whole new deal. It’s getting weird, man. It’s just crazy.It sounds like you weren’t that comfortable with it…JB: You just have to work with your discomfort. Being pissed off that you don’t have a costume is counterproductive. It’s challenging, but you have to dance the dance that the band’s playing. You can’t say: “I came here to Cha Cha and they’re playing a Waltz, godammit!”Crazy Heart is released on March 5th.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"talk, sitcom, shows, hispanic, TV, dark, die, Superheroes","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"exclusive-oscar-nominee-jeff-bridges-on-crazy-heart-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613208910282","title":"Broadcast Film Critics Name Critics’ Choice Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Broadcast Film Critics Name Critics' Choice Winnersby Jeff Giles | January 8, 2009 |  CommentsThe 14th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards were given on January 8, 2009, to honor the finest achievements in 2008 filmmaking.

Gonzo: The Life And Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, a documentary about the godfather of Gonzo journalism, and the writer of Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas is also lighting up the big screens, with mouse-based animation The Tale Of Despereaux making up the numbers for this week’s releases. But what did the UK critics have to say?Twilight is the film adaptation of the hugely successful and popular teen-fantasy novel by Stephanie Meyer. The books, Twilight being the first in a series of four, have sold by the boat-load in the US, approaching an almost Potter level of success, but mainly amongst hormonal teenage girls of a certain age. Meyer’s tales of teenage yearning and angst, combined with the gothic supernatural seem to have struck a rich vein of youth literature, and the film adaptation has been generating a massive amount of interest amongst the book’s legions of fans.The film was released last month in the US, and didn’t fare too well with the critics. It stood at a Rotten 45% on the Tomatometer, with the critics feeling that it didn’t live up to the source material, and many bemoaning the chemistry (or lack of) between Bella and Edward, played by Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. But, perhaps due to the more muted level of popularity of the source material here in blighty, the UK critics have really fallen for Twilight. From the 20 reviews collated today, only one review came in unfavourably, and even The Sun’s critic The Sneak admitted that the film was “A superior high school romance, which looks set to live on after the sun has set on Hogwarts.” So with UK reviews only Twilight would stand at a much more respectable (and Fresh) 95% on the Tomatometer. Critics swooned over the breathless romance and dark but well-meaning tone, meaning that Twilight may just be the hit of the winter season with Will Lawrence from Empire saying “A sometimes girlie swirl of obsession that will delight fans, this faithful adaptation is after teenage blood, and will most likely hit a box office artery.”Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson does exactly what it says on the tin. Alex Gibney‘s documentary currently stands at a Certified Fresh 86% on the Tomatometer. UK critics echoed the US critical response, applauding the insightful, accessible and definitive biography into Thompson’s weird and wonderful life, whilst a few complained that Gibney failed to delve deeply enough into his darker and more idiosyncratic foibles. Summing up the film, and it’s hagiographic nature, James Christopher of The Times said…“Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It’s a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney’s reluctance to engage fully with Thompson’s toxic personal life.”It must be a literary themed this week, as our third big release is The Tale Of Despereaux, an adaptation of the Kate DiCamillo fantasy novel, concerning the eponymous brave rodent Despereaux. Boasting an all-star cast including Sigourney Weaver, Matthew Broderick and Potter alumni Emma Watson, The Tale Of Despereaux is a modern animated fairytale with princesses, castles and talking mice, naturally. At 47% on the Tomatometer though, it seems that Despereaux doesn’t have the required level of magic to garner a Fresh rating. The critics felt that kids would probably enjoy it (but, at the risk of sounding patronising, what animated feature don’t they?), they praised the crisp animation, but felt the story was laboured, the characters weak, and film displayed a concerning lack of warmth. Paling in comparison to the similar yet superior Ratatouille and Shrek, The Tale of Despereaux is more stale than fairytale.Quote Of The Week“Horror fans will find little to sink their teeth into, but it’ll get tweenage hearts fluttering like orgasmic bats.”Twilight.

But is Hancock‘s reluctant superhero routine any match for the intrepid adventures of Kit Kittredge?Once upon a time, Will Smith (as the Fresh Prince) composed his own definition of summer madness: going to BBQs, reminiscing, waxing his car, frontin’ and maxin’. But cut to 17 years later, and he has a new definition of summer madness: box office domination. With a track record of recent crowd-pleasers (I Am Legend, Pursuit of Happyness), will fans pay any heed to the less-than-super reviews of his first vehicle as a superhero? Conversely, young Abigail Breslin — Oscar nominee, cherubic 12-year-old — seems to be giving Dakota Fanning a run for her money as the reigning ‘tween It Girl of her generation.What should you see this weekend?

(The original 1951 sci-fi classic sits pretty at a robust 94 percent on the Tomatometer.) The folks at Fox apparently don’t like such questions, because they decided to “update” the tale of an alien visitor named Klaatu who brings a message of peace — and then, potential destruction — to the callow denizens of Earth. Keanu Reeves‘ monotone delivery as Klaatu didn’t help TDTESS‘s clunky direction and script, though in his defense, he was doing it on purpose. Find the 3-Disc version for a plethora of bonus materials (production photos, storyboards, and concept art) and tons of thematic and making-of featurettes; unfortunately, the lone commentary track does not feature the film’s stars or its director, Scott Derrickson. The good news? Limited editions of the 2-Disc and 3-Disc DVDs also come with the original The Day The Earth Stood Still, so you might get some enjoyment out of the release after all.Next: Adam Sandler in Bedtime StoriesBedtime Stories — 22%Back again with another family-friendly comic clunker, Adam Sandler stars as a goofball uncle named Skeeter who entertains his niece and nephew with fantastical stories — stories that begin to come to life! Although the appealing Keri Russell co-stars as Sandler’s love interest, and the rascally Russell Brand as his best friend, this high concept comedy fell flat. Even director Adam Shankman (Hairspray) couldn’t breathe enough pep and life into the proceedings, and he was able to make people enjoy watching John Travolta in drag. Special features include pieces on the film’s special effects, child actors, and computer-generated guinea pig, bloopers, deleted scenes, and an infomercial-type appearance by Big Daddy co-stars Cole and Dylan Sprouse (now bonafide Disney idols).Next: Multiple Oscar nominee, DoubtDoubt — 78%Oscar-watchers absolutely must see this Certified Fresh chamber piece, which earned five Academy Award nominations and was adapted by director John Patrick Shanley from his own Pulitzer-winning play. With creds like these, is there any, ahem, doubt, that serious moviegoers should move this to the top of their Netflix queue this week? A strong cast led by Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams give this period piece about suspicion and the specter of abuse in a 1950s parish serious weight, though a brief, powerhouse performance by Viola Davis steals the show.Next: Say maybe to Jim Carrey’s Yes ManYes Man — 43%Jim Carrey is a shadow of his former self in Yes Man, a predictable comedy about a straight-laced banker who battles his mid-life crisis by embracing a single word: yes. Unfortunately, critics overwhelmingly disagreed with the film’s central theme (“Say yes to everything!”), despite a winning if strained performance by Carrey, who plays against his strengths as the straight man with the occasional glimmer of that slapsticky, classic Carrey. And then, there’s Zooey Deschanel. Always winning as the token “manic pixie dream girl,” she’s extra-quirky in a role as a scooter-driving, rock band-fronting, Silverlake-dwelling free spirit who, naturally, falls in love with Carrey (18 years her senior in real life). Deschanel’s musical performances, included in full as bonus features, are the highlight of Yes Man on DVD – watch one below!Next: Contemplate your credit history with I.O.U.S.A.I.O.U.S.A. — 91%Economy got you in a funk? If watching an entire documentary about the nation’s money woes won’t sink you further into depression, then we fervently recommend picking up I.O.U.S.A. (maybe a rental — it’s more cost-effective). This nonpartisan doc aims to educate America about fiscal responsibility — but in an entertaining way, unlike your bank’s customer service agents — utilizing engaging graphics to make its terrifying point. Another bonus: I.O.U.S.A. is directed by award-winning filmmaker Patrick Creadon, whose 2006 doc Wordplay introduced audiences to the nation’s biggest crossword nerds — and won a Golden Tomato award to boot.Next: Yup, someone made a movie entitled Donkey PunchDonkey Punch — 47%The title does bear explanation, but you’ll have to watch this film to find out what it means. It’s got a promising premise; this British thriller follows a group of young partiers adrift on a boat trip that takes a dangerous turn at sea. Critics liked it to a point, but gave it negative reviews for giving way to tired genre cliché. Brutal violence, drug use, and general hedonism abound, if you like that sort of thing…but while curiosity is bound to get the best of anyone looking for sordid thrills, Donkey Punch might turn out less impactful than its own title.Next: Painterly animation and adventure in The Tale of DespereauxThe Tale of Despereaux — 54%When it comes to animation, it would seem that American studios (Pixar, DreamWorks) have a monopoly on critical success. European studio Framestore Animation nonetheless tried their hand with The Tale of Despereaux, whose titular character is a mouse of particular courage and manners. Despereaux aimed to capture the imaginations of young audiences but ended up splitting critics, who credited it with handsome, painterly CG visuals but complained of a lack of spirit. The bland allegory, based on the novel by author Kate DiMillo, might serve hardcore fans of animation (and those with small children) best; all else, be warned. A few games and making-of featurettes highlight the DVD.Next: Get naughty and nostalgic with the Pre-Code Hollywood CollectionPre-Code Hollywood Collection — 78%Hearken back to an Old Hollywood unencumbered by silly “morals,” before that stuffy Hays Code took effect, with six delightfully dirty classics: The Cheat (1931, pictured above), Merrily We Go To Hell (1932), Hot Saturday (1932), Torch Singer (1933), Murder at the Vanities (1934), and Search For Beauty (1934). Among the set are films starring the likes of Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lucille Ball and Claudette Colbert, with salacious storylines that span the un-PC themes of adultery, wedlock, murder, and good old-fashioned smut. (Bankhead’s The Cheat plays like an early version of Indecent Proposal, as an indebted woman considers paying the ultimate price to a “lecherous scoundrel.”) A mini-handbook reprint of the infamous 1934 Production Code accompanies the set; here, we share our favorite bylaws: “Revenge in modern times shall not be justified” and “Excessive and lustful kissing, lustful embraces, suggestive postures and gestures, are not to be shown.”Next: Should you double dip with the No Country For Old Men Collector’s Edition?No Country For Old Men Collector’s Edition Blu-ray — 94%Double-dip home video releases are never enticing to fans who already own a title, but this week’s Blu-ray release of the Coen Brothers’ Oscar-winning No Country For Old Men comes with enough new bonus material that fervent Coen fans should take a look. When No Country first hit DVD and Blu-ray a while back, only a trio of features accompanied the film; all three of those features are ported over to the new Collector’s Edition 2-Disc Blu-ray and 3-Disc DVD, and share space with a wealth of new extras, which include Josh Brolin‘s behind-the-scenes feature, a Q&amp;A with Joel and Ethan Coen and cinematographer Roger Deakins, and nine additional pieces featuring the Coens and their stars talking with various media programs about No Country. If you’ve spent hours analyzing the film’s ending, shot compositions, or Anton Chigurh’s hairdo of choice, consider these materials study guides to the Coen classic.Next: 2010: The Year We Make Contact hits Blu-ray2010: The Year We Make Contact Blu-ray — 68%It was an audacious idea to begin with; who in their right mind would attempt to follow Stanley Kubrick‘s science fiction classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey, with a sequel? In the year 1984, that person was director Peter Hyams (Capricorn One, The Star Chamber, Timecop), whose adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s follow-up novel picked up nine years after the events of 2001. Roy Scheider stars as Dr. Heywood Floyd, a now-disgraced aeronautics expert investigating the HAL 9000 glitch, who along with John Lithgow, Helen Mirren, and Bob Balaban, tries to unlock the secret of the monolith. While the release comes with woefully few bonus features (a vintage featurette and the theatrical trailer), it’s a great High Def release for science fiction purists.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comics, RT, It, Year, 2020, Columbia, Golden, Hulu, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Bedtime-Stories-Yes-Man-Doubt-Hit-Shelves"},{"id":"47613252776412","title":"The Couch Tomato: Rachel Getting Married, W.","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Couch Tomato: Rachel Getting Married, W.Plus, Sam Jackson goes psycho and we smoke up Weeds season 3by Joanna Cohen | July 9, 2009 |  CommentsCouch Tomato Pick of the Week:Rachel Getting Married —86%Consensus: Engrossing tale of family angst, highlighted by Hathaway’s powerful performance.Anne Hathaway proves there is life beyond Bride Wars when she channels her Serious Actor Within as Kym, the drug addicted, pain-in-the-ass sister in Rachel Getting Married. Director Jonathan Demme goes to town with the hand-held shooting style he loves so much but it is Jenny Lumet’s (Sidney’s little girl) quick-fire script that keeps you gripped in the stomach-churning discomfort of familial dysfunction overload.There are a lot of speeches, the family is unlikeable and it goes for just a bit too long; still, you can’t help but love it. Basically it is every family wedding you have ever been to — so pop the champagne, throw rice at yourself and get into it.Special features: commentary with producer Neda Armian, screenwriter Jenny Lumet and editor Tim Squyres; commentary with actress Rosemarie DeWitt; Behind the Scenes; The Wedding Band; cast and crew Q&amp;A; deleted scenes.Available to rent and buy on DVD on Wednesday, 8 July.W. —60%Consensus: A surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of the 43rd American president, W. is fascinating in spots, but merely rudimentary as a whole.Oliver Stone is at it again….the presidential biopic. He has done JFK and Nixon, and is now turning his gaze on our old mate, Dubya. If Bush-bashing is what you are after, you won’t find it here. What you will find is an entertaining film that is performed quite well and is… um… kind of nice. ‘Nice’ is not a word that should ever be used to describe an Oliver Stone film or George W. Bush — but there you have it. It focuses more on George’s relationship with his father and God than the effect his particular brand of leadership had on the world, and arguably its biggest crime is that it doesn’t dig very deep.Still, it is surprisingly funny, in a good way, and the performances from Josh Brolin as the good ol’ boy himself, Elizabeth Banks as Laura and James Cromwell as Daddy Bush are very sound. Watch it for its well-performed character study, rather than any political insights.Special Features: commentary with director Oliver Stone; Dangerous Dynasty: The Bush Presidency; No Stranger to Controversy: Oliver Stone’s George W. Bush; deleted scenes; and filmmakers’ research and annotations Guide.Available to rent and buy on DVD on Wednesday, 8 July.Lakeview Terrace —47%Consensus: This thriller about a menacing cop wreaking havoc on his neighbours is tense enough but threatens absurdity when it enters into excessive potboiler territory.Samuel L Jackson stars as the psycho neighbour in this well-meaning thriller. You can’t help but ask yourself: What is a nice man like Sam doing in a movie like this? Remember when he was making good quality films like… Snakes on a Plane and… Jumper?Lakeview Terrace starts well, and bless it, does have some message to impart around racism and class. But it lacks the subtly to do it well. Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, a force of nature on the screen, and the other performances are solid enough.Resist the urge to pack your bags and move kilometres away from your nearest neighbour. Instead, scoot back to the DVD store and pick up Snakes on a Plane.Special Features: commentary with director Neil LaBute and actress Kerry Washington; deleted scenes with optional commentary; Welcome to Lakeview Terrace: Behind the Scenes – An Open House; Welcome to Lakeview Terrace: Behind the Scenes – Meet Your Neigbours; and Welcome to Lakeview Terrace: Behind the Scenes – Home Sweet Home.Available to rent and buy on DVD and Blu-ray on Wednesday, July 8.RT on TV:Weeds: Season 3Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), everyone’s favourite mull MILF, is back for another season after one hell of a cliff-hanger at the end of Season 2. Nancy’s story is a familiar one: a woman, newly widowed, decides the best way to provide for herself, her children, brother-in-law and blackmailing housekeeper is to set up a thriving drug-dealing business in her white-bread, middle-class town.Season 3 offers Nancy her usual challenges. She is once again broke, in over her head and playing with people she shouldn’t. She is less green this time round, giving her a tougher edge as she juggles her many responsibilities whilst clutching a giant, caffeinated beverage. In this season everyone wants in on the family business — including an Olsen twin!A stand-out amongst the supporting characters is acid-tongued Celia, played by Elizabeth Perkins. With a gin in one hand and a permanent air of moral righteousness she proves that with friends like these you don’t need enemies.Special features: eight commentaries with cast and crew; seven trivia tracks; gag reel; Little Boxes music montages; Little Boxes Randy Newman featurette; Uncle AWOL featurette with Justin Kirk; Mary-Kate Olsen bio; and G.M.A.: Good Morning.Available buy on DVD on Wednesday, 8 July.The Tudors Season 2This series traces the original love rat, Henry VIII, through his ferocious and deadly matrimonial adventures.Henry, played by a charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is a busy boy this season, what with swapping out his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, and the Catholic Church for the sexy Anne Boleyn and the Church of England. And by season end, even our Anne is losing her head whilst Jane Seymour steps up to the plate.This is an opulent series created by Michael Hirst, the screenwriter who brought us Elizabeth and Elizabeth: the Golden Age. Henry has lost his innocence of the first season and is starting his descent into the merry wife swapping for which he is so known, with a little church pillaging on the side.If historical documentaries are not your thing, then this certainly is. It is a soft porn soap with lots of scandal, betrayal and heaving breast shenanigans. History is dealt with in broad strokes so if you are a stickler for accuracy, you may find yourself shouting at the television screen.Special features: To Play a Pope; and Love and Passion in Tudor Times.Available to buy on DVD and Blu-ray on Wednesday, 8 July.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"poppins, nightmare, media, street, DGA, movies, Diego, Emmys, Comic-Con","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"The-Couch-Tomato-Rachel-Getting-Married-W"},{"id":"47613275584998","title":"RT-UK’s What to Watch at the Edinburgh Film Festival","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT-UK's What to Watch at the Edinburgh Film FestivalWe scour Oscar-bait as it heads to Scotland for a celebration of all things big-screen.by Joe Utichi | August 26, 2007 |  CommentsAh, Edinburgh, a city known for contrast, vibrancy, comedy, castles and, for a couple of weeks in August, a little congestion. You see, the Edinburgh International Film Festival competes with the infamous Fringe comedy festival, as well as half a dozen other festivals, and no-doubt a couple of weddings and a stag do. Hotel rooms are as scarce as A-listers from the film and comedy world are abundant and restaurants are practicing their, “I’m sorry sir, you should have booked in February,” routine.The festival has, in the past, played home to the world premiere of Serenity and the European first-show for Clerks II. Its programme is open to the public, and provides a wide variety of home-grown, European, American and international cinema. This festival sees two of the freshest movies of the year from the US play to UK audiences for the first time – Knocked Up and Ratatouille and they’re joined by the indie likes of Hallam Foe and French warbler Les Chansons d’Amour.In short, there’s something for everyone of every age, gender and nationality, and it’s probably one of the most relaxed and, in turn, exciting festivals on the calendar. It’s also a good place to start or join in that ever-exciting early awards buzz, and with that in mind we thought it’d be a good idea to let you know what we and the critics think of the films on display so you can add them to your wish-list.So without further ado we present, in no particular order, our fifteen favourites of the festival. We’ve gathered quotes from the Tomatometer and our critic friends too to spotlight the cream of the cinematic crop as chosen by our international pool of critics and ourselves respectively.THE BEST OF BRITISHFive films that represent the best the UK has to offer at the Edinburgh Film Festival – whether produced in the UK, directed by British talent or starring British actors.Hallam Foe – dir. David MackenzieStarring Jamie Bell, Sophia Myles, Ciarán Hinds and Claire ForlaniYou may remember director David Mackenzie‘s previous films, Young Adam and Asylum, with respective Tomatometers favouring fresh and rotten. In the eyes of the critics we’ve spoken to, and this dashing RT-UK editor, Hallam Foe looks set to do away with any doubts and land firmly as one of the year’s freshest.Being the tale of a rather strange teenager, the titular Hallam, who escapes a devilish stepmother for the lofty heights of Edinburgh and falls in love with a woman who’s the spitting image of his mother, the oedipal tale is at turns hilarious and heart-rending. As is Mackenzie’s wont, it’s about real people with unique lives and as a coming-of-age drama there is none finer. Its depiction of this festival’s host city, Edinburgh, isn’t troubled by big-screen sheen – this is the real Edinburgh, and it’s beautiful.Bell and Myles are outstanding, and Claire Forlani reaches a level of wicked sadism that only Claire Forlani could accomplish and still have you falling madly in love with her. It’s quirky, but not so quirky that it becomes ridiculous, and it’s probably one of the finest films you’ll see this year.“Affirms the raw talents of both David Mackenzie and Jamie Bell (who’s come a long way since Billy Elliot).”– Rich Cline, SHADOWS ON THE WALL“An intriguing rites-of-passage story with a delirious, skewed perspective and an almost palpable sexual pulse.”– Damon Wise, EMPIRE MAGAZINEStardust – dir. Matthew VaughnStarring Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Robert De Niro and Michelle PfeifferWe first experienced a sprinkle of Stardust courtesy of director Matthew Vaughn‘s invitation to the edit suite and while we loved what we saw we were curious to see if the film could maintain the pitch of the footage for its entire runtime. Having taken two trips to see the unfinished version, we’d say we’re fairly enthusiastic about the results.Based on the novel by Neil Gaiman (to settle the argument before it starts, it began life as an illustrated novel before being published without the illustrations), Stardust follows young Tristan Thorn (newcomer Charlie Cox) as he journeys across “the wall” into a magical land in quest of a falling star to retrieve for the beautiful Victoria (Sienna Miller) in exchange for her hand in marriage. When he discovers the star is actually a young woman (Claire Danes), they begin a quest back home and, along the way, are pursued by a handsome prince (Mark Strong), a wicked witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) and a devilish pirate (Robert De Niro), all of whom have their own designs on the star.And if that cast list isn’t enough to woo you, pray silence as we barrage you with Peter O’Toole, Ian McKellen, Mark Williams, Ricky Gervais, David Walliams and Rupert Everett.And we have a Princess Bride fan in the office who’s convinced he’s found a movie to rival his classic. You can start queuing now.“With its heart worn proudly on its sleeve, it’s one of the best date movies of the year, a compatibility litmus test for starry-eyed romantics.”– Kevin Crust, LOS ANGELES TIMES“The antic spirit of The Princess Bride looms large over Stardust, creatively adapted from Neil Gaiman’s much more sober 1998 graphic novel. That’s probably a good call.”– Joshua Rothkopf, TIME OUT NEW YORKWAZ – dir. Tom ShanklandStarring Stellan Skarsgard, Melissa George, Selma Blair, Ashley WaltersOn paper WAZ (the A is actually a Delta symbol so it’s pronounced Was or W-Delta-Z depending on the mood you’re in) looks like every other torture porn movie cluttering cinemas at the moment. But to lump it in with Saw and Hostel would be to do it a disservice, because this debut feature from director Tom Shankland is much more inventive.Detective Eddie Argo and his new partner, Helen Westcott, begin investigating a series of grisly murders with one thing in common; a mathematical equation has been carved into each of the victims. When they learn that the equation – the WAZ of the title is a part of it – is designed to test altruism, and that the victims are being offed in pairs, forced to kill each other to “save” themselves, the case turns even nastier, and as Westcott gets to know her new precinct she’s seeing things that don’t add up in the police department’s handling of previous cases.Set in New York but filmed, predominantly, in Belfast, with a cast that includes a Swede, an Australian and a Brit, the accents are a touch on the unpredictable side, but stirring performances from Stellan Skarsgard, Melissa George, Ashley Walters and Selma Blair make you forget those troubles, and the film creates a visually arresting universe and ramping tension that keep you glued to the screen.“Director Tom Shankland launches himself into the industry with a fierce sense of style and energy to spare.”– Rich Cline, SHADOWS ON THE WALL“WAZ distastefully delivers.”– Derek Elley, VARIETYSugarhouse – dir. Gary LoveStarring Steven Mackintosh, Ashley Walters and Andy SerkisLest you think we have a thing for Ashley Walters, it’s worth pointing out that Sugarhouse and WAZ mark genuinely impressive turns by the young actor following his stunning breakthrough in Bullet Boy. We’d make some sort of So Solid Career pun but that’d be annoying.Sugarhouse, another debut film this time from director Gary Love, is a smarter kind of Brit gangster flick. Walters is crackhead D who is looking to sell a gun to Steven Mackintosh’s city worker. D’s motives are money, his client’s are revenge. But there’s a third in the form of Andy Serkis as this year’s most terrifying baddie, Hoodwink. The gun’s his and he’s damn sure not going to let D sell it on.Based on a play, Sugarhouse is decidedly intimate, most of the action collected around D’s crack den, and its sense of realism – lacking in the works of Guy Ritchie and Matthew Vaughn – is refreshing. It’s not about effing and blinding, it’s about the seedier side of life.“Despite thin caricatures and dodgy dialogue, this still stands out on the street.”– Kat Brown, EMPIRE MAGAZINE“Andy Serkis delivers a performance that makes his turn as King Kong look like Johnny Vegas’s knitted monkey sidekick.”– Stella Papamichael, BBCControl – dir. Anton CorbijnStarring Sam Riley, Samantha Morton, Craig Parkinson and Alexandra Maria LaraAnton Corbijn‘s Control captivated audiences upon its Cannes debut earlier this year, and with good reason; the biopic of Joy Division’s late lead singer, Ian Curtis, delivers a somber but beautiful glimpse into the life of the tortured musician that should enrich fans of the Manchester band and move the uninitiated in comparable measure.Shot in gorgeously stark black and white monochrome, Control follows Curtis (Sam Riley), a sensitive working-class daydreamer in 1970s England, as he falls into the role of lead singer for a local band. That band, of course, soon becomes post-punk legend Joy Division; the lads sign a record deal, go on tour, and get big. But life gets in the way of fame for Curtis, and the demands of his budding fame – a young wife (Samantha Morton) and child, and a new girlfriend (Alexandra Maria Lara) on the side – paired with recurring epileptic seizures that render him helpless sometimes mid-concert, become too much for him to juggle.With its pulsating score (all songs performed, and well, by the actors themselves) and a transcendent central performance by Curtis doppelganger Riley, Control paints a sensitive portrait of a tragic artist whose legacy lived on for decades after his untimely death at the age of 23.“Corbijn has done his research during 30 years as a photographer, striking a realistic balance between farce and tragedy.”– Stephen Dalton, THE TIMES“Somber, sad and compelling.”– Russell Edwards, VARIETYTHE BEST OF THE USWe cross the Atlantic (figuratively) to take a look at the five top films playing in Edinburgh from the US of A.In the Shadow of the Moon – dir. David SingtonFeaturing Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Michael Collins and Jim LovellTheory: There’s nothing more exciting than listening to the former astronauts for the Apollo missions tell their tales of visiting the lunar surface. Except perhaps being one of them. Yes, David Sington‘s In the Shadow of the Moon is a little heavy on the America-the-Great, but it’s also one of the best documentaries of the year; a fascinating portrait of men so brave that most regular Joes couldn’t possible comprehend their journey.And, to its credit, it allows them to get on with it – there’s no narrator – we’re just shown fascinating footage from the moon’s surface, from the launch pad, from the shuttle, and in between these men tell us their story.For the real space-junkies, there’s doubtless little in here to learn, but for the rest of us the film is full of fascinating factoids and, like the best movies set in space – fictional or not – it’ll leave you feeling smaller than the smallest needle in the biggest haystack.“The excitement, majesty and extraordinary human accomplishment of the American lunar program of the ’60s and early ’70s is rousingly captured in In the Shadow of the Moon.”– Todd McCarthy, VARIETY“This exquisite documentary about the Apollo program takes the magic of moon flight and miraculously makes it downright down-to-Earth.”– Frank Lovece, FILM JOURNAL INTERNATIONALRatatouille – dir. Brad BirdStarring Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano and Peter O’TooleFilms about rats, it seems, don’t tend to go down well with the squeamish movie-going public. That’s just about the only way to explain the poorer-than-expected box office returns for the gem that is Ratatouille. Of course, we’re not talking bomb here – it’s currently sitting at around $300m so they won’t be remortgaging – but it’s a surprise considering it’s one of Pixar’s finest movies in a crop of fine movies.The project, about a gastronomic rat named Remy who finds himself the sous-sous-chef at a posh restaurant, has a troubled history; original director Jan Pinkava was replaced by Brad Bird with barely a year of the seven-year development time left on the clock. Pinkava left Pixar and has “no comment” on the whole affair, but given last year’s troubled Cars the tabloid tales have knocked a little of the sheen from Pixar.Fortunately the film – credit to Bird and Pinkava – is astonishing and more than settles any doubts about the affair affecting the movie. As is traditional with Pixar, the actors are chosen because they’re right for their characters and the film’s visuals shame every other CG movie released this year. Bring on Wall-E.“Displaying the usual meticulousness associated with the Pixar brand, Ratatouille is a nearly flawless piece of popular art.”– A.O. Scott, NEW YORK TIMES“A film as rich as a sauce béarnaise, as refreshing as a raspberry sorbet, and a lot less predictable than the damn food metaphors and adjectives all us critics will churn out to describe it. OK, one more and then I’ll be done: it’s yummy.”– David Ansen, NEWSWEEKDeath Proof – dir. Quentin TarantinoStarring Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson, Sydney Poitier and Zoe BellCaught up in this year’s Grindhouse scandal – Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez made two back-to-back flicks to be put out as one and then no-one in America went to see them – Death Proof is the Weinstein Company’s first attempt at recouping some of the expense internationally. It’s Tarantino’s half, which means lots of talking, lots of references to classic pop-culture, and plenty of hot women with well-manicured feet.The film follows Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) as he crosses country to do damage to a bevy of beauties in his “death proof” car – he can crash it at any speed and live to tell the tale. So we first meet Jungle Julia (Sydney Poitier) and her posse (Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd and, notsomuch, Rose McGowan) before the film shifts state and introduces us to stuntgirls Tracie Thoms and Zoe Bell (who was Uma’s stunt-double on Kill Bill and their friends Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rosario Dawson.But it’s not so much about the story or the characters as it is about the Tarantino dialogue, the homages to seventies B-movies and the fake film grain added to make it look like the print has been kicked around a bit. One segment is even in black-and-white suggesting it’s not even a complete print and the missing reel has been substituted with one from a black-and-white version of the film.Death Proof, the standalone, replaces a title card pointing to a missing reel in the Grindhouse version with the full version, a seedy lap dance from Ferlito. And it’s steamy-hot but, of course, all the good frames have been ripped out – presumably stolen by projectionists as the print gathered dust. It’s all a very heart-warming reference to classic B cinema.As a standalone, Death Proof is far more satisfying than it is as part of Grindhouse, though a scene with Michael Parks, while far too good to cut out, doesn’t working without the audience having seen Planet Terror. The irony is that, because Planet Terror builds to a crescendo ending and is followed by a film that takes a while to get going, Death Proof should have been the first part of Grindhouse and Planet Terror should have been the first to be released independently. Still, forgive the Weinstein mistakes and be sure you see Death Proof, even if you’re one of the lucky ones to have already seen Grindhouse.“All the nutrition of a narcotic compound.”– James Rocchi, CINEMATICAL“A beautiful piece of Americana. Stupid, and brilliant.”– Alistair McKay, SCOTLAND ON SUNDAYKnocked Up – dir. Judd ApatowStarring Seth Rogen, Katherine Heigl, Paul Rudd and Leslie MannThere’s a reason this comedy – usually a tough genre with the critics – is currently sitting in the nineties on the Tomatometer; it’s genuinely that good. From The 40-Year-Old Virgin helmer Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen stars as a man whose one-night-stand turns into a twenty-year commitment when his beau, Katherine Heigl, turns up pregnant. Oops.Perhaps the buzziest film of the year – an R-rated trailer first circulated virally ages ago – it’s a laugh-a-minute romp through hysterically inappropriate gags with Rogen chewing the scenery at every opportunity, and fantastic supporting performances from Paul Rudd and Alan Tudyk.Keep an eye out for Jonah Hill – you’re about to hear his name a lot when Superbad hits cinemas – and be sure to bring the girlfriend. Knocked Up‘s real success is that it appeals to every demographic, with just the right mix of cheap laughs and heartfelt drama that both sexes will fall in love with it, and it’s loveable “hero”.“A refreshingly frank, funny odd-couple comedy with engaging leads and too many belly laughs to count.”– Tom Charity, CNN.COM“Apatow’s gleefully raunchy movies are, in an odd and charming way, extremely family-friendly.”– Joe Leydon, VARIETYParanoid Park – dir. Gus van SantStarring Gabe Nevins, Taylor Momsen, Daniel Liu and Dillon HinesGus van Sant is fascinated with adolescence, and his fascination has thrown out some deeply meditative films in the last few years. From his Cannes triumph Elephant, through Last Days and now Paranoid Park, van Sant’s stoic trilogy is a labour of love that seems to shun convention at every turn.While Last Days, ostensibly a biopic of the final hours of Kurt Cobain, and Elephant, about high-school serial killers, have courted controversy, Paranoid Park plays things decidedly safer, adapting Blake Nelson’s novel about a skater boy who accidentally kills a security guard while venturing out-of-bounds on Portland’s rail network.And because it’s safer it’s also probably his most accessible of the three – Elephant and Last Days did little until their powerful endings while Paranoid Park first introduces us to Alex (played by newcomer Gave Nevins) before exploring how the accident affects his life.The film looks beautiful and is rather unconventionally shot in the square 4:3 aspect ratio, while 8mm cutaways punctuate the film gracefully. It’s a testament to van Sant’s ability that he can say so much by doing so little; you could collect the film’s dialogue on a postage stamp.“Van Sant has composed an emotional mosaic that brings you inside Alex.”– Kirk Honeycutt, HOLLYWOOD REPORTER“Bears some similarities with Elephant. A similarly photogenic teen milieu is shot with fluid, graceful camerawork; a non-linear structure slots together like a puzzle to reveal the panicked mindset of a boy under agreat deal of stress.”– Wendy Ide, THE TIMESTHE BEST OF THE RESTOf course, Edinburgh is about more than British and American movies – here we take a look at some top titles from the rest of the world, as well as a few British and American flicks that we couldn’t quite squeeze into the first two categories.Day Watch – dir. Timur BekmambetovStarring Konstantin Khabensky, Mariya Poroshina, Aleksei Chadov and Dima MartynovTimur Bekmambetov‘s follow-up to his masterful Night Watch – a film which came out of left field from Russia and gave Hollywood a run for its money – is possibly even less accessible than its predecessor. Day Watch cuts straight into the universe, grabbing its audience by the lapels and forcing us to remind ourselves of the story so far.It’s also decidedly more heartfelt than Night Watch; Khabensky’s Anton wrestling with a son who’s deserted him for the Day Watch and his responsibilities to his unit. The line Anton walks is blurrier than anything to come out of the big American studios, and it’s refreshing to see a little ambiguity.Jeannette Catsoulis says it best in the New York Times. Day Watch “dazzles and confuses with equal determination.”“Spectaculars don’t come much more bombastic than this goth-Russian supernatural epic.”– Colin Covert, MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE“The filmmakers destroy Moscow with the same glee that Godzilla has in stomping Tokyo. Even though Day Watch is probably a good 20 minutes too long, it’s easy to forgive its excesses because Bekmambetov just seems to be having so much fun.”– Beth Accomando, KPBS.ORGA Mighty Heart – dir. Michael WinterbottomStarring Angelina Jolie, Dan Futterman, Archie Panjabi and Irfan KhanWhen A Mighty Heart was first announced the reaction seemed to be shock – Angelina Jolie as a black woman? But it’s the story here that has the power, and her fine performance ensures nothing else matters.Still, it’s an odd project to see Michael Winterbottom direct. Considering he’s recently crafted films as varied as Road to Guantanamo, A Cock and Bull Story and, erm, 9 Songs we should be long past the point of surprise when it comes to the projects he works on, and yet who could have foreseen him direct Angelina Jolie in a film produced by Brad Pitt?Nevertheless, it wowed critics in Cannes and sent doubters – both from camps Jolie-isn’t-black and Winterbottom-doesn’t-do-Jolie – running. It’s a Winterbottom film through-and-through and the smart turns of the supporting cast – including Dan Futterman and Irfan Khan – make an impressive film even more impressive.“The director’s rapid-fire and choppy editing gives you a genuine feel for the many different sides of Karachi, and the urgency of the investigation.”– James Christopher, THE TIMES“What is best about A Mighty Heart is that it doesn’t reduce the Daniel Pearl story to a plot, but elevates it to a tragedy.”– Roger Ebert, CHICAGO SUN-TIMESWeirdsville – dir. Allan MoyleStarring Wes Bentley, Scott Speedman and Taryn ManningAllan Moyle‘s Weirdsville imagines a scenario that defines the term, “bad day.” When Royce and Dexter find the latter’s dead girlfriend following an overdose, it’s a simple trip to a seedy basement to bury the evidence. Only a group of satan-worshipping ne’er-do-wells happen to be doing their own ill deeds at the same time. And when the girlfriend can’t stay dead it seems like nothing is going to go their way.What follows is nothing short of riotous as the pair of hapless losers beg, steal and borrow their way to morning. Moyle, whose last big hit was 1995’s Empire Records serves up a devilishly intriguing black comedy that keeps you on tenterhooks ’til the end. Weirdsville may well be another cult classic in the making.Wes Bentley and Scott Speedman are brilliant as Royce and Dexter, while support from some cultists, a dead girlfriend, a bunch of drug dealers and a midget security guard keep them on their toes throughout.“A cleverly constructed, capably crafted and often uproarious shaggy-dog black comedy.”– Joe Leydon, VARIETY“So much gonzo enthusiasm that it’s impossible not to enjoy watching these crazed characters bounce off of each other.”– Rich Cline, SHADOWS ON THE WALLTwo Days in Paris – dir. Julie DelpyStarring Julie Delpy and Adam GoldbergIt’s rather fitting that actress Julie Delpy’s feature film debut would be Two Days in Paris. You can imagine the financiers meetings as she explained that it was about a couple, a French girl and an American boy, and their brief stay in the City of Love. The dollar signs in their eyes are as clear as day.And it’s with a brilliantly witty sense of irony that we behold the end result. If Before Sunset is one of the most romantic movies ever set in the French capital, its female lead has gone on to deliver one of the most unromantic. The culture clash is the source of much comedy between Delpy and the brilliantly on-form Adam Goldberg, but if Sunset is about how communication can reignite a relationship, Days is about how misreading it can be disastrous.It’s not very often a journalist will imply that watching a film is like witnessing a car crash powerless to do anything and mean that as a compliment, but in this case it’s definitely fitting. Two Days in Paris marks Delpy as a director to watch and its sharp wit will leave it resonating with anyone who’s ever found even the slightest fault in their partner.“Julie Delpy’s and Adam Goldberg’s performances are so assured and spontaneous that they don’t even seem to be acting.”– Stephen Holden, NEW YORK TIMES“[Delpy has] created two original, quirky characters so obsessed with their differences that Paris is almost a distraction. I don’t think I heard a single accordion in the whole film.”– Roger Ebert, CHICAGO SUN-TIMESRocket Science – dir. Jeffrey BlitzStarring Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D’Agosto and Aaron YooJeffrey Blitz first examined kids under the stress of hormones and intellectual competition in documentary form with Spellbound. With Rocket Science he this time spins a fictional yarn, but it nevertheless still manages to capture the real emotional minefield that is adolescence.Hal Heffner’s stutter is incurable by any therapist-recommended treatment, but when he meets Ginny Ryerson and she introduces him to the world of high school debating, he finds a project to immerse himself in; one that, he’s sure, will rid him of his impediment. But when Ginny starts playing truant from their meetings and the stress of his parents’ divorce begins to take its toll he wanders whether getting even is preferable to getting mad. Enlisting the help of former debating champion Ben Wekselbaum, he becomes determined to beat his former tutor at her own game.Reece Thompson’s nuanced performance as Hal betrays a talent beyond his age and Anna Kendrick’s Ginny is as beguiling as she is infuriating. It’s these two key performances that cement the emotional core of a film that succeeds through subtlety without ever having to hold back from its comedy. It’s certainly not the first quirky American indie to release, and its quirk threatens to alienate audiences who believe they’re tired of that sort of thing. Rocket Science matches its quirk with real emotional truth and that’s enough to separate it from the herd.“It may gross as little as Welcome to the Dollhouse or as much as Clueless, but whichever it does, it’s in the same league.”– Roger Ebert, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES“A fiercely personal and yet engaging–and often outright hysterical–look into a young man on the brink of adulthood.”– Rich Cline, SHADOWS ON THE WALLCheck the website for more details about the festival and use the links below to find out more about the movies, directors and stars referenced within!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Academy, comedies, Marathons, Fox, drama, and, story, indiana","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rtuks-what-to-watch-at-the-edinburgh-film-festival"},{"id":"47613287109100","title":"Ryan Phillippe, Eva Green, Sam Riley Join Franklyn","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ryan Phillippe, Eva Green, Sam Riley Join FranklynTrio signs on for McMorrow's debut.by Jeff Giles | September 21, 2007 |  CommentsRyan Phillippe, Eva Green, and Sam Riley are heading into the future.Variety reports that the trio has signed on to star in Franklyn, the feature-length debut from director Gerald McMorrow. The film’s synopsis, from the article:Pic, set in contemporary London and a future metropolis dominated by faith, weaves the tale of four lost souls divided by two parallel worlds on course for an explosive collision when a single bullet will decide all their fates.Yeah, we don’t really understand it either. But McMorrow’s previous effort, a short film titled Thespian X, won the Turner Classic Short Film Festival prize at the London Film Festival, as well as awards at the Tribeca and Berlin festivals, so he must know what he’s doing.

Sandra Bullock reached a new career high with the thriller \"Premonition,\" which debuted in third place while the horror film \"Dead Silence\" and the Chris Rock comedy \"I Think I Love My Wife\" opened in the top five with mixed results. \"300\" grossed as much as all three new releases combined.It was another decisive victory for Warner Bros. as \"300\" commanded the top spot with an estimated $31.2M in its second weekend dropping a sizable 56% from its record launch. Averaging a stellar $9,537 from 3,270 locations, the R-rated historical actioner raised its ten-day tally to a remarkable $127.5M making it the top-grossing film of 2007 in a short period of time.300’s second weekend gross was even bigger than the opening weekends for recent R-rated spring actioners like \"Sin City,\" \"Constantine,\" and \"V for Vendetta.\" Those films all dropped by more than half in their sophomore frames and collected 66-69% of their final grosses in the first ten days. 300 could follow in the same pattern and reach a colossal $180-190M domestically. That would be an impressive tally for a film with an estimated production cost of $60-65M.Overseas, the Spartan sensation scored number one openings this weekend in South Korea, Turkey, Thailand, Hong Kong, and India and grossed an estimated $15.6M overall from over 1,300 screens in 13 markets. The international total stands at $24.6M with major invasions scheduled this week in Europe and the United Kingdom.Buena Vista held steady in second place again with the motorcycle comedy \"Wild Hogs,\" which dropped only 32% to an estimated $18.8M in its third weekend. The Tim Allen–John Travolta hit crossed the $100M mark on Sunday in its 17th day of release pushing the cume to $104M. Despite dreadful reviews, \"Wild Hogs\" is holding up very well and could find its way to a sensational $150M domestically.Sandra Bullock scared up the biggest opening of her career with the supernatural thriller \"Premonition,\" which collected an estimated $18M to land in third place. The PG-13 film about a woman who relives a day in her life and tries to prevent the death of her husband averaged a solid $6,358 from 2,831 venues. Reviews were mostly negative for the Sony release. \"Premonition,\" Bullock’s first spooky thriller, beat out her previous best opening weekend performance of $16.2M which was generated by both \"Speed 2\" in 1997 and \"The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood\" in 2002. Adult women as expected led the way for the $20M production with studio research showing that 66% of the audience was female and 61% were 25 or older.Universal scared up a decent opening for its new horror entry \"Dead Silence,\" which debuted in 1,805 theaters to an estimated $7.8M. Averaging a moderate $4,305 per location, the R-rated film about a ventriliquist’s dummy on a deadly rampage was marketed as being from the director of \"Saw,\" James Wan. Reviews were not too bad for a fright flick not screened in advance for critics and actually scored the best marks of the weekend’s three new releases.Chris Rock saw a mild opening for his new comedy \"I Think I Love My Wife,\" which bowed to an estimated $5.7M from 1,776 locations for a $3,218 average. The Fox Searchlight release was written, directed, and produced by the former Oscar host who also played the lead, a mild-mannered husband tempted by a lovely young woman. Reviews were mostly negative. The opening for Wife failed to reach the heights of some of Rock’s other spring comedies like 2001’s \"Down to Earth\" ($17.3M, $6,850 average) or 2003’s \"Head of State\" ($13.5M, $6,278 average), which he also directed.Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten dipping just 24% in its fifth weekend to an estimated $5.1M for a solid $74.9M cume. Sony actioner \"Ghost Rider\" fell 40% to an estimated $4M lifitng the domestic total to $110.2M. Worldwide, the Nicolas Cage film will surpass the $200M mark later this week.Paramount’s acclaimed serial killer drama \"Zodiac\" continued to struggle with paying customers tumbling another 54% to an estimated $3.1M giving the David Fincher thriller a disappointing $28.9M in 17 days. The critically-panned Eddie Murphy comedy \"Norbit,\" on the other hand, has been pleasing audiences and dropped 36% to an estimated $2.7M pushing the cume to $92.4M for the studio. Rounding out the top ten was the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore comedy \"Music and Lyrics\" with an estimated $2.2M, down 41%, giving Warner Bros. $47.4M to date.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The slave trade drama \"Amazing Grace\" had strong legs once again and slipped just 17% to an estimated $2M. With $14.4M in the bank, the Samuel Goldwyn/Roadside Attractions release could end its run with $20M or more. Universal’s FBI thriller \"Breach\" has found success with its moderate release. The R-rated entry grossed an estimated $1.5M, off 42%, for a $31.3M total while playing in roughly 1,500 theaters during the past month. A $34M final seems likely. Jim Carrey‘s horror flick \"The Number 23\" has grossed $33.5M to date and should finish with a not-so-impressive $35M overall.In limited release, the best per-theater average once again came from Fox Searchlight’s \"The Namesake,\" which expanded from six to 41 theaters and grossed an estimated $692,000 for a strong $16,874 per location. The total for the well-reviewed Mira Nair film has reached $1.1M and the Indian-American drama will widen to over 100 theaters this Friday. Also doing well in limited play was the foreign language Oscar winner \"The Lives of Others,\" which took in an estimated $839,000. The German film dipped only 2% with no extra theaters and Sony Classics has grossed $4.6M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $98.6M which was up 10% from last year when \"V for Vendetta\" opened at number one with $25.6M; but off 4% from 2005 when \"The Ring 2\" debuted on top with $35.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Action","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-300-reigns-again-as-box-office-king"},{"id":"47613321292285","title":"Sydney Pollack: A Retrospective","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sydney Pollack: A RetrospectiveRT looks at the filmmaker's highest-rated films.by Alex Vo and Jen Yamato | May 27, 2008 |  CommentsWith two Oscar wins and plenty more nominations under hisbelt, Sydney Pollack was a filmmaker that Hollywood admired. He was also aproven actor’s director whose fruitful relationships with performers like RobertRedford resulted in films like Three Days of the Condor, The Way We Were,and Jeremiah Johnson; even his off-screen friction with Tootsieactor Dustin Hoffman gave way to one of Pollack’s most famous on-screenperformances.Pollack undoubtedly knew how to frame a star, working withthe likes of Jane Fonda, Sally Field, Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman and Paul Newmanto superb results. He also worked freely within genres, infusing thrillers,comedies, and Westerns with a personal brand of socio-political reflection.Below, we count down the ten highest-rated films that Pollack directed, and thentake a look at the late filmmaker’s most memorable performances in front of thecamera.more info…10. Sabrina (1995)Tomatometer: 62%Pollack took on the legacy ofBilly Wilder in updating the romantic comedy Sabrina, about a beautifulyoung woman (Julia Ormond) caught between a charming playboy (Greg Kinnear) andhis no-nonsense brother (Harrison Ford). While comparisons to the originalabound — along with its cast of Golden Hollywood legends Humphrey Bogart, AudreyHepburn, and William Holden — Pollack’s Sabrina turned out this side of Freshand garnered two Oscar nominations, for John Williams’ score and the song“Moonlight,” performed by Sting.&nbsp;&nbsp;moreinfo…09. This Property is Condemned (1966)Tomatometer: 64%A pre-GodfatherFrancis Ford Coppola co-scripted Pollack’s second feature (along with Fred Coeand Edith Sommer) based on a Tennessee Williams play; the result was theconsequently steamy, seamy tale of a boarding house floozy (Natalie Wood) and arailroad man (Robert Redford) caught in a tragic romance in a poor Mississippitown. Pollack would go on to direct Redford in six more films, including theOscar-winning Out of Africa.&nbsp;more info…08. The Scalphunters (1968)Tomatometer: 75%At the tail end of the civilrights movement, Pollack directed this social satire-masquerading-as-comedyWestern starring Burt Lancaster, Ossie Davis, Telly Savalas and Shelley Winters.When a trapper (Lancaster) is forced to “trade” his prized pelts for an educatedslave (Davis), he goes after the offending Indians; when they are in turn killedby a band of scalphunters (led by Savalas), he turns his attentions to them.Pollack would team up with Lancaster again in his next film, The Swimmer,co-directed with Frank Perry.&nbsp;more info…07. The Firm (1993)Tomatometer: 76%One of the few thrillers inPollack’s filmography (see Three Days of the Condor below) is TheFirm, which along with The Pelican Brief, helped launch a wave ofJohn Grisham fever in 1990s Hollywood. The tale of an ambitious attorney whodiscovers sinister doings at his new law firm also captured star Tom Cruise atthe height of his thirtysomething career; Pollack would reunite with Cruise sixyears later in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, appearing on the otherside of the camera.&nbsp;more info…06. Absence of Malice (1981)Tomatometer: 71%One of the best movies aboutjournalism came courtesy of former Detroit Free Press editor Kurt Luedtke, whoco-scripted Pollack’s Oscar-nominated film about a man with familial mob ties(Paul Newman) wrongly implicated in a crime by a hungry newspaper reporter(Sally Field). Supporting actress Melinda Dillon picked up her second AcademyAward nomination for her role as a devout woman whose tragic secret getssplashed across the front page.more info…05. Sketches of Frank Gehry (2006)Tomatometer: 81%Pollack’s lone documentaryfeature focuses on his close friend, prize-winning architect Frank Gehry. Thedirector integrated interviews with art-world celebrities like Dennis Hopper,Julian Schnabel, and even himself, creating an intimate and even look at the“starchitect” behind such awesomely warped feats as Spain’s Guggenheim Museum.&nbsp;moreinfo…04. They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?(1969)Tomatometer: 83%Dreams are dashed left andright in Pollack’s deeply moving spectacle of ambition and desperation at aDepression-era dance marathon, which earned a total of nine Oscar nominationsbut won only one, for Gig Young’s performance as the contest’s tireless MC. Italso earned Jane Fonda her first Oscar nod, marking a turning point in Fonda’scareer.&nbsp;more info…03. Three Days of the Condor (1975)Tomatometer: 89%Re-teaming with RobertRedford would prove very successful for Pollack, and he put Redford’s leadingman magnetism to work as Joe Turner, AKA Condor, a low-level CIA intelligenceoperative who becomes the target of a covert assassination plot. Evoking theHollywood thrillers and unsettled political climate of the 1970s (and suggestingJason Bourne long before the Bourne saga hit theaters), Three Days ofthe Condor excelled in creating taut, believable Hitchcockian suspense.&nbsp;more info…02. Tootsie (1982)Tomatometer: 89%Dustin Hoffman becameHollywood’s favorite cross-dresser with Tootsie, a comedy about a thornyactor so desperate for work that he turns to drag and becomes a soap operasensation — as a woman. The comedy was nominated for ten Oscars, winning onefor Jessica Lange as Best Supporting Actress; Pollack’s onscreen turn asHoffman’s aggravated agent brilliantly segued on-set tensions between thedirector and his star into one of the film’s most crackling scenes.&nbsp;more info…01. Jeremiah Johnson (1972)Tomatometer: 100%Pollack’s best-reviewed filmis yet another of his many collaborations with Robert Redford, the hard-bittensaga of a 19th century mountain man who encounters life, death, andIndians in the wide open terrain of Utah. While passed over by the Oscars — itwas the year of Cabaret, Deliverance, and The Godfather —Jeremiah Johnson nevertheless remains Pollack’s most criticallycelebrated work. As with many Pollack films, the Western isn’t merely a genreexercise; it’s also an existential character study that examines the impact ofliving the anti-establishment life, a driving theme in 1970s New Hollywood.Sydney Pollack started out in the business as an actor, appearing in 60stelevision fare like The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.He acted less frequently when he found his calling in directing and producing,which, in a way, made him a more fascinating actor; he found the freedom tochoose roles that played to his strengths and particular style. Here, we take alook at Pollack’s best roles in movies not directed by himself.&nbsp;moreinfo…Husbands and Wives (1992)Tomatometer: 100%Husbands and Wives is arguably Woody Allen’s most realized drama (thatdoesn’t involve murder), with its cinema verite filmmaking and strongperformances from Allen, Judy Davis, Mia Farrow, and Sydney Pollack. The roleof Jack is vintage Pollack, a man who never lets go of his measured regalityeven as his life begins to crumble away.There aren’t any Pollack clips on YT, but check out this fantastic scene with Davis.&nbsp;moreinfo…Eyes Wide Shut (1999)Tomatometer: 78%In Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, Pollack portrays Victor Ziegler, the closest this infamouslymurky movie gets to having a “bad guy.” He’s a complacent figure, watching ashis friend and doctor, William (Tom Cruise), goes on a nightmarish trip ofsexual politics and self-discovery.&nbsp;moreinfo…Changing Lanes (2001)Tomatometer: 78%Pollack made an acting career out of lawyers, businessmen, and meeting roomdwellers whose moral ethics never made a sinner out of him, but never quite theinnocent man, either. He delivers a speech in Changing Lanes that sums uphis MO: “I can live with myself because at the end of the day I think Ido more good than harm. What other standard have I got to judge by?”&nbsp;more info…Michael Clayton (2007)Tomatometer:91%Pollack re-enteredthe public consciousness at large with his brawny supporting role in MichaelClayton. Working in a law firm filled with “fixers” probably means yourmoral compasses are slight askew, but Pollack gives his role major gravitas,becoming a voice of reason as George Clooney freefalls into a diabolicalcover-up.&nbsp;more info…Made of Honor (2008)Tomatometer: 12%The wacky parent has long been a staple in romantic comedies Pollack gets histurn in the Patrick Dempsey-Michelle Monaghan vehicle, Made of Honor. Itmay not be the most glamorous final role, but at least demonstrates Pollack’swillingness to continually push himself as an actor, even after a spot wasreserved for him as a major movie director and producer.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tarantino, nature, new, awards, vampires, high, jurassic, Chernobyl, boxing, festivals, teaser, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sydney-pollack-a-retrospective"},{"id":"47613315935738","title":"Werner Herzog Taking Audiences on Antarctic Adventures","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Werner Herzog Taking Audiences on Antarctic AdventuresDirector's latest doc bowing in June.by Jeff Giles | March 13, 2008 |  CommentsThroughout his career, Werner Herzog has shown a fascination with protagonists in impossible situations. For his latest film, he took his cameras to what might be the most impossible place on Earth.Variety reports that Herzog’s Encounters at the End of the World, the director’s first documentary since 2005’s Grizzly Man, has been given distribution by ThinkFilm and Image Entertainment in association with Discovery Films. Encounters, which debuted at the Toronto Film Festival last year, looks at “the daily lives of Antarcticans.” From the article:Herzog is known for visually stunning and insightful portraits that telescope the starkest of individual experiences into metaphors about the human condition. Here, lensing entirely on location, he explores the existence of people working in literally blinding conditions, as well as natural elements such as a volcano and, yes, penguins.According to Variety, the film kicks off at the McMurdo Station research center, “with its yoga studios and ATMs,” before venturing into the icy wilderness surrounding the South Pole.Encounters at the End of the World is set to debut June 11.Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, The, awards, Critics, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"werner-herzog-taking-audiences-on-antarctic-adventures"},{"id":"47613314108921","title":"Juno, No Country for Old Men  Among Writers Guild Award Nominees","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Juno, No Country for Old Men Among Writers Guild Award NomineesOh, and by the way, the awards ceremony? Not happening.by Jeff Giles | January 11, 2008 |  CommentsIf there’s one Hollywood awards ceremony that you’d think would be able to go off without a hitch this year, it’d be the Writers Guild Awards — but you’d be wrong.According to The Hollywood Reporter, the WGA “pooped its own party” Thursday when the western branch unilaterally canceled its awards banquet, “blindsiding” WGA East. West and East traded brief statements in the wake of the announcement, with WGAW saying “There will be no Writers Guild of America, West show until the strike is over,” and the WGAE responding with “We are exploring our options, and we will let you know when we have made a decision.”Ah, creative types — they can never agree on anything. Anything, that is, except for nominations — the WGA at least got its stuff together long enough to come up with the following list of 2008 Writers Guild Award nominees. The list follows below, with Tomatometer percentages in parentheses:Original screenplayJuno, written by Diablo Cody (93 percent)Michael Clayton, written by Tony Gilroy (90 percent)The Savages, written by Tamara Jenkins (91 percent)Knocked Up, written by Judd Apatow (90 percent)Lars and the Real Girl, written by Nancy Oliver (79 percent)Adapted screenplayNo Country for Old Men, screenplay by Ethan Coen &amp; Joel Coen, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (95 percent)There Will Be Blood, screenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson, based on the novel Oil by Upton Sinclair (89 percent)The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, screenplay by Ronald Harwood, based on the book by Jean-Dominique Bauby (93 percent)Into the Wild, screenplay by Sean Penn, Based on the book by Jon Krakauer (82 percent)Zodiac, screenplay by James Vanderbilt, Based on the book by Robert Graysmith (89 percent)Documentary screenplayThe Camden 28, written by Anthony Giacchino (88 percent)Nanking, screenplay by Bill Guttentag &amp; Dan Sturman &amp; Elisabeth Bentley, story by Bill Guttentag &amp; Dan Sturman (96 percent)No End in Sight, written by Charles Ferguson (94 percent)The Rape of Europa, written by Richard Berge, Nicole Newnham and Bonni Cohen (76 percent)Sicko, written by Michael Moore (93 percent)Taxi to the Dark Side, written by Alex Gibney (100 percent)Source: The Hollywood Reporter","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"universal, 78th, Office, TNT, Association, Academy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"juno-no-country-for-old-men-among-writers-guild-award-nominees"},{"id":"47613372208665","title":"\"21 Grams,\" \"Babel\" Creators Innaritu and Arriaga on the Outs?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"21 Grams,\" \"Babel\" Creators Innaritu and Arriaga on the Outs?by Jen Yamato | October 4, 2006 |  CommentsRumor has it that the long-standing and successful partnership between Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga may be coming to an ugly end, just as their forthcoming festival fave \"Babel\" is set to hit theaters.According to the LA Times, a rift between the two had opened in recent years after Arriaga publicly attributed the success of the pair’s Oscar-nominated \"21 Grams\" to his own writing; this year, Innaritu returned the slight by banning Arriaga from the Cannes premiere of \"Babel,\" where the film won Innaritu the Best Director award. The two first worked together on 2000’s Spanish-language \"Amores Perros,\" which earned an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign film and helped to jumpstart Mexico’s recent cinematic revival.Brad Pitt stars in Innaritu and Arriaga’s \"Babel,\" already on the Oscar trailWhile Innaritu has never directed a feature-length film without Arriaga as his screenwriter, Arriaga wrote \"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada\" for director Tommy Lee Jones, for which he won the 2005 Cannes award for Best Screenplay.The writer has commented in the past about the growing recognition of writers in film. Doing press for \"21 Grams\" back in 2004, the sometime novelist indicated to the Guardian that good writers are increasingly becoming more important than directors:\"It’s happening already. I think people are waiting for the new Charlie Kaufman movie rather than worrying about who is directing it. I think most people go to David Mamet‘s films because of Mamet the writer, not Mamet the director. People go to films for the stories. They remember the films for the stories. And there’s a huge crisis in stories and storytellers.\"Meanwhile, the multi-lingual, linearly fractured drama \"Babel\" currently sits on an 89% Tomatometer and is garnering more and more awards-season attention its October 27 release approaches.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium, Max, festival, spanish, Unbreakable, cinematic, Century, Cinematographers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"21-grams-babel-creators-innaritu-and-arriaga-on-the-outs"},{"id":"47613391620642","title":"6 Horror Films That Will Give You All the Feels… After They Terrify You","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})6 Horror Films That Will Give You All the Feels... After They Terrify YouIt doesn't happen often, but sometimes the scariest horror flicks can also move you to tears. Valerie Complex breaks down the 21st-century terrifiers that moved her the most.by Valerie Complex | October 27, 2020 |  CommentsMy motto is, no matter what, if a film moves me, there is no shame in turning on the waterworks. I ugly cried in the theater during Disney’s Coco, I sobbed through the second half of Titanic, and I bawled my eyes out for the third and fourth installments of Toy Story. But I’ve been known to get teary-eyed during scary movies, too — when I say I’ll cry if a film moves me, I do mean any&nbsp;film, including horror.It may seem odd to get emotional during horror films, but they can do so much more than just be terrifying. Some can&nbsp;inspire sadness, hope, or even happiness.&nbsp;The first one I remember getting me in my feelings is Candyman (1992); I was nine years old and begged my father to take me to see it. While the film terrified me throughout, a dramatic tear rolled down my cheek during the last 15 minutes. There was something about sacrifice and children that got to me, even at a young age — it still gets me to this day.As Halloween approaches, we revisited some of the films that include a little slashing, a little bashing, and a little sensitivity.&nbsp;Got suggestions of horror movies that made&nbsp;you&nbsp;weep? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;[Warning: Major spoilers follow below.]The Monster (2016) 80%Lizzie (Ella Balentine) is a bright young 11-year-old who has to deal with her mother Kathy’s (Zoe Kazan) alcoholic, abusive, unpredictable ways. As they travel on the road at night, they find themselves stranded on an isolated road in the middle of nowhere, fighting for their lives against one ugly forest monster.Cry Factor:&nbsp;The best mother and daughter bonding happens on this frightful night. You don’t get the sense that Kathy cares for Lizzie until it’s life or death; as a mother who feels she’s given her child nothing but strife, the only thing left for Kathy to do is to sacrifice her own life so Lizzie has a fighting chance to survive. The characters started crying, and then I started crying. It’s a scary cry fest!Dark Water (2002) 81%In this moody Japanese horror film by Hideo Nakata, single mom Yoshimi Matsubara (Hitomi Kuroki) is dealing with a bitter divorce and custody battle for her young daughter, Ikuko (Rio Kanno). As the two try to start life anew in their new apartment, ghostly apparitions of a young girl with a red backpack begin to haunt them, and it’s clear something supernatural — and evil — is afoot.Cry Factor:&nbsp;This movie is just sad all around. The body of a young girl who drowned in the building water tower still lingers in it; her spirit haunts the building’s hallways looking for a new “mother” to latch onto, and&nbsp;Yoshimi is it. The woman must choose between crossing over to be with this ghost child or allowing her own daughter to be possessed by the spirit.&nbsp;Yoshimi ultimately decides to sacrifice herself so&nbsp;Ikuko can live in peace. Ten years later, Ikuko returns to the site of her mother’s disappearance and sees her ghost, who assures her that she’s OK in the afterlife and not to worry, providing rare horor-film closure for Ikuko.Pulse (Kairo) (2005) 75%A college student commits suicide on a live internet stream, setting off a&nbsp;chain reaction across Tokyo that causes others to follow suit. The film follows Michi (Kumiko Aso), Ryosuke (Haruhiko Kato), and Harue (Koyuki), three unrelated folks whose stories eventually converge in this atmospheric, supernatural horror in which the internet plays a&nbsp;pivotal role.Cry Factor: Kairo isn’t a typical horror film as it’s more about existentialism than anything else. Ghosts are lonely, and they travel through the internet to make contact with the living. In the end, 85% of the population is gone, and Michi begins to realize the power of human connection. The film&nbsp;asserts that death is just as finite as the living world, and if people cannot connect in life, they will be forced to do it in death.&nbsp;It will hit you in the feels, ya’ll.Pan's Labyrinth (2006) 95%Many consider this to be Guillermo del Toro’s best film. The horror/fantasy tale is told&nbsp;against the backdrop of Franco’s authoritarian rule over Spain amd packs an emotional punch. The film follows 12-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), otherwise known as Princess Moanna of the underworld, who meets a faun that wants to help her return to her kingdom. In reality,&nbsp;Ofelia lives a harsh&nbsp;life&nbsp;with her stepfather, a captain under Franco’s regime.Cry Factor: Ofelia’s mortal mother dies, and she herself is&nbsp;abused by her stepfather and nearly eaten by the Pale Man, all while living under Franco’s rule. This kid goes through it all. Just when you think she’s victorious, she’s shot and killed by her stepfather. Not all is bleak in death, though: she returns to the underworld to rule as its princess once again. How can you not feel anything from that?Spring (2015) 85%If Before Sunrise and H.P. Lovecraft had a baby, it would be the horror/romance film Spring. Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci) is an American in Italy learning how to farm. He meets Louise (Nadia Hilker), a genetics student, and it’s love at first sight. The two exchange life stories, but Louise forgets to mention she is a 2,000-year-old Cthulhu-like monster. Until, that is, Evan catches her one day in the midst of a transformation phase that’s pretty gnarly to witness.Cry Factor: Evan sees this transformation and doesn’t care; he is still in love with Louise. She explains this is a hereditary trait that helps her achieve immortality. She injects a special serum to keep herself in human form, but every 20 years, she&nbsp;must transform into a new look and new body – the only thing that will stop this process is falling in love. The duo decide to spend&nbsp;Louise’s final moments in her present form together, but when the time comes,&nbsp;the transformation doesn’t happen because she’s in love with Evan. It’s enough to bring tears to your eyes and&nbsp;butterflies to your stomach.The Orphanage (2007) 87%Creepy dead children, a haunted house, and a mother at her wits’ end trying to find her missing son – nothing is as it seems in The Orphanage. Laura’s (Belén Rueda) son Simón (Roger Princep) is missing, and she is desperate to find him. The cops aren’t helpful, and she’s seeing frightening apparitions of dead children in her home, a former orphanage. Laura can’t decipher if she’s going mad or if the ghosts are trying to tell her something.Cry Factor:&nbsp;Laura has truly lost all hope, but emotions escalate when she discovers she killed her son by accident and didn’t even realize it: What she thought was the ghost of one of the creepy children was, in fact, her own child in disguise.&nbsp;You’ll tear up just thinking about it even years after watching. The film ends on a bittersweet note, as Laura commits suicide to cross over and be with Simon and the other children. Now she too is a part of the orphanage.Thumbnail image by&nbsp;©Picturehouse Entertainment courtesy Everett CollectionOn an Apple device?

Acquisitions of this year’s entries focused mainly on big names (Steve Carell) and wide appeal, as \"Little Miss Sunshine\" started things off with a $10 million deal followed by pics like \"The Darwin Awards,\" \"The Science of Sleep,\" \"Factotum\" and \"The Night Listener.\" Even the smaller films that secured distribution deals boasted recognizable names — \"Stay\" (directed by Bobcat Goldthwait), \"Right at Your Door\" (with Rory Cochrane and Mary McCormack), and the recent ThinkFilm acquisition, \"Half Nelson\" (starring Ryan Gosling).One look at the award winners announced Saturday night reveals the disparity between the best films in the festival and those that secured distribution deals. Setting precedence by winning two awards each in their respective categories, the two top winners both examined immigrant life in America.Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland‘s \"Quinceneara\" boasts an unknown cast in the story of a Latina girl ostracized by her immigrant family when she becomes pregnant, and won both the prestigious Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award for best Drama.Likewise, Christopher Quinn‘s documentary \"God Grew Tired Of Us\" won both Grand Jury and Audience Awards for best Documentary with it’s story of three Sudanese boys who trekked thousands of miles across their war-torn homeland and eventually found refuge in America.By the end of the festival, neither of the history-making winners had secured a distribution deal.Other winners in Sundance competition include Mexico’s \"In The Pit\" (World Cinema Jury Prize: Documentary), France’s \"13 Tzameti\" (World Cinema Jury Prize: Dramatic), Mexico’s \"De NADIE\" (World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary), and New Zealand’s \"No. 2\" (World Cinema Audience Award: Dramatic).Honors also went to James Longley‘s doc \"Iraq In Fragments,\" which won honors for Documentary Directing, Excellence in Cinematography, and Documentary Film Editing; \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\" helmer Dito Montiel for Dramatic Directing; and \"Right At Your Door\" lensman Tom Richmond for Excellence in Cinematography.Special Jury Prizes went to \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\" for Best Ensemble Performance; Julia Kwan’s \"Eve &amp; the Fire Horse;\" So Yong Kim‘s \"In Between Days;\" and docs \"American Blackout\" and \"TV Junkie.\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"marvel, Anna, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sundance-end-of-festival-awards-announced"},{"id":"47613363670548","title":"RTIndie: IFC Beefs Up On-Demand","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RTIndie: IFC Beefs Up On-DemandPlus, King of Kong helmer blows up and Fireflies gets remadeby Tim Ryan | August 22, 2007 |  CommentsThis week at RTIndie: IFC brings indies to the people; Seth Gordon capitalizes on the success of The King of Kong; anime classic Grave of the Fireflies gets the remake treatment; and a Certified Fresh Mumblecore touchstone is our DVD Pick of the Week.IFC Beefs Up Theatrical/On-Demand Program First, the bad news for IFC: The company’s attempts to distribute bigger-budget movies didn’t work. The good news for people who like indie movies: IFC will be giving more attention to its First Take program, in which smaller films will receive a theatrical and on-demand release on the same day.The First Take films include indie movies with budgets under $3 million and foreign fare. So far, First Take has released This Is England (92 percent on the Tomatometer), The Wind That Shakes the Barley (88 percent), and Black Sheep (70 percent) simultaneously in theaters and on cable; Gus Van Sant‘s Paranoid Park and the Palme D’Or winner 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days are some of the program’s upcoming highlights. Even if these films only play in a few cities during their theatrical runs, they can be seen in 40 million homes, increasing the availability for edgier first-run fare.This week’s First Take release is Joe Swanberg‘s Hannah Takes the Stairs, which tells the story of a young woman’s romantic connections and disconnections over the course of a summer. Swanberg told RT he’s thrilled to have the added exposure of cable not only as a filmmaker, but as a movie buff as well.“It’s really exciting,” Swanberg said. “I live in Chicago, where I have to wait a really long time for a lot of movies to come through, so that’s really cool.”IFC’s attempt to go big(ger) time didn’t really pay off. Despite strong reviews (Certified Fresh at 77 percent on the Tomatometer) You Kill Me didn’t exactly kill at the box office, taking in around $2.4 million. The movie, starring Ben Kingsley, Téa Leoni, and Luke Wilson, was something of a test case for IFC’s plan for distributing indies with slightly larger budgets. Subsequently, IFC decided to scrap its release of Penelope, starring Christina Ricci and Reese Witherspoon, and has no bigger movies on its release slate.(Check out our full interview with Swanberg here. Also, we caught Paranoid Park at Cannes; click here for our review.)Like An Accomplished Gamer, Kong Helmer Gordon Moves Up A Level Things are looking good for Seth Gordon, as his Slamdance-approved doc The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters continues to make waves. Not only is Kong winning near-universal praise from critics (it’s currently at 97 percent on the Tomatometer), it’s getting Gordon plenty of attention from Hollywood.Gordon has signed on to direct Four Christmases, a comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon about a couple, each with divorced parents, who must find a way to attend four Christmas celebrations. The project, which will be distributed by New Line, previously had several directors attached, according to the Hollywood Reporter.In addition, Cinematical notes that Gordon is starting work on The Only Living Boy in New York, the tale of a down-on-his-luck post-collegiate who finds himself contemplating an affair with his dad’s mistress. Columbia Pictures will release the film in 2008.And that’s not all. It appears Gordon is also in the early stages of a fictional remake of The King of Kong, and hopes to attract the services of such notables as Johnny Depp or Edward Norton to play one of the gamers. The documentary version tells the story of two archrivals who do battle in the realm of Donkey Kong.Fireflies Rises From the Grave in Live-Action RemakeThere have been a ton of cartoons and comics that have gotten live-action remakes; it appears the latest will be the classic 1988 animated feature Grave of the Fireflies. ScreenDaily is reporting that Taro Hyugaji will helm the remake, which tells the harrowing story of two children left homeless by bombings in the last days of WWII. The original (89 percent), directed by Isao Takahata, is one of the seminal masterpieces of anime, but that doesn’t mean filmmakers haven’t tried to give the story another go before. In 2005, another version of Fireflies was produced for Japanese television.RTIndie DVD Pick of the Week: Mutual AppreciationMovie critics are always on the lookout for a filmmaker who’s the “voice of their generation.” In the case of Andrew Bujalski, said voice is peppered with “ums,” “likes,” and “y’knows.” But don’t mistake his latest, Mutual Appreciation, as mere emo posturing. With Appreciation and his previous film, Funny Ha Ha, Bujalski has carved out a distinctive niche in the world of no-budget filmmaking; he has a wonderful ear for how twentysomethings express themselves — or, as the case may be, try to figure out how they feel as they talk. Mutual Appreciation is a few days in the live of Alan (Justin Rice), an Elvis Costello-esque indie rocker looking for a band — and finding himself in the midst of several romantic possibilities. Don’t be put off by the grainy black-and-white cinematography or the hipster trappings; Bujalski gets remarkable performances from his cast of unknowns, and post-collegians (or introspective-types of any age) will see a lot of themselves in Mutual Appreciation. And the music’s pretty good, too. Appreciation is at 88 percent on the Tomatometer; it, along with Funny Ha Ha and Swanberg’s Hannah Takes the Stairs, are playing in New York as part of The New Talkies: Generation D.I.Y., which runs through Sept. 4.)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"VOD, 21st, festival, slashers, drama, TCA, on, foreign, Trophy, History, Valentine's, America, Trek","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rtindie-ifc-beefs-up-ondemand"},{"id":"47613385937439","title":"SAG Award Winners Revealed, Oscar Predicting Hits Full Steam","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})SAG Award Winners Revealed, Oscar Predicting Hits Full Steamby Alex Vo | January 30, 2007 |  CommentsKnown as a big predictor of what’ll go down Oscar night, the Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony took place last Sunday to a rapturous Hollywood crowd without a hitch (or surprises or upsets). Check out the full winners list below, along with analysis on how the SAG results affect the Oscar nominees’ chances.The SAG Awards frequently mirror Oscar nominations and wins. And this year, they’re more similar than in recent memory. Of the 25 Acting and Best Picture nominations, the SAG and Oscar disagree only twice: the SAG reserved a Supporting Actor nom spot for Leonardo DiCaprio, while the Academy has eyes for Mark Wahlberg (both for \"The Departed\"). And in the Best Picture category, the SAG had \"Bobby\" whereas the Oscars have \"Letters from Iwo Jima.\"\"There appears to be a developing unanimity about the year’s best actors,\" writes Hollywood Reporter’s Gregg Kilday. Indeed, who doubted that Forest Whitaker (Male Actor winner for \"The Last King of Scotland\"), Jennifer Hudson (the Supporting Female Actor winner for \"Dreamgirls\"), or Helen Mirren (Outstanding Female Actor for \"The Queen\") wouldn’t be going home empty-handed? They’ve dominated all the other awards shows prior to the SAG Awards.\"The Queen\": Helen Mirren phones it in.However, it’s hard to say that \"Dreamgirls‘\" Eddie Murphy, who took home the Outstanding Supporting Male Actor award, is guaranteed the same Oscar reward. According to OscarWatch, every actor nominated for the Supporting Actor Oscar have won roughly the same number of awards as he has.The same can be said for the Best Picture Oscar. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" won Best Ensemble Acting (the SAG’s Best Picture equivalent), but the other Best Picture Oscar nominees have just about the same number of accolades. And \"Little Miss Sunshine’s\" directors snub from the Academy can be another problem. Risky Biz Blog points out that only twice has a Best Picture winner not also have its director(s) nominated (1932’s \"Grand Hotel\" and 1989’s \"Driving Miss Daisy\").Eddie Murphy is SAGacious in \"Dreamgirls.\"Kilday also notes that \"no one film has dominated the best picture race this awards season.\" Oscar nominess \"The Departed,\" \"Babel,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" and \"The Queen\" have all been accumulating accolades at about the same rate. \"Letters From Iwo Jima\", however, lags far behind.The cast surveys the scene in \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"And in the case of \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" it can also be said that comedies almost never win the Best Picture. Then again, stranger things have happened.

He hadn’t read the source novel when he auditioned for therole of Amir (the character’s journey back to Afghanistan to atone for childhood mistakesis the story’s main plot), didn’t speak a word of Dari, and had acted in only oneprior film.&nbsp; But that film was the Oscar-nominated United 93,and his memorable performance as Ziad Jarrah happened to grab the right people’sattention.In Rotten Tomatoes’ second Kite Runner interview (you canread our interview with author Khaled Hosseinihere,while our interview with writer and novelist David Benioff will run later thisweek), we met with Khalid Abdalla in San Francisco to discuss Afghanistan, hisrelationship with the children on set, and why The Kite Runner (openingthis Friday) is quintessentially an American story.Were you a fan of the book before auditioning for the role of Amir?Khalid Abdalla: I always wish I could say that I read it before I was asked to audition for it, but I hadn’t. I first heard about it when I was asked to audition for it. But then I read it immediately. I went out and bought two copies, in fact. I read it in a day and thought it was an extraordinary story.You have a strong background in theater. How does that come into play when filming a feature, like United 93 and The Kite Runner?KA: Obviously there’s a huge difference between the mediums, but essentially you’re dealing with the same material. In some ways, it’s a different way of expressing it and you’ve got different means to do so. As an actor, it feels kind if similar. But United 93, it was a totally unorthodox filming experience. Our average take was 25 minutes and our longest take was an hour and 15 minutes, which is kind of unheard of — and it was entirely improvised. I guess a theater background helped with that because you’re running at it in long sequences, but each film comes with its own challenges. The essential thing that binds them all together is trying to tell stories for audiences, whether it’s for theater or film. Being able to share my experience with people is what I love.Amir is such a well-known character from the novel. How did you approach portraying him on-screen?KA: I guess it really started for me after the first audition. Marc Forster called me to tell me, “It’s you, it’s you. But first, we have to go to Afghanistan to find someone to play the younger Amir.” So they went to Afghanistan for three months to search for as many people as they could, and a month and a half later, they found the boys. During that time I didn’t want to get into the role, I was being held back like a bull. I really wanted to go at it, but I felt that if I did, I wouldn’t get the part — kind of a superstitious feeling. Then finally with six days notice I got a call saying, “We’ve found the boys. Get on the plane.” Six days later, I’m in Kabul.I spent a month in Afghanistan and that month was absolutely extraordinary and crucial. I was born in Scotland, brought up in London, my parents are Egyptian, my father was born in Illinois. I’d never been to Afghanistan. In that month, I was in total immersion. I banished English completely, had Dari lessons five hours a day. I ate everything I had never eaten before, I went everywhere that was referenced in the book, I built my relationship of love with Afghanistan during that period. I did everything I could and the reward I got at the end was being able to speak the language, which I managed to do in a month somehow.I’ve heard that people who are completely fluent in Dari have seen the film and think you are totally conversant.KA: I had to take on that responsibility, it wasn’t a question. I know what it feels like to be misrepresented on-screen. This is an opportunity. This is the first film for the region, and particularly for Afghanistan, where the first point of contact is a human family story instead of what everyone’s used to with political violence and bombs. To go in and not to do that as authentically as possible would be absurd. It would be so wrong. That’s why everyone gave as much as they could to it. That was part of my responsibility. I could never forgive myself if at the end of the film, Afghans would walk out feeling misrepresented.Marc Forster has a beautiful phrase that this film is “a love letter to Afghanistan.” If I didn’t commit myself completely I would feel like I had destroyed it. It hurts to be misrepresented, that’s why I gave everything that I could. It’s really beautiful to be part of something which is, as well as being a great story, a cultural project. It’s giving in so many directions, which is part of the pride. Hopefully that’s what translates onto film. The film is made by people who love the book. People came from 26 different countries and we had 46 languages on average to translate from on the set each day. It was about people, not borders, and it’s that spirit that’s in the approach.Do you think the film will help some people’s preconceived notions about Afghanistan?KA: I certainly hope so. That is definitely what the book is about. So many people say that in reading the book, they thought of Afghanistan in a totally different way. I hope that when people see the film, they feel like they traveled to Afghanistan. When you have a meeting with someone you’ve never met before from a different country, you never meet them through a bomb. You meet them through their own stories and hopefully that’s what the film does.A lot of the appeal of the book has to do with the fact that this friendship could take place anywhere. Many readers can relate to the story, no matter where they come from.KA: It’s a quintessentially American story, just 100 years late. It’s a story of leaving your homeland to come and make a life in America. It is a story that so many immigrants in this country have lived through. With my background, and this opportunity to travel to Afghanistan, I like to think of myself as a person who is not so interested in borders. I’m interested in people and their stories.One of the things that struck me about The Kite Runner is how many Afghan refugees live in this country.KA: Absolutely. Afghanistan is a country that had at one point over six million refugees. When you think of the traumas that means for a whole country, the journeys they’ve had to make, the family members who have died along the way, a story like The Kite Runner becomes a drop in a nation. Most people don’t associate that with Afghanistan, they think of the people that brutalized the country rather than the people who were brutalized.The friendship between young Amir and Hassan plays an integral part in the story, but as the adult Amir, you don’t have any scenes with them. Did you watch their scenes being filmed?KA: I was there every day. I think there were only ten shots that I missed. I met the boys for the first time in Kabul. We learned how to fly kites together. I was there each day supporting them and they came to support me as well. We developed a special relationship.The children in the film were incredible.KA: They were extraordinary. It’s a really special age as well. It’s an incredible act of casting of well. It’s kind of there in the book, that final moment of childhood. A year-and-a-half later, they start becoming teenagers. And that’s a very different age.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Syfy, curtis, Marathons","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"actor-khalid-abdalla-on-the-kite-runner-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613418043952","title":"Guide of the Dead – An RT Romero Retrospective","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Guide of the Dead - An RT Romero RetrospectiveAs Diary hits cinemas, we take a look at Romero's zombie opus.by Chris Hewitt (UK) | March 7, 2008 |  CommentsHow George A. Romero covered capitalism, consumer culture, human nature, politics and blogging through the eyes of thousands of zombies…WORDS: Chris Hewitt PORTRAIT: Larry Busacca DESIGN: Joe Utichi&gt;&gt; Continue to Part One: Night of the Living Dead &gt;&gt;When the dead start returning to life with a hunger for human flesh, a disparate band of survivors hole up in a Pittsburgh farmhouse, bicker amongst themselves, and try to stop themselves from winding up on an undead menu as a unique three-course set meal. Coffee not included.Far from it. The zombies in Night of the Living Dead, according to film historian Robin Wood, represent capitalists, feasting on the flesh of society’s outsiders. But as would rapidly become the pattern in Romero‘s films, the zombies aren’t really the villains. Instead humans are, with Harry Cooper (Karl Hardman) openly fighting with the film’s black hero, Ben (Duane Jones), and even trying to kill him. At the end, Ben is the sole survivor, but is shot in the head by a patrol crew who ‘mistake’ him for a zombie. The subtle implication is that, had Ben been white, he would still have been alive.The hero. By making his hero an African-American, particularly one who’s reasoned and intelligent, Romero was overtly addressing the racial politics that were engulfing America at the time. It would become a trend in his movies.Barbara, played by Judith O’Dea. A far cry from the ass-kickers of later Romero episodes, Barbara spends most of the movie in a catatonic trance, traumatised by the fate she’s just seen befall her brother.Minimal in this movie, although scenes of ghouls feasting on flesh and Karen Cooper trowelling her mom to death are dripping with black goo that, legend has it, was actually chocolate sauce. At this point in time, Romero hadn’t yet met a young man named Tom Savini and the gore is surprisingly restrained.It’s hard to top “They’re coming to get you, Barbara!”, spoken by Barbara’s brother, Johnny. Referenced in the likes of Shaun of the Dead, it’s also a paranoid classic to rival Kevin McCarthy‘s “They’re here!” in Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, itself a cracking political allegory.The movie was originally called Night Of The Flesh Eaters.“I was brought up on Tales Of Hoffman and movies like Othello and Macbeth. Those were the visual influences — hard shadow, hard light, obvious sources. I tried to make it look like newsreel. I used a handheld Arriflex and I felt so free!”The zombie epidemic is threatening to engulf the world, forcing a disparate band of survivors to hole up in a Pittsburgh shopping mall, which they turn into their own private paradise. But, with zombies and roving biker gangs trying to get in, their idyll may not remain uninterrupted for long.Dawn of the Dead is an overt attack on American consumer culture — not only do the zombies return to a shopping mall, which is described as the place that made them happiest, but it turns our four protagonists into zombies, deadening their souls. In fact, so gripped with avarice are two of the group — Steven and Roger — that they perish while trying to protect what they’ve built, as if material goods are worth a tinker’s cuss in Romero’s apocalyptic world. Once again, as when a biker gang invades the group’s little world and starts pulling it down around them, destroying stores for no good reason, you’re reminded that Romero is, more often than not, on the side of the zombies. Traitor.The hero. Ken Foree‘s effortlessly cool, iconic Peter is perhaps the most memorable character in each of the five Dead films. A big bear of a man, Peter’s a born action hero, but he’s not without his compassionate moments, and his genuine affection for his compadre, Roger, hits home in the film’s most affecting sequence, when he is forced to blow his newly-zombified buddy’s brains out.Gaylen Ross‘s Fran, and she’s several steps up from the appallingly one-dimensional Barbara, showing Romero’s marked dedication to fleshing out his female protagonists. Initially, she seems to be very much the token girlfriend as Roger (Scott H. Reiniger), Steven (David Emge) and Peter run around the mall, but gradually she becomes more assertive. In the end, it’s her determination to learn to pilot the group’s helicopter that saves her and Peter from a fate worse than death. OK, scratch that — just death. But as fates go, it’s still pretty nasty.High, and in bright Technicolor red, too. By this point, Romero had hooked up with Tom Savini (who also plays the leader of the biker gang), and the special effects guru runs wild here, splattering the place with bright red blood and some of the best headshots in movie history. Check out the impromptu Jackson Pollock that explodes onto a wall near the movie’s end – or, of course, the infamous helicopter gag when rotor blades (actually animated and hand-drawn onto the frame) whip off the top of a zombie’s brain. Interestingly, Greg Nicotero, Romero’s go-to guy for FX these days, was inspired to get into the business by a flesh-biting gag in the first 20 minutes of the movie.Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause, please, for the iconic, “When there’s no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.” In early drafts, this line actually read, “When there’s no more room in the last carriage, please wait. A new train will arrive in two minutes.”This is the first Romero zombie film in which the Z-word is actually uttered.“When I made the first film I was always concerned about this idea, the reason to do this stuff is to upset the applecart and what everyone seems to do is restore the order at the end of these things, which is what I never want to do. At the end of Dawn in the script, I had everybody die and I realised that I was doing it because it was a sequel. I realised I could save a couple of these individuals without restoring the world!”OK, everything’s fucked, to put it mildly. With zombies now outnumbering humans by 400,000 to 1, mankind is at the bottom of the food chain and things are looking bleaker than a Scottish winter. Needless to say, a disparate band of survivors hole up in an underground military complex and bicker, argue and generally fight amongst themselves in Romero’s bleakest vision yet.Day of the Dead, Romero’s ’80s entry in his Dead franchise is the most overt attack on human nature yet. Save for a handful of sympathetic characters, Romero populates his film with appalling villains, from leering and mocking grunts, to the utterly black-hearted Captain Rhodes (Joe Pilato, who appears briefly as a different character in Dawn of the Dead), who is already unhinged when we meet him and rapidly heads south from there into gibberdom. In this, when the zombies attack, it’s generally a relief, while famously Romero works hard to humanise, for the first time, a major zombie character, in the shape of Howard Sherman‘s sympathetic and likeable Bub.The secondary protagonist, with Terry Alexander’s John a laidback Haitian helicopter pilot who is content to sit out the simmering civil war tearing the group apart, until fate — and zombies — force his hand. It’s a departure from the ass-kicking Peter of Dawn, but Terry is a more cerebral character.The hero – and the strongest female character in Romero’s canon. Sarah (Lori Cardille) is a scientist trying to keep it together in the face of extreme provocation: her colleagues, particularly Richard Liberty‘s demented Dr. Logan, are ineffective fruitcakes. Her army ‘protectors’ either want to kill her or rape her. And her boyfriend, Miguel, is a soldier who makes Captain Rhodes look sane. Sympathetic and three-dimensional, Sarah isn’t a saint by any means, but she’s more proactive than any of Romero’s previous heroines.Off the chart, with Savini coming up with grotesque new gags that forced Romero to reduce his vision for the film, after his financiers offered him a larger budget in return for an R-rating. Refusing to compromise, Romero rewrote his massive script for Day, plumping for a smaller budget but more gore. And boy, are we glad, particularly in the iconic moment when Pilato is ripped apart by zombies, yelling “choke on ’emmmmmm!” as zombies drag his entrails across the floor.The aforementioned “Choke on ’emmmmmm!”Damon Albarn’s cartoon band, Gorillaz, sampled John Harrison‘s theme for M1 A1, a song on their debut album.“I love Howard Sherman in that movie. Some of the stuff he did, I was just in awe. The moment when he picks up Salem’s Lot — wow!”Those pesky zombies are still stumbling around and biting anything they can get their manky hands on. However, small pockets of survivors have finally got their shit together, and built well-protected enclaves, boasting some semblance of a social hierarchy. No prizes, though, for guessing that, at some point, zombies are going to get in and get their chomp on…No, indeed. Romero waited over a decade to make a fourth zombie movie and, when Land of the Dead came, it was loaded with political and social comment, from the thinly-disguised pokes at the Bush administration (Dennis Hopper‘s character might as well be called Rumsfeld) to jabs at the War on Terror (largely fought here, it’s suggested, by just ignoring the problem and hoping it’ll go away) to digs at the class structure of American society, where the rich white man prospers and everyone else can go hang.A zombie! But it’s ok, it’s a hero zombie. Continuing the evolution of the zombies from shambling ghouls to sympathetic characters, Romero gives us Big Daddy, a giant ex-mechanic (played by Eugene Clark) who galvanises his zombie hordes into an army that storms the enclave and reclaims the land for themselves. A land… of the dead. Hey – just like the title! Although not as likeable as Bub, it’s clear that we’re still meant to cheer when Big Daddy – even more terrifying than the fat British wrestler with whom he shares a name – blows Hopper to kingdom come.In another departure from tradition, not the female lead. Instead, Asia Argento‘s Slack — a hooker with a heart of gold, as they say — turns up about a third of the way in and doesn’t get to do much more than exchange quips with the film’s human hero, Riley (Simon Baker) and fire a gun now and again. Still, it’s nice to renew the Argento-Romero connection.Although the film merely garnered a 15 certificate in the UK, the effects, by Greg Nicotero’s KNB, are startling, icky and often hilarious. Nicotero, in fact, was the film’s second unit director, with his team known as The Splatter Unit on set. Our personal favourite? The belly button gag — gets an ‘ooh!’ every time. Remember, kids – piercing just gives zombies more stuff to grab.“I always wanted to see how the other half lives.” — John Leguizamo‘s social climbing mercenary, Cholo, after being bitten.Not only do Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright — the Shaun Of The Dead creative team — appear as zombies (which you probably did know), but they’re up front on the poster as well, flanking Big Daddy.“Big Daddy’s much more severe than Bub. He has to be a leader. And what happens in this film is that others imitate him. And yeah, I think people did say, ‘There’s something more to this movie.’ Well, I’ve been trying to tell you that, guys, for the last 30 years!”And so we’re up to date as Diary of the Dead arrives in cinemas. In addition to telling RT about his movies past, we sat down with George A. Romero to learn about Diary and the future of the Dead franchise…So, you don’t make a zombie film in the 90s, and now it’s two in three years. Are you making up for lost time?George A. Romero: [laughs] No! I missed the 90s because I was swallowed up in development hell there. I had development deals, made a lot of dough, never made any movies. And basically, I fled and did a little film called Bruiser. I’ve just scrammed and that’s why I missed it.I had had the idea for Land Of The Dead back then, but I reworked it. Actually, it was — I think — probably thankful that that’s the way it worked out. Post-9/11, it was a much stronger film, I think. That’s what happened with that. When I finished that film, I took a look at it. I was happy with the way it turned out. There was a lot of talk about a sequel and I thought, where the hell am I going to go from here? First of all, I didn’t have an idea and I didn’t want to get involved. I had completely lost touch with the origins of this thing. I wanted to see if I had the chops and the stamina to go back and do a little guerrilla film. Initially I wanted to do something about this emerging media, and I had a little sketch of the script. I was basically ready to go and take a vacation and do it at a film school where I had taught a couple of classes, just to have some control and to do something small.And Diary is very small — much smaller than Land, which had a $15 million budget.GR: Yeah, the people at Artfire read the script and said, “We’ll let you have the control if you can make it under four.” I had the idea, and it did grow. I wanted to go back to the beginning. There are a lot of other elements involved here. We lost the copyright on Night of the Living Dead. That’s basically a public domain film and all the other films are owned by somebody else and you have no action in it. So that was also a motivating factor.I’m glad you mentioned Night, because I thought that Diary was much closer in tone to that movie, and Day Of The Dead, whereas Land and Dawn were poppier. Was that deliberate?GR: I agree with you. I was trying to do that. I had a conversation early this morning about, “Well, what if they want to make a sequel to this?” Well, this is closer to Night, so maybe we need to do something that’s closer to Dawn. A pure comic book thing.Are you going to do a sequel to this?GR: I don’t know what to do. If I had to do a sequel right now, I’d finish the story and start it with the same characters, which is also something I’ve never done. I’m hoping that it’ll all blow away. I’m hoping that if Barack Obama gets elected, I’ll have something to talk about. More importantly, if he gets shot!I’m intrigued that you and Brian De Palma have made similar films at the same time, with this and…GR: Redacted. I haven’t seen that and I haven’t seen Cloverfield. I guess there’s a collective subconscious. I don’t know because I haven’t seen those films but I don’t know that they’re exactly about the same kind of thing. I think it’s an influence and where does it come from? It seems to me that this is more of a response to reality television, than it is to this age of New Media. I don’t know if any of these films really speak to that. Redacted, I guess, is helmet cameras, right?Yeah, and CCTV footage. But it’s interesting that two old stagers-GR: We’re New Yorkers! [laughs]OK… New Yorkers, would be drawn to this new form of expression. Were you attracted by the immediacy?GR: It’s not so much the immediacy but the danger of it. Right in the middle of Super Tuesday in the America election process, they interrupt the election results to say, “We have reports of a tornado touching down in Arkansas. Anyone out there, if you can get a good picture, send it in, we’ll put it on the air and we’ll send you a mug! Be careful!” And people are out there waiting for something to happen. Everyone has a camera phone. The shootings at Virginia Tech, all the footage we had was footage from camera phones. It strikes me as quite dangerous. If Hitler was around, he would never even have to go into the town square. He could throw up a blog and forget about it.You’ve got a no-name cast this time around, but I detected a few famous voices playing newscasters, including Simon Pegg and Guillermo del Toro.GR: What happened was, we shot the film in 20 days and then we went back and we had enough money to shoot three more days and that was it. All we could afford was to get the principal footage in the can. We knew we could come back and do the narration portions and the news stuff. There was some of that in the script but we said we can refine it later because it’s all just audio. We shot the film and we came back and we kept writing things and we kept writing dialogue and we would try it on for size. We were all recording – it was me, my editor and my girlfriend and we were sitting there with a finished film but it was all our own voices. So first I called Stephen King and he said, “Sure man, I’ll do it,” and I called some of my other buddies and I’m very grateful that they all said yes and were all willing and able. It’s a vote of confidence.How did you decide who to single out?GR: I called people whose work I respect and who I’ve been able to hang out with without having any altercations! [laughs] I tried to call Dario but I couldn’t reach him. [laughs] I don’t know… I guess with subtitles, but he may not have been distinguishable. Tom Savini is one of the voices. I wish that Tom would get back into the biz, so to speak. I think he’s more concerned about being an actor. He wants to be an actor now. He should get back into it.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV+, The, Rey, Syfy, Access, TV, telelvision","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"guide-of-the-dead-an-rt-romero-retrospective"},{"id":"47613428983348","title":"Eric Bana talks Love the Beast – RT Interview","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Eric Bana talks Love the Beast - RT InterviewOn why he's such a petrol head.by Joe Utichi | November 16, 2009 |  CommentsNot a lot of people know that actor Eric Bana, familiar to most from roles in the likes of JJ Abrams’s Star Trek, Steven Spielberg’s Munich and Ang Lee’s Hulk, is a massive petrol head. With the release of Love the Beast, Bana aims to change that. A love letter to his pride and joy, a Ford GT Falcon Coupe which he’s owned since he was 15, the film is a documentary about his obsession with it and with racing, and the mourning attached to his crash during the Targa rally in 2007. Along the way Bana interviews the likes of Jeremy Clarkson, Jay Leno and Dr. Phil as he attempts to understand his passion better. In London to promote the UK release — it’s out on DVD now — Bana sat down with RT to talk more about his pride and joy.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10010943[/tomatometer]Why have you come to London to promote this when you should be fixing the Coupe? What’s the status?Eric Bana: [laughs] The status is it’s getting there. It’s taken us probably a year to get all the bits and pieces together, but we’ve started so in the not too distant future it’ll be on the road.Most won’t know you as a car fan, but the passion is palpable. Has that been there from the very beginning?EB: Yeah, I guess so. It’s always been my hope, as an actor, to reveal only what is relevant about myself to the work. So I’m not surprised that most people are surprised to know I’m into cars, but it’s something that’s been there since I was born. There wasn’t a moment where I got into cars. It wasn’t a conscience decision or something that came later, it was there since I was born. I just love it.You mention the importance of Mad Max in the film as a movie that combined both passions for you, are there others?EB: Yes and no. I do feel like, as a car person, I’m somewhat manipulated by them. I mean, there are some that go down as all-time classics. They don’t hold up as great pieces of cinema but they do hold up for someone who’s obsessed with cars.However, I don’t think that’s the case with modern films. One of the reasons I wanted to make this film was that I felt like there was really no connection between me and a lot of the modern car films. I felt they were more about, “Hey, if we put this car in a film and we do a big chase sequence, car guys will like this.” Those films don’t appeal to me so much. All of my favourite car films are very old ones, and even then there’s quite often a disconnect.I felt that what was missing from them was this social notion that a car can transcend itself and become something else.Bana with the original BeastJeremy Clarkson says in the film that machines are supposed to be perfect and infallible, but because cars aren’t, they have a personality and you can bond with them — do you think maybe that’s what’s missing from modern car movies, that the car is no longer a character?EB: I guess there’s an element of that; I think that’s because of the kind of cars in car movies these days. It’s very hard to get the same sort of emotion out of a modern vehicle because they are so perfect, and it’s very hard to have a tactile relationship with them.One of my closest friends, who I made the film with, has a fifteen-year-old son with whom he’s building a car. They’ve had to go back to 1979 or 1982 to get a car he could work on. You know what I mean? It’s going to be interesting to see what our kids will work on, if they even do. Will it just be a sealed unit that you dispose of? You have to go back to the 80s to find a car you can just open the bonnet and take a spanner to.Do you think that’s actually going to die, then?EB: To a degree I think it will. I think the value of the old cars will be maintained as people realise they’re the kind of cars you can work on. And by work on I mean work on; I don’t mean putting a fibre-glass bonnet on and some big speakers. I could be wrong but I can’t see kids stripping engines down and rebuilding them on the latest 325 BMW ten years from now.Do you think this hobby is something that’s culturally more active in your native Australia?EB: It’s a good question, and it’s why I wanted to put my childhood in context in the film. To understand my obsession you sort-of need to understand where I came from, growing up in the suburbs out near the airport where there was space and room to play with these things and to tinker and go and test your skills in an environment that wasn’t a threat to anybody. In that respect, the world has changed a little bit. It’s gotten more heavily populated and we have stricter road rules. We have more speed cameras, heavier population. It is a different environment to what it was when I was growing.Bana talks to Jeremy ClarksonWhen you crashed the car and you thought it was a write-off, it was most surprising that after 25 years you were questioning whether that was the end of this obsession for you — did you ever seriously consider that?EB: Not that part of my life, but that the car could be over, yes, because it was a real threat. If the car was so badly damaged that it would have required a re-shell, I wasn’t going to do it. That’s an exercise in spending money, and if the car has reached its natural end, so be it. Fortunately I found someone who was capable of repairing the structural damage to the extent that we didn’t have to re-shell the car. That’s the only reason the car’s being rebuilt — I would not have re-shelled the car. To me that would have been a different vehicle.And there was a real threat that the car wasn’t going to be rebuilt. Technically speaking, you can build anything out of sand; it doesn’t mean you do it. I had some middle-class guilt that I had the resources to go out and do that again and I just finished rebuilding the car over a two-year period, and to be honest I was out of emotional energy at that point, too. I just waited until recently, when there was enough distance between myself and the project, to just go back to it and tinker with it again.Would you have found a different car and carried on if it had been a re-shell?EB: I’ve always had other vehicles and I’ll always tinker, so that part of my life would have been the same I guess, but the car itself would probably have been at its end, and the film would have been its final chapter. Fortunately it looks like it will rise from the ashes.Do you know when the car will be back on the road?EB: Oh it’ll be less than twelve months from now.Hopefully we’ll see a follow-up film, then!EB: [laughs] I don’t think there’ll be a sequel! I’m sure a photo will end up in a magazine or two at some point!Now that I’m rebuilding it, I do feel good about it. The film was really well received back home and I got some letters that I’ve just never received in my life, you know; letters you’d never get as an actor. They’re from people who saw the film with their wives and at the end of the film, without them saying anything, their wives have turned to them and said, “OK, you can do it — you can buy that car that you’ve been putting off for 10 years.” It’s really incredible, but the film seems to have appealed to people who aren’t into cars and it’s helped them understand that it isn’t just about a car. It’s also about the social or emotional importance that having a hobby and an outlet and some kind of artisan experience can provide.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Travel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"eric-bana-talks-love-the-beast-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613457184324","title":"Will Miyazaki’s Next Film Be His Last?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Will Miyazaki's Next Film Be His Last?by Scott Weinberg | March 20, 2007 |  CommentsIt’s been speculated that legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki will retire after the release of his next film, \"Ponyo on a Cliff,\" but now it looks like we’ll have at least a year to worry about it. The flick’s not scheduled for release until summer of 2008.(Very) well-known and globally admired for films like \"Howl’s Moving Castle,\" \"Spirited Away,\" and \"Princess Mononoke,\" Mr. Miyazaki is presently hard at work on \"Ponyo,\" and early word indicates that there will be NO CGI in this film. Just pure, beautiful, hand-drawn animation all the way. (Cool.) The story will be about a goldfish princess who dreams of becoming human after making a two-footed friend.And although Studio Ghibli has employed CGI effects in the past, the company’s \"Toshio Suzuki told reporters at Monday’s press conference announcing the toon. \"Instead he will use simple, childlike drawings.

The deal marks a reunion of sorts for Woody Allen and the DreamWorks folks; his old-three picture deal with the studio yielded \"Small Time Crooks,\" \"The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,\" and \"Hollywood Ending.\" DreamWorks aims to release \"Match Point\" around Awards Season, which is a pretty promising sign for all involved — especially the moviegoers!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Martial, show, Musical, Peek, Kaling, the, GoT, Pop, Tomatazos, Office, Us, boxing, Fantasy, discovery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"woody-allen-makes-a-match-with-dreamworks"},{"id":"47613460272710","title":"Oscar Night Approaches; Who Will Win?

Our Predictions Inside!by RT Staff | February 22, 2007 |  CommentsThere’s two ways to predict the Oscars: (1) dissect the awards buzz, attempting to get a feel for the fickle machinations of the Academy voter. Or (2) use your powers of geek math to crunch box office numbers and awards statistics for some cold, hard facts. With both methods in full swing, here’s a rundown of the Internet’s major Oscar predictions.Best PictureAs usual, the nominees have settled into their niches: two big flicks (\"The Departed\" and \"Babel\"), one major underdog (\"Little Miss Sunshine\"), and two wallflowers (\"The Queen\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\"). FilmJerk, having combed the last 28 years of Oscar winners for meaningful statistics, posits \"The Departed\" has history on its side. The Envelope, L.A. Times’ one-stop hub for Hollywood buzz, agrees.But it ain’t over yet. After polling readers from over 20 blogs, Vizu Answers reveals that 54 percent believe \"Babel\" will emerge victorious. And in our own unofficial Rotten Tomatoes research of the past 15 or so Oscar ceremonies, we discovered that the best-reviewed nominee never wins, along with the ones that make less than the average gross of all the nominees combined. This knocks \"Babel\" out of the race and pits \"The Departed\" against \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio with hats in \"The Departed.\"Best DirectorMartin Scorsese.All signs point that this is going to be his year (more so than the other million times that statement’s been made). And what if another nominee (probably that Iñárritu guy) swoops in? People will be angry, more Hitchcock comparisons will be made, Scorsese will make a quip and then go back to work.Martin Scorsese in a \"Departed\" powwow.Best Actor and Best ActressStatistically, Leonardo DiCaprio has a lead on the Best Actor race for \"Blood Diamond,\" but no one is expecting him to win. Peter O’Toole, always the rascal, might pull off an upset. But based on the strong reader and industry insider buzz, it’s hard to imagined the award won’t be going to Forest Whitaker for \"The Last King of Scotland.\"As for Best Actress, statistics argue that Meryl Streep in \"The Devil Wears Prada\" has an advantage. Everything else is pointing towards heavy favorite Helen Mirren for \"The Queen.\"Peter O’Toole is old in \"Venus.\"Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting ActressThe Supporting races are the the most unpredictable ones this year. The Envelope recently bumped \"Dreamgirls\"’ Eddie Murphy down, replacing him with \"Little Miss Sunshine\"’s Alan Arkin as favorite to take home the statue. But blog readers want Murphy to win and the numbers also slightly favor him.Jennifer Hudson looks to be a shoo-in for her performance in \"Dreamgirls.\" But the buzz has been almost too good; something’s got to backfire at some point. Abigail Breslin from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" seems an unlikely contender, but the Academy does like to hand out the tot votes (Haley Joel Osment’s nom for \"The Sixth Sense\" and Anna Paquin’s win for \"The Piano\" being recent examples).Jennifer Hudson hitting high notes in \"Dreamgirls.\"Best Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay\"Babel\" and \"The Queen\" are contenders, though the talk of the town is that the award’ll probably go to \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Recently, this category’s become the designated play area for quirky indie films (\"The Squid and the Whale\" and \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" anyone?). \"Lost in Translation\" won Best Screenplay but lost Best Picture in 2003, so if \"Little Miss Sunshine\" doesn’t nab Best Picture, it’ll get this consolation prize.And Best Adapted Screenplay? Reader and Hollywood buzz and historical statistics are in favor for \"The Departed.\" And why not? \"The Departed\"’s popular with critics, audiences, and picky \"Infernal Affairs\" fans. And it was written by only one guy (compare with \"Children of Men\"’s and \"Borat\"’s five apiece) so we won’t have to sit through a really long acceptance speech.Steve Carrell and Toni Collette action pose for \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"Best Foreign Language FilmA strong crop have been nominated this year, including \"Water,\" \"Days of Glory,\" and \"The Lives of Others,\" all Certified Fresh. But the award is likely to go to the critically lauded, record breaking \"Pan’s Labyrinth.\" Since a \"Pan\" win for Best Screenplay isn’t going to happen, Academy members are going to want to pay their respects and dogpile the votes here.A charming \"Labyrinth\" inhabitant.Best Animated FeatureFor the first time in maybe ever, Pixar doesn’t look to be a sure-fire bet. \"Cars,\" despite being Certified Fresh and grossing nearly $250 million, in relative Pixar terms, it wasn’t a huge success like \"Toy Story 2,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" or \"The Incredibles.\" The other big nominee, \"Happy Feet,\" however, was a surprise hit, much like that other penguin movie. Academy voters are probably still thinking fondly about \"Happy Feet,\" while \"Cars\" has the Ghost of Pixar Movies Past looming over it.Owen Wilson as an unhappy car.Best Documentary FeatureEach of the four major nominees have big positives going for them. \"Iraq in Fragments\" is timely and \"Deliver Us From Evil\" has a perfect Tomatometer. \"An Inconvenient Truth\" may win on the sheer number of people who have seen it as opposed to the other nominees. \"Jesus Camp\" was an underground, word-of-mouth hit and actually resulted in the closure of the titular camp. You can’t buy better buzz and publicity than that.Solidarity in \"Iraq in Fragments.\"Source: FilmJerk, The Envelope, Vizu Answers","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Masterpiece, Television, festival, movies, movies, The, nfl, FX, movies, Swim, American, Network, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"oscar-night-approaches-who-will-win-our-predictions-inside"},{"id":"47613445841469","title":"Trailer Bulletin: The Proposition","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trailer Bulletin: The Propositionby Scott Weinberg | May 8, 2006 |  CommentsIf you like your action westerns extra gritty and a little on the Australian side, you’ll want to be sure to check out John Hillcoat‘s excellent \"The Proposition.\" But since it’s a limited release title, you might just need this trailer to hold you over until the DVD release.\"Australian Outback, 1880s.

When all the numbers are in, \"The Incredibles,\" Pixar Studios’ latest animated movie, is Rottentomatoes.com’s pick for the best reviewed title in the Wide Release category.

And after a series of surgeries and a long time spent on the road to recovery, it looks like the Pulitzer-winning movie man is about to get back to work.Slowly but surely is what we’re talking about here. Mr. Ebert has been on the mend for just about nine months, but he’s definitely planning to be in attendance at his ninth annual Overlooked Film Festival. Beyond that he plans to keep penning a few reviews here and there as he continues to recover from cancer treatments.The widely-admired film critic seems just as enthusiastic about his job as ever: \"I plan to gradually increase my duties in the months to come. I still love writing about the movies. Forty years is not enough.\"Films scheduled to screen at the Overlooked Fest (in late April) include \"Gattaca,\" \"Holes,\" \"The Weather Man,\" \"Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,\" and \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,\" which was written by Roger Ebert way back in 1969.

Vegas!by Joanna Cohen | April 23, 2008 |  CommentsAmerican cinema worships an array of iconic landscapes: Monument Valley; the streets of New York; Niagara Falls; the car-chase hills of San Francisco; and last, but certainly not least, Las Vegas. Vegas, with its neon haze and endless tales of lost hope and fortune, has provided a gaudy back-drop to many great films. With the upcoming release of the Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher romantic comedy, What Happens in Vegas, RT thought it might be time to brush-up on the Las Vegas canon with our Top Ten Vegas Films.1) The Godfather: Part II98%In one of the greatest sequels ever made, the story of the Corleone family continues. A chilling moment in this chapter of Coppola‘s saga is the Hyman Roth “There was this kid I grew up with” speech. “That kid’s name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas”. Rotten Tomatoes has goose bumps just thinking about it!RT’s favourite review: “The performances, Gordon Willis‘ memorably gloomy camerawork, the stately pace and the sheer scale of the story’s sweep render everything engrossing and so, well, plausible that our ideas of organised crime in America will forever be marked by this movie.” Geoff Andrew, Time Out. More reviews2) Leaving Las Vegas90%This is not the most upbeat pick for a Friday night but it will hold you riveted right to the end of the bottle. It has got bright lights, addiction and a hooker with a heart of gold but that is where the Vegas stereotype ends. It is relentless and while many describe it as a cautionary tale, the reality is that it is dark enough to drive you to drink.RT’s favourite review: “The plot goes nowhere, but under the pornographic circumstances Figgis, Cage, and Shue all do fine jobs.” Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader. More reviews.3) Casino 83%Yeah yeah, he did it all before in Goodfellas but no-one does a mobster like Scorsese and this time it is under neon lights. Where better to set a story about the destructive force of greed but in the ‘morality car wash’ that is Vegas?RT’s favourite review: “People talk and talk about how Vegas works, and Scorsese’s camera sprints to keep up. He’s like an energetic tour guide making sure we understand everything.” Rob Gonsalves, eFilmCritic.com. More reviews.4) Ocean’s Eleven 80%It is not often that a re-make outshines an original but the 1960s rat pack vehicle is quite shambolic beside the slick, uber-sexy perv fest that is this little slice of Clooney/Pitt/Damon/Garcia heaven. It is fun, serviceable eye candy.RT’s favourite review: “One expertly made piece of pure, unpretentious popcorn entertainment.” Michael T. Grace, Film Threat. More reviews.5) Viva Las Vegas 79%Elvis WAS Vegas. Combining the two was an act of cinematic genius.RT’s favourite review: “Hallucinatory but fabulously entertaining.” Nell Minow, Movie Mom at Yahoo! Movies. More reviews.6) The Cooler 77%In the true tradition of the Vegas genre, The Cooler is about luck and who has it and who is so far out of it that it takes some serious work to be that down. William H. Macy carries his hang-dog expression to great effect as a man running away from lady luck.RT’s favourite review: “A curious mix of thug violence, romance, and whimsy.” Steve Crum, Kansas City Kansan. More reviews.7) Swingers 76%Before Jon Favreau went all blockbuster with the likes of Iron Man, he was making cool, independent films that made us all want to grab a martini, say cool things and hit Vegas with our equally cool friends. In retrospect it may have been a little too cool for its own good but it sure gave good vernacular.RT’s favourite review: “The first and best outing from Favreau and Vaughn. Trendy, but hilarious. VEGAS, BABY – VEGAS!” Brian Mckay, eFilmCritic.com. More reviews.8) Diamonds Are Forever 68%Don’t try to keep up, just enjoy the smooth sophistication of Connery, the greatest of the Bonds. Debonair in the face of ludicrous surroundings, this Bond movie may be the perfect Vegas metaphor.RT’s favourite review: “30 years later, Connery is STILL Bond!” Michael A. Smith, Nolan’s Pop Culture Review. More reviews.9) Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 46%This is not everyone’s cup of tea with a peyote chaser. Depp‘s performance is not unlike sitting in a centrefuge at a heavy metal concert or, for that matter, going on a drug binge in Las Vegas with Hunter S. Thompson. It may be teeth clenchingly frenetic but so was the original book by Thompson, and this is a gripping adaptation of both the book and the man.RT’s favourite review: “About as enjoyable as a bad trip.” Dennis Schwartz, Ozus’ World Movie Reviews. More reviews.10) Showgirls 14%Smut, nudity and some of the bitchiest slanging-matches to hit the screen. There is no question that this is a truly dreadful film, but dreadful films can bring so much pleasure. Best watched in a pack.RT’s favourite review: “Tasteless, tawdry, and guaranteed to leave you rolling in the aisles… the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer.” Michael Dequina, Mr Brown’s Movies.

The director of such influential films as The Seventh Seal, Persona, Cries and Whispers, and Fanny and Alexander, Bergman was known for his literary sensibilities and existential ruminations. The director’s work has exerted a profound influence on filmmakers as disparate as Woody Allen, Lars Von Trier, and Wes Craven.Bergman’s childhood and early career is outlined in potent detail in his autobiography The Magic Lantern. A precursor to the slide projector, Bergman acquired a magic lantern from his brother in trade for 100 tin soldiers. Citing his imagination as a refuge from the oppressive discipline of a Lutheran clergyman father and housewife mother, it’s rather poetic he should enter the realm of cinema by trading toys for visions. (Fanny and Alexander, about an upper-class family in Upsala before the First World War, is regarded as a loosely autobiographical portrayal of his youth).Bergman on the set of SarabandBergman left his home at the age of 19 and got a menial job at the Royal Opera House. In 1942 the Swedish Film Industry hired him as an assistant scriptwriter. Torment (aka Frenzy or Hets), a script he wrote in 1944 was filmed by then dominant director Alf Sjoeberg and went on to win several awards including the grand prize at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. Promptly thereafter, Bergman began his directorial career, producing an average of one film a year. When his comedy Smiles of a Summer Night (1955) appeared in theaters he won international acclaim. Bergman also worked in television, directing everything from soap commercials to the monumental miniseries Scenes from a Marriage (1973).Bergman frequently collaborated with such notables as Max von Sydow, , Harriet Andersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Ingrid Thulin, Erland Josephson, and especially Liv Ullmann, with whom he produced ten films and a daughter.Bergman won Academy Awards for best foreign film in 1960 (The Virgin Spring), 1961 (Through a Glass Darkly) and 1963 (Winter Light). The latter two films were part of his “faith trilogy,” and it’s suggested the third in the series (The Silence) was too sexually suggestive to be considered for the Oscars. In 1972, two of his films, Persona and Wild Strawberries (1957), were included in Sight and Sound’s prestigious poll of critics as two of the 10 greatest films of all time. In 2005, Time Magazine called him the world’s greatest living filmmaker.The Associated Press reports the filmmaker, director of 54 features, and 129 stage productions, never fully recovered from a hip surgery he had in October. His last film was 2005’s Saraband.Bergman is survived by his nine children. Funeral services have not yet been announced but the Swedish Film Institute plans a memorial event for the month of August.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, Purge, casting, ViacomCBS, 2020","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"legendary-director-ingmar-bergman-dies-at-89"},{"id":"47613619363477","title":"Trailer Bulletin: The Lake House","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trailer Bulletin: The Lake Houseby Scott Weinberg | April 24, 2006 |  CommentsIf I told you that Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves had gotten together to make another movie, you’d probably have visions of something like \"Speed 3: Malfunctioing Ski-Lift,\" but instead we have a wistful little rom-drama called \"The Lake House,\" which is based on a 2002 Korean film called \"Il Mare.\" Anyway, here’s the trailer.\"A woman doctor and an architecture school dropout live in the same house two years apart and fall in love via letters they exchange through a mailbox that mysteriously bridges time.\"Sandra Bullock in \"Miss Congeniality 2\"Plus the trailer has that really weepy Keane song, which fits the chick-flicky tone just perfectly.Co-starring Christopher Plummer and Shohreh Aghdashloo, \"The Lake House\" opens up on June 16th.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"mockumentary, News, Tumblr, Drama, Television, PBS, National, Disney, Sneak, Emmys, FX, Channel, Awards, Sci-Fi, Toys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"trailer-bulletin-the-lake-house"},{"id":"47613617601172","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Fool’s Gold Hopes to Shine in Battle of New Comedies","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Fool's Gold Hopes to Shine in Battle of New ComediesRoscoe Jenkins, Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy also vie for box office.by Gitesh Pandya | February 7, 2008 |  CommentsHollywood plays the race card this weekend opening a pair of star-driven comedies, one for white moviegoers and the other for black audiences. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson get the wider release with the romantic adventure comedy Fool’s Gold while debuting in 741 fewer theaters is Martin Lawrence‘s family reunion laughfest Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. Adding to the mix is the standup comedy concert pic Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show which will also try to tickle funnybones from coast to coast. Not all three films will get to laugh all the way to the bank.Five years and one day after their date flick How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days became a number one hit, McConaughey and Hudson reteam for Fool’s Gold. Directed by Andy Tennant (Hitch, Sweet Home Alabama), the PG-13 picture tells of an ex-couple that must band together to find sunken treasure. The Warner Bros. release looks like a winner on paper. Take two stars with a proven track record, put them in a film that combines romantic comedy with action adventure, and hefty grosses from both genders should come rolling in. The marketing has certainly been pushing all the right aspects trying to sell this as a Romancing the Stone for today’s twentysomethings and thirtysomethings.But the film’s poor execution will be a major liability in the long run. Reviews have been among the worst of any film in this new year. Since Fool’s Gold will play to an over-25 crowd, the thumbs down from critics could have an impact. Bad word-of-mouth will certainly kick in after this weekend and hurt future weeks. Then again, critically-panned comedies packed with big stars usually sell pretty well with the paying public. Gold will play to the same crowd that powered 10 Days to a $23.8M bow and McConaughey’s 2006 rom-com Failure to Launch to $24.4M. Both skewed female and heavily white. The actor’s latest offering could open in the same neighborhood but should suffer weaker legs. Opening in 3,125 theaters, Fool’s Gold may bow to about $23M.Hudson and McConaughey in Fool’s GoldMoviegoers not up for Matt and Kate’s excellent adventure can spend the weekend with Martin Lawrence and his lively family in the Universal comedy Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man, Undercover Brother), the PG-13 film packs ample starpower into one film with co-stars Cedric the Entertainer, James Earl Jones, Michael Clarke Duncan, Mike Epps, and Mo’Nique. Four of the stars come from a standup comedy background which only raises the volume in the laughter department. The film finds Lawrence playing a self-help guru and talk show host in Hollywood who returns to his Georgia home to reunite with the family he left behind.Roscoe Jenkins will pull in most of its business from the African American audience. Turnout should be robust given the starpower. Sure the family reunion story has been done a hundred times, but moviegoers will want to see all the big names under one roof giving them two hours of laughs. In the right film, and when surrounded by other marquee stars, Martin Lawrence is still a big draw at the box office. His comedy sequel Big Momma’s House 2 opened to $27.7M around this time of year in 2006.Plus with this weekend’s Top 20 set to offer no other films led by black casts, direct competition will be minimal. The Ice Cube comedy First Sunday debuted to $17.7M a month ago and Martin and gang could do better. Reviews will not be very good, but that should not matter much. The only limiting factor will be the theater count. Debuting in 2,384 locations, Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins could collect around $20M this weekend.Martin Lawrence in Roscoe Jenkins.For those who like their laughs purely from standup comedians on stage, Picturehouse releases Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show. The R-rated pic follows the Hollywood star and a group of comics on the road during their 2005 tour. Hannah Montana and U2 have had great success with their concert films over the last two weeks. But Wild West lacks the music and the 3D element that helped to make those two score at the box office. Most of the successful standup comedy hits at the box office have been from African American funnymen so Vaughn’s experiment does not have a proven formula to follow. Plus none of the comedians are big stars which is why Santa’s brother had to include his name in the title in order to grab the attention of potential ticket buyers. Most will probably wait for the DVD which is sure to have some unrated bonus material. Rolling into about 800 theaters, Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show could take in roughly $3M this weekend.The marquee says it all.Miley Cyrus rocked her way to the top of the charts last weekend with her Hannah Montana concert pic which opened to a scorching $31.1M with $15 tickets resulting in more than two millions admissions. The fan fever has spilled over into the midweek period as Monday and Tuesday grosses remained red hot with takes of $3.3M and $2.9M, respectively. A full-week tally of about $42M seems likely and with Disney extending the run of the film, more wheelbarrows will be needed to haul away the green. Still, most fans planned ahead of time to see Best of Both Worlds during the first week since it was promoted aggressively as a one-week-only run. Parents may hesitate to shell out more of the pumped up ticket prices for a second helping. Sales could fall by 45% to about $17M which would push the ten-day cume to an amazing $59M.The Eye settled for a decent second place finish over the Super Bowl frame and like most fright flicks, should not enjoy a good hold on the second weekend. The new menu of comedies won’t provide too much competition so a decline of 50% would leave Lionsgate with about $6M lifting the total to $21M after ten days.Fox’s female-skewing comedy 27 Dresses will take a direct hit from Matt and Kate’s reunion. Look for the Katherine Heigl film to fall by 40% to $5M for a 24-day score of $64M. Playing to a slightly different audience, Rambo took a sizable blow over the Super Bowl frame and should see its drop stabilize to 50%. That would leave the ultraviolent Lionsgate sequel with $3.5M putting the overall cume at $36M.LAST YEAR: Following soon after his first-ever Oscar nomination for Dreamgirls, Eddie Murphy rocketed to number one at the box office with the powerful $34.2M debut for the comedy Norbit. The Paramount release went on to gobble up $95.7M domestically and about $160M worldwide. Opening in second with a respectable $13.1M was the thriller Hannibal Rising which went on to gross $27.7M for The Weinstein Company. The previous weekend’s top two films followed, but switched their order. Universal’s Diane Keaton comedy Because I Said So held up well and grossed $9.2M while the horror pic The Messengers fell harder and took in $7.2M for Sony. Rounding out the top five was the unstoppable holiday hit Night at the Museum with $5.8M in its eighth frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Christmas, Turner, chucky, Exclusive, breaking, concert","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-preview-fools-gold-hopes-to-shine-in-battle-of-new-comedies"},{"id":"47613651145379","title":"Get Ready for Another Dose of \"National Treasure\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Get Ready for Another Dose of \"National Treasure\"by Binh Ngo | August 3, 2006 |  CommentsEveryone called \"National Treasure\" a \"Da Vinci Code wannabe\" when it came out a few years ago, what with its hidden clues and historical trappings, but now that \"The Da Vinci Code\" has shown up and disappointed a whole lot of people, \"National Treasure\" doesn’t look so silly anymore.

In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all.&nbsp;In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series,&nbsp;director Baz Luhrmann and production and&nbsp;costume designer Catherine Martin break down how they created one of cinema’s great entrances.&nbsp;VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLThe Movie:&nbsp;Moulin Rouge! (2001)  76%Baz Luhrmann‘s breakout success, the 1992 comedy&nbsp;Strictly Ballroom, announced the Australian director as a bold new filmmaking talent with a wild,&nbsp;colorful, fast-moving style that was unlike anything anyone else was doing at the time. BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations followed, and buzz began to build for what Baz would do next. That next was&nbsp;Romeo + Juliet&nbsp;– a modern&nbsp;retelling that would spawn a hit soundtrack, make a star of Leonardo DiCaprio, and become the definitive version of the story for ’90s and 2000s teens. Then came the big one: 2001’s&nbsp;Moulin Rouge!, the tale of a courtesan named Satine (Nicole Kidman) and a poet named Christian (Ewan McGregor) who meet and fall in love at Paris’s Moulin Rouge, a cabaret club famous as the birthplace of the can-can. The Luhrmann-y twist was that their story was told as a musical filled with modern songs and mashups (and one beautiful original, “Come What May”). The ambition was grand – to give new life to the movie musical&nbsp;– and Luhrmann was aided in his mission by a mammoth team of filmmakers and actors that included his wife and longtime collaborator Catherine Martin, the film’s costume designer (with Angus Strathie)&nbsp;and production designer. Here, Luhrmann and Martin reveal how the film began to take shape, from the initial idea to building the club itself.“While I was in India had the incredible experience of experiencing a Bollywood movie… you could have drama, then high comedy – like, literal physical gags – then a musical number, then high drama again.”Baz Luhrmann:&nbsp;“I was debating what my next work should be. I was thinking, ‘Should I look at Shakespeare as if Shakespeare was going to make a movie, or should I look at my other great passion, which is a way of finding the musical?’ – which I loved as a child growing up in a very small country town where we had a cinema and we got very old movies. Is there a way of making the musical work at this time and at this place?&nbsp;At the same time, we were creating an opera of Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. I went off to India to do that opera and while I was there I had the incredible experience of experiencing what would be called a Bollywood movie. I went into a cinema and there was maybe 2,500&nbsp;people in that cinema. And what was astounding in the language and in the form was that you could have drama, a dramatic scene, then high comedy — like, literal physical gags — then a musical number, then high drama again. And it influenced me in a couple of ways.In one regard, it was Shakespearean, and&nbsp;on the&nbsp;other hand, you went, like, ‘Wow.’ This&nbsp;is audience participation in cinema. You are meant, as an audience, not to be looking at reality through a keyhole, but you are meant to participate in the storytelling. You’re meant to boo and hiss and laugh and cry and sing along, but then you’re also meant to be emotionally engaged and moved. I thought in a strange way this was completely and totally fresh. So I went off and I actually did&nbsp;the Shakespeare film first, and then coming a second time round, I went like, ‘It must be time to have a go at trying to make the musical work.’”Luhrmann was influenced by Bollywood films.

The character [of] Toulouse-Lautrec, I guess, would have been Andy Warhol, and there would have been a young creative writer/singer who comes to New York and gets involved in the underworld of 54. What I found was that it’s too close to us… You’ve got to remember, at the time, the 1890s — the can-can and all of that imagery in that world, you couldn’t think of anything less cool or less hip. I remember CM [Catherine Martin] waking up in the middle of the night one night and saying to me, ‘Oh my God, Baz. We’re doing a can-can movie. I mean, how could we possibly make that, you know, in any way aesthetically interesting?’ And I said, ‘Through a perspective.’We went to Paris. I went with Craig Pierce, my long-term co-writer, and my team, and then we lived it. Like all the movies, I live them. I literally lived the life of a 1890s Bohemian. And then reading, of course, lots of literature and research and, you know, Émile Zola’s Nana&nbsp;and Lady of the Camellias&nbsp;and all that, and then starting to DNA the story. And then looking at, ‘OK. How do you decode a musical language that’s going to kind of smash through the barrier that says musicals are dead?’ So that was the mission.”“I didn’t know Elton John, so I rang him up and he said, ‘Oh that sounds like a fantastic idea, darling. Of course, we’re going to do it.’”Luhrmann:&nbsp;“The device that what comes out of Christian is music that we know in our universe, started this idea of being able to be both set in a period but also take leaps of faith into the future and into our world. I’m going to use this word, which was totally not around, you know, 18 years ago when I made this movie: the ‘mashup,’ slicing, montage, like mashing different things together. People weren’t talking about mashups 20 years ago. So that’s kind of where we were coming from in terms of finding a musical and visual and storytelling language. Publishing-wise, you technically couldn’t have done it before Moulin Rouge!. The only way that Anton [Monsted, the film’s executive movie producer] and I managed to get that together with Craig and I writing, was I had to ring the actual artist. I mean, I didn’t know Elton John, so I rang him up and he said, ‘Oh that sounds like a fantastic idea, darling. Of course, we’re going to do it.’ And then I reached out to David Bowie and ended up working with David Bowie and Bono and all these icons and they all just thought it was a great, daring idea. If they hadn’t have supported it, it would never have happened, but it did change this idea of publishing. That you could take all kinds of pieces of music and make something new out of it.”Luhrmann and Nicole Kidman. (Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.)“Heath Ledger was very much emerging and so was Jake [Gyllenhaal, for the role of Christian].”Luhrmann:&nbsp;“One of the most touching and beautiful stories –&nbsp;and it’s been put out there before – was that actually at one point Heath Ledger was very much emerging and so was Jake [Gyllenhaal, for the role of Christian]. And I remember Heath and Jake, the idea of Christian being a much younger character…both of them could have played it in different ways. It just became clear that this idea of the age difference was probably putting a pressure on that wasn’t exactly right. But the beautiful story is, and they often tell it, is that they became great friends and bonded over almost getting that role. I mean, when I look at [the footage I have of them] and I look at Heath and Jake – they both sing beautifully. Jake’s got a beautiful baritone, I think, but Heath sang beautifully as well, and you know, that’s just one of those moments that happens in the journey where you go, like, ‘Wow. Well that would have been different, too.’ But Ewan and Nicole were just perfectly matched for that role. It was very like, it’s a perfect match in&nbsp;Casablanca, you know, between Bergman and Bogart.”Luhrmann says Kidman and McGregor were a perfect pairing. (Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp.

And as a result, we shrunk the size down, because it just was huge. Then we went in front of the show grounds in Sydney, at Moore Park [where] there’s a big open area of grass. We went out with sticks and tape and we actually marked out the whole of the Moulin Rouge, using the stick that people use to do surveying and police tape, and we marked out the entire size of it. And we got every single person we could find in the production offices to come and inhabit the space. From then we tweaked the size of it again. The idea of the entrances –&nbsp;like the spinning mirrors for the Diamond Dogs entrance – came from a lot of research about very classical theatrical entrances. And it seemed like a great way of getting a surprising and explosive and an unexpected way of getting our cast into the body of the Moulin Rouge. I think, on our biggest day, we had like 350.”The Moment:&nbsp;The Sparkling&nbsp;DiamondLuhrmann knew he wanted to give Satine a&nbsp;memorable movie entrance. So it is that she first appears&nbsp;perched on a swing above the main dance floor of the Moulin Rouge, singing a slowed-down first verse of “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” before the horn section kicks in and Satine&nbsp;begins swirling&nbsp;around the room like a glittering circus performer. It’s little wonder both the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) and Christian are entranced. The audience was, too, and the scene, along with Satine’s costume,&nbsp;have become defining signatures for the film. Kidman did the whole scene stunt-free, Luhrmann and Martin explain, and executed it like a pro. (She would&nbsp;break a rib wearing one particular corset during shooting, and take a nasty stumble in her “pink diamond” costume – she handled both incidents “like a trooper” says Martin.) Here, the duo breaks down the moment, how they achieved it, and the many films and styles they drew on to create Satine’s first look, the “Black Diamond.”Kidman performed the scene without a stunt double. (Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.)“The very, very last thing you see is the eyes and the face under the hat.”Martin:&nbsp;“Baz always starts from the storytelling of the scene, how he wants to stage it. His first question is always, ‘Where are the entrances and exits?’ He is very technical in that sense and very exigent. You know, you can’t have a doorway in the middle of the set that no one ever uses. Because the audience is always just looking at the door, wondering when someone is going to come in. All these things sound obvious. But you’d be surprised how unobvious they are when you’re designing something.”Luhrmann:&nbsp;“Film’s best entrances, great&nbsp;film entrances, you could do a reel on it. Whether it’s Lawrence of Arabia&nbsp;and Omar Sharif coming out of the desert, or the entrance of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, the reveal. One of the technical things about the reveal [of Satine on the swing in Moulin Rouge!], is that you see ka-bang! and then you see the flitter, and then you see the silhouette of her, and then you see her body, and then you see the hat, and then the very, very last&nbsp;thing you see is the eyes and the face under the hat. So it’s a very slow curtain reveal: Then it’s like, the sparkling diamond. It’s quite technical.”“Nicole was like, ‘No way’… She was 100% stunt-free on that moment.”Luhrmann: “I thought, wouldn’t it be great if we put her in a circus trapeze and we did a trapeze number, but we’ll have to have a stunt person. But Nicole being Nicole was like, ‘No way.’ So she trained with a circus person for a good, I would say, two weeks to do that number and when you see her swing around that’s her. It’s her all the way through that footage. She’s on the trapeze, she’s being swung around, she comes down, she falls into all those guys. So she was 100% stunt-free on that moment. It was just a process of skillful circus rigging and we made the swing as simple as possible, because we wanted it to be all about her. And we also wanted it to be light and flexible and movable and to be a real piece of circus equipment, so that it would be safe as possible. Basically, it was a real stunt leap that we just decorated. I think what’s great about it is that it’s almost not there. It’s all about Nicole and Nicole’s entrance and her spectacular physical confidence.”Martin drew inspiration from the fish-scale pattern on Marilyn Monroe’s dress in Bus Stop. (Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp./courtesy Everett Collection)“We wanted to maintain that 19th-century feeling of being corseted, but at the same time we wanted to call on a myriad of classical movie heroines, whether it’s Marilyn Monroe or Rita Hayworth.”Martin:&nbsp;“Nicole’s costume, when she first appears on the swing, is called the Black Diamond outfit. It was very interesting, all our discussion about how to find, and make, Nicole kind of this quintessential and classical heroine. We wanted to maintain that 19th-century feeling of being corseted, but at the same time we wanted to call on a myriad of classical movie heroines, whether it’s Marilyn Monroe or Rita Hayworth – that kind of classic movie glamour of musical movie stars of the ’30s through the ’40s into the ’50s. So the corset shape for Moulin Rouge&nbsp;was adjusted a little bit to have a slightly ’50s kind of bustier feel. You see that in Nicole’s outfits. We then used, from Marilyn Monroe’s costume in Bus Stop, the fish scale pattern as a little nod to her. One of the big great motifs in the design of Moulin Rouge!&nbsp;is the use of the tail coats and top hats, and you’ll see in the costume itself, it actually has tails in the back, and she is wearing a miniature top hat that’s perched on the side. It was a big fashion in the late 19th century. It was considered very sexy and kind of lush for women to wear thin trousers and male costumes. It also plays with the idea of the equestrian, the sexual fetish about women riding horses, obviously. It’s all those things melded to create the ultimate showgirl costume. The first time I saw Nicole in the Black Diamond outfit, she was Satine. I mean Nicole is marvelous to dress for obvious reasons, but&nbsp;she always transcends her costume. She makes Satine who Satine is. The outfit is never as good on a dress stand as it is on her body.”The Impact:&nbsp;The Musical Is RebornMoulin Rouge!&nbsp;was something of a sensation in its time. Praise was not unanimous – while the movie is Certified Fresh at 76%, there were vocal detractors who could not get on board with its feverishness nor its earnestness – but it struck a chord with audiences who’d been yearning for an&nbsp;&nbsp;audacious new musical. The movie made $180 million globally and earned&nbsp;eight Oscar nominations, with Martin winning two for Costume Design and Art Direction. The movie’s soundtrack, which included the “Lady Marmalade” cover by Christina Aguilera, Mya, Lil’ Kim, P!nk, and Missy Elliott, went two times platinum in the U.S. and spawned a second volume. The movie’s lasting impact would take some time to materialize, however. Lurhmann&nbsp;did, in fact, help reignite interest in the movie musical, and in the next two decades we would see successful new entrants in the genre like&nbsp;Chicago,&nbsp;Hairspray,&nbsp;Dreamgirls,&nbsp;The Greatest Showman, and&nbsp;La La Land.&nbsp;Moulin Rouge!&nbsp;itself remains beloved by a hardcore group of fans to this day, a passion that Broadway producers are banking on: a big-budget stage show of the movie opens at the Al Hirschfeld theater this month. For Luhrmann and Martin it’s a joyful full-circle moment.“Maybe we’re just getting a little bit far there. We might have to tone that down.”Luhrmann:&nbsp;“We did open in Cannes and that was a spectacular opening, that went terrific. But there was a time when we screen-tested it in a place called Simi Valley, CA, and nothing against Simi Valley, but at that stage we were even wilder up front about the kind of things that could happen in the Moulin Rouge. Now, I’m not going to go into detail, but it was a little bit more in-your-face about the… let’s say “menu,” of erotic possibilities at the Moulin Rouge. So we had this kind of opening sequence in it, and for example, I think there might even have been Grace Jones’ ‘Slave to the Rhythm’ at some point in the opening sequence – we were putting it out in front of an audience and it was meant to be slightly tongue-in-cheek, but I’m pretty sure three quarters of the audience just walked out before the first 10 minutes [were over].

It took Chicago&nbsp;and a lot of great musicals that then followed afterwards to keep the language going. And I did a celebration of the musical — in fact I can’t remember when — but for the Oscars, with Hugh Jackman and Beyoncé and a whole cast of hundreds as a celebration that the musical was back. Well, that was years ago. When I started out in movies, Star Wars, science-fiction, that was the dominant genre, and the idea that the musical would be commercially successful, I mean, just nobody believed that –&nbsp;nobody– and I only did it because I loved them. But now, for example, Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;I think, did like a billion dollars, and then you go, ‘Wow. The musical really is back.’ Nobody even thinks about musicals being a challenge anymore. I mean, look at The Greatest Showman, look at La La Land. I’m just thrilled that the musical is now not a subject of, ‘Should you or shouldn’t you?’ The subject is: What do you do with it next? How can you keep challenging the form? How can you keep the interest in it?”“It was quite controversial when it first opened and it created a lot of polemic discussion about the cutting style, its content, the mashups.”Martin:&nbsp;“I’m very proud to have been part of the journey. I’m proud that it’s part of the body of work that I’ve been involved in. And I’m thrilled that it has stood the test of the time and I still meet people to this day that are as enthusiastic about it as they were in the first days of it being shown. In fact, the enthusiasm has kind of grown. And it was quite controversial when it first opened, and it created a lot of polemic discussion about the cutting style, its content, the mashups, all these things. And what’s fantastic is that it truly has continued to capture people’s imaginations. And it’s viewed more fondly now probably than when it first opened. The affection that the audience holds for the title, I think, is extraordinary. [When I saw the new musical] there was every sort of person in the audience and every age group. There were like five standing ovations. Alex Timbers [who directed the musical] has done an amazing job. It’s just great to see young fresh talent reinterpret something and make it relevant again to such a broad population. I mean, there’s nothing to be said apart from the audience can’t be wrong. You just cannot believe how the audience connects to the show. It’s&nbsp;mind blowing.”The stage at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre in New York City, where the Moulin Rouge! musical opens in July.

So I think to myself, ‘It’s got a life of its own and it continues.’ And you know, when we did it, its impact on fashion and on music, the idea of the musical mashup, that elephant love medley, where they all sing on top of the elephant and all the different love songs are all mashed together… For it to still be around 20 years later, it’s like some child that I guess I conceived and was born and has grown up, and now it’s like run away and fallen in love with an audience, and occasionally it drops by and says, ‘Hi Dad.’ And I go, ‘How you going?’ It’s got a life of it’s own.

Those are the ingredients&nbsp;of Guy Ritchie’s 2000 classic Snatch, as well as a new streaming series on Crackle. Crackle’s Snatch is 10 episodes with an all-new story set in the world of London gangsters and criminals.Albert Hill (Luke Pasqualino) is trying to get out of his father’s (Dougray Scott) crime business, but as Michael Corleone says, “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.” Albert thinks one last job with Charlie (Rupert Grint) could allow him to go legit, but every heist movie ever made says that something will go wrong.Grint and Pasqualino, along with the show’s creator Alex de Rakoff, spoke with Rotten Tomatoes before the premiere of Snatch on Crackle. Here are 10 ways 2017’s Snatch reinvented the classic film.1. IT’S GOT RON WEASLEY ALL GROWN UPIt’s not like Grint woke up on his 18th birthday and said, “I’m going to play adults now.” It’s just the characters he’s right for have grown up with him, and grown-up men are more likely to turn to crime than enroll in wizard school — probably.“It’s fun to do something edgier,” Grint said. “That’s what I really liked about the script. It was kind of ballsy. There’s a dark side that comes out which is really a joy to play. I’ve never really played anyone like him so it’s been good.”2. IT’S SNATCH: THE NEXT GENERATIONThe characters of Crackle’s Snatch were toddlers when Benicio del Toro, Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones, and Brad Pitt ran their con in the movie.&nbsp;They’re still young, untested criminals.“This show’s younger,” de Rakoff said. “All our kids are 21, 22, 23, 24. You’re dealing with relationships between boys and girls which you don’t see in the film. You’re dealing with kids growing up, and boys becoming men, and you’re dealing with family.”3. THERE ARE 10 HEISTS ON SNATCHAlbert and Charlie end up in a long con trying to snatch some gold bullion. That will take 10 episodes, but every week de Rakoff promises some heist action.“There’s a heist in every episode,” de Rakoff said. “When I say heist, I mean some shit goes down whether it’s a robbery or a diamond heist or something. There’s always a central narrative that each episode runs around with this meta-narrative which is the gold bullion.”The gold heist evolves every episode too.“It’s really interesting seeing how each character deals with the gold,” Grint said. “The gold becomes a character in its own right. It’s kind of like the ring in Lord of the Rings. It kind of has a dark effect on everyone. We all deal with it in different ways.”4.&nbsp;IT&nbsp;CLARIFIES THE DIALECTWhen Snatch came out on DVD it was a whole different movie for Americans who could finally turn on subtitles and understand the thick British slang. The characters on Crackle’s&nbsp;Snatch speak in cockney rhyming slang, a dialect first developed by gangsters to speak in code around police. It has now become common in London, but Crackle offers subtitles.“We’re trying to make a show for a wide audience, as well we still need to stay true to the characters and how they would actually speak in London and what not,” Pasqualino said. “There is a lot of that dialogue there.”De Rakoff said he was conservative with the slang: “I actually held back and was very restrained in terms of how much slang I use.“When I first saw The Sopranos, I didn’t understand half of what they said,” De Rakoff said. “I like that because you get the essence of what you’re watching and you get the context, but you’re like, ‘What was that word?’ Then you hear it again three episodes, later and you start to understand the fabric of the show.”5. ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IS BASED ON PRINCE HARRYCreating new characters in the underworld of London, the cast drew on many cultural resources. Grint even looked at British royalty.“It took me a while to find exactly who he was,” Grint said. “There’s a bit of Prince Harry in there. [Charlie] comes from this kind of aristocratic family. These people do exist, all their money’s gone, maintaining these huge properties and they can’t maintain it. So they have no money, but they live this kind of façade of wealth and very proud of the family name, despite having not a pot to piss in. It’s interesting he’s always trying to get away from that and trying to be more gangster. He’s desperate to justify his position in this gang.”As Albert, Pasqualino focused on his physicality.“It was how he moved, how he talked, how he points and how he uses his hands and stuff,” Pasqualino said. “When you get dressed and you’re in the costume, you feel in character.”6. IT HAS A WOMAN’S TOUCHThe film Snatch is a classic, but it’s also a sausage party. De Rakoff wanted to have a strong female presence in the show, so there are two female main characters. Chloe (Stephanie Leonidas) is a jeweler who become’s Charlie’s love interest.“He falls in love pretty hard for this jeweler, Chloe Cohen,” Grint said. “Kind of a weird, complicated love triangle emerges.”Lotti Mott (Phoebe Dynevor, pictured) is a gangster’s moll who teams up with Charlie and Alex.“Lotti Mott’s not just a femme fatale,” de Rakoff said. “She’s integral to the heist and the plots. She becomes very embedded in the gang. Especially 15 years after the movie, it was really important to have strong female characters. Lotti on the surface is a hustler, but there’s a lot more to her than that.“Chloe, played by Steph, appears more straight-laced when you meet her and a bit more on her game,” de Rakoff added. “She’s also very powerful, intelligent, ambitious female character on the show.”7. BOXING GOES PROAlbert and Charlie do manage a boxer (Lucien Laviscount), and there is a double cross in the ring. It goes about as well as Statham’s deal with Pitt in the movie, even though de Rakoff moved the fight from the streets to the arena.“There didn’t have to be a boxing match but I love the boxing match in Snatch,” de Rakoff said. “It’s something I felt was true to the world and true to the original. It’s also not a bare-knuckle fight. It’s a gloved fight, and it’s 15 years later. It has a bit more of a pop-up East London boxing feel as opposed to in a basement, grungy.”Look for some more twists on the common themes of Snatch.“Like the film, gypsies play a big role,” Grint said. “There’s a lot of characters from the gypsy camp, which is something people will be familiar with from the original. A lot of it is in the edit and the kind of music and the punchy dialogue. It sits somewhere between reality and cartoon. It’s just fun. That’s one of the things about the original. It was just fun. That’s an important thing to keep, not take it too seriously.”8. IT’S A 10-HOUR MOVIECrackle will release the entire first season of Snatch at once so viewers could potentially binge watch the whole thing. That’s how de Rakoff conceived it.“I look at this thing and feel like it’s a 10-hour film, not 10 episodic TV shows,” de Rakoff said.The cast recommends binging too.“I feel it’s something you really can binge-watch,” Grint said. “It’s so fast-paced. It’s all kind of quick cuts and slow motion. It’s got such a great style which is pretty authentic to the original. It just really kicks off.”9. IT’S A LONDON THAT ONLY EXISTS ON SNATCHThe movie filmed on location in London circa 1999. For the show, Snatch built sets in a Manchester studio, so the London that appears is an artist’s rendition of the streets.“We’ve taken over a set in Manchester, Old Granada Studio,” Pasqualino said. “It was home to a very popular soap opera in the UK. The production designers and set decorators have made it into a really unique world for us. Manchester is such a great place. It doubles as London. It doubles as New York. It can be anywhere you would want it to be with a little bit of help.”De Rakoff added that they included some location shots in back alleys of Manchester, still doubling as London.10. IT USES NEW, UNDERGROUND MUSICMusic plays a big role in Guy Ritchie movies. In fact, he made one called RocknRolla. De Rakoff wanted to have a modern musical style to Crackle’s Snatch&nbsp;and discovered some new artists to provide it.“It’s all unbroken bands predominantly in the show,” de Rakoff said. “It’s all 2016/2017. The clothes sit in today’s world, and I think play really, really strong. We identify ourselves and separate ourselves through the fact that it is 15 years later through the music and the fashion and the overall style of the show.”Snatch&nbsp;premieres March 16 on Crackle","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Christmas, horror, festivals, transformers, Alien, Lifetime, e.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"snatch-reinvents-2000-gangster-movie-for-2017-streaming"},{"id":"47613682450099","title":"Newell & Bardem Come Down with \"Cholera\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Newell &amp; Bardem Come Down with \"Cholera\"by Scott Weinberg | February 17, 2006 |  CommentsInternational acting stud Javier Bardem and well-rounded movie director Mike Newell are about to bring the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Love in the Time of Cholera\" to the big screen for New Line.

Here's how he spins his unique appeal.by Aaron Pruner | September 24, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images)Are we in the middle of a John Goodman television renaissance? A Goodman-aissance? According to the actor, it’s a silly question.“Oh for f—‘s sake,” Goodman says, laughing. “I don’t even want to think about that.”But given his recent return to The Conners set for season 2 of the Roseanne spin-off series, and his stint as the patriarch in HBO’s new comedy The Righteous Gemstones, it does feel like he’s currently having a noteworthy moment in the spotlight.It wasn’t something Goodman had planned. When Roseanne Barr was fired from the 2018&nbsp;Roseanne reboot — which had reunited Goodman with his old friend and on-screen wife — the actor found himself overwhelmed and unemployed.“At the time, I was in deeper shock about it than I even thought, and it was bad,” Goodman tells Rotten Tomatoes. “It had more to do with the Twitter world and social media. It just got really scary all of a sudden. And I thought I was handling it well, and then — just a lot of weird little things were going on with me. I got over it.”Goodman visited Jimmy Kimmel Live&nbsp;in fall 2018 and shed light on some of those things: “My wife got sick after that. And then I fell down the stairs.”That’s around the time Danny McBride came calling.“This is actually weird: I lost that job and, like, the day after, I got the call for Gemstones,” he explains. “I said, ‘Well, I’m not doing anything!’ And so I took that, and then [The Conners] came back. A lot of weird things happened.”It feels like Dan Conner and Eli Gemstone couldn’t be more different, yet grief seems to be a commonality between both characters; Dan lost Roseanne to an opiate overdose, though the death of Eli’s wife, Aimee-Leigh (Jennifer Nettles), has yet to be explained.Jumping from the working-class contractor that made Goodman a household name to the privileged wealthy leader of the Gemstone family’s megachurch wasn’t that much of a stretch for the actor. But for McBride, adding the beloved actor to the cast of his HBO series felt more like a pipe dream than an achievable reality.(Photo by Ryan Green/HBO)“I just never imagined that he would be interested in something I would be doing,” The Righteous Gemstones creator and star tells Rotten Tomatoes. “And so when we sent him the script, and he called back, I think, the next day and said he was interested, we were just blown away.”Was Goodman always on McBride’s mind to play Eli? Well, no. According to the Gemstones creator, picturing actors in the different roles he creates is never a part of his storytelling process. That comes much later. When those conversations happened and Goodman was suggested by casting directors Sharon Bialy and Sherry Thomas, McBride was energized by the notion.And when Goodman said yes, the whole thing really came together.“I couldn’t imagine anyone better for this,” McBride says. “He’s just an actor that I’ve always admired. And he’s my favorite kind of actor. He has the same ability as, you know, what I love about Walton Goggins, which is: I love it when someone can make me laugh, but I love it more when they can make me feel something and they can pull my heartstrings.”(Photo by ABC/Robert Trachtenberg)Delivering the comedy and plucking the heartstrings is something Goodman does so well, in fact, that it feels a bit effortless when you watch the man work — whether it’s on premium cable or in a primetime sitcom. For his work on The Conners, Goodman admits most of the acting work he’s been doing recently is reacting.“I think to my guy, it’s just kind of one damn thing after another, you know?” he says.After a thoughtful pause, he continues, “I think the challenge for [Dan] is just keeping up with everything and trying to stay on top as best he can. Right now, it just feels like he’s treading water. But that’s the way he’s felt his whole life. Things just happen.”Things just happen,&nbsp;life just happens. It sounds simple enough, but Goodman is downplaying his talent here. As humble as the actor is, there’s no denying his ability&nbsp;to take on the complexities of the human condition and do so with effortless flair.“Mainly, I just study him,” Sara Gilbert reveals. “He’s like a humanizing machine. The words come out more real and different than you would ever expect. There is some part of me that believes Dan Conner is absolutely a real person.”(Photo by ABC/Eric McCandless)Gilbert has played Darlene, the middle Conner child, for 12 years, collectively. First, during the show’s original run, from 1988 to 1997. And then, like the rest of the core cast, she reprised her role for 2018’s Roseanne revival. Barr may be gone from the show, but the Conners family legacy lives on.“It’s quite magical that after all these years, the relationship is the relationship,” Gilbert says. “If anything, maybe Darlene challenges her dad a bit more as an equal. Their ideas clash and we get to fight it out more than I remember doing as a child.”In the upcoming season of the ABC sitcom, a new addition to the Conner family switches things up a bit. Will the loss of Roseanne still be in the tapestry of the show? From the sound of it, her absence will always be felt. But with pregnant Becky about to give Dan a new grandchild, the character can’t dwell on the past.“There’s not much time to reflect because of the changing relationships,” Goodman says, “and the changing family dynamics with the kids living at home, now. It’s just one damn thing after another, so you have to keep up. And just keep earning a living.”(Photo by ABC)With just a three-week gap between the wrapping of Gemstones season 1 and the start of production on The Conners, Goodman’s schedule has become quite busy. Just last month, Disney+ announced a new animated sequel series to Monsters Inc., titled Monsters At Work, which will find Goodman reprising his role as beloved monster Sully.“Oh, yeah! I forgot about that,” he laughs. “I don’t know if I’m done with it or not. I haven’t heard from them lately.”Friends, fans, colleagues, and industry observers have no problem remembering the Golden Globe– and Emmy–award winning actor’s accomplishments, including his roles in blockbuster fare like the Monsters and&nbsp;Transformers franchises, Kong: Skull Island,&nbsp;10 Cloverfield Lane; in Joel&nbsp;and Ethan Coen’s Barton Fink, The Big Lebowski,&nbsp;Inside Llewyn Davis, and&nbsp;O Brother, Where Art Thou?; on Roseanne, of course, but also in TV series The West Wing, Treme, and Damages; and, with 13 appearances, as&nbsp;the third-most&nbsp;frequent host of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live (behind Alec Baldwin at No. 1 and Steve Martin at No. 2).“[John Goodman] was doing television before being on TV was cool,” McBride says. “Back then, it was like if somebody was on a famous sitcom, they weren’t in movies. And, you know, John was able to be in big movies, a big popular television show, and be able to be in arthouse films with the Coen brothers … He’s been able to do anything he wants. And he’s been around for a long time doing that, and it’s just really, really impressive.”With all the projects Goodman is juggling, it shouldn’t be all that surprising that he’d space on one of Disney’s highly-anticipated new programs. It feels like the actor’s real-life strategy is not so different from his iconic small-screen persona: Just keep earning a living.“You know, I’m just a guy with two jobs. I’m really lucky. And the two jobs I have are really great,” Goodman says before correcting himself. “Three jobs! I keep forgetting about Monsters At Work!”The Righteous Gemstones&nbsp;airs on Sundays 10/9C at on HBO; The Conners&nbsp;season 2 debuts on Tuesday, September 24 at 8/7C on ABC; Monsters At Work&nbsp;is expected to be available the second year after Disney+ launches on&nbsp;November 12.&nbsp;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"series, Christmas, furious, E3, YouTube, YouTube, Searchlight, Arrowverse, Disney","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"john-goodman-tv-renaissance-conners-righteous-gemstones-monsters-at-work"},{"id":"47613726335685","title":"Trailer Bulletin: Harsh Times","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trailer Bulletin: Harsh Timesby Scott Weinberg | July 5, 2006 |  CommentsI saw \"Harsh Times\" almost a year ago, and I remember thinking \"Wow, Christian Bale is a force of freakin’ nature in this flick.\" I also expected that the actor’s fans would have a field day with this movie — which I’m sure they will, if the thing ever gets a release date.

Epps plays Isaac Johnson, a Secret Service agent who recruits his former Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Ryan Phillippe) to help him prevent an assassination attempt on the president. By the end of the first episode, Swagger is framed for taking the killshot. Just what did Johnson get him into?It’s a big week for Epps too, because his holiday comedy Almost Christmas opens this weekend, with Shooter premiering on USA next week. In&nbsp;the former, Epps plays a romantic leading man to Gabrielle Union at a family holiday gathering.Whether fans know him as Eric Foreman from House, Quincy McCall from Love &amp; Basketball, or any of the roles he’s played in the last 25 years, no one quite knows what to expect from Epps as Isaac Johnson in Shooter. Swagger will have to find the truth.Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: Is it nice to have a leading man role in Almost Christmas and a villain role in Shooter coming out at the same time?Omar Epps: It’s awesome. It’s just fun, man. I’m just enjoying the ride. I had a great time doing Almost Christmas, but then we had a really great time doing Shooter. What I liked about it was the storytelling was way more cerebral than the trailer could give off. On the surface, it looks like this action–espionage-y feeling, but the cat-and-mouse game is really a chess game with layers. So I’m excited about that.RT: Even if people read the book or saw the movie, are there a lot of twists and turns coming for Johnson on Shooter?Epps: Oh yeah, totally. We kind of start with that same plot, but then we veer off and do our own thing.RT: There is a lot of jargon to explain to Swagger when they recruit him to help. Is that fairly easy compared to all the medical jargon you had for eight years on House?Epps: Everything else is easier than the medical stuff I had to do on House. That was like speaking a different language. It felt good to just speak normal military jargon again.RT: You say “normal military jargon.” That can seem like a foreign language too.Epps: You know what’s funny with the military: It’s really a lot of acronyms. Everything has an abbreviation term. It’s like a quickspeak, but that was fun. I try to bring a level of authenticity to not even just my characters, but whatever their field is. I always want the people who are actually in those fields in real life to feel like, “Oh wow, it’s grounded and authentic.”RT: That is a good point: that once you know what the abbreviations stand for, it’s easier to say them.Epps: Yeah, and it informs your intonations.RT: The Secret Service can’t let you do a ride-along like you could if you were playing a detective, right?Epps: Yes, that didn’t happen. I did get to speak to a couple of ex–Secret Service guys just to get the little bit of insight that they could give me in terms of that lifestyle.RT: What were some specific little details they could give you that helped you play Johnson?Epps: You look at everything as a grid so it’s a very militaristic mindset in that everything is always through a scope. Everything is on a grid like roads, streets, buildings. It’s a different way of looking at your surrounding environment. One of the little subtleties for me was a lot of marriages don’t last because you’re living a life where you’ve got to pick up and be gone for two months and just get the call like that. I’ve never even thought about that, but I tried to bring that type of feeling into the character.RT: Are guns part of your skill set at this point, having played different agents and cops?Epps: I wouldn’t say they’re part of my skill set. I’m familiar with some. The guns that we were working with in Shooter, I’ve never seen those before. They were really high-grade pieces of machinery.RT: As far as skills you’ve learned for roles before, do you still play basketball?Epps: Here and there. I mostly like to box and do martial arts, things like that, to be physical.RT: Like the movie, in the first few episodes, Johnson is part of this conspiracy against Swagger. Is there any hope of redemption for him?Epps: Absolutely, because Isaac is not a bad guy. He’s a guy who believes in the system and the further up the ladder he went, simultaneously the deeper down the rabbit hole he went. You always hear that saying, “doing it for the greater good.” The greater good is sort of a relative term. His code of ethics and morals is tested and he gets to the position that he’s in by doing something that he thinks is for the greater good that turns up to twist on him. That redeemable factor is very prevalent by the end of the season for him.RT: What are some juicy episodes of Shooter fans should watch for?Epps: I think, hey, should watch the whole thing. I don’t want to give too much away, but there are a couple of episodes where we go backwards in time, and you get to see how my character and Ryan’s character were in the military. Isaac at one time was the captain of the Marine Sniper Unit, which is pretty badass within itself. I think at that point, the audience needs to really get what their dynamic is before moving forward.RT: Does that give you a chance to play two different relationships with Swagger, then and now?Epps: A little bit. It’s interesting because on the surface it might seem as though they had a friendship, but you see it was more of a working relationship. That’s what happens during the course of the season. They discover their relationship, a different part of it.RT: On the lighter side, Almost Christmas is your return to comedy in over a decade. Had you been looking for a comedy?Epps: I actually have. This kind of fell right into my life. I had such a great time working on this project. The energy that you see spilling off the screen in Almost Christmas was exactly how we were on set. Everyone just had a genuinely great time.RT: Was that scene with Gabrielle Union stuck in the window like a big screwball comedy moment?Epps: That was actually my first day on set so we just dove in. Gab and I are friends, so we just had fun with it. It wasn’t a situation where these two characters come together and they’re like wham, bam, thank you, ma’am. There’s an innocence to it that we got to play with, so that was fun to do.RT: Did you ever see House as a comedy? Because it was the funniest show on television.Epps: I never saw it as a comedy, but all the comedic moments, I got. I thought the comedy in House was brilliant.RT: Are you writing a script too?Epps: I have a few screenplays that I’ve written. I’ve got a couple of television projects that I’ve written. I’m trying to hit on all cylinders. Everything is in full motion right now.RT: Right now you’re on Shooter, but are you developing things you would act in?Epps: Not all of them but a couple of them are, yes, definitely. I don’t want to talk about anything in development, but I do have a project at Lifetime that I wrote that we’re trying to put together. It’s a romantic comedy.Shooter premieres November 15 at 10 p.m. ET on USA","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Trailer, and, disaster, social, Calendar, ratings, rotten, Britbox, foreign, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"omar-epps-on-shooter-and-almost-christmas"},{"id":"47614836735168","title":"\"The Net 2.0\" Coming Online","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"The Net 2.0\" Coming Onlineby RT Staff | February 22, 2005 |  CommentsCharles Winkler will direct the sequel to 1995’s \"The Net,\" according to Production Weekly.

Notting Hill, arguably her last great rom-com, remains a timeless, beloved urban fairy tale, and also one of the most successful rom-coms in history, earning $364 million worldwide ($116 million in the U.S.) since its release in North American theaters on May 28, 1999.Notting Hill re-teamed screenwriter Richard Curtis (Love Actually) with his Four Weddings And A Funeral star Hugh Grant, whose chemistry with Roberts (in their only on-screen appearance together) is so off-the-charts it makes you buy the wish fulfillment fantasy that’s at the heart of Notting Hill’s appeal: that an A-list Hollywood star could fall in love with an ordinary, working-class Englishman.Roberts’ fierce energy, radiant smile, and quick-witted intelligence have had audiences swooning since she burst on to the scene as the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold in 1990’s Pretty Woman. The star recently told Buzzfeed that she’s done making romantic comedies, and so in honor of her legacy, and to mark the anniversary of her best reviewed rom-com, Notting Hill, we’re paying tribute to her rom-com legacy. In order of Tomatometer, of course.Check out our rom-com showdown: Sandra Bullock vs. Julia RobertsAmerica's Sweethearts (2001)  32%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Did You Know… Julia Roberts reportedly turned down the lead role (which went to Catherine Zeta-Jones) to play the supporting role.Roberts plays: Kiki, assistant to her mega-star sister Gwen (CZJ), whose estranged actor husband Eddie (John Cusack), is falling in love with Kiki.Meet Cute: Alas, none – Kiki’s already well acquainted with her brother-in-law.Best Line: “That woman you saw by the pool, that woman you just have to spend the rest of your life with… that was me.”Memorable Sidekick: None, but Billy Crystal as a seasoned, world-weary Hollywood publicist named Lee Phillips has the role in spirit.Romantic Obstacle: Will Kiki’s sister will really let her take her man?Wins Boy?&nbsp;Yes.Runaway Bride (1999)  46%Did You Know… Eight years before the film’s release, Roberts was a runaway bride in real-life, ditching actor Kiefer Sutherland at the altar.Roberts plays: Maggie, a small-town woman whose penchant for leaving grooms at the altar draws the attention of big-city newspaper columnist Ike (Richard Gere).Meet Cute: Ike inquires about Maggie in a beauty parlor.Best Line: “There is a distinct possibility I am profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.”Memorable Sidekick: Maggie’s sharp-tongued friend Peggy Flemming (Joan Cusack). “Not the ice skater,” she tells Ike.Romantic Obstacle: Fear of commitment.Wins Boy?

It’s a concept that’s so compelling that Shudder recently premiered an entire docuseries dedicated to it; it’s called, rather appropriately,&nbsp;Cursed Films.In honor of the most recent addition to the canon — the faux documentary Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made&nbsp;—&nbsp;we’re going to pay a little tribute to the “found footage” horror movies that tricked people into believing their authenticity,&nbsp;as well as those urban legend-like “cursed” films that earned sinister reputations because of the unfortunate, disturbing, and sometimes tragic events that were allegedly attributed to them.But they’re only movies, right?Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made (2019)  75%(Photo by Else Films)What better way to kick things off than with a movie that is a perfect Venn diagram of both concepts – “found footage” faux-real horror and supposedly cursed films. Antrum purports to be a documentary about a lost 1970s film that was only screened twice, because everyone who watches it dies. The movie opens with an 8-minute documentary detailing the curse around the film, then shows you the “film” itself, which is about two young kids who attempt to dig a hole to Hell to save their recently deceased dog. The filmmakers do their best to make the movie-within-a-movie look authentically ’70s to help sell the whole façade. The fact that Antrum’s release was preceded by rumors and word of mouth among hardcore horror fans (much like the way the controversial 2011 A Serbian Film grew a reputation well before it was ever screened publicly) lent the movie an air of real mystery. Some eager horror buffs even tried to track the “original” Antrum down, believing it to be real.Plausibility Score: 2 out of 5Antrum is a nice try, but in the age of advanced search engines, it’s hard to fully convince people that a film with a supposed body count of 60 could truly have been “lost.”Snuff (American Cannibale) (1976) The concept of a “snuff” film – a movie depicting an actual murder – basically started in 1971 when Ed Sanders, the author of a book about the Manson Family, asserted that Charles Manson and his followers had filmed their killing spree (no footage was ever found). Then, just a few years later in 1976, husband-and-wife directors Michael and Roberta Findlay made a cheap exploitation film called&nbsp;Slaughter&nbsp;about an actress and her director who are murdered by a Manson Family-esque clan in South America. Grindhouse film distributor Allan Shackleton bought the film, changed the title to&nbsp;Snuff, and released it under the pretense that it depicted the real murder of the main actress (the tagline was “Filmed in South America…Where Life is Cheap!”). This kickstarted an obsession with&nbsp;snuff films, although none have ever been conclusively unearthed.Plausibility Score: 4 out of 5The Manson Family connection and the fact that people still believe in the existence of snuff films even today and really sell this one.Poltergeist (1982)  86%Perhaps the most famous “cursed” movie of all time, the original 1982 Poltergeist, about a suburban family terrorized by a supernatural presence, climaxed with a scene in which the mom (JoBeth Williams) is dragged into a partially dug-out pool and is surrounded by skeletons – the reveal being that the housing development in which they live was unscrupulously built on top of a graveyard. The rumor was that the film crew had not only used real skeletons, but had desecrated graves themselves to get them. Mysterious and untimely deaths of some of the actors in the trilogy, including young Heather O’Rourke (who played the abducted little girl Carol Anne), who died at the age of 12 due to a congenital intestinal issue, and Dominique Dunne (who played oldest sibling Dana), who was murdered by a jealous boyfriend at the age of 22, led to the urban legend that the ghosts of the unwitting skeletal “co-stars” had cursed the films and everyone who worked on them. It’s flimsy, because clearly major players like Williams,&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson, director Tobe Hooper, and producer Steven Spielberg walked away unscathed.Plausibility Score: 1 out of 5Although it’s the movie everyone cites when talking about curses, a lot of the supposed connections are pretty thin. Plus, more of the actors and crew survived unhurt than didn’t, and a lot of the “deaths” beyond the two young leads were simply age and explainable illness.The Blair Witch Project (1999)  86%Horror is a great way for young talents to break into the business because, often, what you don’t see is scarier than what you do, so it’s a godsend for indie filmmakers with more creativity than budget. The Blair Witch Project came about at exactly the right time – exploiting the still nascent “world wide web,” it managed to cultivate its own urban legend of supposedly lost cam footage that was recovered after a group of young filmmakers went missing. The conceit of it being filmed on the fly covered over the fact that you don’t really see much of anything, and the clever use of sound effects and the overall naturalistic performances by the lead actors made you think, just for a second, that maybe this was the real deal. Of course, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 came out around a year later to confirm that, yes, this was indeed just a cheesy horror franchise at its core.Plausibility Score: 3 out of 5It may have lost some luster since, but at the time? It really had people convinced. And the execution – from the early websites to the film itself&nbsp;– was nearly perfect.The Omen (1976)  86%Strap in for this one: Producer Harvey Bernhard claims that the initial idea for the seminal horror classic The Omen came from an advertising exec named Bob Munger. Munger suggested that a movie about the Antichrist would be cool, but that no one should actually make it because “the devil was at work and he didn’t want that film made.” He may have been right. Just a month before filming was to start, lead actor Gregory Peck’s son committed suicide. As he flew to the set, Peck’s plane was struck by lightning, and then executive producer Marc Neufeld’s plane was also struck by lightning on his way to the location. The hotel Neufeld and his wife were staying in then got bombed by the Irish Republican Army. The crew hired a small plane to do some aerial photography, but it was given to another client at the last minute; that plane crashed on takeoff and killed everyone on board. Filming a zoo sequence, the young boy playing the demonic Damien apparently upset the baboons so much they started freaking out, so an animal wrangler was called in to help; the next day, he was mauled by a tiger and killed. But perhaps the most chilling result of this “curse” was what happened to special effects supervisor John Richardson. One of his big FX sequences in The Omen was one in which a character is decapitated by a sheet of glass. While working on his next movie in the Netherlands, Richardson and his assistant were involved in a car accident, and his assistant was — you guessed it — decapitated. Legend has it the accident occurred near a street sign that read “Ommen, 66.6 km.” But it’s all coincidence, right?Plausibility Score: 4 out of 5It’s hard to write all of this off as coincidence. Even when people discount some of it – like the existence of the Dutch street sign – there’s a lot more that’s been verified.Cannibal Holocaust (1980)  65%(Photo by ©F.D. Cinematografica courtesy Everett Collection)Not long after Snuff, another film came under fire for allegedly depicting actual murders – and it was an early example of “found footage” horror, to boot. This Italian cult movie was built around the idea that it was footage discovered after an American film crew disappeared in the Amazon rainforest and were killed and eaten by indigenous cannibals. The gore was so intense and realistic that a few days after the movie’s premiere, Italian authorities confiscated the film, director Ruggero Deodato was charged with obscenity, and he was eventually slapped with a murder charge when it was suggested Cannibal Holocaust was, in fact, a snuff film. Although it was later proven that none of the actors were killed or harmed, the film does depict scenes of intense animal cruelty&nbsp;that were real. Fun fact: the fake documentary the crew was working on was called The Green Inferno, which would be the title adopted by director Eli Roth for his 2013 homage to Cannibal Holocaust.Plausibility Score: 3 out of 5The rough, grimy cheapness of the film and the addition of actual animal butchery make this feel almost like the real deal.The Crow (1994)  83%What’s unique about the “curse” of The Crow&nbsp;is that it isn’t so much about the film as it is an extension of a curse that is believed to have haunted martial arts icon Bruce Lee and his family for generations. Of course, the 1994 horror-tinged comic book adaptation is infamous due to the tragic death of star Brandon Lee, Bruce’s son, who died after a prop gun misfired and a projectile struck him. The film was&nbsp;hampered by setbacks and accidents – the set was destroyed numerous times, most notably by a hurricane that struck its North Carolina filming location – but in general, the problems seem to have been caused mostly by the fact that it was low budget and behind schedule, and corners were cut a little too recklessly. Some even claim that the Chinese mafia assassinated Bruce and Brandon, which is eerie when you think about the fact that Bruce Lee’s last film, Game of Death, seems to predict this. In that movie, Bruce’s character is a martial arts actor who is shot by an assassin posing as one of the stunt crew. Also, the biopic Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story anthropomorphizes the supposed family curse as a physical demon that haunts Lee his whole life, and at one point in the film, the demon goes after a young Brandon. Dragon was released in 1993 – a year before The Crow.Plausibility Score: 2 out of 5The idea of a Lee Family Curse is compelling, and it fits in with the whole mystical aura&nbsp;surrounding Bruce. But dig deeper into the on-set events of The Crow, and it all appears to be more a case of negligence and unprofessionalism than a sinister hex.The Exorcist (1973)  83%If the Devil really does exist, he seems to spend an awful lot of time on film sets. Before The Omen tempted fate with each shooting day, William Friedkin’s The Exorcist experienced its own unnerving incidents. Telling the story of two priests battling a demonic presence that has taken hold of a young girl named Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair), the film is an undisputed classic of the horror genre, and some of that may have to do with the&nbsp;notion that the film itself was actually possessed. Things got off to a rocky start when the MacNeil family home set – where much of the action takes place – was destroyed by fire. The only room that was untouched by the blaze…was Regan’s. In addition, almost all of the actors suffered injuries during the filming, and televangelist Billy Graham even claimed that “there is a power of evil in that film, in the fabric of the film itself” and suggested that simply projecting it was like opening a door for demons. The movie held its premiere in Rome, during a violent thunderstorm. One attendee even passed out and broke her jaw, later attempting to sue the production because she blamed subliminal messages for her tumble.Plausibility Score: 3 out of 5Some of the spookiness experienced on set and at early screenings was likely psychosomatic, but the movie still carries a heavy creep factor regardless.Rosemary's Baby (1968)  96%Why not complete Satan’s own personal trilogy with a supposedly cursed movie that pre-dates both The Omen and The Exorcist? Rosemary’s Baby is rightly credited with redefining the horror genre by taking it away from the campy cobwebs and castles of the old Vincent Price days and legitimizing it as a “real” grown-up art form. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes star in the story of a young mother-to-be who moves into a New York apartment building that also happens to house a Satanic cult. Producer William Castle – who was infamous in the 1950s and 1960s for promoting all sorts of gimmicks like floating skeletons and rumbling theater seats in an effort to sell the “reality” of his horror movies – believed that real witches had cursed the set. The film’s composer suffered a nasty fall shortly after the movie wrapped and died after being comatose for several days. Castle himself fell ill with painful gallstones that required surgery. And, of course, director Roman Polanski’s wife at the time, actress Sharon Tate, and their unborn child would&nbsp;fall victim to the Manson Family a year after the film’s release.Plausibility Score: 1 out of 5It’s easy to think of anything Satan-related as tempting fate when it comes to curses or bad mojo, but most of these incidents seem loosely connected at best.Faces of Death (1978)  25%Just as&nbsp;The Blair Witch Project came along at the perfect time to take advantage of early internet, the legend of Faces of Death is largely a product of the early 1980s VHS boom. Before Blockbuster, video stores were small (often seedy) mom-and-pop stores, and Faces of Death was one of those creepy little oddities you’d find on one of the dust-covered shelves. Allegedly depicting “real” deaths, it served as a badge of honor for anyone&nbsp;who was actually able to get ahold of a copy and watch it. Although the film does contain some real footage – like newsreel clips from an accident where you can see paramedics cleaning up the remains of a cyclist who had been struck and killed by a truck – it was almost entirely faked by writer and director John Alan Schwartz. Yes, even the infamous scene where a table full of diners appear to kill a trapped monkey and then eat its brains.Plausibility Score: 1 out of 5If you don’t catch on immediately when you’re introduced to the movie’s “medical professional” host, “Francis B. Gross,” you’ll catch on during sequences like the “real” shark attack that somehow has footage from the shark’s POV as it eats a diver. Did it get a cinematography credit?Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)  57%(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)The film version of the classic horror and sci-fi television series let four different directors adapt a classic episode: “Kick the Can” by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark), “It’s a Good Life” by Joe Dante (Gremlins, Innerspace), “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” by George Miller (The Road Warrior, Mad Max: Fury Road), and “Time Out” by John Landis (Trading Places, Animal House). Although some claim the movie is cursed, it’s really just that there’s a sense of morbidity around it because veteran actor Vic Morrow (father of Jennifer Jason Leigh) and two young actors playing Vietnamese children were killed in an on-set accident during Landis’ segment when a helicopter that was part of a sequence recreating the Vietnam War crash-landed on them. None of the other directors experienced any bizarre or unexplained incidents, and all continued to have successful careers. But the tragedy&nbsp;hung a dark shadow over Landis&nbsp;and lends the movie a creepy, all-too-real feel.Plausibility Score: 1 out of 5Again, this was one horrible, tragic accident caused by director negligence. The rest of the film (and filmmakers) got on fine with no curse-related incidents.GUINEA PIG: FLOWER OF FLESH AND BLOOD (1985)None of the images from this film are acceptable to show you, so here is a guinea pig pushing a tiny shopping cart. (Photo by Newspix/Getty Images)Created by artist Hideshi Hino based on his own manga series, the&nbsp;Guinea Pig&nbsp;movies&nbsp;feature the same kind of faux documentary feel as something like Faces of Death or Cannibal Holocaust, and&nbsp;they’re legendary among hardcore horror fans.&nbsp;Without any real plot to speak of beyond “psycho kidnaps women and dismembers them in gruesome fashion while dressed as a samurai,” the movies do feel less like a story and more like some forbidden home video. That said, two incidents lend it a particular air of menace. One is that a copy of Flower of Flesh and Blood&nbsp;was sent to the FBI by Charlie Sheen – yes, Charlie Sheen – because he was convinced it was an actual snuff film (it was not, and all of the deaths and butchery were faked). The other is that a copy of the film was found in the home of a man named Tsutomu Miyazaki, a cannibalistic serial killer known as the Otaku Murderer who was behind the kidnapping and murder of four young girls between 1988 and 1989 in Japan. The film was believed to have inspired him.Plausibility Score: 3 out of 5All Hino had to do was&nbsp;not put a title card over the opening “stalking” sequence and it might have worked. The scene really looks and feels like something a creep would record as he follows women down the street. But no real serial killer goes into AfterEffects and adds cool titles and music cues to their murder footage. At least, not that we know of.ATUK(Photo by Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Universal Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment)Rounding out or list of horror is… not a horror film, but a movie that is believed to be so cursed it will never be made. A comedy based on a 1963 satirical novel called The Incomparable Atuk by Canadian author Mordecai Richler, the story is about an Inuit poet who travels to Toronto and has a series of fish-out-of-water experiences in the big city (the film version Americanized it by making Atuk&nbsp;a native of Alaska&nbsp;who travels to&nbsp;New York). Sounds pretty basic, right? It might well be, if the movie didn’t seem to kill every actor associated with the lead role. The curse of Atuk is particularly weird because the novel itself isn’t about anything sinister or paranormal. The first man up for the role was comedy legend John Belushi; after his untimely death from a drug overdose, the producers approached comedian Sam Kinison… who then died in a drunk driving accident. So they decided to offer the part to John Candy, who would die from a heart attack a few months after getting the script. Undaunted, the part was then dangled in front of another SNL vet – Chris Farley. He, too, would succumb to a drug overdose. Even stranger, Farley allegedly gave a copy of the script to a friend who he thought might also be interested in the role, namely fellow SNL alum Phil Hartman. Five months after Farley’s death, Hartman was shot and killed by his wife, who committed suicide hours later.Plausibility Score: 5 out of 5If this movie doesn’t scream “cursed,” we don’t know what does.Thumbnail image by Else Films","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, adaptation, movies, composers, TCM, Emmy, football, Interview, Cosplay","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"antrum-and-12-other-cursed-movies-that-will-make-your-skin-crawl"},{"id":"47613840290554","title":"Catalina Sandina Morena Joins Soderbergh’s Che Films","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Catalina Sandina Morena Joins Soderbergh's Che FilmsYep, \"films.\"by Scott Weinberg | July 20, 2007 |  CommentsDid you know that Steven Soderbergh was making a movie about Che Guevara? Starring Benicio Del Toro in the title role? Yeah, me too. But somehow I missed the news that he was making TWO films about the historical figure.According to Variety, Oscar nominee Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) will join Oscar winner Del Toro (as well as Julia Ormond, Franka Potente, and Jorge Perugorria) in not one but two films from Mr. Soderbergh: Both The Argentine and Guerrilla will tell the Che Guevara story from two different perspective. I’m guessing here, but I’m getting a Flags of Our Fathers / Letters from Iwo Jima vibe on these projects.Steven Soderbergh, as you probably already know, is one of those filmmakers who leaps between indie-style and big-budget whenever he feels like it. One one side he gave us sex, lies &amp; videotape, The Limey, Full Frontal, and Bubble — and on the other side we got Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, and the whole Ocean’s series. And then somewhere in the middle are The Good German and Solaris. Pretty impressive if you ask me.Soderbergh begins his dual-movie project later this month in Spain.

After a long layoff, Jenkins is back with \"The Savages,\" premiering at the Sundance Film Festival.The charismatic Jenkins is almost a poster girl for Sundance; she’s had three films in the festival, and workshopped \"Slums of Beverly Hills\" in the Sundance labs. Her latest, \"The Savages,\" stars Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman in a dramedy about two middle-aged siblings who must care for their long-estranged father with dementia. In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, she talked about the process of writing, the problems inherent in making an independent film, and how to avoid telling an audience how to feel.Director Tamara Jenkins with Philip Seymour Hoffman.Rotten Tomatoes: Was \"The Savages\" a hard sell for studios?Tamara Jenkins: It’s a tough movie, and I was anxious that there would be a desire to chip away at the frankness of the movie. There were certainly suggestions, but when push came to shove, they let me make the movie I wanted to make, and that’s a pretty noble thing. In [the years between features] I matured in ways that made me incredibly protective about my point of view with regards to what I make. But really, when it came down it, they were like, \"It’s your movie.\"RT: What was the reason for the delay between projects?TJ: Well, I worked on a script (a biopic of Diane Arbus), and it never happened for various reasons. I made weird things, I directed theater pieces, I wrote art essays, I did some strange things. And then I wrote this, and this took a couple of years. I knew everybody would be like, \"What have you been doing?\" I think I learned to be a good writer. I spent a lot of time writing, and failing, and trying, and just devoting myself to becoming a better writer. I think I was in the woods. And I literally was in the woods, because I went to this artists’ colony, like, three times, this writers’ colony called Yaddo, this legendary place in upstate New York where [John] Cheever wrote, and Sylvia Plath. There were all of these very intense fiction writers, and there was just something about being in that environment and that kind of commitment to writing.RT: As a woman, is it harder to get a project off the ground?TJ: It feels like there are definite inequities out there in terms of how many women filmmakers there are. There’s got to be some sort of truth in that. But it was kind of a personal exile. I feel I’m not really cut out for the business in a certain way. I don’t think I’m that great at that. I feel I’m getting better, but it doesn’t come naturally for me.RT: Where did you come up with the idea for the main characters?TJ: I wrote a scene about 10 years ago about this brother and sister, where the sister is calling freaking out about her dad. I didn’t even know what it was connected to. I think I was just interested in a sibling dynamic, and that was the first sign of it… As I was writing, it became very clear to me that it was about these two individuals, they were born under the same roof, under the same circumstances, and they adapt to the world in certain ways based on the damage of their childhood. Their coping mechanisms were very different.Jenkins on the set of \"The Savages.\"RT: While I was watching \"The Savages,\" I was wondering if these were the \"Slums of Beverly Hills\" characters all grown up.TJ: I mean, there are obviously some autobiographical elements. I’ve had old people in my life die. My grandmother had dementia and she lived in a nursing home. But it’s inaccurate to say that it’s autobiographical. There’s a nursing home around the corner from where I live, and I have a dog, and I walk my dog around the block every single day, and there’s this nursing home, and I was just very fixated on it. I was obsessed with making the tone of that nursing home right. There are some aspects that are personal, but it’s a fiction. [Also,] I went and saw \"Tokyo Story,\" and I was like, \"This is so applicable to what I’m doing, but I’m doing the inverse.\" It really bugged me that the kids were these monsters. I took ideas from me and my brother, from both our lives, and just inverted us. It’s not autobiographical, it’s kind of us inside-out.RT: You got a really good cast to put this over.TJ: The most important thing was to find the right people who would really have this chemistry. It was like casting lovers or something; they had to have the perfect chemistry that made sense. After meeting Laura, then I had the idea of Phil. I just couldn’t believe my luck, that they responded to it and that they had the time to do it.RT: It was shot pretty quickly?TJ: Thirty days.RT: Was this an easier experience than \"Slums?\"TJ: Yeah. I mean, it was very hard, for all the reasons that making movies is hard, like not enough money and not enough time. Mostly not enough time, which means not having enough money. But I did have a lot of luck in a lot of ways, and surrounded myself with a lot of really talented people in every department. There was just a really amazing work ethic.RT: \"Slums of Beverly Hills\" and \"The Savages\" have laughs, but they’re sort of sour.TJ: It must be my perspective or something. It’s not I’m sitting there trying to do something. It’s obviously something I’m very attracted to. I guess I think something that I’m trying to achieve is a kind of tone where you’re not telling an audience how to respond. They have to find their own way through it. You don’t want to feel like you’re pushing emotional buttons in a cheap way. I didn’t realize it that much until I saw it with an audience. People weren’t having a universal response, they were having their own reactions to it.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney make their appearance.RT: This is your third time at Sundance, in terms of having a movie here?TJ: I had two short films and this one. I was first here in 1994, and it was shaggy and rumpled. It was just kind of a different feeling. But I really love to be here, because I love the institute. It was a very formative thing for me. Even though everyone’s always talking about how it’s been corrupted by all this stuff, I still think there are definitely people here who are focused on film.RT: What are you doing next?TJ: I have no idea. This has been very consuming. There hasn’t been enough downtime to imagine anything yet.Read Tim’s review of \"The Savages.\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tubi, cinematic, thriller, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sundance-interview-rt-talks-with-the-savages-tamara-jenkins"},{"id":"47613852536575","title":"5 Reasons Why Three Kings Is the Best War Satire of the Last 20 Years","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Reasons Why Three Kings Is the Best War Satire of the Last 20 YearsOn its 20th anniversary, we look back at David O. Russell's eerily prescient heist movie, whose astute observations and moral complexity are just as relevant now as they were then.by Graham Flashner | October 1, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)There were a handful of forgettable war-related films released in 1999: The General’s Daughter, All The King’s Men, the Robin Williams-starrer Jakob The Liar. And then there was Three Kings (Certified Fresh at 94%), part action comedy, part heist movie, and 20 years later, still holding up as one of the best — and most subversive — war films ever made.Directed with adrenalized panache by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook,&nbsp;American Hustle), Three Kings followed on the heels of Steven Spielberg’s heroic 1998 WWII epic Saving Private Ryan, which canonized the sacrifices made by the Greatest Generation. But Russell had no such patriotic flag to wave. Like Catch-22, Three Kings satirically probes the insanities of war; like Apocalypse Now, it revels in surreal set pieces and sharp visual juxtapositions; like M*A*S*H, it mixes black humor with moral complexity.Its heroes are reluctant ones, soldiers who start out consumed by their own self-interest until forced by untenable circumstances to take a moral stand.IT HAS A KILLER VISUAL LOOKInspired by color photos of the war that appeared in newspapers at the time, Russell and his cinematographer, Newton Thomas Siegel, devised a saturated, blown-out look for the Iraqi desert (actually Arizona) in the film. They increased the contrast and graininess and bypassed the bleaching stage of the film process, giving the desert landscape a foreboding, surreal look, which set the visual template for other films about contemporary wars that followed. The Iraqi village was designed by production designer Catherine Hardwicke, who served the same role on films like Tombstone and Tank Girl and would go on to direct the first Twilight and Lords Of Dogtown.IT MAKES ASTUTE POLITICAL POINTS WITHOUT BEING PREACHY(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Russell exposes the hypocrisy of American foreign policy in the Middle East and indicts the Bush Administration for its abandonment of anti-Saddam insurgents – whom the U.S. had encouraged to rise up against the Iraqi dictator – all without pedantic speeches or heavy-handed scenes. The soldiers who steal back the Kuwaiti gold from Saddam – George Clooney, Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg, and Being John Malkovich director Spike Jonze – spend the latter part of the film, at great risk to themselves, helping a group of insurgents reach the Iranian border, foreshadowing the refugee crisis of future wars to come.IT HAS THE MOTHER OF ALL INTERROGATION SCENESWhat’s a good war movie without at least one hard-to-watch interrogation scene? Most of these scenes tend to follow a simple formula: someone, usually a soldier, is captured behind enemy lines and tortured for information. But the scene between Moroccan actor Saïd Taghmaoui&nbsp;as an Iraqi army officer and Mark Wahlberg as the captured American soldier gets up close and personal in a way few of these scenes manage to.While the Iraqi does torture Wahlberg’s character with electric shocks, he’s no faceless sadist; our sympathies are engaged when we learn he’s lost his young son and daughter to American bombing raids. But the capper comes when Taghmaoui forces oil down Wahlberg’s throat, a searing indictment on what many felt was the real point of America’s intervention in Kuwait: to protect its oil reserves in the Middle East.IT’S THE FIRST WAR FILM TO SHOW GRAPHICALLY WHAT A BULLET CAN DO TO THE HUMAN BODYRussell was concerned about viewers being anesthetized to gun violence; his answer was to give the audience the uniquely visceral experience of how a bullet traumatizes the human body. In the scene, Clooney lectures his men: “What makes any gunshot wound bad, provided you survive the bullet, is something called sepsis. Say a bullet tears into you right now. It creates a cavity of dead tissue, the cavity fills up with bile and bacteria, and you’re f—ed.” As the soldiers listen, the camera tracks a bullet as it smashes into the body, tearing through flesh and filling the organs with bile.While doing press for the film, Russell grew so irritated with a reporter’s questions that he made up a story about how the bullet scene was done using a real corpse. Needless to say, the studio did not find it funny.IT TRANSFORMED GEORGE CLOONEY’S CAREERIn 1999, Clooney was still playing a doctor on NBC’s hit TV show E.R.&nbsp;After the disappointment of 1997’s&nbsp;Batman &amp; Robin (11% on the Tomatometer), he was desperate for meatier roles in prestige projects.&nbsp; In particular, he wanted the role of Three Kings’ disillusioned Special Forces Major Archie Gate (it didn’t hurt that Warner Bros., who produced Three Kings, also produced E.R.), but his relationship with Russell was volatile from the start. The weather on set in Arizona was hot, and the shoot&nbsp;proved to be chaotic. Clooney would often show up on set only to find that Russell had completely rewritten his scenes. As recounted on Slate.com, the two famously came to blows after Clooney objected to Russell physically manhandling an extra on the set.Nevertheless, the film helped to&nbsp;cement Clooney as a leading man, as he jumped to starring roles in The Perfect Storm and O Brother, Where Art Thou? Late in Three Kings, after Jonze is killed and Wahlberg is wounded by a sniper, he even gets an E.R. moment, placing a flutter valve in Wahlberg’s chest to allow air to escape from a punctured lung.Three Kings&nbsp;opened on October 1, 1999.Like this?

For each item it reviews, Mediaversity provides a grade for representations of race, gender, LGBTQIA+, and other identities where applicable. But Lai’s mission also translates beyond the screen and onto the page.“I’m probably most proud that we’re supporting underrepresented voices – that was always the genesis of Mediaversity in the first place, and that’s never going to go away,” Lai said in an interview with Rotten Tomatoes.In the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, calls for policy change, and greater diversity in editorial spaces and newsrooms, Mediaversity’s mission is all the more resonant. “The goal is just to keep diverting the resources back to people of color and writers of color,” Lai said.Li Lai is the founder and editor-in-chief of Mediaversity Reviews.What is the movie or TV show that you’ve watched more than any other?I guess the only movie I can think of that I’ve really watched over and over and over again is&nbsp;Velvet Goldmine&nbsp;from 1998. … It’s sort of a cult queer movie. It just has so many layers to it that every time I watched it and re-watched it, I would just find something new.What do you think makes a good movie?What makes something interesting to me is freshness. I always like having just a slightly new angle. And there are so many movies out there that are meant to just purely entertain and they’re fun. But if I’m saying what a “good movie” is, then I think it needs to say something new – whether it’s visually or the moment in time, through the story. It could be experimental. I just feel like that’s what every movie or every piece of art really should be trying to do, is just to say something new.Who are some people that everyone should follow on Twitter?I love Candice Frederick because she’s clearly so informed on Black issues… You can tell that she is sharing articles that she’s read and that she thinks have something interesting to say. She’s not glossing over anything.Then one person I really I think is always on the forefront of Asian American issues is Nancy Wang Yuen. She always seems to have the news first, whether it’s a new Asian American movie that’s coming out… she just always has thoughts on it.Valerie Complex really is just such a leader and such a voice. Especially with Black Lives Matter lately, if you want to follow anybody, I feel like she’s a person that is really, really important to know what her viewpoint is and how she’s experiencing everything in the world.Who is an up-and-coming critic that you want people to check out?I just love Robert Daniels (@812filmreviews) so much. He’s written for Mediaversity a few times, so I feel like it’s been exciting for me to see his writing grow over the past year. He’s just getting better and better. And what I love about his work especially is that, one, you can tell how much he loves movies. His enthusiasm is really infectious.(Photo by A24 Films)Is there an actor or director or a screenwriter whose work you always love? Regardless of what they make, you know you’re going to watch it.Barry Jenkins has just consistently done such gorgeous work. Wong Kar-Wai has such a lovely aesthetic… And then when I even think about it one step further, I’m like actually, and then Barry Jenkins was really influenced by Wong Kar-Wai. I’m sensing a theme here.Do you binge watch TV?I definitely do. And ever since coronavirus, I’ve been watching a lot of Asian dramas and things.What have you been watching lately?I just finished Triad Princess on Netflix.Do you do most of your screenings from your couch or in theaters?Definitely not in theaters now. In general, I do things from home anyways, other than film festivals. It’s film festivals or home and lately, of course, it’s just been home.What about a favorite screening snack?I’m pretty boring with this one. Popcorn’s good!(Photo by Miramax)What’s a Rotten thing that you love?The Rotten movie I love echoes the one I watched repeatedly, which is&nbsp;Velvet Goldmine. Because it’s so experimental and unabashedly queer, I think it gets a bad rap from the everyday moviegoer looking for something more conventional.Do you go in cold when you’re reviewing or do you try to learn as much as you can, spoilers be damned?I definitely do more research, especially because a Mediaversity review is different than other ones, which might be coming out earlier and summarize a plot and let people know about a movie. On my end, we dive pretty deep and a lot of our reviews have spoilers. I do a lot of research.How does that influence your perspective on how the story is told? Do you think that it does?Yeah, it definitely affects it. An example might be the movie Waves. If you’re just looking at the trailer, it definitely looks like it’s a “Black movie” – predominantly people of color in the cast. And then if you find out that, oh, the director is white, then there’s more of a story there and it makes you wonder maybe like why this was the chosen subject matter. And then that just usually will lead to some interesting answers.Do you read other reviews before you write your own?Probably three quarters of the time, I’ll read other reviews. It helps me understand what the general conversation is. And then that way, again, because my reviews come out later, I like to add something new to the conversation. I try to make sure I’m not just repeating what everybody has already said.(Photo by The Criterion Collection)Is there an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?Since I feel like I come at the film criticism world from the outside, I’m not sure that I have people who I think are under-the-radar. I will say one director that I’ve been discovering for the first time… Edward Yang, he was a Taiwanese director. He passed away, but he had this movie A Brighter Summer Day. And it just completely blew my mind when I watched it.With this quarantine, but I’ve been revisiting a lot of older movies and this isn’t stuff I would normally do, but I’ve completely gone down the rabbit hole of 1980s and 1990s Taiwanese movies. Because I’m Taiwanese, and it’s just kind of a fun way for me to get to know that culture. Edward Yang is one of the directors that has come out of that movement who has really incredible work. And also I’m finding that I really like Tsai Ming-liang, he’s also another of the Taiwanese new wave directors.What do you consider required viewing?I don’t think anything should be “required viewing.” I’m really not prescriptive. I think anybody should be able to enjoy movies and TV shows the way they want to. And I think it’s really snobby for anyone to say, “You have to see this to understand that.” No, everybody’s experience is different. I would say nothing is required.Do you have advice for critics who are still finding their voice?That’s an easy one. Just write. I’m sure everyone says the same thing. Just write, write, write, write, write, like make a ton of mistakes. Write for different outlets. Just keep throwing everything at the wall and then it eventually shakes itself out.Li Lai is the founder and editor-in-chief of Mediaversity Reviews.

Duong had, after all, conceived the idea of collecting film reviews in one easy-to-find destination after struggling to find the latest notices of Jackie Chan imports like First Strike, Rumble in the Bronx, and Supercop.But soon after pegging RT’s launch date for August 18, 1998 — the week of Rush Hour‘s slated release — the film got rescheduled to September. (And a smart move on New Line’s part it was; Blade opened at number one on August 21, while the calendar move allowed Rush Hour to win its stellar opening weekend opposite the Renee Zellweger-Meryl Streep drama One True Thing.) The site launched as planned anyway; Your Friends &amp; Neighbors became the first movie to appear on Rotten Tomatoes.In honor of RT’s Tenth Anniversary, we took a trip in the way back machine to revisit the first 10 films ever reviewed on Rotten Tomatoes. Come on all you film review nuts; it’s time to party like it’s 1998!more info…Blade Tomatometer: 55%Opening Weekend: $17 millionThe comic book movie explosion of the past decade can be attributed in no small part to Stephen Norrington‘s Blade, which took a lesser-known Marvel comics character — the titular half vampire, half human “daywalker” who hunts killer bloodsuckers (Wesley Snipes) — and turned it into one of the first wildly successful superhero trilogies in recent years. Opening at number one, Blade proved that dark, ultra-violent comic book stories could make great dark, ultra-violent comic book movies, and two sequels followed. Screenwriter David S. Goyer, who penned all three films and a short-lived spin-off television show, would go on to write Batman Begins and Jumper; he’s also signed on for scripting and directing duties, respectively, for forthcoming film adaptations of The Flash and Marvel’s X-Men Origins: Magneto.more info…Dance With Me Tomatometer: 46%Opening Weekend: $4.5 millionWhat do you get when you combine a chart-topping former Miss America with Puerto Rico’s biggest pop star in a romantic dramedy about ballroom dancing helmed by the director of Children of a Lesser God? A modest gamble that doesn’t really pay off, as Columbia execs soon found when Dance With Me opened in 8th place behind hot tickets like Saving Private Ryan and There’s Something About Mary. The Vanessa Williams vehicle barely made its budget back; its male lead, Chayanne, would never make another English-language feature; and Hollywood would subsequently never really get the competitive ballroom dancing genre right.more info…Dead Man on Campus Tomatometer: 15%Opening Weekend: $4.7 millionIt was the perfect comedic set-up based on a popular urban legend: two college kids look for a suicidal roommate so they’ll get automatic sympathy straight A’s. It starred two recognizable young hunks who were both in need of a hit — Tom Everett Scott (That Thing You Do!), who had just flopped with his remake of An American Werewolf in Paris, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who’d most recently followed his career-defining turn as Zack Morris on Saved By The Bell with a string of tepid movies-of-the-week. Unfortunately for both of them, Dead Man on Campus wasn’t the breakout success they probably hoped it would be, spending only three weeks in theaters with an ultimate total gross of $15 million.more info…Wrongfully Accused Tomatometer: 23%Opening Weekend: $3.5 millionAfter the flagging box office performances of his mid-90s spoof films (Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult, Spy Hard) it should have become apparent to Leslie Nielson that the genre was getting tired. Yet plug away he did, resulting in the tired jokes and meager earnings of Wrongfully Accused, a riff on the mistaken identity crime thriller The Fugitive (and every additional Harrison Ford guffaw they could devise). The flick opened in 12th place in the summer of 1998 and topped out at just under $10 million in ticket sales. Luckily for Nielson, Scary Movie 3 was only a few years away…more info…54 Tomatometer: 13%Opening Weekend: $6.6 millionSex! Drugs! Disco! All were never as yawningly depicted as they were in 54, a crosshatched movie of good-looking people consumed by bellbottom decadence. Writer/director Mark Christopher assembled an impressive cast — Salma Hayek, Neve Campbell, and Ryan Phillippe when they were still rising stars — and allowed room for Mike Myers to give a rare serious performance. Critics responded well to Myers’ role as the coke-addled Studio 54 owner, but call out Christopher for failing to honor his performers through lugubrious pacing and a lack of interest in completing everyone’s stories. 54 flopped, ending the late-90s’ sudden obsession with the disco era (e.g.Boogie Nights, The Last Days of Disco).more info…Why Do Fools Fall in Love? Tomatometer: 54%Opening Weekend: $3.9 millionDirector Gregory Nava had already struck success in the biographical movie genre with Selena the year before, making a star out of Jennifer Lopez, who had previously appeared in Nava’s Mi Familia. This time he shone the light on 1950s teen idol Frankie Lymon (played by baby faced actor Larenz Tate), the titular song’s teenybopper crooner who died of a heroin overdose at age 25, leaving behind three widows to battle over his estate (Vivica A. Fox, Halle Berry, and Lela Rochon). The film made a modest profit at the box office, but Nava would subsequently return to dramatizing the Latin American experience in projects like 2002’s Frida, the PBS series American Family, and the internationally released Bordertown.more info…Knock Off Tomatometer: 6%Opening Weekend: $5.5 millionJean-Claude Van Damme had been at the top of his game only a few years earlier, when films like Universal Soldier and Timecop had him sitting pretty as one of Hollywood’s leading action stars. But by the time he collaborated with Hong Kong director Tsui Hark on two films — 1997’s Double Team, opposite a neon-coiffed Dennis Rodman, and the subsequent bomb Knock Off, opposite Rob Schneider — Van Damme’s star was beginning to fade. Featuring the worst action premise in movie history, Knock Off starred Van Damme as a fashion designer and Schneider as a CIA agent battling mobsters who’ve hidden explosives in fake-label jeans; within a few years, Van Damme’s career would exist only in the direct-to-video market.more info…Rounders Tomatometer: 64%Opening Weekend: $8.4 millionDespite a lukewarm opening weekend and marginally fresh reviews, Rounders became a cult hit thanks to the simultaneous explosion in popularity of the game it helped popularize: Texas Hold ‘Em. The game of poker, previously relegated to smoky barrooms and boys nights out, subsequently became the card sport du jour across America; suddenly everyone knew how to splash the pot, turn the river, and what it means if you can’t spot the sucker in the room. Matt Damon starred, fresh off his Oscar win for Good Will Hunting; Edward Norton stole scenes as Damon’s gambling addict buddy. (One month later, Norton would get his own revelatory star turn in American History X, earning him a second Oscar nomination.)more info…One True Thing Tomatometer: 93%Opening Weekend: $6.6 millionMeryl Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a cancer victim in this familial drama, which also stars a post-Jerry Maguire, pre-Bridget Jones Renee Zellweger as the daughter who comes home to care for Streep in her final days only to learn she didn’t know as much about her parents as she thought. Director Carl Franklin, who previously had and subsequently would specialize in crime thrillers (Devil in a Blue Dress, Out of Time), earned critics’ approval for his career departure into sentimental drama.more info…Rush Hour Tomatometer: 63%Opening Weekend: $33 millionAs the tagline read, “The Fastest Hands in the East Meet the Biggest Mouth in the West.” The legendary pairing of martial arts star Jackie Chan and Friday motor mouth Chris Tucker was inspired casting, rejuvenating the classic buddy-cop formula of films like Lethal Weapon while serving as Chan’s pivotal Hollywood breakthrough. After an incredible opening weekend, Rush Hour would go on to net $244 million worldwide; the three-film series eventually grossed over $800 million worldwide. Former music video director Brett Ratner, whose feature debut had been just one year earlier in Money Talks (with Tucker starring), became a household name and eventually directed high profile projects like Red Dragon and X-Men: The Last Stand. Tucker, strangely, would only appear in two feature film roles after 1998’s Rush Hour — both of which were its next two sequels.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"independent, 2020, drama, Awards, camera, Comic, Summer, FirstLook, children's, See","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-flashback-the-first-ten-movies-ever-reviewed"},{"id":"47613920846628","title":"Eli Roth is a Hostel Kind of Guy","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Eli Roth is a Hostel Kind of Guyby Scott Weinberg | April 20, 2006 |  CommentsLike just about every movie site in the known universe, Now Playing recently sat down with horror dude Eli Roth, and the topics discussed include \"Hostel 2,\" Roth’s impending adaptation of Stephen King‘s \"Cell,\" and the young filmmaker’s disappointment at having to bypass his intended remake of \"The Bad Seed.\"A few tidbits from Mr. Roth: “If you’re going to watch the sequel, you know what it is but you kind of want to see more and I want to learn more about this organization and how it works.

Pixar’s second movie came out in theaters way back in November of 1998, when it premiered on November 14 before opening in limited release on the 20th and expanding everywhere on November 25. Though a success at the time, A Bug’s Life is one of the more forgotten Pixar movies these days. Sure, it doesn’t get flack the way the much-maligned Cars franchise does, but&nbsp;it&nbsp;rarely places highly on any of those “Every Pixar Movie, Ranked” lists that&nbsp;populate&nbsp;the web. Pixar itself appears to have forgotten A Bug’s Life as well, in a way: It’s the only one of the studio’s first six films that hasn’t gotten a sequel (the seventh, if you count Toy Story 2). Not everything needs a sequel, but it’s perhaps telling that the studio hasn’t returned to the story of Flik and his friends.That’s a shame in a lot of ways. Though A Bug’s Life doesn’t reach the soaring visual and emotional heights of later films like Wall-E, Inside Out, and Coco, it’s still a remarkable success — just on smaller terms, as is fitting for a movie about bugs.The&nbsp;Antz Rivalry(Photo by Walt Disney Studios, DreamWorks)To fully appreciate A Bug’s Life, one must travel back to 1998, when moviegoers who wanted to see a computer-animated movie about an ant who was an individualist with big, unappreciated ideas had two choices as the box office. There was A Bug’s Life, and there was DreamWorks’ Antz, a bizarre parable about Marxism starring Woody Allen. That the movies were so similar was not a coincidence, at least not according to Pixar’s brass at the time, who claimed that DreamWorks’ Jeffrey Katzenberg, a former Disney chairman, stole the idea and rushed the movie to theaters before A Bug’s Life. Both were pretty well-received — Certified Fresh at 94%,&nbsp;Antz actually ranks a little higher on the Tomatometer than A Bug’s Life’s also Certified Fresh 92%, even if the audience score for the latter easily tops&nbsp;the former’s —&nbsp;and we can look back at the two movies now with bemusement. Still, consider how wild and telling it is that A Bug’s Life was a big enough deal from the start that it prompted some alleged corporate espionage. That’s the sign of an important movie, if there ever was one.The Cast Is Full of Unexpected Greats(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)A Bug’s Life has a secretly stacked cast, full of actors who were definitely not cast because they were “popular with the youths,” but because they were talented. Phyllis Diller, whose iconic cackle was probably familiar to anybody who grew up with the pioneering female comedian in the ‘60s, makes a real character out of the Queen. Mel Brooks mainstay Madeline Kahn, who would die too soon a little more than a year after the film’s premiere, plays Gypsy, while Roddy McDowall, a character actor perhaps best known for his role as Caesar in Planet of the Apes, played a thespian ant. These are all great actors, but perhaps not the most obvious choices for an up-and-coming animation studio in the ‘90s. That they were cast in the movie is another early hint of Pixar’s willingness to do the unexpected.Other members of the cast were perhaps a little less out of left field, but actors like Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Princess Atta), Denis Leary (Francis), David Hyde Piece (Slim), and Brad Garrett (Dim), and Richard Kind (Molt) are all inspired casting choices, not to mention Dave Foley in the lead as Flik. It’s nearly impossible to talk about Kevin Spacey with any sort of reverence these days, and for good reason, but as Hopper, he voices one of the more chilling villains that Disney — let alone Pixar — has ever dreamed up.Its Plot was Epic, Yet Focused(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)A Bug’s Life is, essentially, a kid-friendly rendition of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. The grasshoppers, led by Hopper, have been oppressing the ants for too long, and when their greed and cruelty reaches new levels, the ants must fight back. Sure, the fight is less of a Lord of the Rings-style clash between giant armies and more of a Trojan Horse gambit in the form of a wooden bird, but A Bug’s Life has a pretty epic plot nonetheless. And yet, the storytelling economy is on point. In a filmmaker’s roundtable video that Disney/Pixar produced, the directors and producers recall how the script went through multiple iterations as they figured out what had to work in order to make the story flow.The first big breakthrough came when they recast the lazy grasshopper from the Aesop’s Fable as a greedy tyrant. From there, it was all about making sure that every character had a personal stake in the fighting. Early drafts had a main character who was not from the colony, or circus performers who were initially scammers before deciding to switch sides, but those ideas wouldn’t have worked. By directly tying the conflict to each character in an emotionally resonant way, A Bug’s Life managed to have a large-scale war story with a highly focused scope.It Was a “Traditional” Disney Story in a Way No Other Pixar Movie Is(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)These days, Pixar is celebrated for its truly innovative premises. What if the emotions in your head were personified, here to teach you a lesson about how sadness is good? What if humanity ruined the Earth and left a cute, largely silent robot behind to clean up? What if art deco superheroes fought against the struggles of marriage, and also maybe loved Ayn Rand? A Bug’s Life is not like that. In fact, it’s probably the most traditional Pixar movie when compared to Disney’s classic animated canon. The film, like so many of the classic Disney movies, was based on an old tale from the public domain — in this instance, the Aesop’s Fable about the ant and the grasshopper.Anybody who has watched The Little Mermaid and then gone and read the original Grimm’s Fairy Tale knows that Disney frequently makes major (and typically good) changes when adapting an old story. A Bug’s Life was no different, taking this fable of a lazy grasshopper and hardworking ant and spinning it into a new tale about individualism, make-believe actors becoming real-life heroes, and triumph over extortion. It was Pixar’s only real take on what had been Disney’s M.O. for decades, and while the studio’s creative ambitions would only grow greater, A Bug’s Life is worth remembering for being a singular Pixar reinterpretation.It Proved That Pixar Wasn’t a FlukeIf the worst thing A Bug’s Life has going for it is that it isn’t one of the greatest animated movies ever made from arguably the greatest animation studio of all time, then that’s a pretty good sophomore slump. After the success of Toy Story, Pixar, which had since become a public company, needed to deliver a success to keep the momentum going.“We felt the future of the studio was resting on it,” A Bug’s Life producer Darla K. Anderson recalled in that filmmaker’s roundtable. Had Pixar’s second movie been a total bust, Pixar might’ve been written-off as a one-hit wonder. Instead, A Bug’s Life was a critical and financial success — maybe not as good as Toy Story, but a sure sign that there were plenty more good things to come.Twenty&nbsp;years later, now that computer graphics have progressed so much, it’s easy to overlook the visual and technical leaps that A Bug’s Life Made. Compared to Toy Story, A Bug’s Life is much more complex. Animators needed to create entirely organic-looking worlds on a much bigger scale than Toy Story’s mostly bedroom settings. There were significantly more characters in A Bug’s Life than in the earlier film — heck, the ant colony alone dwarfs Toy Story’’s entire cast. Pixar also had to use or develop new animation techniques to handle light flickering through semi-transparent grass and the flickering flames of the finale. In other words,&nbsp;A Bug’s Life was no small feat, and that warrants a bit of celebration.A Bug’s Life was released on November 25, 1998.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"kong, twilight, Awards, winner, Women's, dragons, movies, game, CNN, History, cancelled, action","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"why-a-bugs-life-is-an-underrated-pixar-classic"},{"id":"47613904940827","title":"Wicker & Chainsaw Posters!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Wicker &amp; Chainsaw Posters!by Scott Weinberg | June 14, 2006 |  CommentsOne’s a remake of a classic; the other is a prequel to a remake of a classic.

TitanicWe're asking the big questions about the onetime biggest movie of all time: Is James Cameron's boat flick one of the all-time great epics, or just a really cool-looking disaster movie with a chilly (and badly written) heart?by RT Staff | February 18, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Merie W. Wallace / TM and Copyright © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.)At the Oscars in March 1998, James Cameron declared himself the King of the World – and while many people cringed, it was hard to argue with the superstar director. After all, his sweeping-romance-slash-terrifying-disaster-epic Titanic had just taken home 11 Oscars, tying Ben-Hur’s haul, and was sailing hard past box office records. The man who’d also given us The Terminator and Aliens deserved his crown.While his film/pop-culture phenomenon hasn’t exactly bumped into any icebergs in the decades since its release –&nbsp;it remains beloved by many, if not the annual VHS-tape–tearing re-watch it once was – the waters are slightly rougher for Titanic than when it first landed in theaters. With the “wow” factor of its technical achievements dampened with time, modern audiences are largely left with the story of star-crossed lovers Jack and Rose (and total psycho Cal) and for many –&nbsp;including a number who swooned at age 15, but roll their eyes all these decades later – it’s a clichéd stinker.(And yes, Rose definitely could have moved over a little and let him onto that damn door.)In the latest episode of Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong, we’re stepping aboard the Certified Fresh onetime biggest film of all time and asking: Did Titanic deserve all those awards and its place –&nbsp;in some people’s ongoing hearts, at least –&nbsp;as one of the greatest films ever made? Joining host Mark Ellis and Jacqueline Coley is Dorina Arellano, one third of YouTube’s Whirl Girls and co-host of Impolite Truths with John Rocha. While Arellano may have had her first kiss during a Titanic screening, that does not mean she was feeling that Jack-Rose heat.Listen Now:&nbsp;&nbsp;Spotify&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple Podcasts&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;Stitcher&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;TuneIn&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Podcasts&nbsp;|&nbsp;Radio Public&nbsp;|&nbsp;Deezer&nbsp;|&nbsp;iHeart&nbsp;|&nbsp;Art19Check&nbsp;in&nbsp;every Thursday for a new episode of&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong (A Podcast From Rotten&nbsp;Tomatoes).&nbsp;Each week, hosts Jacqueline and Mark&nbsp;and guests go deep and settle the score on some of the most beloved –&nbsp;and despised –&nbsp;movies and TV shows ever made, directly taking on the statement we hear from so many fans: “Rotten Tomatoes is wrong.”Episode one:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Spider-Man 3Episode two:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Mortal KombatEpisode three:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullEpisode four:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Sister Act 2: Back In the HabitEpisode five:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;The BeachEpisode six:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Hocus PocusEpisode seven:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Vampire In BrooklynEpisode eight:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;VenomEpisode nine:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About&nbsp;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&nbsp;/&nbsp;When&nbsp;Nature CallsEpisode 10:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… the&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;moviesEpisode 11:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Batman v SupermanEpisode 12:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of SkywalkerEpisode 13:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Home Alone 2Episode 14:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;Love, ActuallyEpisode 15:&nbsp;“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;How the Grinch Stole ChristmasEpisode 16: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;The Greatest ShowmanEpisode 17: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About…&nbsp;National TreasureEpisode 18: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Age of UltronEpisode 19: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… AvatarEpisode 20: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Wonder Woman 1984Episode 21: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… BladeEpisode 22: “Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… The NotebookIf you have a suggestion for a movie or show you think we should do an episode on, let us know in the comments, or email us at&nbsp;rtiswrong@rottentomatoes.com.Meet the hostsJacqueline Coley&nbsp;is an editor at Rotten Tomatoes, with a focus on awards and indie coverage but with a passion for&nbsp;everything, from the MCU to musicals and period pieces.

That film is being directed by Crowe’s Gladiator director Ridley Scott and is being produced by Brian Grazer, who also produced Gangster and Crowe’s Cinderella Man. Because of the Gangster shooting schedule, while Crowe is committed to starring in the Luhrmann project, he could be unavailable to start another film in September. “When Baz is ready, I’m there,” Crowe told the Sydney Morning Herald.Gangster itself is getting a second incarnation. It originally was to have been directed by Antoine Fuqua with Washington starring as a Harlem heroin druglord and Benicio Del Toro as a New York City detective.Kidman, meanwhile, began work this week on Noah Baumbach‘s untitled film for Paramount’s specialty division and producer Scott Rudin.

We dive deeper into one of the best movies on that list, The Birdcage, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary.As the kind of sissy boy whom my schoolmates scolded for my lack of soccer skills and my predilection for choir practice (I was a soprano, naturally), I spent much of my childhood wrestling with my own seemingly insufficient masculinity. Despite how obviously I failed at performing manliness, I was wracked with anxiety about how I knew I should act. This is not as uncommon an experience as I felt it was. Whether you grew up in Colombia, as I did, or in the South of France or in Miami, the pressures of acting like a man were as soul-crushing as they were laughable. This is what one of my favorite movies growing up taught me, though not until I revisited it decades later.The Birdcage is, above all, a farce about masculinity. About its frailty and its attendant anxieties. Based on Édouard Molinaro’s La Cage aux Folles, Mike Nichols’s broad comedy stars Robin Williams (in khakis and a Selleck-ish mustache) and Nathan Lane (in linen pants and the occasional wig) as Armand and Albert Goldman. The couple run the The Birdcage, a drag club in South Beach where Albert (as “Starina”) is its greatest star. When Armand’s son Val (Dan Futterman) informs him that he’s going to&nbsp; marry his girlfriend Barbara (Calista Flockhart) he caveats the good news with a request: might he go along with the white lie Barbara told her ultra-conservative parents, Senator Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman) and his wife Louise (Dianne Wiest), that Armand is a straight cultural attaché?(Photo by MGM Home Entertainment / Everett Collection)The comedy stems from the failed attempts at keeping the charade of a heterosexual (and heteronormative) Goldman family. If Albert cannot present himself to the Keeleys as Armand’s partner, by god he’ll do it as Val’s definitely-not-gay uncle, a scenario that gives Lane every delicious comic beat he could ever hope to play. In one of the scenes that I could probably still perform from memory, Albert tries to butch himself up. He practices spreading some mustard on some toast only to be scolded by his frustrated lover: “Don’t use the spoon! And don’t dribble little dots of mustard: men smear! Smear!”The film was a staple of my teenage years. Whenever it was on cable we’d watch it as a family. We’d laugh in unison as we saw Lane’s flailing attempts to walk straight, only to end up deciding to pass himself off as Val’s mother in surprisingly convincing Old Lady drag. My laughter was, during those family viewings, comforting and discomfiting in equal measure. I laughed at Lane’s femininity in a way that I hoped inoculated my own. What a laughable stereotype, I thought. Thank god I’m not that gay, I reassured myself, still in the closet. I may be called a ‘marica’ in school, but surely I pass more easily than this out-of-drag drag queen. I loved the film precisely because it gave me room for such distance.(Photo by MGM Home Entertainment / Getty Collection)By the time I got to college, that kind of thinking led me to a revisionist understanding of the film that felt all the more insidious: it’s films like these – big broad comedies trafficking in caricature – that fuel the homophobia around me. Couldn’t we do better? Couldn’t we be more than punchlines? Did we have to be effeminate gay men with high-pitched voices who couldn’t hold their pinkies in check when “smearing” our toast?It’s only slowly dawned on me how much I came to project onto The Birdcage which, Hank Azaria’s lisping “Guatemalanness” aside, is a wholly assured satire about homophobia and masculinity. Nichols walks a fine line between finding Val’s request and the subsequent comedy of errors it precipitates as preposterous and hilarious, insulting and entertaining. And while Albert may look like a fey stooge, it is his sensibility which runs through the film; it’s his drag which saves the day and reveals the Keeleys’ (and Val’s) hang-ups as utterly laughable. In its campy theatrics, The Birdcage encourages us all to be more like Albert, to see in his gay femininity a kind of strength we all too often mock and disparage. Sometimes even within ourselves.Manuel Betancourt is a culture writer and film critic interested in all things queer and Latinx. www.mbetancourt.comLike this?

Tommy Boy is Still Hilarious 25 Years LaterWe look back at the late, great Chris Farley's first — and best — starring role and why it still makes us laugh to this day.by Tim Lowery | March 31, 2020 |  CommentsNear the end of Adam Sandler’s 100% Fresh — we see what you did there — he plays a musical tribute to Chris Farley. The Springsteen-esque song features gentle guitar strums and heartfelt thoughts on Sandler’s former SNL castmate, and as&nbsp;he sings, classic clips from the late, great comedian play in the background. It’s emotional, especially because it&nbsp;comes from a guy whose comedy is often synonymous with silly, sophomoric humor, and after it’s over, Sandler tells the audience, “He was by far the funniest f—ing guy of all time.” Farley was that funny&nbsp;— anyone who’s seen him as the hyper stress-fest that is motivational speaker Matt Foley or as the bumbling host of “The Chris Farley Show” would have a hard time dismissing that outright. He could be insanely loud and in-your-face one moment, a sort of one-man comedy tornado, and weirdly sweet and empathetic the next. He lit up whatever he was in.But could what made Farley such a tour de force on SNL translate onto the big screen, especially in a starring role and especially amid all those big-budget movie trappings: sweeping crane shots, a ceaseless score, and by-the-numbers plotting? That was the question Tommy Boy — released 25 years ago on March 31, 1995 — would answer. The first in Farley’s Movie Star canon is a road comedy, chronicling spoiled man-child Tommy (Farley) and his uptight dry-wit of a minder, Richard (David Spade), as they try to save Tommy’s family business. At the time, critical reception was lukewarm-to-cold (it&nbsp;sits at&nbsp;42% on the Tomatometer), with Variety scoffing that “stupid is apparently in” and The Independent branding it “a comedy that might be a hoot after several beers but is otherwise best avoided.” Yet the same qualities those reviews slung as insults were exactly what moviegoers of a certain age&nbsp;were looking for in a film: decidedly dumb, preferably watched late at night with friends, and packed with lots of quotable lines. Here’s why&nbsp;Tommy Boy&nbsp;still holds up after all these years.IT&nbsp;PROVED CHRIS FARLEY COULD&nbsp;CARRY HIS OWN MOVIEAs implied above, Farley may have owned his skits more than anyone else to grace the stage at SNL. He also proved — both before and after Tommy Boy&nbsp;— incredible in small parts on the big screen, most notably as the sad-sack bus driver in Billy Madison and the barfly with a bitten-off nose in Dirty Work. In the lead of a feature, though, you could understand the skepticism: Would the joke run thin? Would this character make any sense for an entire 90 minutes? Somehow, all of his larger-than-lifeness works in Tommy Boy. It’s his best starring role (Black Sheep, Beverly Hills Ninja, and Almost Heroes aren’t exactly stiff competition, but still), one that leaves you watching to see what Tommy will stumble into next as opposed to waiting out a series of high-energy pratfalls.FARLEY AND DAVID SPADE HAVE UNDENIABLE COMIC CHEMISTRY(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Another reason Farley works so well as a lead here? Spade, the cynical ying to Farley’s trusting, airheaded yang. The pair fits nicely in a long line of comedy duos, both classic (Laurel and Hardy stand out, not only because of the disparity in body sizes) and more modern (Jake and Elwood in The Blues Brothers, John Candy and Steve Martin in Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles). Tommy Boy lifts from that latter movie’s playbook, actually: There’s the never-ending road trip with polar opposites and the destruction of their car (complete with a double take when it’s demolished). There seemed to be more than a bit of life-imitating-art going on as well. (Or was it viceversa?) As one of the film’s writers put it in a making-of doc, the two were a sort of IRL Odd Couple, with Spade often throwing sarcastic jabs at Farley, promoting immediate bursts of laughter, when the cameras weren’t rolling.IT’S ENDLESSLY QUOTABLEMany of the moments that land in Tommy Boy come from that same off-the-cuff, we’d-be-joking-with-each-other-regardless spirit. Take this exchange, a version of which was allegedly overheard between Spade and Farley and then added to the script:“Hey, does this suit make me look fat?”“No, no, no. Your face does.”Perhaps the movie’s most memorable scene, too, came from someone on set noticing that, after shooting the “fat guy in a little coat” bit, Farley started singing the dialogue. They thought it was so funny they decided to reshoot it, and it’s hard to imagine it working nearly as well without Farley’s sing-songy delivery. There are too many good quotes from Farley to list here — besides, many of them have been recited ad nauseum in college dorm rooms over the last two-plus decades — but let’s spotlight these doozies: “Brothers don’t shake hands. Brothers gotta hug,” and “John Hancock… It’s Herbie Hancock.”DAN AYKROYD CRANKS&nbsp;IT UP TO 11(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures)A few of the minor characters fall flat in this movie&nbsp;— as Tommy’s new stepmom,&nbsp;Bo Derek&nbsp;was even nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress&nbsp;— but one in particular is memorable above all the others. As auto magnate Ray Zalinsky,&nbsp;Dan Aykroyd leans on his&nbsp;stereotype-on-steroids Chicago accent as he says lines like,““I make car parts for the American working man, because that’s what I am, and that’s who I care about.” Ostensibly one of the villains of the film, Zalinsky&nbsp;is part Bass-O-Matic motor-mouthed salesman, with every spat-out pronouncement delivered with such a punch that it makes his turn as Elwood in The Blues Brothers look subtle in comparison. It’s ridiculous — and a joy to watch.FARLEY’S SWEETNESS IS ON DISPLAY(Photo by ©Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)If Tommy was just an imbecile running into things — and, to be fair, that might be his defining characteristic — it wouldn’t give one much reason to watch this movie, let alone return to it. But there’s a lot of love in Farley’s take on a spoiled know-nothing. He wants everybody to like each other and get along, and even the few moments that touch on loss oddly ring true in Farley’s hands. It’s the same trick he pulled off so brilliantly on SNL’s “The Chris Farley Show,” the ability to end a flubbed interview with Paul McCartney with an “aww”-inducing moment of connection. We may never know what other moments like that he had in him, but at least we have films like&nbsp;Tommy Boy to remind us what he was capable of.Where You Can Watch It NowAmazon (rent/own),&nbsp;FandangoNOW (rent/own),&nbsp;Google&nbsp;(rent/own),&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;(rent/own),&nbsp;Vudu&nbsp;(rent/own)Tommy Boy&nbsp;was released on&nbsp;March 31, 1995.#1Tommy Boy (1995) 42%#1Adjusted Score: 44.254% Critics Consensus: Though it benefits from the comic charms of its two leads, Tommy Boy too often feels like a familiar sketch stretched thin.Synopsis: Saturday Night Live star Chris Farley had his first starring role in this frankly lowbrow comedy, which teamed him with...

They had a choice: interview supermodel-turned-actress Devon Aoki, or catch the Canadian premiere of \"BloodRayne\" with Uwe Boll himself. With time winding down, the only way to cover both things was to split up. Read on to hear how Phu’s one-on-one with Devon went, while Senh went for coffee with the notorious B.O.L.L.In Phu’s own words: \"Before sitting down with the lovely Devon to begin the interview we looked at each other as if we had seen each other before. Then out of nowhere she claimed I was ‘the buff guy from the gym.’ I did not really know what to say — I was quite flattered, honestly. I was thinking, ‘You’re the cute girl from the gym!’ but didn’t have the guts to say it.It turns out Devon stayed at the same hotel as Senh and I. One night we had dinner and were unknowingly seated across from her and her mom. Devon and I both agreed that the meals from the hotel were not only delightful in taste but awesome in presentation as well compared to other nearby fancy hotels. The second night her mom and her came into the gym to do some cardio on the treadmill machines as Senh and I were pumping some iron — hence the ‘buff guy’ epiphany.So a word of advice to all you RT readers: be aware of your surroundings, for you never know who you’ll run into.\"————Rotten Tomatoes: Your character in \"Rogue\" is Japanese. How long did it take you to learn? Did you speak it before?Devon Aoki: No. I’m really kind of a California girl. I know I look like I’m straight off the boat from Japan, or China or any of those Asian countries. People always ask, ‘What are you, Asian?’ It was very cool to learn Japanese.There are all these different nuances; if you say a sentence in Japanese, if you say it wrong with the wrong process, Japanese people aren’t going to know what you’re saying. They complain to me about other movies where someone has played a Japanese character and the dialogue is very difficult to understand, so I thought that I had to do it well enough so that it’s clear.Devon as French exchange-secret agent-student Dominique in 2004’s \"D.E.B.S.\"RT: Can you tell us about your role without giving away the plot?DA: I can tell you a little about my role, but I don’t know if I can tell you about the synopsis of the movie. That’s a loaded question; anything I say will give away the movie, because there are a lot of crazy twists and turns in this one!My character is the Yakuza boss’s daughter. In the movie they refer to her as being a ‘bitch’, so I have to say she is one. She’s not a nice girl, she never has been. Her dad has raised her to be more of like a Yakuza whore than just a nice little girl. She’s following close to her dad’s footsteps. She wants to fit into his shoes. She wants to be the new leader. She’s basically second in command, but she’s working her way up to being the head of the Yakuza, regardless of the fact that she’s a woman. No one’s going to stand in the way of her doing that, not her uncle, not any of the other Yakuza guys. In this film I boss them around quite a bit.It was fun, I have to admit. [My character] is her dad’s second in command, and she’s the person who’s making sure the cargo comes in. Basically the whole cargo and shipping subdivision (which is why we’re here at this location) is based on the fact that her father wants very, very precious sculptures, and he will stop at nothing to get them, even if that means killing I don’t know how many people. That’s what he wants. That’s what he thinks he needs for his dynasty. And so this whole movie he’s trying to get his hands on these precious Chinese horses, and she’s making sure that it happens.My father is played by a really amazing actor, Ryo Ishibashi. He’s a Japanese actor. Working with him was really a pleasure; he helped me to learn my Japanese lines.Devon, in what will probably be known as the best ever sequel to \"The Fast and the Furious\"RT: In today’s scene you’re threatening Jet Li. What has been your favorite scene so far to shoot?DA: It was really fun for me to shoot the Japanese stuff, so I would have to say the scenes where I speak Japanese because it was something different. I don’t want to disappoint the people in Japan and Asia. I don’t want them to request subtitles because they can’t understand me. I want them to understand me. So I think the scenes where I spoke a lot of Japanese were my favorite.RT: You are going to be in \"DOA: Dead Or Alive,\" playing Kasumi, who is a badass ninja…DA: Yes, she’s pretty badass. She’s a little different than this girl; she’s a lot nicer than Kira [in \"Rogue\"]. Kira is a naughty girl, and very troubled. I think all her life she’s had to follow her father’s footsteps. He doesn’t care if you live or die, and she has had to mimic his irreverence for life. She becomes a very stone-cold woman, on her path of power…\"DOA\" is going to be very cool.RT: Can you tell us about the plot of \"DOA?\"DA: Yes. My character is Kasumi, and she’s a princess. She’s never been outside the palace walls. She’s been very, very sheltered, because she’s a princess and that’s the way it is…until the point where she actually decides to leave, she’s basically been pretty sheltered but she’s a capable fighter.She finds out that her brother went to a DOA tournament, and he didn’t come home. She wants to know if he’s dead and why, and how can she make things better for herself and her family, because her brother was to be king. So she leaves the palace walls much to the dismay of everyone around her, including her loyal servant who is played by Kane [Kosugi]. Then she has this crazy half-sister who wants to kill her. She becomes a Shinobi, who is someone who has left the clan, and has basically wronged them.This crazy half-sister is on this revenge quest to kill her, so she has the half-sister following her around. Her servant boy, who she has a crush on, and is a very skilled ninja, he’s following her to make sure she’s OK. So basically she goes to the DOA tournament a year later, where she’s snooping around to find out about her brother.While she’s there, she has to fight people from all over the world. She is exposed to all these American things she’s never been exposed to before. She’s like a delicate little flower princess – well, not so delicate. It’s just an eye-opening experience for her.In \"DOA: Dead or Alive,\" Devon will wield a sword alongside Holly Valance, Sara Carter, Jaime Pressly, and Natassia MaltheRT: Corey Yuen is the action choreographer in \"DOA,\" yet you don’t seem to be doing action scenes in this movie.DA: No, not so much. That’s what’s kind of cool about it, is that my character is not a ninja. She’s so capable that she can fight anybody, but her job is not to protect anyone, it’s not to serve anybody, it’s not to fight anybody. Her role is to further the clan. So that’s what was a little bit different in this one. I didn’t have to do any stunts, which is good and bad, because I don’t go home with bruises, but at the same time I didn’t get to spend as much time with Corey as I would have liked. But all in all it was a lot of fun for me.RT: Do you feel any pressure from being one of the highest profile Asian-American actresses?DA: Yeah, I have to admit I do. I don’t see a lot of Asian faces who get to be on screen or get to be in print as a fashion model, or who get to be in the media. I grew up always knowing that I was Asian and always knowing that I was closely tied to all Asian people be they from Japan or China.My mom is German-English. I grew up with my mom, but I can’t escape the way I look and my whole life I’ve had a strong sense of self because of it. I’ve watched my father (Benihana restaurateur Rocky Aoki) and all of the achievements he’s made; I’ve always wanted to follow in his footsteps in some ways in changing the dynamic of how Asians are interpreted.I think it’s really important as an Asian to work hard, to be dedicated, and to ultimately prove that I deserve to be here. As a young girl I always looked up to Asian celebs — if there was an Asian person on the screen, I was watching that Asian person. There weren’t a lot of people who were even allowed to represent for our culture, being from the East. So every movie I do, that’s a thought in my head that I have to represent for Asian people. That’s really important to me.Also on Aoki’s slate, the return of silent-but-deadly assassin Miho in \"Sin City 2\"RT: What was the first film that you noticed an Asian actor in?DA: \"Seven Samurai.\" I’m pretty old-school, I’ve been watching Asian films for a long time. One of my all-time favorites is \"Sayonara;\" Marlon Brando was in it. I’ve watched that film three or four times because I could relate to seeing an Asian face on the screen that was beautiful and elegant and who was the star (Miiko Taka), and I liked that.Of course modern movies, I’m a sucker for kung fu movies. I love Jet Li, I love Jackie Chan. I love all the new films coming out of China: \"Hero,\" \"Crouching Tiger,\" and the stuff Corey has been working on. His life’s work has been some of the best films to come out of Asia. He basically discovered Jet Li. I live for that stuff. I live to see young Asian girls doing it, older Asian women doing it, it’s really important to me.I guess I could say one of my favorite movies was \"Sayonara.\" I love Marlon Brando too.RT: Who doesn’t?Stay tuned for more on-set interviews with \"Rogue\" choreographer (and \"DOA: Dead or Alive\" director) Corey Yuen and action star Jet Li!

He plays a video store clerk who accidentally erases all the tapes, and has to replace all the videos by filming them himself.\"We did a lot of movies,\" said Black. \"We did ‘When We Were Kings,’ the documentary about Muhammad Ali. I play Muhammad Ali, strangely. We did ‘Superman.’ Actually, I shouldn’t say that, we had to change the name to something else. Incredible Flying Man I think we changed it to. We did ‘Ghostbusters.’ That was a masterpiece. We did ‘Robocop,’ we did ‘Driving Miss Daisy,’ just to name a few. There were tons of movies that we did.\"Director Michel Gondry brought his \"Eternal Sunshine\"/\"Science of Sleep\" sensibility to the film, ordering Black not to research the films within the film. \"We were under strict orders not to watch any of the movies again, not to re-watch anything again and if we hadn’t seen it, don’t see it. Just do what you think it is based on the commercials you had seen of the movie because he wanted it to look that way; because there isn’t any time in the movie for us to do any research. So he wanted to keep that consistent as actors not to research any of the movies we were remaking.\"They even remake one of Black’s own movies. \"We did a little ‘King Kong,’ too. It was cool. And it was pretty low-budg, the movie but he makes up for it with incredible tricks and stuff, and depth perception, and camera tricks. Like, let’s say I’m King Kong, and that over there is Roz, but you’re the camera, and if I do that and hold her like that, it looks like I’m a giant. It’s hard to explain.

Here’s what they had to say: \"There will be a sequel to Crank yes. Prepare to Crank again. And you know the \"is it a sequel or prequel\" question… IT’S A SEQUEL. We’re not selling out and going prequel. We are picking up where the last movie left off.\"And if that’s not curious enough, it looks like Mel Gibson wants to get back in front of the cameras and make a sequel. Nope, not to \"Mad Max\" or \"Lethal Weapon.\" He says those series have more than run their course by now. Nope, his new plan is to partner up with James Garner again and give the world a \"Maverick 2.\"From Mr. Gibson: \"There’s talk of doing another Maverick. Garner and I have been looking at that for a while.

Home Alone 2: Lost In New YorkWas moving the action to Manhattan and upping the \"ow\"-factor enough to justify a second Home Alone movie? We're tossing bricks and taking names in the latest ep of our podcast.by RT Staff | December 10, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved.)You know the lines. (“Kevin!”) You know the scenes. (Bricks!). You know the characters. (Pigeon Lady!). But did you know&nbsp;Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, a modern-day Christmas favorite, is Rotten on the Tomatometer? Cue: Hands on face – mouth agape.What did the critics object to, exactly? According to many reviews at the time,&nbsp;simply moving the action – and Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) and the Wet-now-Sticky Bandits – from the suburbs of Chicago to the streets of Manhattan wasn’t quite enough to justify this sequel’s existence. Almost scene-for-scene, from the family losing Kevin in the airport to Kevin meeting a scary stranger who is more than they appear,&nbsp;Home Alone 2 plays exactly like&nbsp;Home Alone,&nbsp;and for many that wasn’t enough. And then there was the violence: Critics slammed the movie for its&nbsp;brutality, which felt more Freddy Krueger than Road Runner the second time around – and to be fair, the grand finale, set in a Manhattan brownstone, featured enough bricks and paint cans and traps to kill Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci)&nbsp;many times over.Too much of the same thing or just enough of a good thing? Too violent or brilliantly brutal? Sickly saccharine or expert bringer of the Christmas feels?

As part of our RT Archives project, we are collecting contemporaneous reviews for those films – see a full list here and read what critics said about them at the time – and shining a spotlight on the stories and people behind them. Learn more about the RT Archives project here.Mr. Babadook –&nbsp;the tall and top-hatted monster from Jennifer Kent’s acclaimed film The Babadook –&nbsp;might be the most iconic horror villain of recent times. (Don’t believe us? Check out the memes… or just leave your house on Halloween evening.) But while the Babadook is a marvel of modern horror, its roots date back to the earliest days of cinema, and to one film in particular: the Lon Chaney-starring London After Midnight. Here, as part of our RT Archives project, we take a look at that film and how its distinctive visuals inspired one of recent horror’s most celebrated works.To read reviews of director Tod Browning’s 1927 London After Midnight, a murder mystery flavored with&nbsp;ghouls and hypnosis, is to know that it is terrifying. The Film Daily wrote that “Lon Chaney’s latest chill raiser [has] a story certain to disturb the nervous system of the more sensitive picture patrons.” But modern audiences will never know&nbsp;just how nerve-wracking the film is. Although it has been reconstructed by Rick Schmidlin with the help of recovered still photographs, a script, and new score by Robert Israel –&nbsp;you can find details of that effort at TCM&nbsp;– audiences can no longer&nbsp;see London After Midnight in its original form: the only known remaining copy was destroyed in an MGM vault fire in the 1960s.(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Trawl through contemporary reviews, though, and you see that a major contributor to the film’s overall creepiness was a mysterious character who – spoiler alert! – is later revealed to be Scotland Yard Inspector Professor Edward C. Burke in disguise. Of the limited imagery from the film that remains, it’s this figure,&nbsp;with his bulging eyes, pointed teeth, and distorted grin, that stands out. The Sydney Morning Herald’s April 30, 1928 review addressed the effect of the creature at the time: “The few moments when a squat black figure like a bat, with glaring eyes and enormous teeth, is seen coming down the stairs in company with a woman in grey robes, whose face is terrifying in its corpse-like absence of expression, imprint themselves very strongly on the mind.”The role was fittingly played by famed character actor Chaney, known as “the man of a thousand faces” due to his ability to apply his own makeup and prosthetics, and distort his body for the many roles that required it. He utilized those skills to deliver memorable performances in The Phantom of the Opera and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, among others. But it was the wide-eyed, grinning Professor Burke that might have been his most singularly disturbing; at the very least, according to a 1928 Photoplay review, the costuming and makeup used “was as gruesome as any [Chaney] had ever worn.” In December of 1927, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote, “Mr. Chaney obligingly applies a figurative bit of ice to the vertebrae by walking in and out of scenes in properly horrifying makeup.”(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection )Keen-eyed movie fans immediately saw similarities between “The Man In the Beaver Hat,” as Chaney’s London After Midnight figure came to be known, and Mr. Babadook, the creature from a mysterious pop-up book who enters the home –&nbsp;and/or minds –&nbsp;of a grieving mother and her young son in Kent’s The Babadook. There’s the hat, the black-rimmed eyes, and the exaggerated mouth and teeth. In 2014, Kent told the Mountain Express that the image of Chaney in the 1927 movie “really impressed itself upon me.”She added in the same interview: “What I loved about that particular image – and you can also see it in the footage we used of [Chaney]&nbsp;in the movie on TV from&nbsp;Phantom of the Opera&nbsp;– is that you can see that it’s a person’s face. It’s just a face that’s been distorted – without CGI obviously – but manipulated so that it looks human, but almost not. And I think that&nbsp;London After Midnight,&nbsp;shot with his face and his mouth pulled apart like that, is really frightening.”There is a thematic similarity, too, between how both creatures are handled in Browning and Kent’s films. In The Babadook, the creature is more than a terrifying specter who must be vanquished for Essie Davis’s Amelia to move on – he becomes something that the protagonist must learn to make space for in her life. In London After Midnight, Chaney’s mysterious figure is misunderstood as well: He’s ultimately not&nbsp;a villain, and becomes a key part of solving the film’s mystery.(Photo by ©IFC Midnight)That turn resonates with something Chaney told journalist Ruth Waterbury in the same issue of Photoplay in which London was so well reviewed –&nbsp;and his performance deemed “perfect.” “I’ve tried to show that the lowliest people frequently have the highest ideals,” Chaney said. “In the lower depths when life hasn’t been too pleasant for me I’ve always [had] that gentleness of feeling, that compassion of an under dog for a fellow sufferer.”London After isn’t Chaney’s only lost film.&nbsp; Many of the short silent films from his early career are considered lost, like &nbsp;The Chimney’s Secret, An Elephant On His Hands, Father and the Boys, Almost an Actress, as well as later film The Big City, another collaboration with director Tod Browning from 1928.

I said: “George Lucas told me recently that there’s a script and he’s happy with the story.”Spielberg: “George Lucas isn’t the director. I am.”You may recall that in this space on Dec. 6, 2005, I wrote that Lucas said he had a script by Jeff Nathanson, who wrote Spielberg’s \"Catch Me If You Can\" and \"The Terminal,\" as well as Bret Ratner’s \"Rush Hour\" movies. But even Nathanson seems to have been succeeded in the Indy sweepstakes.“I have David Koepp on it now, and he’s my ‘closer,’” Spielberg said, using a baseball reference to the pitcher who comes in during the 9th inning and finishes up a winning ball game.\"—For Friedman’s full report, click here.Since his 1988 debut \"Apartment Zero,\" David Koepp has been one of the busiest (not to mention wealthiest) screenwriters out there.

There are many facets to this character which I can’t discuss, but looking at the spectrum of all of Jeff’s roles, this fits in nicely with the man who played ‘Starman,’ ‘Tucker,’ ‘Big Lebowski’ with a little bit ‘Tron’ thrown in … This rounds out our ensemble, and I think it’s one of the strongest casts ever assembled for one of our films.\"No argument here.Production on \"Iron Man\" is scheduled to begin next month.

So when it came time to make the jump to the big screen, the film’s subject, not surprisingly, was television.Wayne’s World’s plot follows a cynical businessman trying to take over the titular regional television favorite, but the film is about TV, and more broadly about popular culture, in myriad other ways. It’s a film about two characters — Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) — whose minds and imaginations have been hopelessly hijacked and colonized by pop culture, to the point where they filter everything through the TV shows they’ve watched, the music they’ve listened to, and the movies they’ve seen. (Note I did not say “the books they’ve read,” because despite repeated inferences that Wayne may be a genius, or at least far more intelligent than he appears, he doesn’t seem like much of a reader.)This intense investment in pop culture, this willingness — even eagerness — to let pop culture speak for them, is represented most memorably in the instant classic scene in&nbsp;which Wayne, Garth, and some of the their burnout buddies ecstatically lip-sync to Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” With Freddie Mercury and Brian May’s pop-trash operatics as the soundtrack, the drab streets of small-town Illinois pick up a new luster. Suddenly Aurora positively glows, and it’s all but impossible not to wish you were there in the car with them, acting out the outsized emotions of “Bohemian Rhapsody” with wild, uninhibited abandon.Wayne’s World is a film in which the heroes visit Milwaukee and intuitively recreate the Laverne &amp; Shirley opening credits, because what the hell else are you going to do in Milwaukee? It’s a film whose characters discuss the surreal insanity of replacing Dick York with Dick Sargent as Darren on Bewitched and hoping nobody would notice, because in the prehistoric days before the&nbsp;internet, people weren’t able to have these essential conversations virtually. They had to have them face to face — or IRL, as the young people say.Director Penelope Spheeris brings a documentarian’s eye for sociological and pop-anthropological detail to Wayne’s World.Accordingly, Wayne’s World opens on television. Benjamin, an oily shark played by Rob Lowe at the very beginning of his successful reinvention as a sly, deadpan comic character actor, is in bed with a beautiful woman played by Ione Skye. Benjamin’s companion for the evening fixates on Wayne’s World, a proudly amateurish public-access goof broadcasting proudly from Aurora, IL. The excessively handsome businessman sees something authentic he can corrupt in these suburban under-achievers, so he sets about buying the show as a vehicle to pimp the wares of Noah’s Arcade, a video game emporium owned by Brian Doyle Murray (whom you may recall we encountered in Get A Life, the first entry in the series).As part of his nefarious scheme, Benjamin sets out to play show-business Svengali to Wayne’s incongruously hot, hair-metal rocker girlfriend Cassandra Wong (Tia Carerre). Wayne’s World holds up shockingly well considering how rooted it is in the early 1990s, but it’s least successful as a vessel/vehicle for Carrere’s forgettable song stylings. Wayne’s romance with Cassandra takes up a lot of screentime, yet still feels fairly obligatory, though even the weakest aspects of the film have a certain goofy charm — as illustrated by the central role Cantonese plays in Wayne and Cassandra’s courtship.But before this corporate snake comes slithering into Aurora, it stands as an unlikely Midwestern Eden, albeit an unmistakably Canadian Midwest. Re-watching Wayne’s World made me nostalgic for living in the Midwest like nothing else in the 13 months since I left Chicago with my wife, baby, and dog like Lot and his family fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah (but with more of a sense of urgency). The Chicagoland of Wayne’s World is the one I love and miss. It’s also one I suspect may never have actually existed. That’s because, in a very real sense, the Chicagoland of Wayne’s World was faked through editing. The vast majority of the film was shot in Los Angeles, but they picked up a number of shots in Chicago and the Chicagoland area, and I recognized a bunch of buildings and businesses from different neighborhoods I’d lived or worked in during my 25 years as a Chicagoan.The Aurora of Wayne’s World is a romanticized, idealized, outsider’s vision of small-town Illinois as an idyll of all-American innocence, where driving a lemon through streets full of sad little businesses while blasting a classic rock oldie can be a source of palpable, irrepressible joy, and nobody ever needs to grow up when you can play street hockey with your buddies all night and end the evening with some Bear Claws at Stan Mikita’s Donuts.If Wayne’s World feels weirdly like a definitive take on growing up aimless and goofy in the Midwest despite being filmed almost entirely in Los Angeles, that might be because director Penelope Spheeris proved herself one of the canniest and most empathetic chroniclers of American youth culture in her seminal rock and roll documentaries The Decline of Western Civilization and The Decline of Western Civilization Part 2 (which, to be fair, was super-canny, but somewhat light on empathy).Spheeris brings a documentarian’s eye for sociological and pop-anthropological detail to Wayne’s World. She has an unusually astute feel for the rituals, traditions, and sub-cultures of young people, and in its early going, Wayne’s World feels a little like a Midwestern, bubblegum version of American Graffiti. It has a sense of place that is rare for a mainstream commercial comedy, especially one not shot on location.The film’s plot is a television morality tale, but one with an enormous amount of affection for the medium.It would be unkind to call Wayne’s World a celebration of loserdom. It would be nicer to say it’s a celebration of low expectations, of low ambitions. It’s a celebration of sticking with what you love and what gives you pleasure, whether that’s juvenile pranks or the music of Mötley Crüe, for as long as humanly possible — even if that means living at home with your parents and hosting a silly public access show with your best friend.In that sense, the film’s plot is a television morality tale, but one with an enormous amount of affection for the medium Harlan Ellison disparaged as the “glass teat” for its infantilizing effects. The moral struggle in Wayne’s World is between Wayne and Garth putting on a television show out of love for the medium and a guileless desire to express themselves creatively, versus evil television forces that cynically wish to corrupt this medium with their infernal lust for money and power.There’s an interesting meta aspect at play here, in that the Aurora public access version of Wayne’s World represents a lot of kids’ conceptions of Saturday Night Live as a cool, fun place where friends hang out and goof around primarily to amuse themselves, and if they happen to make a ton of money and become movie stars, that’s a nice bonus. Yet the Benjamin incarnation of Wayne’s World is probably a lot closer to SNL’s reality — a high-pressure commercial enterprise full of hard-working, calculating, and ambitious professionals sometimes blessed with an unusually direct connection to the wants and needs of youth culture.Wayne and Garth are making television for the right reasons, and as a result, they’re not making any money off the endeavor, although Wayne confides that his dream is to be able to host Wayne’s World for a living. We learn a lot from Wayne directly because this is yet another Simpsons Decade entry where the fourth wall is violated so extensively and so purposefully that it calls into question whether it even exists at all.As the hero of the film, it’s perhaps not surprising that Wayne intermittently talks to the camera to address the audience directly, but it’s still a fairly audacious choice. It’s more surprising that nerdy, childlike, lovably unself-conscious Garth has also apparently been deputized to break the fourth wall. And it is delightfully absurd that an exceedingly minor supporting character played by Ed O’Neill also breaks the fourth wall and tries to get the audience interested in some strange, dark tale that has nothing to do with the rest of the film.The idea that the film’s onscreen narration would be hijacked by some hardboiled weirdo inhabiting his own world and his own mini-movie is stranger than it is funny. It’s a comedy writer’s joke more than a comedy audience’s joke, and I suspect that if O’Neill weren’t the enormously popular star of Married… with Children, a hit television sitcom also set in the Chicagoland area, the whole bit might have ended up on the cutting room floor as a weird joke that didn’t quite play.Yet O’Neill’s strange cameo speaks to the film’s glorious, unabashed artificiality, to the sense that Wayne’s World knows damn well it’s a fictional movie based on a fictional television show from a long-running sketch-comedy institution. Wayne’s World glories in its non-reality. It’s a movie in which Wayne opens a door to a room where a group of men are being trained in armed combat, something that might happen in a James Bond movie or a martial arts cheapie, simply because that’s always something Wayne wanted to do, and since this is his movie, he can do whatever the hell he wants.Wayne’s World is a product of the VCR and cable era, so it gravitates towards pop culture references a broad cross-section of the audience can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;identify.In another context, introducing such a preposterous fantasy element might compromise the film’s reality, but that would imply that Wayne’s World has a baseline reality to compromise. It does not. Wayne’s World’s contempt for realism only increases as it progresses and reaches a giddy apex when the film rapidly cycles through three separate, very different endings.The first ending, implausibly enough, is a deeply unhappy one. The girl doesn’t get the recording contract, a psychotic ex-girlfriend shows up pregnant, the cad ends up with the girl (in a tropical paradise, no less), and for good measure, there’s a near-fatal fire as well. Needless to say, Wayne and Garth (and, by extension, the movie) are not terribly invested in that ending, so like a teenager flipping through channels, the movie offers up two more. The second is a Scooby-Doo homage in which Lowe’s perfect visage is revealed to be an astonishingly realistic mask and the ostensible “TV hotshot” is revealed to be the geriatric “Old Man Withers, the guy who runs the haunted amusement park!”It’s a testament to how much the film loves TV — and doesn’t love reality — that the actual, happy ending is given only slightly more weight than one rooted exclusively in the audience’s campy nostalgia for the cartoons of their youth. Wayne’s World is a product of the VCR and cable era rather than the internet, so it tends to gravitate towards the pop culture that a broad cross-section of the audience can&nbsp;easily&nbsp;identify, whether that’s Scooby-Doo, Led Zeppelin (when Wayne goes to the music store to lust after a sweet-ass guitar, there’s a sign asking customers not to play “Stairway To Heaven”), or even Terminator 2, which figures prominently in one of the film’s most timely and consequently most dated references, when Robert Patrick’s murderous cyborg shows up during the climax.Wayne’s World is curious proposition. It’s the enormously likable, even lovable, brainchild of one of the prickliest men in show business, a man notorious for being difficult and litigious. It’s also a tribute to friendship and a wonderful buddy comedy starring two men with such an acrimonious relationship that, at one point, Myers famously tried to cut Dana Carvey out of an early&nbsp;draft of the script. It’s a great collaboration between Myers and Spheeris, who hated working with each other. It’s a wonderful movie about the Chicago suburbs that was filmed almost exclusively in L.A. Lastly, it’s a fundamentally sweet, even tender film whose pleasures go far beyond pop culture nostalgia even though they’re deeply rooted in it.Is Wayne’s World as good as I thought it was when I was 16? No, because nothing, honestly, is as good as I thought Wayne’s World was when I was 16. That’s okay. That doesn’t mean it isn’t worth celebrating. In the 24 years since its release, Wayne’s World has come full circle. It’s now a beloved fixture of the pop culture past it spends so much of its running time both spoofing and celebrating — albeit not to the point where it couldn’t still wring copious laughs out of it in the bargain.Nathan Rabin if a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

But the making of \"Poseidon\" was an incredibly difficult undertaking, he said. \"I never compare what we do to a real job,\" he said. \"But truthfully, this was a close to going to work on an oil rig as you can get.\"In a press conference with reporters, cast members and director Wolfgang Petersen said the film was not an easy one to make, but it was a fascinating experience.\"Poseidon\" tells the tale of a New Year’s Eve cruise gone horribly awry. After the titular ship is hit by a rouge wave, it turns upside down. Believing that staying put will mean certain death, a group of passengers strike out on their own, braving fires, electrical wires, and lots and lots of rising water.Wolgang Petersen on the set of \"Poseidon\"Petersen has made several films that involve disaster on the ocean, and Lucas said the director told him \"Poseidon\" would be the third in a loose trilogy.\"The first conversation he and I had was, ‘I want to do what’s essentially a trilogy — \"Das Boot,\" \"The Perfect Storm\" and this one — and deal with moving from a huge Hollywood-type panoramic party setting into a claustrophobic hell and an ascent out of that hell,\" Lucas said. \"But not in a spiritual sense like in the book, just from a pure survival [standpoint].\"The ocean can be both a calming and unsettling natural force, which is why it appeals to his artistic sensibilities, Petersen said.\"You go to the water and dream,\" he said. \"There’s a long, endless horizon and there’s a lot of space where your thoughts can go. [But] It’s the biggest force of nature, with the most destructive kind of absolute frightening force.\"And in fiction when things go wrong on a grand scale, cast member Mike Vogel said, audiences can enjoy the high drama in comfortable conditions.\"Be it with this or any disaster movie, there’s something within us as humans that we’re drawn to catastrophe for some reason,\" he said. \"We want to experience that without having to experience it. It gives you a chance to keep one foot in each world without getting hurt.\"Surf’s upIn this case, Kurt Russell was excited about the possibility of working with Petersen on the reconfiguring of a classic genre film.\"I’m not much on sequels, and I’m not on remakes; I don’t like or dislike them,\" he said. \"I think [it’s about] if you read a good script or there’s a director you want to work with. That was the thing for me. In this case I really wanted to work with Wolfgang.\"There are lots of movies that I wouldn’t want to have any part of doing a second part of, or remake of,\" he continued. \"This is quite different from the first.\"The original \"Poseidon Adventure,\" made in 1972, starred Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters. The film helped to kick off the \"disaster movie\" genre that was popular in the 1970s. Mia Maestro said while she enjoys \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" it’s something that could benefit from an update.\"I love the original movie,\" she said. \"I think there are many interesting connections between the old characters and the new characters.[And] I thought it was the perfect movie to do a remake of. We have so much more technology and the special effects are so much more incredible these days.\"I don’t think you should do a remake of Bergman, or a Fellini movie, because how can you top that?\" she continued. \"But a genre film? I think it’s pretty great.\"\"If you can do ‘Mutiny on the Bounty‘ three times, you can do ‘Poseidon,’\" Russell said.Kurt Russell and Josh LucasThe film is relatively brief at 99 minutes, and there isn’t a lot of delving into the characters’ backstories or inner workings. But that was very much by design, Lucas said.\"You can’t have bogus dialogue,\" he said. ‘[People] are not gonna get to know each other in that situation. The sets and the kind of filmmaking Wolfgang was doing was so violently heightened. [If] you come into a room and there’s dead bodies around the room, you’re not going to have conversation about, you know, ‘where you from?’ In a sense, it honored the truth of the situation more than it would have otherwise.\"While that might mean that there aren’t a lot of opportunities for actors to make grand speeches, Russell said that’s fine by him, as films made with big sets and lots of special effects require different things from their casts.\"If you’re doing \"Poseidon\" or \"Backdraft,\" these big movies that have a lot of activity in them, you work with it,\" he said. \"What you try to do is be as good a part of it as you can to help tell the story that that director wants to tell. Whatever you’re going to do, whatever your part is in helping bring that about, do that to the best of your ability.\"The Poseidon hits some rough watersBut while the actors spend much of their time onscreen reacting to the dangers around them, Lucas said there are little opportunities to show some of the subtle aspects of a character.\"You’re not really acting much in this movie, you’re reacting,\" he said. \"The thing I try to settle into and connect to is, who is this guy inside and what can you show from the inside that’s not through dialogue — that’s through subtle little moments of this man’s independent rogue-ish danger and mysteriousness at the beginning. All that has to be totally internal because it’s not dialogue and that becomes an interesting challenge in a reactionary environment.\"And that environment was hazardous for the actors. While many of the images in the film were created using CG effects, the actors were shot on a huge soundstage to depict the upside-down ship.\"It was a serious set,\" Vogel said. \"There were several close calls.\"Russell came down with a throat infection. Both he and Vogel had pneumonia. Russell also unintentionally hit Lucas in the face with a metal flashlight, causing [the] production to shut down for a day while Lucas was taken to the hospital. Lucas was hospitalized again when he fell and snapped a muscle in his thumb, an injury that required surgery.\"For the first two and a half months of the movie it was one thing after another,\" Russell said. \"I just kept being sick.\"\"We were hurt, and everyone was sick,\" Lucas said. \"You’re dealing with a human Petri dish.\"In addition, the effects of the water took their toll in other ways.\"I was wet for five months,\" Lucas said. \"I’m soaking wet in every single scene. Your skin gets so soft that you can cut it with your fingernail. It’s gross. It’s absolutely amazing what happens to your body when you’re in the water for that period of time.\"\"It was the underwater stuff that was psychologically difficult to do because once you went in there wasn’t any getting out,\" Russell said. \"You also have no goggles on so it was very difficult to see because of the lighting. You were dependent on someone swimming in to give you air and then they had to lead you out. By the time you reach the end, you’re out of air.\"Mike Vogel, Emmy Rossum, Kurt Russell, Ruchard Dreyfuss, and Mia MaestroBut the environment also made for a very realistic experience, Lucas said.\"I really like physical filmmaking,\" he said. \"There’s a real sense of physical truth in this movie — there’s nothing fake. I mean, we were there. Obviously the boat is not real, but all those environments, all that fire, all that water, [they’re real].\"Because of the intensity of the shoot, there was real camaraderie among the cast and crew, Lucas said.\"I find it boring when actors sit around and say, ‘Aww, everyone liked each other,’\" he said. \"Truthfully, had we not like each other on this movie, it would have been impossible because it was so physically difficult. There was an odd lack of ego, where everyone was showing up and saying, this is extremely difficult, let’s help each other through it which is kinda what the characters had.\"How audiences will react to the film is, of course, another matter altogether. Peterson said he is always excited to have a big movie out around the summer, but he also hopes the audience will be entertained.\"It’s a pro and con [situation],\" he said. \"There’s a lot of excitement about summer movies, but there’s huge competition out there. I have decidedly mixed feelings.\"There’s one thing that Vogel is certain of, though: he’ll never go on a cruise.\"Never,\" he said. \"I’m just not a water guy.\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"toronto, Witch, die","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"josh-lucas-kurt-russell-and-cast-discuss-poseidon-adventure"},{"id":"47614215697318","title":"On DVD This Week: House of Cards Season Four and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: House of Cards Season Four and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | July 4, 2016 |  CommentsHappy Fourth of July!

But the Spielberg classic might be an exception, not a rule.by Mark Hofmeyer | April 5, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer / © Paramount )Director John Krasinski’s new horror flick, A Quiet Place, is being called a creature feature for the ages. Critics have&nbsp;described the film, which follows a family hiding out in silence from a mysterious threat that responds — very aggressively — to sound, a “nervy terrifying thrill” and “almost unbearably tense”, and lavished it with a Certified Fresh 97% Tomatometer score, so far. Audiences are psyched for the movie, too, based on early buzz and early trailers; it’s tracking to potentially open to $30 million.In the tradition of some of the most celebrated monster movies in cinema, A Quiet Place keeps its creature cards close to its chest, only revealing what its mysterious threat actually is about halfway through the film. Even then, we rarely get a chance to ogle the noise-hating beasts that are terrorizing Emily Blunt and Co. — marvelous though they are, as rendered by the sick geniuses at Industrial Light and Magic. “Our philosophy is: What you don’t see is scarier,” screenwriter Scott Beck recently told Rotten Tomatoes.But is hiding your beasties always best for your movie?As A Quiet Place enters the monster movie canon, we’re looking at whether the amount of screen time that filmmakers give their creatures affects how well their movies are received by critics. Does following the Jaws rule of keeping your monster below surface for an excruciatingly long stretch of your running time necessarily mean your movie will achieve Jaws-like levels of nail-biting tension and critical acclaim? Should movies show more or less when it comes to things that want to kill you? And should they reveal their&nbsp;killers straight out of the gate, or wait to the bitter and bloody end?Filmmakers offer wildly different answers to those questions. Some unleash their beast(s) almost immediately (Bubba Ho-Tep) and are adored by critics and fans, while others choose to withhold the full reveal until minutes before the end (The Ritual). Some choose to feature their creations for only two minutes (Signs) while others let their monsters linger on screen a lot longer (Hello, King Kong). The impact these choices have on critical reception, as measured through the Tomatometer, is what we’re investigating below.Specifically we’re diving into two questions:Does the amount of screen time given to a creature help or hurt a movie’s Tomatometer score?Does it matter when the creature gets its first “This is me!” money shot?We pulled together 36 creature features and analyzed their use of their central creatures in an effort to answer the questions. The movies were picked because they encapsulate key aspects of their genre, were created by Stan Winston (a given), or are looked at as trendsetters, cult-classics, or underappreciated gems. We understand these 36 films don’t come close to covering the entirety of the genre, but the data pulled from them does give us some understanding of over 80 years’ worth of cinematic monsters and how their creators used them. The full list is below, and more details about our criteria for choosing them can be found at the bottom of this feature.Pandorum, Leviathan,&nbsp;Deep Rising, The Relic, Anaconda, Lake Placid, Jeepers Creepers, Eight-Legged Freaks, The Faculty, Mimic, The Blob (1958), Ragnarok, Pacific Rim, The Ritual, Grabbers, Monsters, Signs, Godzilla (2014), Cloverfield, Bubba Ho-Tep, Colossal, Predator, Trollhunter, Super 8, The Thing (1982), Creature From The Black Lagoon, Tremors, The Descent, Spring, Attack the Block, The Host, Godzilla (1954), It Follows, Alien, Jaws, King Kong (1933)When it comes to Monsters, More — and Earlier — is More(Photo by (c) 20th Century Fox Film Corp)Creature features that show their monsters for more than four minutes have a higher Tomatometer average than those under four minutes.&nbsp;76.5% (four minutes or more) &gt; 65% (less than four minutes)Movies that feature their “This is me!” money shot in the first 30 minutes have a higher Tomatometer average than those that wait.77% (Monster revealed in first 30 minutes ) &gt; 69.5% (Monster revealed in minute 30-60) &gt; 66.9% (Monster revealed in minute 60-90).Wait — what? You mean everything my screenwriting professor told me is wrong? Movie lore would have it that the best creature features are those that wait patiently to reveal their bad guys, and then don’t show them too much at all. Show a bit of leg, or fin, to tease your audience and keep them wanting more. There’s data to support this approach. Films like Jaws, Alien, Cloverfield, and Signs are all massive hits that waited an average of 67 minutes to fully reveal their creatures, and then only showed them on screen for a little over three minutes. The same&nbsp;tactic&nbsp;is earning A Quiet Place critical acclaim, with AV Club’s A.A. Dowd saying it “builds tension from the absence of the monster”.Steven Spielberg’s&nbsp;Jaws and Ridley Scott‘s&nbsp;Alien are classics of the less-is-more school, both with Tomatometer scores of 97%. However, when we combine those movies’ scores with the Tomameter scores for other movies that delay their monster reveals until after the 60-minute mark — Rotten flicks like Leviathan, Deep Rising, The Faculty, and The Relic —&nbsp;their exceptional individual numbers are weighed down by the stragglers.&nbsp;Combined, these late revealers have an average score of 66.9%, while the movies that fully introduce their monsters within the first 30 minutes average 77%. The latter set includes&nbsp;The Host (2006), It Follows, Pacific Rim, The Blob, Attack the Block, Bubba Ho-Tep, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Pandorum, and Trollhunter.When you dig into that cream of the creature-feature&nbsp; crop — the 10 best-reviewed films in the data set — some interesting&nbsp;trends and moments in movie history emerge.10. Tremors (1990) – 85%9. The Descent (2005) – 85%8. Spring (2015) – 88%7.&nbsp;Attack the Block (2011) –&nbsp;90%6.&nbsp;The Host&nbsp;(2006) – 93%5.&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;(1954) – 93%4.&nbsp;It Follows (2015)&nbsp;– 97%3.&nbsp;Alien (1979)&nbsp;– 97%2. Jaws (1975)&nbsp;– 97%1. King Kong&nbsp;(1933) – 98%In this group of 10, you can see something like an evolution of the creature feature.In the Beginning, We Lingered.King Kong (1933) |&nbsp;Godzilla (1954)King Kong and Godzilla are arguably the most famous of all monster movies. Both of their central creatures have starred in numerous sequels and reboots, and they now share their own cinematic universe with Godzilla (2014), Kong: Skull Island (2017), and the upcoming Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) and Godzilla vs. Kong (2020). The first films that each character appeared in set up a successful template for how and when to introduce monsters.Both giants get their first money shot at the 46-minute mark of their debut films, and then are given lots of screen time to destroy their respective countries’ largest metropolises. Kong was on screen for just over 18 minutes and Godzilla was featured for almost nine full minutes (8:56). At times when moviegoers were eager for spectacle and special effects, they were getting their money’s worth with these beasts.The trend of giving monsters plenty of screen time continued with Universal’s 1954 classic, The Creature From the Black Lagoon (number 11 on the Tomatometer from the films in our data set). The lagoon creature was less monumental than Kong or Godzilla, but like them, it was showcased for&nbsp;a significant portion of&nbsp;the movie in which it featured (11 minutes), plenty of time for audiences to scour the creature suit for any tell-tale seams, but also to understand the creature’s motivations.We come to know and sympathize with it, and it is thus a tragedy when it dies at the hands of humans. Kong earned similar pathos with his 18 minutes of screen time.&nbsp;If you want your monster to be more of a character than simply a menace, we need time to get to know it. You might even win an Oscar for your efforts if you do, as Guillermo del Toro did this year with The Shape of Water.Then Spielberg and Scott Created a Formula that was Tough to Match.Jaws (1975) |&nbsp;Alien (1979)Jaws and Alien are considered the most important creature features of the modern era — they helped create the summer blockbuster and, at the same time,&nbsp;brought the horror genre a prestigious allure (suddenly it was OK for A-list directors to tackle B-movie material). They also redefined the monster movie with their less-is-more approach.Spielberg and Scott both wait until after the 60-minute mark to fully reveal their monsters, and it’s a very deliberate game of peak-a-boo that they’re playing. Scott’s delay allows audiences&nbsp;to witness the birth and growth of a slick and juicy-looking beast (Facehugger, Chestburster, Xenomorph); Spielberg&nbsp;has us sitting or floating in fear of the unknown,&nbsp; unseen “thing” lurking&nbsp;below the surface (sure, we know that Bruce the mechanical shark was the&nbsp;reason behind that decision, but it’s effective nonetheless).We’re not meant to empathize with these creatures — we’re supposed to run, swim, and scream for our lives.Filmmakers ever since have emulated this approach, but it doesn’t always work. It’s worth noting that three out of the four lowest rated movies in the data set delayed the full reveal of the monsters until after the 80-minute mark and featured their creations for less than three minutes each. The Relic (#33), Deep Rising (#34), and Leviathan (#36) all kept their monsters from audiences for way too long and then didn’t show them enough. There needs to be a reason to&nbsp;withhold your monster from the audience, because if not, it feels like the movie is cheating. It also helps if there’s something interesting going on while we wait for the monster money shot. Some interesting human drama, say.Deep Rising is an especially egregious offender. It sets up a cool prehistoric boat-hating monster, shows us some tantalizing glimpses of tentacles, and then reveals a kraken-esque CGI fest&nbsp;that leaves us scratching our heads and saying “huh” rather than dropping our jaws and saying “wow”.Filmmakers skillfully&nbsp;adapted those formulas.(Photo by (c) Lions Gate/courtesy Everett Collection)Tremors (1990) |&nbsp;The Descent (2005)Tremors trades out the Atlantic Ocean setting of Jaws for the wide-open expanses of the Nevada desert and features monsters (graboids) that attack from under the soil, rather than beneath the sea. The graboids are unleashed at the 33-minute mark of Tremors, and from there the film becomes a cat-and-mouse game between the stranded townsfolk and the smarter-than-you’d-think sandworms. We see more of the monsters here than we do the shark in Jaws, and we meet them earlier, but the storytelling principals remain the same. The townsfolk stand in for the audience, learning more about the creatures together, and what they need to do to defeat them, as more is revealed (think: “We’re gonna need a bigger boat.”).(If you are looking for a fun double feature, watch Tremors alongside The Thing — number 12 in our data set.&nbsp;They are incredibly different films in tone and approach, but both have their big reveals at the 30(ish)-minute mark and both feature main characters who learn, from one crumb of new info to the next, how to defeat their beasties — i.e. very large explosions.)The Descent swaps out Alien’s claustrophobic spaceship for a claustrophobic cave system in the Appalachian mountains, and replaces the earlier film’s xenomorph&nbsp;with subterranean humanoid crawlers who&nbsp;can attack at any time from anywhere. We don’t meet the crawlers until 56 minutes into the film, but each of those monster-free minutes is insanely tense. Director Neil Marshall traps his female crew of spelunkers in a massive cave system, where they get lost (of course) and have to endure darkness, uncertainty, and broken bones — all before the monsters show up. It’s another case of an isolated crew dealing with in-fighting, killer beings, and an environment where no one’s likely to hear you scream — with a very tough woman, front-and center.Both The Descent&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tremors&nbsp;show that if you embrace creature feature tropes and add a unique spin, you may have a modern classic on your hands.And Today, Earlier&nbsp;Seems better.&nbsp;(Photo by ©Magnolia Pictures)The Host (2007) |&nbsp;Attack the Block (2011) |&nbsp;It Follows (2015)Recent monster movie favorites The Host, Attack the Block, and It Follows fully introduce their creatures within the first 25 minutes. With the mystery out of the way early, these films focus on character development and new monster details to sustain the tension —&nbsp;and the fact that their un-mysterious menaces are relentless attack machines. You know what you’re running from, now do not stop.In Attack the Block, the monsters get their full reveal at the 24-minute mark, and&nbsp;the film settles in&nbsp;as a limited-location&nbsp;thriller. Nothing is really ever learned about the aliens attacking the titular high-rise, and they are only on screen for less than four minutes total; but that short screen time doesn’t matter because the story isn’t about them. It’s a coming-of-age story, really, with some awesome thrills and sci-fi legend-to-be John Boyega at the helm.Similarly, we meet the title character of South Korean mega-hit The Host almost shockingly early — just 14 minutes in — and, more shockingly, in daylight. The first sighting of the creature and the following attack happen so fast that it’s almost impossible not to say “Wait, what?” as you’re picking up&nbsp;the popcorn you just dropped. Early creature attacks are rare, especially ones where we can see the attacker. Director Bong Joon-ho&nbsp;(Okja, Snowpiercer) is known for subverting genre exceptions, and he does it again here. We’re suddenly on edge, because the old rules do not apply.While what “the host” actually is remains a mystery for much of that film, even as we get several good and long looks at it, the monster at the center of It Follows is almost fully explained when it is introduced 20 minutes in.&nbsp;Its original form is never sighted, and it is only seen in the human&nbsp;guise that it adopts, but the entity is grounded by rules, and has certain limitations, making it a creature in the creature-feature sense, and making it seem more alien than supernatural. While mystery is so often central to a horror movie’s dread, certainty is the root cause here: With those clear rules in hand, we know that the one thing this big evil will do is relentlessly follow its prey. Whenever a frame lingers a little too long, we know that it is coming.(Photo by Jonny Cournoyer / © Paramount )While the Tomatometer suggests that more monster equals better movies, dig a little deeper and the story is more nuanced. What the data seem to show most clearly is that — no surprises here — good ideas, good filmmaking, and, often, reinvention, are key. That certainly seems to the case for&nbsp;A Quiet Place, which now sits at 99% on the Tomatometer. In many ways, it’s a traditional monster movie in the&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jaws&nbsp;sense: a mysterious, hidden and largely unexplained force is on the hunt. But it’s also a monster movie with its own spin. In the space that these characters occupy, no one can hear you scream — because screaming is the thing that will get you killed.&nbsp;It’s a novel twist and another step forward for the monster movie genre.A Quiet Place&nbsp;is in theaters April 6.A note on how we selected the movies:We only counted the time the monster is seen alive on screen. Autopsies don’t count.In movies like King Kong (1933) and Godzilla (2014), the title character battles other monsters. We only counted the time the main creature is on-screen (sorry M.U.T.O.S).Movies like The Descent, Tremors, Grabbers, and Attack the Block feature several creatures. Any time the creatures were on screen, the time was counted. There was not one specific creature that was tracked.Movies like The Fly and An American Werewolf in London were excluded because the main character becomes a creature. We were looking for people being harassed by monsters (not, you know, eventually turning into them).No sequels, zombies, werewolves, vampires, invisible people or genetically modified creatures who easily escape their enclosures.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"HBO, tv, Cinematographers, ghosts, foreign, superhero, TCA, streaming, Disney, spider-man","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"monster-minutes-how-does-creature-screen-time-affect-a-scary-movies-tomatometer"},{"id":"47614249563063","title":"First Look at Terry Gilliam’s Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})First Look at Terry Gilliam's Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus!Tom Waits as the devil? Sign us up.by Jeff Giles | October 9, 2007 |  CommentsItching for a look at Terry Gilliam‘s next feature, The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus?The director’s fanzine, Dreams, has posted an early glimpse at the film, including cast details, a synopsis, and a concept drawing of the titular Imaginarium. From the site:The Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus is set in the present day, and tells the story of Dr Parnassus and his extraordinary ‘Imaginarium’, a travelling show — where members of the audience get an irresistible opportunity to choose between light and joy or darkness and gloom. The script is written by Gilliam with Charles McKeown, who both wrote the script to The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.According to the article, the film’s cast includes Christopher Plummer as Dr. Parnassus, Tom Waits as “the devil incarnate,” and a supporting roster led by Heath Ledger, Verne Troyer, Andrew Garfield, and Lily Cole. Gilliam has described Parnassus as “a person with eternal life who’s basically a storyteller, but the world has moved on and his brand of storytelling is of no interest” — which is probably not all that dissimilar from how Gilliam has felt in meetings with studio executives.The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is slated for an early 2009 release.

The harrowing tale of a deranged superfan who kidnaps her favorite author not only anticipates&nbsp;the rise of toxic fandom, but also hints at the kind of dangerous direct access that contemporary social media affords the general public. It’s also just a damn good movie. To celebrate its 30th anniversary, we&nbsp;explore how the Hitchcockian thriller predicted the fraught relationship between the content creators of today and their sometimes problematic fans.&nbsp;Keep those cockadoodie sledgehammers handy.“When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon.”When we first meet Annie Wilkes (played b Kathy Bates, who won an Oscar for her performance), she’s polite, sweet, and, dare we say it, likable. Sure, she&nbsp;has difficulty with boundaries, but she seems harmless enough and genuine in her love for the&nbsp;work of writer Paul Sheldon (James Caan). Having rescued Paul from a bad car accident during a snowstorm, she’s initially surprised to discover he’s different from what she expected, based on how his book covers described him, but she makes the most of her private audience with him to air her grievances.This disconnect between a celebrity’s public persona and private self is an all-too-common discovery in the age of social media. These days, every public entity, from pop stars and athletes to fast food companies and, ahem, movie review websites, maintains such a meticulously curated presence online – their “brand” – that breaches of protocol, even deeply human ones, risk massive controversy. Even still, it’s never been easier to contact your favorite actor, comedian, or, yes, writer; all it takes now is a Tweet, and if you’re lucky, you might get a response. This unprecedented access can lead to fun, insightful interactions, but it can just as easily breed unfettered hostility – there may not be anyone strapped to a bed, but this is about as direct as hate mail can get, and it can be pretty&nbsp;nasty.“I’m your number one fan. There is nothing to worry about.”The thing that differentiates Annie Wilkes from most other movie stalkers is that her violence and sense of entitlement are born of artistic admiration, rather than sexual attraction or murderous intent. She is dangerously unwell, of course, but her sickness manifests in a twisted devotion to Paul’s popular, Harlequin-esque series romance novels starring a character named Misery Chastain.Our first indication that she’s more than just an obsessive fan comes when she convinces Paul to let her read a draft of his latest book, an attempt to branch out from romance. To say Annie disapproves of the profanity is a gross understatement; as&nbsp;Paul calmly explains that it’s based on his own experiences, she lashes out in a bizarre&nbsp;tirade before she catches herself, but by then it’s clear something is amiss.Later,&nbsp;when Annie picks up a copy of the&nbsp;latest Misery book and&nbsp;discovers the character dies, she snaps and calls Paul a murderer. The dynamic changes as she ceases to be a caretaker and instead becomes Paul’s captor.&nbsp;She grows more violent, but she rationalizes her behavior as a byproduct of her love for Paul and the books. She kisses his cheek, apologizes, and asks him to forget anything bad has happened. When she finally admits that she’s kidnapped him, she blames Paul for everything; clearly he brought it all upon himself.Three decades later, we’ve seen a rise in fan culture taken to dangerous extremes, with cries of ruined childhoods and death threats forcing some to leave social media altogether. Like Annie, the gaslighting comes from a place of distorted love, the kind that compels her&nbsp;to “hobble” Paul with a sledgehammer when he dares to seek escape from his captivity. He has committed a grievous crime in the eyes of his “number one fan,” and he is obligated to fix it at any cost.“You’re gonna write a new novel… Now you’ll make it right.”In Annie’s mind, there is only one&nbsp;way for Paul to atone for killing Misery Chastain: Bring&nbsp;her back to life in a new book, and do it in a fashion that satisfies Annie. She knows exactly what story she wants to read, but she needs Paul to write it. Naturally, the first pages he delivers aren’t to her liking, because she remembers the novels better than anyone&nbsp;– possibly even better than Paul himself&nbsp;– and according to her, the new direction flies in the face of continuity, and she won’t stand for it.&nbsp;Her expectations are more important than the right story being told, so she throws another hysterical tantrum, and an exasperated Paul is back to square one.In real life, this admittedly isn’t a new phenomenon. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, for example, was compelled by publishers and fans to revive Sherlock Holmes over a decade after he wrote the character’s death. Nowadays, though, it’s&nbsp;exceedingly common to see people feel so entitled to a piece of media that they&nbsp;would presume to dictate how it should be done.It’s natural for fans to feel a connection to their favorite characters, and it’s frequently said&nbsp;that a creator’s work no longer belongs to them once it’s presented to the public. But it’s another thing to send death threats to Rian Johnson for his&nbsp;handling of Star Wars: The Last Jedi&nbsp;– whatever one’s opinions on the film are – and even campaign to remake the film. Just a year later, Game of Thrones viewers&nbsp;were so incensed&nbsp;at the series’ final season that they petitioned HBO to spend millions of dollars to remake it as well. After a massive fan outcry, Paramount Pictures literally went back to the drawing board and redesigned the title character in&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog, effectively delaying the release of the film by four months.&nbsp;Next September, HBO Max will premiere&nbsp;Zack Snyder’s Justice League, a recut, partially reshot, serialized version of the 2017 DC superhero film closer to the director’s vision, thanks in large part to another fan petition after the original production suffered multiple setbacks and a poor reception. This is, in other words, not a trend on the downswing.“I put two bullets in my gun. One for you and one for me.”Stephen King originally intended to call the book “The Annie Wilkes Edition,” which gets to the heart of the story and helps explain why it’s still relevant. Annie clearly adores Misery Chastain&nbsp;– she even named her pet pig after her&nbsp;– and she just wants to do right by the character, but it’s telling that she has no plans to publish Paul’s corrective novel after he finishes it. When she realizes that the police are onto her, she plans to shoot Paul and then herself as soon as the book is ready. Paul isn’t the object of her affection; he’s merely the delivery mechanism for her personal fan fiction. Misery belongs to Annie and no one else, and Paul only matters as long as he gives Annie exactly what she wants.This doesn’t feel&nbsp;too dissimilar from some of the outrage over 2016’s&nbsp;Ghostbusters&nbsp;for going with a female cast&nbsp;(“This isn’t my Ghostbusters“) or the backlash over the diversification of the Star Wars sequel trilogy’s cast. Behind the bigotry seems to lie a fear that these franchises will somehow actively work to exclude the people complaining about it. They are the original fans, they might say, and they won’t stand to have their memories desecrated. There are certainly other legitimate criticisms to be leveled at those films (and the final season of&nbsp;Game of Thrones, and&nbsp;Justice League), but the folks making those criticisms aren’t the ones we’re talking about. Imagine all the Misery Chastain fans in Paul Sheldon’s world who were upset with the character’s death but, you know,&nbsp;didn’t kidnap him, torture him, and force him to write another book.Misery not only became a commercial and critical success, but also the only film in the prolific world of Stephen King adaptations to win an Academy Award. But beneath the fake smiles and that horrifying sledgehammer scene lies a deeper, more prescient&nbsp;indication of how terrifying it would be if an Annie Wilkes&nbsp;– much an army of Annie Wilkses – were to rise up every time a Misery Chastain meets her end.Misery&nbsp;was released in theaters on November 30, 1990.Thumbnail image by&nbsp;(c)Columbia PicturesOn an Apple device?

Pictures./Everett Collection)There is a big difference between scary kids’ movies, and kids’ movies that&nbsp;just happen to scare kids. We wrote about the latter just last month, as we explored animated movies that weren’t necessarily intended to be horror pieces, but still managed to traumatize young viewers. But the former, the kids’ movies that are actually meant to be scary, are quite a special thing. The ’80s and early ’90s gave us plenty of darker movies for kids that managed to be creepy enough to scare the young audience – and frankly, many of the adults who were sitting with them – but still provided enough wonder and entertainment&nbsp;for those kids to return to the films again and again. Just to be terrorized once more.Among these darker films, there is one that stands above the rest: the&nbsp;Nicolas Roeg&nbsp;adaptation of Roald Dahl’s The Witches. The story of an orphan and his grandmother who happen upon a convention of witches at a seaside hotel – and the beginnings of a scheme to rid the world of children – landed in U.S. theaters in August of 1990, and was immediately heralded as a groundbreaking entry in the canon of dark kids’ movies. With grotesque makeup courtesy of Jim Henson’s team, a chillingly memorable Anjelica Huston as the Grand High Witch, and Dahl’s ceaselessly dark story, it would become a VHS favorite for more adventurous children. (A remake, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway, is due in theaters in 2021.)To mark the 30th anniversary of the terrifying, hilarious, and unforgettable original, we’re going to avoid eating the soup&nbsp;and explore why this is the scariest kids’ film ever made. Period.Forget&nbsp;Scream: This is the Opening 10 Minutes That Still Keeps Us Up At Night&nbsp;Plenty of horror movies, both for kids and adults, take their sweet time getting to the good stuff. Thankfully, The Witches wastes nary a minute,&nbsp;opening with evil witches, a terrifying short story, and establishing its lore as grandma Helga (Mai Zetterling) explains to Luke (Jasen Fisher) her hatred for the story’s vicious child-killing witches and how to spot them. Right out of the gate, the film&nbsp;taps directly into the “Stranger Danger” panic of the ’80s, as Helga says,&nbsp;“You can never be sure if it’s a witch you are looking at or a kind lady.”Then shit gets&nbsp;really&nbsp;creepy.As Helga explains how to spot a witch – no toes, purple tinge to their eyes – she tells the story of how her childhood friend Erica became a victim to the witch that lived next door. The way the film frames Erica’s disappearing in&nbsp;a laneway, kidnapped by the friendly neighbor, is enough to send chills down both kids’ and adults’ spines. But then&nbsp;Helga reveals that a few weeks&nbsp;after the kidnapping, she noticed a strange little girl in the painting Erica’s dad bought the day she went missing. Turns out, Erica&nbsp;is&nbsp;trapped&nbsp;within the painting, cursed to live her life in a 2-D space, growing old until one day she disappears. (Find us a ’90s kid who doesn’t remember the haunting image of Erica in that) painting.In just 10 minutes, the movie&nbsp;mixes the fantastical concept of witches with the real fear of child abduction, and shatters our view of a group that we’re&nbsp;traditionally taught to see as safe — the nice old lady across the street&nbsp;who gives you candy and pinches your cheek.Then, to cap things off, Luke’s parents die.The Director Is A Horror Genius And Doesn’t Hold Back&nbsp;Despite his reputation as a children’s author, Dahl writes plenty of disturbing imagery into his work. While many directors adapting his&nbsp;stories play down that aspect of the material&nbsp;— think&nbsp;Matilda,&nbsp;The BFG — the director of one of the best and most adult horror films ever made,&nbsp;Don’t Look Now,&nbsp;was determined to bring the cruelty and ugliness that The Witches required.Having Nicolas Roeg direct a kids’ movie certainly was an odd choice, on the surface, given the director’s reputation for thrillers with plenty of sex appeal. And yet, Roeg manages to perfectly translate the unpleasantness of the titular witches to the big screen, and create a sense of unease throughout. Watch as he uses extreme close-ups and Dutch angles to give the entire film an unsettling vibe. This is particularly effective when Huston’s Grand High Witch&nbsp;pushes a baby carriage towards a cliff’s edge and a chase to save it unfolds; the scene is already shocking by its nature, but Roeg treats it with the same seriousness as he did his nightmarish, lost-in-Venice scenes in&nbsp;Don’t Look Now, turning it into an unspeakable act of unfathomable sadism.Roeg has admitted that he accidentally let his son watch the dailies, which helped him realize what scenes were too terrifying for the final film.Roald Dahl Knew How to Exploit&nbsp;Kids’&nbsp;Worst FearsOf course, the film wouldn’t have been possible without the bizarreness and horror of Dahl’s original story. Though we mostly remember him for his classic works of children’s fiction like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,&nbsp;James and the Giant Peach, and Matilda, Dahl was not a stranger to horror. The author even hosted a pre-Twilight Zone sci-fi and horror anthology series called Way Out for CBS, and he always knew how to be scary without crossing a line, but also without ever talking down to his audience.In The Witches, Dahl explores that period in which kids start to realize the world may not be as safe or as bright as their parents made them believe. First, he does it by turning the “nice old lady” into a vicious monster, allowing Roeg to force&nbsp;us to look with suspicion at every character who enters the frame and sow distrust with every purple glint in a hotel worker’s eye. Then, Dahl pulls a reverse Willy Wonka, using the chocolate bar as a poisonous weapon that threatens to turn every kid in England into a mouse.&nbsp;In Dahl’s world, as faithfully rendered by Roeg – until the tacked-on happy ending at least – nothing is safe.Jim Henson’s Grotesque&nbsp;Witch Makeup Caused Us All Kinds Of Nightmares(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures./Everett Collection)If there is one defining image of The Witches, it’s the unmasking of Huston’s Grand High Witch as she delivers her keynote address at the convention. After the stylish woman in that lush purple-lined cape walks onto the stage to the applause of&nbsp;her adoring fellow witches, she removes her wig to reveal a bald head — which we already knew to expect thanks to Helga’s warnings. But then she goes a step further, removing her face mask to reveal a gnarly monster that seems part Skeksis, part Freddy Krueger.It’s incredible work by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop, and a far cry from either Kermit or even most of the creatures they conjured up for&nbsp;Labyrinth. The Grand High Witch is a masterpiece of horror makeup, and Henson’s team dive fully into the ugliness and gnarly-ness of the look, which reportedly took several hours to put on and then even more hours to remove.&nbsp;There is more incredible work, too, as children and witches are transformed into mice, but it’s Huston’s transformation that sticks in the memory. The moment the witch removes her face is the moment the film affirms&nbsp;what it has so far only hinted at: behind the gentle smiles hide heinous monsters&nbsp;ready to devour you.Anjelica Huston Delivers One of the Great Horror Movie PerformancesIt’s one thing to have a villain who looks the part, but The Witches only remains as memorable as it does because its villain also acts the part. Even before her nightmare-inducing transformation, Huston is an enthralling menace, vamping it up – what even&nbsp;is&nbsp;that accent – as she sashays&nbsp;flirtatiously one minute, and stares down and terrorizes the next. The Oscar-winner sells a completely different attitude than any other witch in the film. Instead of warm, gentle, and easy to approach, Huston’s Grand High Witch exudes sex appeal, talks with a cold and detached voice that shows she knows she’s more powerful than everyone in the room – she’s Miranda Priestly, with certain unsavory appetites – and then writhes with pleasure when she’s about to demonstrate her child-killing abilities.The film is constantly warning us against strangers, especially those who&nbsp;approach us with faked kindness, but Huston’s Grand High Witch doesn’t need to fake anything.&nbsp; She is a repugnant and vile monster, and yet we – and seemingly every man who encounters her in the film – are drawn to her, almost admiring her for daring to be herself: a true witch, mask on or off.The Witches&nbsp;was released in U.S. theaters on August 24, 1990. It is available to stream on Netflix, and to rent or buy on FandangoNOW, Vudu, Amazon Prime, and&nbsp;iTunes.&nbsp;#1The Witches (1990) 93%#1Adjusted Score: 95.544% Critics Consensus: With a deliciously wicked performance from Angelica Huston and imaginative puppetry by Jim Henson's creature shop, Nicolas Roeg's dark and witty movie captures the spirit of Roald Dahl's writing like few other adaptations.Synopsis: A little boy and his kindly grandmother thwart the efforts of a coven of witches to rid Britain of children...

Unfortunately, early reviews of the Amazon new release indicate the sequel borrows more than just its title from the first film, as the main complaint in the negative reviews of&nbsp;Craig Brewer’s follow-up are the movie’s recycled bits.However, a lot of the favorable takes highlight the same overly faithful familiarity as a positive, or at least a harmless fault, while celebrating the return of Prince Akeem, Semi (Arsenio Hall) and the rest of the ensemble representing Zamunda and Queens. Especially Wesley Snipes.Here’s what critics are saying about Coming 2 America:Does the sequel live up to the original?I’m pleased to report the long-awaited, much-anticipated, will-it-ever-happen, heavily hyped Coming 2 America is just as gloriously funny and wonderful and original and gold-hearted.–&nbsp;Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-TimesVirtually no one does good comedy sequels, especially decades after the fact… of all the people to finally get it right, who would’ve expected it to be Eddie Murphy?–&nbsp;Vince Mancini, UproxxA pale imitation that never comes close to the dizzying highs of the original.–&nbsp;Matt Goldberg, ColliderMan, this is supposed to be the long-awaited follow up to&nbsp;Coming to America! Why does it feel so toothless and safe?–&nbsp;Sean O’Connell, CinemaBlendWill it cater to your nostalgia?Man, is it a fun nostalgic ride to take.– Carla Renata, The Curvy Film CriticThe film will easily capitalize on the lingering nostalgic affection for one of Murphy’s most successful efforts, even if the original isn’t nearly as funny as you might remember.– Frank Scheck, Hollywood ReporterComing 2 America is cute and fun, a lovingly made exercise in nostalgia.– Kristen Baldwin, Entertainment WeeklyIt’s a sequel that’s leaning heavily on your fond memories of the first movie without daring to bring anything new to the table.– Matt Goldberg, Collider(Photo by Quantrell D. Colbert/©Amazon Studios)Are there too many references to the original?It works in plenty of odes to the original while updating it in, well, not really surprising ways, but at least they seem entirely heartfelt.– Jason Adams, PajibaComing 2 America often risks dissolving into an assemblage of reference points, but Murphy’s Akeem provides just enough pathos to fuse the narrative together.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireCraig Brewer, a superfan of Murphy and his films, doesn’t hide the joy he has for it and stuffs as much as he can in this film to prove it.– Aaron Neuwirth, We Live EntertainmentComing 2 America&nbsp;includes so many nods to its predecessor that it feels like a feature-length easter egg in search of a movie.– Frank Scheck, Hollywood ReporterSo is it just for the fans?Coming 2 America is adamantly, unabashedly one for the fans. And, judged solely by that mission, it’s a straight-up, if modest, success.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostThose who adore the original will feel like they’ve been revisited by an old friend, or perhaps the dirty uncle, whose jokes are a bit frayed but still pointed enough.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireWho’s curious to know what these folks have been up to in that span? If you count yourself as an ‘I do!’ then, well, this movie answers that question. Sometimes with terrific comedy!– Jason Adams, Pajiba(Photo by ©Amazon Studios)Do you need to have seen the original?If you haven’t seen or can’t quite recall Coming to America, the relevant background is helpfully supplied here, along with some new information.– A.O. Scott, New York TimesA lot of the jokes will land even if you haven’t seen it. That being said, you will appreciate this one so much more if you have watched the first one.– Tessa Smith, Mama’s GeekyWhere do the main problems lie?Brewer&nbsp;and the film’s three writers (Barry W. Blaustein,&nbsp;David Sheffield, and&nbsp;Kenya Barris) get so caught up in repeating what worked before that they neglect characters with the most promise and potential.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsOne of the chief problems with Coming 2 America is that it doesn’t even know who its protagonist should be.– Matt Goldberg, ColliderIs it funny?If you are a fan of the first one, there are numerous callbacks that should have you laughing until your sides hurt.– Tessa Smith, Mama’s GeekyIt delivers several genuine laughs, even if it never achieves the comedic excellence of its predecessor.– Kristen Baldwin, Entertainment WeeklyIt didn’t always make me laugh (though I laughed plenty), but it always made me smile.– Vince Mancini, UproxxWith no strong characters and a muddled plot, it’s no surprise that most of the jokes in Coming 2 America&nbsp;fail to land.– Matt Goldberg, Collider(Photo by Quantrell D. Colbert/©Amazon Studios)Does it veer into musical territory?From time to time, Coming 2 America stirs to life, especially when it goes full-on musical pageant.– Justin Chang, Los Angeles TimesThere are more dance numbers than the first one, and they were some of my favorite scenes.– Tessa Smith, Mama’s GeekyIt’s a winning, maximalist musical extravaganza.– Vince Mancini, UproxxHow is Eddie Murphy?Brash, lovable, and doused in irony at every turn, his outsized persona remains a singular figure in American comedy, evidently still capable of dominating the screen.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireThe biggest letdown is seeing Murphy deliver such a generic, lifeless character after both the original film and his wildly charismatic and energetic performance in Brewer’s&nbsp;Dolemite Is My Name.– Rob Hunter, Film School RejectsAnd the newcomers?While [Jermaine] Fowler proves an appealing comic actor, he’s unable to bring much vibrancy to the formulaic goings-on.– Frank Scheck, Hollywood ReporterLeslie Jones as Lavelle’s mother, Mary, and Tracy Morgan as his uncle, Reem, and they’re both as flat-out funny as you’d expect them to be.– Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-TimesLeslie Jones is reliably hilarious.– Anna Menta, DeciderThis movie provides further testimony to the absolute comic genius of Wesley Snipes.– A.O. Scott, New York TimesWesley Snipes has never given such a riotous kind of deadpan performance.– Eric Kohn, IndieWire(Photo by Quantrell D. Colbert/©Amazon Studios)Are there any notable cameos?The arrival of a certain famous baritone voice, who narrates a very ridiculous funeral, shows just how much the movie has invested in its jokey internal logic.– Eric Kohn, IndieWireMuch of the film’s fun stems from the celebrity cameos — including Morgan Freeman amusingly sending up his godlike narrator image and Trevor Noah as a “ZNN” anchor.– Frank Scheck, Hollywood ReporterIs it more contemporary in its treatment of women characters?What I most appreciate about this sequel is the women of Zamunda are self sufficient, strong-willed, strong-minded and not reliant upon the approval of a man to be their own person.– Carla Renata, The Curvy Film CriticThe film’s feminism – which sees the girls doing some fighting and not much else – feels tacked on.– Emma Simmonds, The ListLike the first movie, albeit to a less leering extent, this one wants to have its cake and eat it too when it comes to objectifying women.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostHow are Ruth E. Carter’s costumes?Perhaps the biggest star of the film isn’t an on-screen player but its costume designer Ruth Carter, who has gone all out in creating an Afrocentric aesthetic that bursts with richly hued fabrics, lush textures and gleaming metallics.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostThe various royal garments give this film interesting ways to build off the characters and a wide array of colors to constantly work with, which shines just as brightly as the many happy faces seen throughout.– Aaron Neuwirth, We Live EntertainmentI’m not exaggerating when I say that costume designer Ruth E. Carter deserves an(other) Oscar.– Vince Mancini, UproxxShe could win another [Oscar] just for General Izzi’s warlord couture.– A.O. Scott, New York Times(Photo by ©Amazon Studios)Is Coming 2 America ultimately worth streaming at home?It’s good at what it sets out to do. Which makes it great fun.– Ann Hornaday, Washington PostIt’s the kind of comedy with a “repeatability factor” that will have you making plans to see it again before the closing credits even finish rolling.– Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-TimesPerhaps some of this movie’s jokes would kill on the big screen rather than simply expiring as they did on my laptop.– Justin Chang, Los Angeles TimesIf&nbsp;Coming 2 America&nbsp;had released in theaters, or on-demand for $19.99, I’m not sure it’d be worth it. But since it’s streaming free on Prime, and since you probably already have a subscription… Sure!– Anna Menta, DeciderComing 2 America&nbsp;premieres on Amazon Prime&nbsp;on March 5, 2021.On an Apple device?

And he’s got a big name in Chinese cinema in his posse.MonkeyPeaches.com is reporting that not only is Spielberg interested, but that he would do his \"Journey to the West\" in tandem with Chinese director Zhang Yimou (\"Hero,\" \"House of Flying Daggers\"). The news comes from Chinese producer and Yimou pal Zhang Weiping, who told Sina.com that the two renowned directors \"agreed to make a movie together and this movie would probably be based on Classic Chinese fantasy novel Journey to the West.\"Jet and Jackie: Looks like you’ve got companyIs Weiping a credible source? He’s produced six of Yimou’s last projects, including the now-filming \"Curse of the Golden Flower,\" which stars Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li, and has already been picked up by U.S. distributor Sony Pictures Classics. Oh, and by the way, Weiping has stated that he and Yimou are already gunning to win Best Foreign Film at the next Oscars with \"Flower.\"While the Spielberg-Yimou collaboration has yet to begin, both directors are apparently set to produce the 2008 Olympics ceremonies in Beijing. A Zhang Ziyi – Jackie Chan rematch? A Gong Li – Jet Li showdown?And who might join the pair in a \"Journey to the West?\" A smart bet might be on Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who was discovered in Yimou’s \"The Road Home\" (1999) and appeared later in both \"Hero\" and \"House of Flying Daggers\" for the director. Ziyi also starred in the Spielberg-produced \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and is arguably the most recognizable Asian actress in Hollywood — a key casting move if the Spielberg-Yimou project aims for American audiences.Another frequent Yimou collaborator is Gong Li (\"Ju Dou,\" \"Raise the Red Lantern,\") who also appeared in \"Memoirs\" and widened her Hollywood exposure with this summer’s \"Miami Vice.\"Which begs the question: who is the powerhouse team in this American-Chinese folk-legend adaptation face-off?

Yet when it comes to movies, only horror films seem to consistently warrant the anthology treatment. Oh, sure you’ll find a few comedic anthologies like New York Stories, The Ten, and the cult classics Kentucky Fried Movie and Amazon Women on the Moon. But for the most part the “cinematic omnibus” is the domain of the scary storytellers, and genre fans certainly seem to enjoy the format – doubly so when one or two of the terror tales stand out as something truly special.With that in mind, we’ve cooked up a sort of Frankenstein’s Monster of horror anthologies; a collection of the best segments from much-loved horror compendiums, curated scream-by-scream and featuring established classics along with more recent frights. We’ve created this list partly because IFC Midnight’s kick-ass import Ghost Stories is about to hit theater screens and VOD —&nbsp;trust us, it’s great, and currently sits at 88% on the Tomatometer —&nbsp;but also because, well, there’s just something very appealing about scary-AF short stories.So enjoy this massive anthology menu composed of the best of the best horror anthology segments. And, yes, we had enough left over for a Volume 2.“The Ventriloquist’s Dummy” from Dead of Night (1945)Arguably the Casablanca of horror anthology films, Dead of Night showcases a strong handful of creepy and darkly amusing tales, but it’s probably best remembered for its masterful story about a ventriloquist who is convinced that his dummy is not only alive but incredibly malicious. Fans of flicks like Magic (1978) and Dead Silence (2007) will certainly enjoy this mini-movie.“The Telephone” from Black Sabbath (1963)Mario Bava kicks of his celebrated anthology with a simple yet enjoyably twisty tale of two women, a mysterious phone caller, and a stalker who may or may not actually exist.“Frozen Fear” from Asylum (1972)Amicus Productions released seven anthology horror films between 1965 and 1974 (most of them quite entertaining), but this is the one my parents rented as a kid, and it scared the living hell out of me – particularly this simple story of murder, voodoo, and a bunch of dismembered body parts. The stories in this anthology get weirder as the film progresses, and then, of course, it all ends on a nifty little twist. If you enjoy this one, check out Dr. Terror’s House of Horrors (1965), Tales from the Crypt (1972), and Vault of Horror (1973).“Amelia” from Trilogy of Terror (1975)The first two stories in this TV movie –&nbsp; based on the works of the great Richard Matheson – are passable, if a bit forgettable, but the third tale absolutely terrified an entire generation. Basically, a woman gets attacked, chased, and terrorized by what’s referred to as a “Zuni fetish doll,” and if you thought Chucky was a nasty plaything, wait until you get a load of this tiny monster.“The Crate” from Creepshow (1982)(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)The collaboration between Stephen King and George Romero would, not surprisingly, lead to one of the finest horror anthologies of all time, but if we’re picking the best of this fantastic crop, we’re going with this story about a ravenous crate-bound monster who leaps out and devours anyone who gets too close. It’s a wonderful blend of jolts, dark comedy, and gruesome bits of gore.“Nightmare at 20,000 Feet” from Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)This uneven adaptation features at least two fantastic tales: Joe Dante’s “It’s a Good Life,” about a spoiled kid who has godlike powers, and this simple story of a man, an airplane, and a horrible monster that nobody else can see. William Shatner played the troubled passenger in the original Twlight Zone episode, but here he’s played by the great John Lithgow.“Quitter’s Inc.” from Cat’s Eye (1985)On the whole, this King-penned anthology is a fairly slight affair, but it does feature a cat (which I love) and it does have a segment in which the ever-sleazy James Woods is stalked by the employees of a very ominous anti-smoking group. We mainly included this one for the cat.“The Raft” from Creepshow 2 (1987)This sequel may lack the polish, cast, and budget of its predecessor, but it does deliver at least one very memorable tale. It’s a simple story about a bunch of horny teenagers who find themselves trapped on a raft when a giant slimy… something surrounds them. The rest of the story is just a bunch of shocks, gore, and random devourings. Fun stuff.“Cat from Hell” from Tales from the Darkside: The Movie (1990)George Romero adapts a Stephen King story, which makes this a Creepshow reunion of sorts. The story follows an old man who hires an “exterminator” because he is convinced his kitty cat is a ruthless killer… and let’s just say it: he’s right.“Boys Do Get Bruised” from Tales from the Hood (1995)(Photo by Savoy Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)A kind of darker take on the “magical kid” story from the Twilight Zone movie, this one’s about a boy who can seemingly injure people by destroying pictures of them. His abusive stepfather is about to discover this dark power.“Dumplings” from Three… Extremes (2004)A vain woman desperately wants to cling to her youth, so she acquires some very suspect “dumplings” from a mysterious old lady. And things get very ugly from there. There’s also a feature-length version of this disturbing story from the same director. Neither are for the faint of heart.“The School Bus Massacre” from Trick ’r Treat (2007)In some anthologies, the best chapters jump straight out at you. In the case of the fan favorite Trick ‘r Treat, it is a very tough call to just pick one. This short earns the nod for being both legitimately disturbing and creepily amusing – like an old horror comic. It’s about a bunch of kids who tell a campfire tale to play a prank, but, of course, things backfire in the most ironic fashion.“10/31/98” from V/H/S (2012)Three guys show up to the wrong house, expecting a Halloween party but stumbling across some freaky occult rites, and then do all they can to get the hell out while the cult members (and the house itself) start freaking out in highly unexpected ways. Not much in the story department here, true, but there’s a lot of clever filmmaking going on.“Safe Haven” from V/H/S/2&nbsp;(2013)(Photo by Magnolia Pictures)This miniature masterpiece may just be the finest “found footage” horror movie you’ll ever see. It begins as an investigation into a creepy Indonesian cult and quickly devolves into a nightmare that feels like a cross between Clive Barker and H.P. Lovecraft.“Easter” from Holidays (2016)This twisted little tale is light on plot, but makes up for it by tapping deeply into the fear of being little and seeing a creature that should be really cute… but really isn’t. Plus, let’s be honest: The Easter Bunny is only slightly less disturbing than clowns and ventriloquist dummies.“The Way In” and “The Way Out” from&nbsp;Southbound (2016)No good horror anthology is complete without a fitting “wrap-around” segment that ties all the short stories together, and this great indie flick has a very creepy one indeed. It’s about two guys who are being chased across the desert by some freaky floating creatures, and it’s pretty nifty how this prologue and epilogue manage to add an extra layer of eerie fun to an already very impressive collection.Ghost Stories opens this week in limited release and on VOD.

He was 73.Gibson received his first big film break in 1963’s The Nutty Professor, but his first major role came courtesy of his three-year stint as part of the cast of Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In, where he developed the popular recurring character of a Nehru-garbed poet. After Laugh-In, Gibson appeared in a long list of films, becoming a favorite of director Robert Altman, who used him in four films: The Long Goodbye, A Perfect Couple, Health, and Nashville (Gibson earned a Golden Globe nomination for his work in the latter).Though he never became a household name, Gibson’s face was one of the more recognizable in Hollywood, partly due to his sheer ubiquity, and partly due to his distinctive style. Some of his better-known film roles include the head of the Illinois Nazis in The Blues Brothers, the villainous Werner in The ‘Burbs, and the perpetually befuddled Father O’Neil in The Wedding Crashers — but he also worked on Broadway, appearing with Walter Matthau and Ruth Gordon in Lillian Hellman’s My Mother, My Father and Me, did voice work (including the part of Wilbur the pig in 1973’s Charlotte’s Web), and was a regular fixture on television, securing a five-season run on Boston Legal and a recurring character on King of the Hill. (Visit his filmography for a more complete list of credits.)Gibson, who passed away at home in Malibu, is survived by three children and two grandchildren.Click here for Gibson’s complete filmography.Source: The Hollywood Reporter","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"actors, halloween, vampires, TCM, DC, Us, movies, Winter, foreign, Academy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"henry-gibson-19352009"},{"id":"47614367276020","title":"5 Ways Rick and Morty‘s Darkest Season Just Got Darker","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Ways Rick and Morty's Darkest Season Just Got DarkerMorty and Summer kill people, the wind has words for Jerry, and the world can't wait for Pickle Rick!by Fred Topel | August 2, 2017 |  CommentsRick promised, threatened really, that season 3 of Rick and Morty&nbsp;would be the darkest year of their adventures yet. This week’s episode proved Rick could be right. “Rickmancing the Stone” was a spoof of the Mad Max movies, including the Oscar-winning hit Fury Road and the less celebrated Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.Summer (Spencer Grammer) and Morty (Justin Roiland) joined Rick (also Roiland) in a dimension that was a post-apocalyptic hellscape, pursued by a high-octane caravan. Mad Max fans surely recognized Immortan Joe and Wez. Rick was going to leave until he spotted the marauders’ big green gem, so he let the family distract them while he made off with the stoneful of Isotope 322.Here are five ways season 3 of Rick and Morty just got darker. At least this’ll tide fans over until next week’s epic “Pickle Rick” episode!1. MORTY GOT ’ROID RAGEMorty this entire episode #RickandMorty pic.twitter.com/HYequHoAkE— sofia (@remedykarlie) July 31, 2017When Morty fought in the Thunderdome (they call it the “Blood Dome,” you know, for legal reasons), Rick gave him a strength injection that would help him fend off combatants. It only made is left arm bulk up, but it was enough to make Morty the champion of Blood Dome. Morty got to work out his rage at his father, Jerry (Chris Parnell), for giving up on his family and separating from Beth (Sarah Chalke).2. SUMMER STRAIGHT UP KILLED PEOPLEThe divorce also made Summer violent. Faced with the post-apocalyptic mob, Summer didn’t hesitate to kill the leader, making her the alpha. She seemed at home having an army at her command and dating Hemorrhage, a Lord Humongous type — at least, until her relationship with Hemorrhage became as mundane as Beth and Jerry’s.3. EVEN THE WIND HATES JERRYThought it couldn’t get worse for Jerry? He’s separated from Beth, living in an apartment next to a corner frequented by hookers. But when he’s all alone and the wind blows, you can hear it whisper “loser.”The wind just whispered \"loooooser\" and now I woke my parents up from laughing too hard. #RickandMorty— Kyler Clodfelter Art (@KylerClodfelter) July 31, 2017With Jerry gone, expect to see different characters pair off this season.“Typically most of Beth’s stuff often in the first season was with Jerry at home,” Chalke told Rotten Tomatoes before the season began. “Then in season 2 they get to go off planet, and then in season 3&nbsp;they really start to pair everybody off. There’s more opportunity to go into those relationships which has been really cool.”4. THE WORLD STILL CARES MORE ABOUT SZECHUAN SAUCE THAN REAL ISSUESJustin Roiland put one of his obsessions in the season premiere script. His nostalgia for McDonalds’ 1998 Mulan Szechuan McNugget sauce got deeper and deeper since it aired on April 1. People on eBay were selling photos of a sauce packet or in one case an actual sauce packet recovered from a car. It seemed the only way to quell this obsession was for McDonald’s to deliver the sauce. So they did.McDonalds literally sent us a bottle of the Mulan sauce with a Rick &amp; Morty label. This is insane. https://t.co/7kee9VJ5ux— Rick (((and Morty))) (@RickandMorty) July 30, 2017Roiland missed his chance to stockpile Szechuan Sauce in 1998. If he had, he might’ve blown through it all by Y2K. Now he’s got a fresh jug.“I missed the window,” Roiland told Rotten Tomatoes. “I was going to get a big case of it from my friend Angel who worked at McDonalds at the time and I slept on that. I was a few days too late. He’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s gone, man. I was going to get you a case.’ I don’t know if I would’ve eaten it all by now.”Holy shit. pic.twitter.com/vNEIfHTmNU— Justin Roiland (@JustinRoiland) July 30, 2017An obsession became reality, and that may drive down the market for $14,000 packets sold on ebay. Co-creator Dan Harmon kept it real, lamenting that while people are getting rich off a Chicken McNugget sauce, there are kids who can’t afford school books.“There’s an inner city schoolkid reading that,” Harmon said. “[He’s] like, ’14 grand for Szechuan sauce. OK, I’m going to go back down into the subway and bang a bucket for change so I can have a science book.’”5. DISBELIEF IS AUTOMATICALLY 10&nbsp;PERCENT MORE SUSPENDED IN 2017Fans always gave the animated sci-fi comedy a lot of leeway for far-fetched ideas, but airing in 2017 makes it all seem a little less crazy. Just look at the excitement for Sunday’s “Pickle Rick” episode. Rick turned himself into a pickle and no one questions this! To be fair, “Pickle Rick” is incredible, and debuted at Comic-Con 2016, but Harmon thinks the election made everything weirder.“Regardless of your politics, the election lowered the need for suspense of disbelief by 10 percent,” Harmon said. “Something changed that makes it now more feasible that this guy just turns out to be a time traveler or a giant cockroach or something. The answer is because frankly the national psyche had a tectonic shift of what’s possible, because we thought we understood how the world worked and we got rocked a little bit.”Nothing’s changed for Rick and Morty&nbsp;season 3, but it’s coming out in a new world.“We were done before we found out anything was possible,” Harmon confirmed.Rick and Morty airs Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on Adult Swim.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"DC, Channel, The, football, OWN, and, satire, binge, toronto, medical, TV, Quiz, Election","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rick-and-morty-s-darkest-season-just-got-darker"},{"id":"47614360509424","title":"On DVD This Week: Homeland Season Four, Age of Adaline, Gotham Season One, And More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Homeland Season Four, Age of Adaline, Gotham Season One, And Moreby Ryan Fujitani | September 7, 2015 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got the most recent season of one of Showtime’s biggest hit series, as well as several other popular shows like Supernatural, Gotham, and Brookly Nine-Nine, and a few indie films, including a fantastical drama starring Blake Lively.

Writing exclusively for RT, director Tom Shankland presents the first gallery of Matt Nettheim’s stills from the set and takes us in to the twisted depths of his mind…Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:Making The Children was simultaneously the most exciting and the most terrifying thing I’ve ever done. Kids? Snow? A cat? To say nothing of the fact that I would have to make the audience to root for parents to kill their own kids. I’m not sure I’ll be getting a call from Disney all that soon…There were a lot of people begging me not to make it, but I always had a hunch it could be a fantastic horror film if I could pull it off. Paul Andrew Williams wrote the first draft (which he called Miria – an anagram for a certain horror director, I wonder?) and very generously let me do my thing with it.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:The idea of a story in which a lethal virus unleashes all the suppressed aggression that children feel against their doting, confused parents was just too appealing to me. Adults’ fear of children is actually a psychological condition called paedophobia and it haunts great films like The Exorcist, The Omen and The Innocents. This was the primal fear that I wanted to stoke up with The Children. Or maybe it was just revenge on my parent-friends for letting their kids run riot on various holidays and do grievous harm to my hangovers in the process…When I’m thinking about a film – particularly a horror film – I need to feel that there’s a theme in the material that can churn up some primal fears both in the audience and me. The idea that our kids might actually be psychopathic monsters and not the cute, defenceless little angels we wish they were is probably a universal fear.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:When ‘the monster’ in your film is a six-year-old kid, the visual approach has to be very different than a story where the menace is a seven-foot tall, leather-faced guy with a chainsaw. Upfront physical aggression from a kid is never going to be that scary – the audience can always imagine that in a straight physical contest, the adult will always win out. It might be disturbing to see a child thrash and flail around (I love the fits in The Exorcist and the fight scene in the car on the way to church in The Omen) but direct aggression from a normal child is never going to seem like a lethal threat to an adult. I didn’t want the kids in the film to have special powers or superhuman strengths. They would always look and sound like the little the innocent darlings their parents loved.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:The scares in a film about kids come more from their creepy behaviour, the adults’ blindness to their malevolence, and from as many ‘that’s so wrong’ images as you can load in. It’s all about messing with the audience’s idealised notions about childhood. Just associating children with images and artefacts of violence and blood disturbs us because instinctively we want to protect them from these things. We find it almost impossible to deal with the idea that they might be relishing or, even worse, causing that violence. More ‘psychological horror’ than full-blown ‘slasher’.Half the battle was finding children with the most interesting faces – faces that gazed out at you with a mesmerising ambiguity. Are they cute? Are they malevolent?Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:Casting The Children really was like The X-Factor. We saw hundreds and hundreds of kids and ultimately found four amazing new talents. William, Raffy, Eva and Jake had done pretty-much nothing before this film. They weren’t necessarily the most ‘dramatic’ kids in the auditions but when you watched the audition tapes back their faces had that exact stillness and ambiguity that I wanted. This ambiguity about children is the thing that haunts Jack Clayton‘s The Innocents – which is such a wonderful and very influential ghost story. Are the children possessed or just precocious and sweet? Ultimately this ambiguity drives poor Deborah Kerr insane.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:Every good horror film needs to break a few taboos. Hopefully there are a few ‘Oh my God, they can’t do that,’ moments in the film. Paul Hyett, our prosthetics designer, was great at suggesting ways I could achieve the more shocking, transgressive moments in the film. He built a life-size, fully operational dummy of Paulie/William (above) for us to throw around at leisure. When we tested the film, there is a particular moment in a greenhouse that caused the whole audience to recoil. There’s nothing like being with an audience who are all thinking the same horrified thought.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:Having just done my first film, WAZ, as a dark, gritty thriller, I wanted The Children to look and sound very different. When it comes to style I think each story needs its own visual language to express the themes and emotions in it. When I start working with a DP and designer on a film, the easiest way to develop a shorthand for discussing your ideas is to watch lots of films and look at lots of pictures.Nanu Segal is an amazing DP who I knew from the National Film and Television School where, amongst other things, she shot some very lyrical films about children. The combination of a creepily lyrical approach to shooting the kids combined with great suspense was exactly what I wanted for the look of The Children. Nanu was perfect for this.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:I thought The Children should look a bit like how a child would imagine a perfect Christmas/New Year. Snow, twinkly lights and so on. Suzie Davies, the designer, thought we should use lots of primary colours. If a child draws a picture of a pretty house in the woods, they’ll always choose the brightest colours in the paint-box. Suzie also made sure that ‘the weapons’ in the film would be very colourful – so the kids would naturally gravitate towards them.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:The snow works brilliantly as a frame for this colourful approach to the film. It makes the compositions so much stronger and more graphic. It also invites you to explore interesting angles and ways of telling the story. There’s a crane shot in the film that takes full advantage of the tell-tale clues that blood-trails can leave in the snow. Snow, of course, is a great visual metaphor for our attitude to childhood in a way – a shroud of purity over a mysterious, darker inner world. We were amazingly lucky with the weather and fabulous location. Bright blue skies, snowy fields – a perfect child’s Christmas.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:We followed the colour rule through into the costumes. Our designer, Andrew Cox dressed the kids in strong colours and the adults in more muted ones. Casey (Hannah Tointon – above), the teenager, is stranded between the two worlds. Darker colours shot through with purple and blues. Her hair is fantastic – I loved Jacqui Fowler’s idea for the purple streak. I’d have one myself if I had the hair for it. Apart from looking great, the costume, hair and make-up tell a story about each character that goes beyond what the script suggests. The colours of the costumes of the kids become more saturated as the film goes on and the sickness takes a stronger hold on them.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:The way the kids lure and trap the adults in The Children is by manipulating the parents’ fears and, of course, their love. The idea that children might use their parents’ love as a weapon against them seemed wonderfully twisted to me. Their MO would be about using their cries and whimpers and their innocent eyes to entrap the parents. The creepy-cute sounds of their toys would also be a useful luring device – sort-of like Hansel and Gretel in reverse. Only when the adults are totally disabled by their instinctive desire to protect the kids, is it the right moment to strike.The aggression in the film evolves organically from the children’s obsessions with things like the effect of impact or ‘where do babies come from?’ There is often a violent subtext in kids’ games that would be terrifying if it was let loose in real life. The murders in the film are all related to the childhood in some way.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:This was probably the most fun shoot I’ve ever experienced. That had a lot to do with the kids. They were amazing to work with and made the film set a lot calmer and more entertaining than it can sometimes be. I always wanted them (and their parents) to feel positive and comfortable about this as an experience. Before filming, we took the kids to Paul Hyett’s workshop to get them used to the gory stuff. (A warehouse full of exploding heads and severed prosthetic limbs – what’s not to like?) After a little coaxing, Raffy, who plays Leah, was pretty happy to stab a fake head in the eye.After a morning of fun ultra-violence we all went bowling with their screen parents to get them feeling happy with their pretend mums and dads. I realise now that in some ways we were acting out the theme of the film by trying to keep the youngest kids ignorant of the darkest details of the story – I presented everything to them as a fun game. But the kids had a spy – Eva, the oldest, who plays Miranda – who had managed to sneak a read of the script. I don’t know why we were worried. The kids were delighted by the idea killing lots of grown-ups. If anything, they were most looking forward to the violent scenes.Click here for a full versionTom Shankland:There are a few films I love watching before I start any project, just to get me ‘in the zone’ of how you can tell a story in cinema. One of them is Vertigo. I always go back to Hitchcock because he demonstrates better than any director that when you abandon a certain level of realism, you can really exploit the full potential of the cinema.For The Children, the specific Hitchcock film I thought about a lot was The Birds. I love how the menace of the birds builds gradually on the edge of the human drama. I love the use of sound and how nothing is really explained. Although, The Children is, in some ways, a virus story, I never wanted the adults to really understand or get a handle on it. They would only have their own emotions and preconceptions to fall back on when the horror kicks in.Click here for a full versionThe Children is due for release in the UK on December 5th. Other territories are to be announced.

By setting Cruella&nbsp;amid London’s 1970s punk scene.But since the word “Disney” doesn’t naturally conjure images of leather pants, spiked hair, and all the black eyeliner one could find at Boots, we asked the film’s production designer Fiona Crombie, costume designer Jenny Beavan, and hair and makeup designer Nadia Stacey to explain how to do a Mickey Mouse-approved version of punk rock.[Warning: Mild spoilers below.]Born for This Job(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)At the beginning of the film, a tween Cruella –&nbsp;originally known as Estella and played by Tipper Seifert-Cleveland – has a knack for clothing design. She even finds ways to add personality to her school uniform, be it accessorizing it with an oversized hat, bedazzling the blazer, or wearing the necktie as a bow – things that would match the personality of a girl born to get attention thanks to her half white and half black hair.Costume designer Beavan says that these designs weren’t meant to be perfect; Estella is just learning her craft, but it’s meant to be obvious that “she’s creative with clothing.” As Estella gets older and finds a job working for Emma Thompson’s well-regarded fashion designer, Baroness von Hellman, Beavan says the character “slowly hems and refines that look.”A Formidable Flat(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises)Estella spends most of her childhood and young adulthood in a London squat with best friends and fellow con artists Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser). They also have two very cute dogs, neither of which are white with black spots.“There was a time when you had these enormous buildings that are quite derelict that were still the scars of the Second World War; there were big empty sections of now what’s known as completely prime real estate,” production designer Fiona Crombie says of London during the film’s period.She says it was important to the story of three kids living without parental supervision that “there’s an ingenuity to how they operate… This was their home that they were making; they knew how to survive and operate in this city.”Crombie says director Craig Gillespie also stressed how important it was “that the lair can’t be frightening” and that “it has to be a place that if you were a child, it has wonder.”The group’s squatter’s flat is made from two buildings mashed together after the wall that separates them was broken down. Horace and Jasper live in a more industrial section while Estella lives near the kitchen. Since Gillespie and cinematographer Nicolas Karakatsanis would be filming in what Crombie describes as a “very fluid” motion, she made sure that every inch of the space held something of interest.Her favorite part? “I love the fact that we have a big hole in the ground,” she laughs.Baroness’ Beauty(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)Hair and makeup artist Naomi Donne handled the designs for Thompson’s cutting, fame-obsessed Baroness von Hellman, developing the look off of hair and makeup designer Nadia Stacey’s inspiration of Elizabeth Taylor in the 1950s. There’s also some subtle white highlights in the Baroness’ hair, which Stacey says are a nod to just how similar she and Cruella are.Vintage Vantages(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)Estella also makes friend with Artie (John McCrea), the owner of an extremely well curated vintage clothing shop. This set was actually a gift shop on Portobello Road in London’s Notting Hill neighborhood, which Crombie and her crew emptied out and repurposed with new wallpaper and painting. They didn’t have to look far to fill the shelves though; they bought a lot of clothes from the real shops that are in the neighborhood.“With Artie’s shop, it was always going to be visually chaotic,” Crombie says, “because you have racks of clothes. And that’s the intention: that you feel kind of all these possibility that in that space. It feels very authentic to what’s on that street.”The Scoop on the Ace Reporter(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises)Estella’s former school chum Anita (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) grows up to be a society reporter with exclusive access to a certain up-and-coming designer. Beavan and her team found modern fabric that still gave Anita a ‘70s look and reminds that, back then, more people made their own clothes with patterns and that “we were all much cleverer at making things then.”Production designer Crombie says Anita’s drab, colorless newsroom is one of the few sets where she says “we are nailing this ‘70s vibe” with evenly spaced desks and little artwork on the walls “so that you’ve got this run of uniformity.”Making the Panther De Ville Purr(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Cruella gets her hands on a Panther De Ville luxury car that’s similar to the one the character drives in the Disney’s live-action 101 Dalmatians. The one in the new movie looks slightly different, as Crombie says they made tweaks to make it better suit her film’s aesthetic. They even altered the plot of the movie to have Cruella and her friends change the color of the car to black because it originally arrived in such a unique tone that they had to make use of it.Although she wasn’t a car person before she worked on Cruella, Crombie says she grew to love this and other vehicles in the movie because “I think they have real wit … [T]hey have real personal personality and presence in the film.”Eye See You(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises)Hair and makeup designer Stacey posted pictures of Siouxsie Sioux around her workspace as inspiration for Stone’s lead, saying now that she liked that the The Banshees lead singer’s “eye makeup had this very distinct, very square eyebrow shape.” However, her goal was to “bring in those punk elements and then blend it out, to soften it to give a beauty edge to it.”Stacey says she also “looked at any of those fashion shows that I feel do something different,” such as the ones by fashion houses Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, or John Galliano. Her goal, she says, was to “look at all these references from the past — because we are a period film — but then change it and to mix it up, to add something a bit more fresh and modern to it.”Pucker Up(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)Red is used a lot in Cruella, particularly in the clothing and makeup. However, it’s also a color that is notoriously hard to accurately capture on screen. Stacey says it was a lot of trial and error with MAC products, coupled with the fact that star Emma Stone’s skin can take heavy coloring. (Incidentally, MAC also launched a capsule makeup collection inspired by the looks in Cruella). Stacey says she knew it was essential to get it right because “we did want a kind of killer red.”Seeing Red(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises Inc.)Although Beavan researched this period in fashion to gain inspiration, all of the gowns were bespoke and were not all direct replicas of vintage designs. An example of one that was the red gown Cruella wears to crash the Baroness’ ball, which is rooted in the Charles James Tree dress from the 1950s, famous for its corseted silhouette that’s encircled with winding tulle.(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises)For the film’s take on the Tree dress, dress designer Ian Wallace had the dual task of making one version of the gown that the Baroness would have designed years ago but that, Beavan notes, “would have to have enough fabric to do something Cruella-ish,” because the younger designer reimagines the gown when she crashes the ball.Stacey says she also knew she had to make a statement with this scene because it signals the end of the era of Estella, the orphan and petty thief, to welcome in the not-to-be-deterred (and frequently criminal) mastermind, Cruella. She says she created Cruella’s mask of feathers and jewels to have a beauty element and serve the purpose of hiding her alter ego.Leather Rip(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)As Cruella continues to taunt the Baroness with more elaborate stunts and designs, she also brings in more of the street fashion and counter-culture of the 1970s. In one scene, she crashes a red carpet in leather pants with gold sequins, a fitted motorcycle jacket with pointed shoulder pads and the words “The Future” spray painted over her eyes.“It’s the first red-carpet moment and it needed to be a real punch,” Stacey says. “I had the Sex Pistols album cover [Nevermind the Bollocks] on the wall near me, and the font of the writing for the Sex Pistols is the same font that I use on the on “The Future,” and I just thought maybe I’ll just run it across the face but to airbrush it as well, almost like it’s been spray painted across their face so it’s harsh and graphic.”(Photo by Laurie Sparham/©2021 Disney Enterprises)Beavan says the exaggerated shoulders on the motorcycle jacket were because Cruella “wasn’t about doing anything normal” and “by this time, she’s really learned to make [designs] well.”It’s here, Beavan says, that there begins to be a push toward the way costume designer Anthony Powell made the character look when Close played her in 1996’s 101 Dalmatians.Spotted on the Catwalk(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises Inc.)No actual Dalmatians were harmed in the making of Cruella’s dresses – in fact, Beavan didn’t use fur of any kind. But the script did call for the nefarious lead to make her mentor-turned-enemy, the Baroness, worry that she’d murdered her dogs. So Wallace designed a black and white-patterned gown that Beavan’s textile team printed on a velvet-like fabric.“A lot of these things come out of the story; what you need and how it’s got to work,” says Beavan. “She’s obviously going to dance in it and it needed movement. And it’s really got to be spectacular and obviously, very clearly Dalmatian, because the Baroness thinks she’s killed her Dalmatians to make it.”Since the Baroness now knows that Cruella and Estella are the same person, Stacey says there was no need to hide her antiheroine behind another mask or face paint. Instead, she says she wanted to return to the “very strong punk elements” of Estella’s original eye makeup look while adding “these silver hues inside that just punch up the light in certain moments.”Not As Simple As Black and White(Photo by ©2021 Disney Enterprises)Using so much black and white can be overbearing from a design perspective because the colors contrast each other. Crombie says the trick is balancing “how dense the color is.”She says filming at the Baroness’ home, Hellman Hall, meant creating a palette that was “quite muted” and where “the level of contrast is softened out … it’s cold, but it’s not stark. So then everything can sit on top of that.”Whereas, she says designing the film’s crucial set piece of a black and white ball required “the use of gold [to] sort of diffuse it and stop it from being too stark and hard.”No Joke(r)Ryan FujitaniThe designers know there are Internet pundits comparing Cruella’s designs to that of Batman villains The Joker and Harley Quinn. All enjoy making an entrance, sometimes while wearing white face makeup, dark eye makeup, and a menacing smirk.Stacey understands why there are the comparisons, but says those characters never came up in her research.“The whole thing about punk is that it’s just such a mismatch of things,” says the hair and makeup designer. “There’s no kind of fluidity to it. It’s kind of crazy. The references are borrowed from so many different places that I didn’t really think that I was ever going to cross into anything too much.”Beavan reminds that Cruella, in one iteration or another, has “always had half and half. You know, I would say The Joker followed Cruella.”Cruella is in theaters and available on Disney+ with Premium Access on May 28, 2021.On an Apple device?

The medical doctor-turned-filmmaker was best known for writing techno-thrillers (The Andromeda Strain, Westworld, Jurassic Park) and for creating the award-winning medical drama ER, now in its 15th and final season.According to reports, Crichton died suddenly Tuesday in Los Angeles after a private battle with cancer. In a message posted to his official website, representatives of Crichton’s family released a statement, excerpted below:“While the world knew him as a great story teller that challenged our preconceived notions about the world around us — and entertained us all while doing so — his wife Sherri, daughter Taylor, family and friends knew Michael Crichton as a devoted husband, loving father and generous friend who inspired each of us to strive to see the wonders of our world through new eyes. He did this with a wry sense of humor that those who were privileged to know him personally will never forget.”Perhaps best known for writing best-selling science fiction novels like The Andromeda Strain, Congo, Sphere, Rising Sun, Jurassic Park and its sequel, The Lost World (all of which were adapted into big-budget blockbusters), Crichton also wrote original screenplays and directed his own films. His 1973 science fiction-western Westworld (90 percent on the Tomatometer), directed from his own script, remains Crichton’s best-reviewed film to date. His next two directorial efforts, 1978’s Coma (76 percent, adapted and directed from a novel by Robin Cook) and 1979’s The Great Train Robbery (78 percent, adapted and directed from his own novel), also rank among the best films written by Crichton or adapted from any of his works, ranking above films directed by the likes of Oscar-winner Robert Wise (The Andromeda Strain), Barry Levinson (Sphere), Frank Marshall (Congo), Philip Kaufman (Rising Sun), Jan de Bont (Twister), and John McTiernan (The 13th Warrior, based on his novel Eaters of the Dead).At the time of his death, two new projects based on Crichton’s works were rumored to be in development: Jurassic Park IV and Westworld, a remake to be scripted by Billy Ray (Volcano, Flightplan).Head over to Michael Crichton’s Tomatometer page for a detailed filmography and more.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"directors, fresh, films, bad, Disney, Reality, television, cults, Awards, Countdown, NYCC, show, Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"michael-crichton-passes-away-19422008"},{"id":"47614476095529","title":"\"American Gangster\" Loading Up an Explosive Cast","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"American Gangster\" Loading Up an Explosive Castby Scott Weinberg | August 22, 2006 |  CommentsI was already intrigued when I heard ‘Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Steve Zaillian,’ but Universal just keeps throwing more actors into the mix.

This week, we’re looking at Sony Pictures, and this is what we’re watching.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1174082[/tomatometer]PersepolisUnited States/Iranian relations are not at a high point these days, but it’s important to remind ourselves that life in other countries — even ones with governments hostile to ours — is always more complex than what we see in the news. Thus, there’s probably never been a better time to revisit the dazzling animated film Persepolis. Co-directed by Marjane Satrapi (based upon her autobiographical graphic novel) and Vincent Paronnaud, Persepolis tells the dramatic, poignant, and often very funny tale of a young woman coming of age during a tumultuous period in world history — the Iranian Revolution. Or heroine Marjane (voiced by Chiara Mastroianni) is a bit too rebellious for her native land, but when she’s sent by her family to study in Europe, she finds herself alienated and alone there as well. With its deceptively simple black and white animation, the Certified Fresh Persepolis is both haunting and life-affirming — and its universality is especially potent in these troubled times. The Blu-ray contains both English and French-language versions of the film, plus making-of documentaries, commentaries and a press conference from the movie’s Cannes Film Festival premiere.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1004377[/tomatometer]Close Encounters of the Third KindSteven Spielberg often recalled being woken by his father in the middle of the night to watch the skies for interstellar craft, a memory that informs Close Encounters and makes it perhaps the director’s most personal film (he also wrote the screenplay; a rare thing). This is the heady stuff of movie iconography: the mischievous UFOs dancing above desert America, the awe of the scientists that heralds the arrival of the mothership, John Williams’ otherworldly score that thrums low and eerie in the speakers. And in three-year-old Cary Guffey’s wide-eyed look of wonder as alien lights flood his house, we have what could be the definitive Spielberg moment; where childhood curiosity equals boundless possibility. Sony’s Blu-ray nicely preserves the film’s grainy, saturated look, and comes with a host of extras, including excellent retrospectives and vintage making-ofs. Best of all, you can choose from three versions of the movie: Theatrical, Special Edition and the recommended Director’s Cut.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083406[/tomatometer]Can’t Hardly Wait 10th Anniversary EditionAs one of the most iconic teen movies of the 90s, the 10th Anniversary Edition of Can’t Hardly Wait is a welcome release on Blu-ray for teen movie fans. The film stars Jennifer Love Hewitt in one of her many physical primes as high school dream girl Amanda, and Ethan Embry as the mild-mannered, hopeless romantic Preston who has carried a flame for Amanda since their first almost-encounter. After graduation, all of the students of Hunnington High’s Class of 1998 end up at the biggest party of the year (that still manages not to feel too dated ten years later) before the class collectively moves on to their next steps. The party warps everyone into an alternate universe, where nerds become studs, popular kids get brought down to earth, and the impossible becomes attainable with a 90s spin on the stereotypes that have a perpetual home in the genre. For fans of Jennifer Love Hewitt, the opportunity to see her again as Amanda Beckett in 1080P glory could be worth a viewing alone. The Blu-ray features deleted scenes, a “You Know You’re 90s If…” trivia game, and commentary from the cast, and also features original commentary from the cast ten years later for this special edition of teenage debauchery.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10007441[/tomatometer]The FallThere are some directors known for their visual flair, masters of imagery who sometimes focus so intently on the look and style of their films that some feel other aspects of those films suffer from a bit of neglect. Tarsem Singh is one such director, and though he’s only helmed two films, both have been noted for their lush, vibrant imagery. 2008’s The Fall is the most recent, and if the Dali-esque cover art fails to convey the scope and spectacle of the film, simply fast forward it to any chapter and it’ll become clear why this is one of the better choices to showcase your Blu-Ray setup. The story centers around an injured stuntman (Roy Walker, played by Lee Pace) in the days of early Hollywood who’s recuperating in a hospital and befriends a young girl named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) with a broken arm. Eventually, Roy promises to relate portions of a sweeping, epic adventure to Alexandria in exchange for stolen morphine, and the film changes settings seamlessly between the hospital and the exotic lands of Roy’s story. The film itself is a bit disjointed and episodic, managing to earn a marginally Fresh rating at 60%, but the cinematography and colorful images are gorgeous in high definition. The Blu-Ray edition features commentaries, a making-of documentary, deleted scenes, and a still gallery, and all look fantastic in hi-def.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000287[/tomatometer]The Adventures of Baron MunchausenBefore you see Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, you’d do well to revisit this. Both are tales of ageing fantasists withering in an era where science and bureaucracy have suffocated the imagination, and both are as close to the experience of “unfiltered” Gilliam as you can get – rich with dazzling visuals, exaggerated theatricality, and the sense that the film itself is unfurling as its protagonist’s stream of consciousness. Munchausen has John Neville as the Baron who sets sail in a balloon to disprove his detractors, with Eric Idle and a pint-sized Sarah Polley tagging along in his trip to the moon, the sea, and an underworld where they find Uma Thurman as the Venus de Milo. Though a notorious flop on its release, this is essential for any fan of the director, representing the “old age” part of his loose trilogy with Time Bandits (childhood) and Brazil (middle-age). The Blu-ray boasts a commentary from a typically humorous Gilliam and a comprehensive documentary The Madness and Misadventure of Munchausen, which goes into depth about the production difficulties that plagued the film.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1196480[/tomatometer]The House BunnyAnna Faris takes on one of her most charismatic roles as Shelley, the lovable and carefree Playboy Playmate turned sorority house mom in The House Bunny. After being removed from the Playboy Mansion by a scheming rival on her 27th birthday, a broken down station wagon and fate lead Shelley to the misfit sorority house of Zeta Alpha Zeta, the lowest house on the Greek hierarchy, filled with girls lacking the knowhow and confidence to make other friends, let alone meet guys on campus. After seeing that Shelley can raise the house’s standing, the girls accept Shelley as their house mom and she begins transforming the girls that nobody saw into the girls that everyone wants to know. For fans of Faris, the special features are largely focused on her. However, there are also other cast shorts, including features with American Idol runner-up turned actress Katharine McPhee, and everywhere girls Emma Stone and Kat Dennings, along with ten deleted scenes filled with Shelly’s unique brand of comedy that unfortunately are only included in standard definition. While The House Bunny is far from being a cinematic classic, its lighthearted humor brought to life through Faris’ comedic timing make it a harmless, fun escape.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1078122[/tomatometer]Air Force OneIt’s hard to imagine a movie like Air Force One being made these days and making it to theaters. Not that the movie’s violent or its concept too sensationalistic (the President of the United States of America taking his plane back from Russian radicals is more ridiculous than controversial). The movie was the last of a kind: an unfussy action flick, free of any deep context, hyperkinetic camerawork, or reflexive nods to its own simplicity. Movies like these have been going straight to DVD because audiences are probably too sophisticated now to let them make any money in theaters, which is too bad because we might be losing our ability to appreciate when genre movies (such as Air Force One) become elevated by uncommonly good acting, editing, and plotting.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1185718[/tomatometer]Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox StoryThe biopic — and especially the pop star biopic — was certainly ripe for parody when Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story hit theaters. Let’s face it: despite their considerable strengths, recent rock biopics like Ray and Walk the Line still adhered closely to the Hollywood playbook. Walk Hard skews those conventions with a deft combination of gleeful abandon and undeniable affection. John C. Reilly is Dewey Cox, whose wild career takes him from rockabilly stardom to folk rock belligerence to inane psychedelic experimentation. Along the way, he meets suck rock luminaries as Elvis (played by Jack White), Paul McCartney (played by Jack Black), and the Ghostface Killa (played by himself). The Blu-ray comes loaded with special features, including several mockumentaries, deleted scenes, commentaries, recording sessions, and a fake sausage commercial.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1188393[/tomatometer]Pineapple ExpressFor a movie about smoking marijuana, there’s surprisingly little of the dirty deed in the Pineapple Express (most of it is frontloaded in the movie’s first act). The movie is more a comedy about marijuana that gradually turns into an action movie, and the jarring, unrepentant shift in tone gives Pineapple Express its “random” quality virtually requisite for stoner movies. Pineapple is a gangly beast, alternately breezy and intense that is surprisingly quite fetching on Blu-ray; director David Gordon Green’s longtime cinematographer Tim Orr gives the movie a piercing, dreamy look. On Blu-ray, it gives new meaning to “high” definition.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1169391[/tomatometer]PaprikaStateside audiences may not be familiar with the work of accomplished Japanese animation director Satoshi Kon (Tokyo Godfathers, Millennium Actress), but his films are striking in their visual presentation as well as the content and themes he explores in them. 2007’s Paprika, a surreal, mindbending sci-fi murder mystery in which the worlds of dreams and reality blend into each other, is no exception. The title character is the alter ego of Dr. Atsuko Chiba, a psychotherapist who counsels patients subconsciously by inserting herself, as Paprika, into their dreams via a revolutionary piece of technology known as the DC Mini. When Atsuko discovers that one of the DC MINI developers DC Mini has gone missing along with his prototype model, and when the images from people’s dreams suddenly begin manifesting in the real world, she (with Paprika) sets out to discover the truth behind it all. The film is a stunning piece of animation, utilizing exquisite artwork and a beautiful palette of colors, and the Blu-Ray transfer offers a more sharpened look at Paprika‘s world. There are a slew of great special features here, so you’ll be ensured of hours of immersion.

But while there is much to admire here, the film, screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, lacks the visceral impact to really work as a whole.The story begins with Damien (Cillian Murphy, excellent as always) preparing to go to medical school in London when a friend is killed by the British for mouthing off. He decides to stay and join his brother Teddy (Pádraic Delaney) and a group of friends in an armed rebellion. The occupying forces hold the Irish in utter contempt (Roger Allam, the fascist TV commentator in \"V For Vendetta\" and effectively nasty here as a British official, refers to the Emerald Isle as a \"priest-infested backwater\").Director Ken Loach has an excellent eye for period detail, and the film has a wonderful sense of the bonds (and fissures) within the community. Damien’s romance with the politically sympathetic Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald) is poignant and uncertain. \"Wind\" also bristles with the vagaries of about the political and social situation. An attempt to start an independent court devolves into an ideological shouting match in its first session, and the fledgling soldiers must deal with the repercussions of going into battle with family and friends; in some cases, their actions are as ignoble as those they claim to be against. And the breathtaking green vistas, the battleground for this guerilla war, are beautiful and ominous in equal measure.And yet, in the end, there’s something missing from \"Wind\" that keeps it from resonating as it should. Once a peace treaty is signed between Ireland and Britain, the film becomes far less involving. Characters become mouthpieces for lengthy political dissertations rather than people with resonant convictions, and much of the historical background is handled by having someone burst into a room with important news. There’s something deflating about witnessing a film establish such a strong tone only to get bogged down into what ends up seeming like a contentious meeting of the planning board.\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\" is not a bad film, but had it maintained the elegiac tone of its early scenes, it could have been more than just a history lesson.\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\" is currently at 60 percent on the Tomatmeter; some critics have praised the film’s atmosphere and performances, while others say it lacks the human touch of Loach’s best work.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"4/20, Paramount, media, TNT, CMT, The, worst, witnail, movies, Signature, Winter","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"toronto-the-wind-that-shakes-the-barley-review"},{"id":"47614528279621","title":"Character Actor Bruno Kirby, Dead at 57","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Character Actor Bruno Kirby, Dead at 57by Scott Weinberg | August 16, 2006 |  CommentsYou’d immediately recognize the face (and the voice) from movies like \"City Slickers,\" \"Good Morning Vietnam,\" and \"When Harry Met Sally,\" but you might not remember the guy’s name. (Good character actors are like that.) The man’s name was Bruno Kirby, and we’re sad to say that he passed away last night at the age of 57.From Yahoo! News: \"Kirby died Monday in Los Angeles from complications related to leukemia, according to a statement from his wife, Lynn Sellers. He had recently been diagnosed with the disease.\"We are incredibly grateful for the outpouring of support we have received from Bruno’s fans and colleagues who have admired and respected his work over the past 30 years,\" his wife said. \"Bruno’s spirit will continue to live on not only in his rich body of film and television work but also through the lives of individuals he has touched throughout his life.\"—Although best remembered for the three movies mentioned above, Mr. Kirby’s filmography is an impressive one indeed. He did some very fine work in movies like \"Tin Men,\" \"The Freshman,\" \"Sleepers,\" \"Donnie Brasco,\" \"The Basketball Diaries,\" and \"We’re No Angels.\" Plus the guy also popped up in \"The Godfather Part 2\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\" So obviously he’s an old pal to many a movie-watcher, and he will definitely be missed.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"critics, Awards, trailers, CMT, twilight, robots","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"character-actor-bruno-kirby-dead-at-57"},{"id":"47614566222930","title":"Indie Fresh List: Spontaneous, Save Yourselves!, and Dick Johnson Is Dead","content":"Indie Fresh Listvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Indie Fresh List: Spontaneous, Save Yourselves!, and Dick Johnson Is DeadCheck out the latest Fresh indie releases, including what's in theaters, what's on VOD, and what's coming soon.by Jacqueline Coley | October 1, 2020 |  CommentsJoin us weekly as&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes reports on what’s indie features are streaming. From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.This week in our&nbsp;Indie Fresh List, we have a high school horror-comedy, an apocalyptic dark comedy, and a heartfelt documentary from a filmmaker about her father’s dementia. In our Spotlight Section, we bring back a found-footage horror film from Shudder with a new interview with its director, Rob Savage. In our indie trailer section, we have new trailers from films featuring&nbsp;Riz Ahmed,&nbsp;Steven Yeun,&nbsp;Stanley Tucci,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Colin Firth.New&nbsp;This Weekend&nbsp;Spontaneous (2020) 97%Featuring two of the most compelling young actors working in Hollywood today, Charlie Plummer and Katherine Langford,&nbsp;Spontaneous is a bloody horror-comedy that charges anyone watching to “cease the day.” Mara and Dylan are two unassuming high school seniors who are left dumbstruck when their fellow classmates&nbsp;start to spontaneously explode. Faced with their impending demise, the pair begin to question what they want in life and who they want to be with in their last moments.&nbsp;Terry Mesnard of Gayly Dreadful calls Spontaneous “a teenage romance that tries to find meaning and love in strange and unusual times where violence can explode in a moment’s notice.”Available to rent or buy&nbsp;October 6 on&nbsp;FandangoNow,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;iTunes, and&nbsp;Amazon.&nbsp;Save Yourselves! (2020) 89%In an effort to unplug and be present, a phone-obsessed millennial hipster couple head off to a remote getaway in the woods moments before an alien invasion. Completely cut off from the world, the pair bumble along as if nothing has happened until they hilariously discover they have secluded themselves at the start of the apocalypse. Another impressive debut from the Sundance Film Festival,&nbsp;Save Yourselves! is a darkly comedic take on the end of the world that Staci Layne Wilson from We Live Entertainment&nbsp;calls “a throwback to an Atomic Age sci-fi cautionary tale, but with a thoroughly modern Millennial twist and a zany dose of droll comedy.”In select theaters now and available to rent or buy October 6 on&nbsp;FandangoNow, Vudu, and iTunes.Dick Johnson Is Dead (2020) 100%Kirsten Johnson,&nbsp;best known for her docu-memoir Cameraperson, which centers on her long career as a cinematographer, channels the grief and pain of her father’s dementia diagnosis into a hilarious and tear-jerking docu-drama. In Dick Johnson is Dead, Johnson dramatically stages her father’s death in multiple outlandish scenarios while eulogizing the man and his final fight to remember who he is and those he loves.&nbsp;Stills Fresh at 100% following its Sundance debut, the film is what&nbsp;Dan Kois of Slate called “a testament to the power of talking forthrightly about death with those you love. It shows how death may never lose its power, exactly, but you can make yourselves partners in the process, not victims of it.”Streaming October 2nd on Netflix.Streaming now&nbsp;– Spotlight PickHost (2020) 100%As if the current state of things wasn’t terrifying enough, Shudder films and director Rob Savage recently released a new quarantine horror tale that is as innovative as it is terrifying. Filmed remotely via zoom, the film follows a group of spirit chasers who perform a seance that inadvertently unleashes an unspeakable evil upon them. Using straight-to-camera shots of the actors as they are terrorized by demonic forces, Savage stitches classic horror elements and internet creepy-pasta with practical effects to create a new flavor of suspense. “One of the most uniquely ambitious horror movies to come along this year, and it serves as an excellent reminder of the power of great genre storytelling,” according to Heather Wixson of Daily Dead.&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes recently sat down with Savage and asked him about his quarantine inspiration and how he worked with the actors to heighten the scares.Jacqueline Coley for Rotten Tomatoes: Did&nbsp;the&nbsp;pandemic wholly inspire&nbsp;the&nbsp;piece or did you adjust a previous idea?Rob Savage:&nbsp;Making a truly scary haunted house movie has always been on my bucket list, but beyond that, I had no basis for&nbsp;Host. At&nbsp;the&nbsp;start of lockdown, everyone was sarcastically talking about&nbsp;the&nbsp;possibility of a movie shot entirely on Zoom — we were all expecting it, and nobody was looking forward to it. All of my closest friends work in&nbsp;the&nbsp;film industry, and we were already hanging out over Zoom almost every day. We just felt like, “Why not us?” When I had&nbsp;the&nbsp;idea of making a Zoom-based feature,&nbsp;the&nbsp;first person I called was Jed Shepherd, who I’ve worked with on a number of shorts. We threw some ideas around, but didn’t land on anything concrete. When I woke up the&nbsp;next morning, I had a text from Jed. Two words: “Zoom Seance.” It really was as simple as that.What was it like setting up the effects with the actors?The very first stunt we filmed, which involves someone crashing down from&nbsp;the&nbsp;ceiling and splatting on&nbsp;the&nbsp;floor, was particularly tough. Not for me — I was sitting at home in my dressing gown — but for our stunt co-ordinator Nathaniel, who was performing&nbsp;the&nbsp;gag. He was suspended by a rope, having to hold a plank position for up to three minutes while a scene played out beneath him. Then, he would be released and would free-fall until, at&nbsp;the&nbsp;last moment, a mechanism would kick in to soften his landing.&nbsp;The&nbsp;very last take,&nbsp;the&nbsp;one that we used in&nbsp;the&nbsp;film, we dropped poor Nathaniel but&nbsp;the&nbsp;mechanism didn’t kick in. He slammed to&nbsp;the&nbsp;floor like a sack of potatoes, thankfully didn’t die, and absolutely made&nbsp;the&nbsp;shot.What is&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest challenge or unforeseen benefit of directing via Zoom?Initially, I was very nervous about&nbsp;the process of filming remotely, but ultimately it felt very similar to working on a normal set. As a director, you have to learn to be concise and clear with your direction, and while&nbsp;the&nbsp;energy was different because we were in separate locations, it was a really exciting and creative process.&nbsp;The&nbsp;main perk was when I had&nbsp;the&nbsp;realization that, by filming remotely, anyone with an internet connection could be part of our movie. With everyone on furlough, we were able to rope in some amazing collaborators to help elevate this film beyond what could have been achieved under normal conditions.As a “Shudder obsessive,” talk about getting them involved?When we started pitching&nbsp;the&nbsp;film to companies, we received a huge amount of interest — this was peak lockdown, and it really felt like we might be locked down for&nbsp;the&nbsp;rest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;year. We had offers from several places, but Shudder immediately felt like&nbsp;the&nbsp;right fit. Not only did I love&nbsp;the&nbsp;work they’d been doing prior to&nbsp;Host, but they allowed us to stream direct to our intended audience: horror fans. We’re huge horror fans, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;question we would ask ourselves throughout&nbsp;the&nbsp;process was always “What’s&nbsp;the&nbsp;film I would want to watch during all this madness?”What is on your Indie Fresh List, or what are you watching in general?The last film I watched was&nbsp;The&nbsp;Painted Bird, which astonished and traumatized me. I also caught up with Mark Jenkin’s Bait, which was totally singular.Besides your film, what is&nbsp;the&nbsp;perfect quarantine horror viewing?My ultimate comfort film is Evil Dead 2. If I were forced to stay inside forever and only watch one movie on repeat, it would be that!Host is available to stream now on Shudder.Along with… 92% Alone (2020) , a thriller about a woman on the run who is stalked by a violent predator.&nbsp; 100% All In: The Fight for Democracy (2020) , a documentary that examines&nbsp;the fight against voter disenfranchisement. 92% The Assistant (2020) , about a&nbsp;young Hollywood assistant to a predatory producer who struggles when presented with daily evidence of his abuse of women. 93% Babyteeth (2020) , a dark rom-com about a sickly girl who falls for the town screw-up. 72% Becky (2020) , a thriller about a girl left alone who must battle escaped convicts when they invade her vacation home. 93% Blue Story (2020) ,&nbsp;a drama about two childhood friends who are torn apart by gang violence. 78% The Broken Hearts Gallery (2020) , a rom-com about an aimless twenty-something who creates an art exhibit to showcase items from past relationships as a means to find closure. 98% Disclosure (2020) , an in-depth documentary about trans performers on screen. 91% Don't Be Nice (2019) , a documentary about an impressive group competing at the National Slam Poetry contest. 87% Get Duked!

This week, that certain kind of moviegoer is in for a treat. In Dream Horse, the feel-good Welsh film that critics say has arrived in theaters – after delays due to COVID-19 – at just the right time for a country in need of some serious uplift, Collette plays real-life small-town hero Jan Vokes, a working-class woman who wakes up one day with a singular ambition: to breed a champion race horse. The film, whose story was told in the 2015 Certified Fresh documentary Dark Horse, follows Vokes as she rallies a disparate group of locals – among them Damian Lewis’s initially skeptical local accountant, Howard Davies – to put some money together and make that dream come true.For Collette, who recently wrapped on Guillermo del Toro’s upcoming Nightmare Alley and is currently shooting Netflix drama Pieces of Her in Sydney, Australia, it’s another critically acclaimed performance as a woman whose circumstances are humble but who should not be underestimated, a trait she says she’s been attracted to from the time of her breakout film role as Mariel/Muriel Heslop in Australian comedy classic, Muriel’s Wedding. In Vokes, Collette says she found someone to whom she could relate: “I am a sucker for an underdog story,” Collette says. “Feeling out of place, but having a certain amount of faith in oneself, just having this gut feeling of, ‘I have to pursue this. There’s no real clear reason why, except that I’m backing myself here and I feel it and I have to do it.'”Ahead of the movie’s release, Collette spoke with Rotten Tomatoes about the pressure to get one of Wales’ most beloved (true) fairy tales just right, forming a tight bond with her cast and a horse named Bo, and why she can’t wait to see what the “singular” Del Toro has done with the highly anticipated Nightmare Alley.(Photo by Kerry Brown / © Bleecker Street Media / Courtesy Everett Collection)Joel Meares for Rotten Tomatoes: Congratulations on the film – and on mastering the Welsh accent. The whole time I was watching I was thinking, this must have been work! What was your approach to nailing the notoriously difficult accent?Toni Collette: Panic, initially. I mean, it’s a very intimidating collection of sounds, and I wasn’t very familiar with it. And not only is the Welsh accent on the whole a little scary from the outset, but then this is a very specific area called The Valleys. Thankfully, I had an incredible dialect coach who helped me – she’s from there, and it was very, very specific. I can’t tell you how helpful she was. Also, just being there and the cast and the crew were the most beautiful group of people, so supportive. So, the familiarity of the accent, it became more and more of something that didn’t seem so scary and far away to reach, but I was very intimidated by it. At the beginning, I was like, “I’ve got to get out of this job. I won’t only embarrass myself, but I will let down this entire nation, because this is a true story and I cannot screw it up!”Rotten Tomatoes: I mean, it feels like the most Welsh movie ever made and you’re at the center of it doing this accent, and look, to my ears – and I’m not steeped in the language – it sounded great! The other thing I kept thinking is, the movie is such a feel-good film, and people are saying it’s such a treat that it’s coming out at this point in time, because we’re in need of this kind of film. It actually wasn’t supposed to be out right now, but do you think the timing adds something to the movie?Collette: It couldn’t be better time. It could not be more perfect. I think the fact that people are able to go and have a communal experience of sitting in the dark together and watching a story unfold and getting emotionally involved is such a special treat. I think all the things we took for granted are now seen so differently. So, to be able to go and do that for a start is amazing, but to be able to watch something as special as this, that is so full of joy, so uplifting, so inspirational and all about hope and realizing your dreams… it just couldn’t be better.Rotten Tomatoes: The movie is about a woman who wakes up one day with a dream and acts on it. And when I was watching your character Jan, a lot of the time I was thinking abut Muriel [Collette’s character in her breakout, Muriel’s Wedding]. They’re these two women from small communities who have a dream, right? But, Muriel’s dream is to run away and get out and Jan’s is to pursue her dream within her community and lift up the community as well. Did you see any parallels between these two characters – both chasing dreams, in different ways, at different points of their life?Collette: Absolutely. I think I am a sucker for an underdog story. I just am. And I grew up in Blacktown [a suburb in western Sydney]; I had very humble beginnings and I had this dream of acting, which seemed so distant and unachievable. I very much relate to feeling out of place, but having a certain amount of faith in oneself, just having this gut feeling of, “I have to pursue this. There’s no real clear reason why, except that I’m backing myself here and I feel it and I have to do it” – and to succeed is an incredible thing. But really, what I’m inspired by in Jan Vokes is that she’s so determined and so full of love and passion, and simply looking for some purpose, some meaning in her life. Really, there’s that line: “I just want something to look forward to when I wake up in the morning” – it’s such a simple dream. And to be honest, I don’t think she really thinks about uplifting the community. I think it’s a by-product of her own [dream]. I think that’s that thing of, if you live your truth, you can only have a positive knock-on effect and I think that’s what happens in this scenario.(Photo by ©Sony Pictures Classics/courtesy Everett Collection)Rotten Tomatoes: Jan (above, from the documentary Dark Horse) is obviously an incredible and inspiring person. To what capacity did you work with her or get to know her in the process of making the film?Collette: I didn’t meet her until she visited the set a few weeks into filming actually. I’d been living, obviously, with the script and everyone’s stories about spending time with her and the documentary that had previously been somewhat successful at Sundance as well. I was kind of steeped in her world, but I didn’t really communicate with her directly. When I heard she was coming to set, I was really nervous. I mean, as I said, it’s a real responsibility playing someone who exists, but then she’s right there. It’s like meeting Santa Claus or something, it’s quite jarring, but also very exciting. Kind of want to pee your pants and cuddle them and you don’t know them at all. And it was a bit stiff and shy and it was a little disjointed, but I just love that there’s this normal woman who pursued her dream and now there’s a movie made about her. That in itself is an incredible thing. That just blows me away.They all visited the set a couple of times and then obviously at the end of the film they appear, which I think is so great. It’s so important for people to see them and it’s done in the most fun Welsh way. I mean, they can’t stop singing. That’s their culture. They will sing at the drop of a hat about anything.(Photo by © Bleecker Street)Rotten Tomatoes: [Laughing] I admit I was watching the movie and thinking, “They’re going to sing ‘Delilah’ at some point –&nbsp; it’s going to happen. It has to, it’s Wales!” And then it does.Collette: Oh yeah baby. And there were songs that we, all the actors, just ad-libbed, that we kind of made up as we went along, which ended up on screen. But not only that, the composer then used what we had made up on the spot and started to compose from that. So, some of the score is actually inspired by us just mucking around on set. I love the organic nature of how that came to be.Rotten Tomatoes: Sounds like a fun shoot, with great people. Director Euros Lyn has said that you formed a particularly close bond with one of your co-stars: Bo, one of the horses who plays Dream. Tell us about that bond.Collette: Well, look, I’m not a particularly horsey person. I have had some mind-blowing almost spiritual experiences with horses, but I’m not around them often. And yes, there were several horses playing Dream. There were some that did a lot of the running racing, and then Bo was the acting horse. All of my scenes were with Bo, and they were emotionally intimate and I feel so lucky to have had an experience working with a creature like this, because there’s no crazy judgment and the mind going round circuitously trying to make sense of things. The horse is just there. The horse is just present and listening, and it’s all just energy between us and it was really profound. I loved him and I even looked into flying him back to Sydney. It was highfalutin, it was never going to happen, but I just felt so connected to this horse, and it wasn’t just in my mind because the crew could see it. Everyone’s like, “Oh my God, this is incredible to capture this on film,” but they are beautiful, sensitive, perceptive creatures, and it was pretty spesh. [Editor’s note: That would be Aussie shorthand for “special.”](Photo by Kerry Brown / © Bleecker Street Media / Courtesy Everett Collection)Rotten Tomatoes: This film obviously shows a very nurturing relationship between man and horse. It’s a beautiful side of this sport. But watching the movie I couldn’t help also thinking about some of the conversations around horse-racing, and controversies, which have particularly come up in Australia in the last couple of years every November [the month of nation-stopping horse race the Melbourne Cup] – the debate around how dangerous racing can be for the animals. These owners clearly were incredibly careful and caring about the wellbeing of Dream, but there is another side. Was that conversation ever something that you thought about or was in the back of your mind as you got to know this world?Collette: Absolutely, yeah. I really don’t know much about horse racing. Like Jan, it was a real education for me. I think the focus of the story is her relationship with Dream and what it does for herself and her community. Dream is almost like a third child to her. She’s so protective of his wellbeing and his health. And it’s torture actually for her to watch him do what he is actually very good at. They talk about him being born to do that and she did do that, she did state, “I’m going to breed a race horse.” But she falls so heavily in love with this beautiful animal and they have such a bond that it becomes quite upsetting for her. She can barely watch. I think she feels… Look, I don’t want to put words in her mouth, but she can’t go and visit him [today]. He has a great life. He’s out to pasture, he’s got beautiful carers and she can’t visit him. She can’t face it.(Photo by Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures)Rotten Tomatoes: The last time we spoke was for&nbsp;I’m Thinking of Ending Things, and I’d asked about shooting Guillermo del Toro’s Nightmare Alley, and at that time everything was on pause and you hadn’t had a chance to do it. And now it’s done.Collette: Done baby, yeah!Rotten Tomatoes: First of all, how was it doing a production with COVID-safe protocols? And then secondly, what can we expect from your character Zeena and this film?Collette: Well, it was an amazing experience. Guillermo Del Toro is an incredible human being. There is nobody like him, and I’m so thankful that I got to work with him and I hope to do it again and again, because it is truly very satisfying and just a huge amount of fun. I love him. I love him as a person. I love him as a director. There is nobody like him. He is singular and incredible.I took my family. We lived in beautiful house in Toronto. There were varying degrees of lockdown. But I’ve got to say, I think, you couldn’t get any safer than a film set. They’re so regimented and disciplined and demanding in terms of having to toe the line and everyone does their best to not get it. You really are in a bubble and the whole of Toronto is in masks and you’re just sanitizing your hands a million times a day and trying not to be in big crowds and you just have to be mindful of that. Especially when you’re working, because there’s a bigger risk there. It’s not just you, it’s everyone else, you know?Rotten Tomatoes: And finally, is there anything you could tell us about the film? What can we expect genre-wise – is this a big Del Toro fantasy? People are so curious.Collette: It’s not fantasy, it’s a period drama. It’s just as gorgeously saturated visually [as his other films], but it’s very much a drama. It’s unlike some of his other work and the actors are incredible. It looks incredible. I personally can’t wait to see it. I think there’s almost four hours of footage, which needs to be whittled down. And I know that he’s editing furiously at the moment, but it was a total joy. I think we all felt very privileged to be able to work during that period when so many people just couldn’t do much at all.Dream Horse is in theaters May 21, 2021.On an Apple device?

Add to the mix the fact that this has been one of the strangest years in movie history, with studios holding back a number of their planned big “awards movies” for 2021 and streaming services like Netflix dominating in many of the film categories, and this is one of the toughest Golden Globes nights to predict in recent memory.Recommended: Full List of Nominations for the 78th Golden Globe AwardsRecommended: Biggest Snubs and Surprises of the 2021 Golden Globes NominationsTough – but not impossible. Which is why we asked you to fill out our digital Golden Globes ballot&nbsp;to let us know who you think will win on the big night, and while we can’t say for sure how accurate the RT community’s predictions will be, there weren’t too many surprises in the results of the poll.Notably,&nbsp;Chloé Zhao and her #vanlife drama&nbsp;Nomadland both won for Best Director and Best Motion Picture – Drama, respectively, but the film’s star, Frances McDormand, fell in the Best Actress race to&nbsp;Promising Young Woman’s Carey Mulligan. Meanwhile, in TV, The Mandalorian edged out The Crown for Best TV Drama by only 17 votes, and RT users predict&nbsp;Schitt’s Creek&nbsp;will repeat its history-making feat at the Emmys by sweeping all five of the awards it’s nominated for, namely Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and acting awards for each of its four stars.

Burning. Shoplifters. The competition for Best Foreign Language Film might be the season's most exciting Oscar race.by Jacqueline Coley | October 26, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Carlos Somonte / © Netflix )This week, The Walking Dead&nbsp;alum Steven Yeun&nbsp;hits theaters as charming, mysterious, and wealthy playboy Ben in Lee Chang-dong’s Korean-language thriller noir, Burning.&nbsp;It’s a case of moviemaking wish fulfillment: Several&nbsp;years ago, on the press tour for Okja, Yeun commented that&nbsp;Lee was a “hero” with whom he desperately wanted to work; three months later, upon hearing those comments,&nbsp;Lee called Yeun to offer him the role of Ben. Currently sitting at 92% on the Tomatometer,&nbsp;Burning, which is South Korea’s official entry in the Foreign Language Oscar race,&nbsp;looks like it might earn the country its first nomination in the category. But it will face tough competition for the win.Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma has dominated awards chatter so far this ear, and rightly&nbsp;so: Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer, Roma&nbsp;is the Oscar-winning auteur’s highest-rated film to date. And while most prognosticators are certain Cuarón’s black-and-white period opus will bring the director more Oscar gold, it’s somehow no done deal. This year, Oscar voters are facing an embarrassment of foreign-language&nbsp;riches, among them&nbsp;Roma, Burning, and a slew of others. Which is great news for moviegoers keen to walk off the beaten path. Here are six foreign-language films in theaters or on their way that you will definitely want to see in preparation for awards season.Border (Gräns) (2018)  97%SwedenWhen Ali Abbasi’s&nbsp;Border&nbsp;premiered at Cannes, it quickly became known as the “troll sex” movie with the lifelike makeup; when the movie took home the top prize in that festival’s Un Certain Regard section, though, it was clear this was a film not to be dismissed. A twisted contemporary fairytale in which the trolls look to find their happily ever after,&nbsp;Border&nbsp;offers a forceful and hilarious critique of self-image and happiness.&nbsp;The movie may be a little too offbeat to challenge&nbsp;Roma,&nbsp;Cold War,&nbsp;or Burning&nbsp;for top prize on the night – or, perhaps, to even be nominated –&nbsp;but it does also have a decent shot for Best Makeup.In limited release October 26Burning (Beoning) (2018)  95%South KoreaBased on the Japanese short story, “Barn Burning,” by Haruki Murakami,&nbsp;Burning&nbsp;centers on Jong-soo, a young man who is besotted with a woman he grew up with but doesn’t initially remember from his childhood. Shortly after they become romantically involved, she’s quickly wooed away by Ben (played by Steven Yeun), an affluent and mysterious businessman whose hobbies are anything but orthodox. A slow burn for sure,&nbsp;Burning&nbsp;frames the Korean countryside in muted light, forming an eerily beautiful background to a series of increasingly disturbing events. Director Lee Chang-dong plants cryptic seeds throughout the film’s 160-minute runtime, but critics are saying the fruit they bear is worth the wait.In limited release&nbsp;October 26Shoplifters (Manbiki kazoku) (2018)  99%JapanOne of Japan’s most acclaimed directors, Hirokazu Koreeda, will potentially represent his country for the first time at next year’s Oscars with&nbsp;Shoplifters. The film, which took home the Palme D’or at the Cannes Film Festival in May, is a critical favorite –&nbsp;it’s currently Certified Fresh at 98% – and tells the story of a close-knit adoptive family that resorts to shoplifting as a way to make ends meet. This poignant slice of life tale about people living between the cracks of society is a testament to the belief that the family you choose can be&nbsp;more&nbsp;precious than the one you’re born with. It’s a theme likely to resonate with voters and audiences.In limited release November 23Capernaum (Capharnaüm) (2018)  90%LebanonNadine Labaki’s&nbsp;Capernaum&nbsp;debuted to a 15-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival this year before taking home the top Jury Prize. The story of Zain, a young boy from the Beirut slums who sues his parents for giving birth to him, is one of several foreign-language films this year to marry a compelling narrative with socioeconomic commentary. The third time might also prove to be the charm for Labaki, who has twice before represented Lebanon in the Foreign Language Oscar race. Already predicted to be a front runner, Labaki will likely be the only female director to represent her nation in the category on Oscar night.In limited release December 14Roma (2018)  95%MexicoThe last film to earn Academy Award nominations for Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Foreign Language Film was Michael Haneke’s 2012 end-of-life French love story,&nbsp;Amour.&nbsp;This year, Alfonso Cuarón looks to repeat that feat with&nbsp;Roma.&nbsp;Cuarón’s semi-autobiographical retelling of his adolescence in 1970s Mexico is voyeuristic and intimate, painting a moving portrait of the relationship between a maid and the family for which she works. Shot in black and white, with Cuarón pulling double duty as cinematographer, this may be Netflix’s best chance yet to win Oscar gold with a narrative feature. And just as Haneke’s leading lady, Emmanuelle Riva, earned a Best Actress nomination, Roma’s lead, Yalitza Aparicio, is looking like a good chance to be in the Best Actress conversation. It’s the one to beat in the Foreign Language category – and potentially in many others – but anything can happen come Oscar night.In limited release and on Netflix December 14Cold War (Zimna wojna) (2018)  92%PolandPoland won the category in 2015 for Pawel Pawlikowski’s&nbsp;Ida. This year, Pawlikowski returns with another black-and-white epic,&nbsp;Cold War, which traces a decades-long love affair between and pianist and his singer muse. Our star-crossed couple falls in and out of love as the events of the Cold War years in Poland disrupt and form a backdrop to their passionate melodrama.&nbsp;The haunting dissolution of their affections is perfectly intermixed with triumphant moments of reunification that will undoubtedly dig into personal wounds for some audiences. Could it be the battle of the black-and-white epics? And the battle of the two previous Oscar winners?In limited release December 21","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV+, trailers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"dont-miss-these-six-foreign-language-oscar-hopefuls-landing-in-theaters"},{"id":"47614611445852","title":"New On DVD This Week: Wonder Woman, The Big Sick, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New On DVD This Week: Wonder Woman, The Big Sick, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | September 18, 2017 |  CommentsWe’ve got two of the biggest winners of the summer on DVD this week, namely the big-screen arrival of an iconic DC superhero and a critically acclaimed romantic comedy based on true events.

On New Year’s Eve 2009, I headed out for a drink in the German city, where I was stationed in the Air Force. As I settled in for the night and took a sip, I thought, “I am a lesbian.” It’s not something I had thought about in the weeks prior, but it felt right to say it then; and so over the super-loud music, I told my best friend that I was satisfied with coming out as a lesbian.I rang in that new year with a new branch of identity, one that felt right but also terrifying because I had a lot of questions. How would I integrate myself into this community? Would I have to fight for acceptance within it? How do I find a date? These aren’t things I felt comfortable asking someone; I needed to experience it for myself. Unfortunately, I also had to deploy. I worked nights, gave up on a social life, and didn’t have time to process those questions or get close to any answers.Instead I watched films, and one day someone suggested I check out Rees’ Pariah. I did some research, discovered what it was about, and knew this was something I needed to see.(Photo by Focus Features)Pariah follows Alike (Adepero Oduye), a 17-year-old Brooklynite who longs for an intimate connection with someone of the same sex. She knows she’s a lesbian and hasn’t come out to her parents; those around her suspect she may be gay based on her fashion choices and current friends, who are openly gay women. Observing this behavior, her mother Audrey (Kim Wayans) encourages her to befriend Bina (Aasha Davis), in the hope she will rub off on her daughter: Bina is feminine, demure, goes to church – everything&nbsp;Audrey’s daughter is not.Alike develops a crush on her new friend, and things look promising until Bina admits the feeling isn’t mutual. Meanwhile, tensions are rising at home. Audrey is incensed at the idea that one of her children is gay, while Alike’s father Arthur (Charles Parnell) believes his wife is overreacting. Tired of the drama, Alike leaves home early for college to start life anew. As she is about to board the bus to college, director Rees interposes the action with a shot of Alike reading her poetry. When she’s finally on the bus, glaring out of the window with&nbsp;a look of satisfaction, we hear the line “I am not running, I’m choosing.” It hits close to home.(Photo by Focus Features/ Everett Collection)“I’m not running, I’m choosing” is a theme that ripples throughout the film, during which Alike is in a constant tug-of-war between family obligation and self-preservation. In the end, she chooses herself – not out of selfishness but for her own mental and spiritual wellbeing.Unlike Alike, my family didn’t have issues with my coming out. They were very accepting, and many were not surprised. However, it’s still a heavy cross to bear when you exist at marginalized intersections. Claiming a sexual label outside of heterosexuality – on top of being Black and a woman in America – can mean you face physical abuse, verbal abuse, and sometimes death.Alike and I have the same skin complexion, are of the same sexual orientation, we grew up in similar environments, and we made the bold choice to leave because it was the best choice for us and no one else. For me, leaving home to join the military was a decision without outside influences – the kind of major decision I hadn’t made until then. Seeing Pariah&nbsp;gave me confidence and confirmed that I made the right choice.Katie ShearerThe movie changed my life and my perspective on what it means to be happy with everything I am. When the film was released, it didn’t receive the notoriety it deserves. Now, many movie fans are discovering what a gem Pariah is. I would go so far as to say it paved the way for films like Moonlight, Night Comes On, and Rafiki. Rees has built a successful career. She followed Pariah with the HBO original film Bessie, starring Queen Latifah;&nbsp;Mudbound, her third feature, picked up four Oscar nominations, including for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Cinematography. Her next film is an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel, The Last Thing He Wanted.I’m just here to remind movie fans that Pariah should always come up in conversation when discussing queer cinema game changers. It’s a movie that speaks to a demographic that rarely interests Hollywood studios – Black queer women and non-binary people. Rees took a cinematic risk and in doing so created a queer classic that holds up 10 years later –&nbsp;and will for decades to come.Valerie Complex&nbsp;is a military veteran turned freelance movie journalist in love with all things related to cinema.Like this?

Turns out that Ken Loach’s Looking For Eric was a good pick for the Opening Night Gala of the 56th Sydney Film Festival. A feel good comedy with a dose of pathos, the film delighted last night’s audience much like it did in Cannes.This year the SFF is daring audiences to get off the couch with the bold tag line, “Don’t Try This At Home” — the idea being that the true film experience can only be achieved within the theatre. And for Sydney, which hosts many of its screenings in the atmospheric and ornate State Theatre, the claim is impossible to refute. Indeed the 12 films selected for the festival’s second Official Competition will screen at the State Theatre.Once again an impressive jury has been assembled to award the $60,000 prize and bestow the trophy colloquially dubbed the ‘Blue Pavlova’. Comprised of Jury President and Australian filmmaking icon Rolf de Heer, actress Miranda Otto, German director Oliver Hirschbiegel (Downfall), Danish director Lone Scherfig (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) and Canadian filmmaker (and adopted Australian) Ted Kotcheff (Wake in Fright), this jury has an equally impressive selection of films to consider.First up we have a tale of two Erics. Ken Loach’s football fable sees down-and-out postman Eric Bishop (Steve Evets) descend into paroxysms of panic at the prospect of having to reconnect with his ex-wife, Lily (Stephanie Bishop), whom he literally left holding the baby some 20-odd years ago. Eric’s well meaning mates attempt to snap him out of his funk by indulging in a bit of group therapy and positive visualisation. The result — well aided by Eric pilfering his stepson’s pot — is that he congers himself a legendary life coach in the form of Eric Cantona (in the flesh). Together the Erics deconstruct the source of his panic and — in a less schlocky way than it sounds –help him find himself.The conceit of the phantom Cantona is well constructed and the source of most of the film’s laughs. Cantona does a great job playing the wooden, football philosopher, espousing obscure proverbs in heavily accented English or just as often in French. This Gallic stoicism is well complimented by Evets’ portrayal of the desperate and dejected Eric. The simple, unobtrusive cinematography doesn’t often place them in a two-shot, however their unlikely camaraderie easily translates to the audience.Paul Laverty’s screenplay is at its best when Eric is starry eyed with his idol or at the bottom of a pint with his mates. Unfortunately the gangster subplot is a bit weak, and though Eric displays courage under fire, the action seems to hijack his personal catharsis and instead works as a vehicle for the lightweight, if amusing, climax. One wonders what could have been if the action had stayed in the home, like the kitchen-sink drama it often reflects, and perhaps it could even more fully interrogated the realities of mental illness.However for once it appears Loach is content to stray towards the lighter side of life. And in a film that could almost be described as The Full Monty for football hooligans, the result is engaging, thoughtful and fun. Eric Bishop sees football as an opportunity to get together with your friends and forget about your life for a couple of hours.The same can definitely be said for cinema.For program details, visit the Sydney Film Festival website","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Awards, australia, The, monsters, Rocketman, Network, rotten, casting, indie, kaiju, dark, WGN, Moore, women","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sydney-film-festival-opens-with-ken-loach"},{"id":"47614686930036","title":"Sundance Awards: \"Padre Nuestro,\" \"Grace is Gone\" Among Competition Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sundance Awards: \"Padre Nuestro,\" \"Grace is Gone\" Among Competition Winnersby Jen Yamato | January 28, 2007 |  CommentsResults are in for this year’s Sundance festival winners, including awards for John Cusack‘s \"Grace is Gone,\" Christopher Zalla’s \"Padre Nuestro,\" NASA documentary \"In the Shadow of the Moon,\" and the racy teen horror flick, \"Teeth.\"Read on for the full list of awards:Grand Jury Prize: Documentary – \"Manda Bala (Send a Bullet)\"Grand Jury Prize: Dramatic – \"Padre Nuestro\"World Cinema Jury Prize: Documentary – \"Enemies of Happiness\"World Cinema Jury Prize: Dramatic – \"Sweet Mud\"Audience Award: Documentary – \"Hear and Now\"Audience Award: Dramatic – \"Grace is Gone\"World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary — \"In the Shadow of the Moon\"World Cinema Audience Award: Dramatic – \"Once\"Directing Award: Documentary – Sean Fine &amp; Andrea Nix, \"War/Dance\"Directing Award: Dramatic – Jeffrey Blitz, \"Rocket Science\"Excellence in Cinematography Award: Documentary – Heloisa Passos, \"Manda Bala (Send a Bullet)\"Excellence in Cinematography Award: Dramatic – Benoit Debie, \"Joshua\"Documentary Editing Award – Hibah Sherif Frisina, Charlton McMillian, and Michael Schweitzer, \"Nanking\"Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award – James C.

Foreign film fanatics have a well-received import to watch (Alice’s House, from Brazil), while an international cast can’t save Steve Martin’s latest slapstick (The Pink Panther 2). Criterion releases a French New Wave classic conundrum (Last Year at Marienbad on Blu-ray), Elle Fanning gets a star vehicle (Phoebe in Wonderland), we get twice the Crispin Glover than usual (Simon Says, in which he plays twin psychos), and Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman team up to show that “direct-to-DVD” doesn’t always equal terrible (The Code, directed by Mimi Leder).Waltz with Bashir —97%This celebrated animated documentary earned award season raves — and, notably, an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film — for its dreamlike depiction of one man’s struggle to remember his involvement in controversial events during the 1982 Lebanon War. Director Ari Folman illuminates his own hazy recollections as a young Israeli soldier with striking, gorgeous animation as his on-screen alter ego revisits old colleagues and a psychologist in order to understand why he has only fleeting memories of the war. An English language version is available on DVD and Blu-ray, along with a making-of featurette, director commentary, and more behind the scenes features.Next: Jerry Bruckheimer does chick flick in Confessions of a ShopaholicConfessions of a Shopaholic —23%Under the guidance of producer Jerry Bruckheimer — maestro of the blockbuster — Disney churned out this appropriately glitzy, yet mildly inappropriate, ode to shopping and female consumption adapted from Sophie Kinsella’s bestselling Shopaholic series. And who knows? Maybe in more buoyant economic times audiences could have latched on better to its designer clothes-fetishizing, credit card-maxing heroine, Rebecca Bloomwood (the charismatic and talented Isla Fisher), an aspiring fashion writer who lands a job writing about fiscal responsibility while hiding her own huge personal debts. Critics, however, spared no expense in dressing down this overly glossy, stereotype-enforcing chick flick (though it does make use of some fabulous costuming by Patricia Field). Deleted scenes and a blooper reel (entertaining itself, thanks to Fisher’s comic sensibility) are included on DVD. (Read Jerry Bruckheimer’s Five Favorite Films here!)Next: Brendan Fraser reads books in his latest fantasy clunker, InkheartInkheart —39%Star Brendan Fraser chalks up yet another family fantasy clunker with Inkheart, based on the international best-seller by Cornelia Funke. Fraser plays Mo, a man who shares the gift of the “Silvertongue” with his 12-year-old daughter, Meggie (Eliza Bennett), meaning they can both bring characters to life from reading aloud from books. When Mo and Meggie become drawn to one book in particular, a colorful cast of characters pop up to help — and hinder — the pair, including Paul Bettany, Andy Serkis, Jim Broadbent, and Helen Mirren. It’s a shame, then, that this fantasy tale wound up woefully short on, well, magic. A handful of featurettes on writing and reading accompany the disc.Next: The acclaimed Brazilian drama, Alice’s HouseAlice’s House —90%Chances are you haven’t heard of this acclaimed Brazilian drama, so what better time than now to check it out on DVD? Director Chico Teixeira unfolds a chamber piece about secrets, love, and betrayal among family members who share a cramped home in Sao Paolo. Teixeria, a former documentarian, uses his experience with nonfiction subjects to lend the film naturalism and the kind of complex characters only found in real life, following 40-year-old manicurist Alice (Carla Ribas) as she tries in vain to balance her dysfunctional sons, her aging mother, and her philandering husband.Alice’s House (A Casa de Alice) was shortlisted for Brazil’s official Oscar selection last year.Next: Who really wanted a sequel to The Pink Panther?The Pink Panther 2— 13%The original films aside, did the world really need another Pink Panther movie? According to the critics, the answer would be a resounding “no,” since the rebooted films keep falling further and further down the Tomatometer. (The previous Pink Panther landed at 24 percent.) Steve Martin, who we’d swear used to be funny, returns as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau, charged this time around with catching a thief who is targeting the world’s most prized historical treasures. As if we didn’t feel bad enough for Martin, a passel of respectable actors find themselves stuck with him in this lame slapstick sequel, including Lily Tomlin, Andy Garcia, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, John Cleese, and Aishwarya Rai. The upside: the 2-disc DVD and 3-disc Blu-ray come with 27 original Pink Panther cartoons, which you can watch instead.Next: Simon Says double the Crispin Glover, double the fun!Simon Says — N/ASometimes when it rains actors, it pours. In the little-seen Simon Says, which opened quietly back in 2007 and made the rounds at genre festivals, actor and cult figure Crispin Glover plays not one, but two psycho-killer brothers. What’s more, the comic horror pic stars not one, not two, but four members of the Lively family of actors (Gossip Girl‘s Blake Lively, her sisters Lori and Robyn, and dad Ernie)! Oh yeah, the plot… five teenagers on spring break encounter demented twins (both played by Glover) while camping in the woods. Gory kills and wacky Glover-isms ensue! What more do you need?Next: Elle Fanning takes center stage in Phoebe in WonderlandPhoebe in Wonderland — 59%Eleven-year-old Elle Fanning is fast stepping out of her sister Dakota’s shadow, thanks to notable roles in films like The Door in the Floor, Babel, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button; Phoebe in Wonderland, her first role carrying a film, should further the younger Fanning’s rep, even if critics were mixed on the film overall. Fanning plays Phoebe, a youngster with inattentive parents (Felicity Huffman and Bill Pullman) and a penchant for flights of fancy who may actually be suffering from serious mental illness; Patricia Clarkson co-stars as Fanning’s encouraging drama teacher, who, like the filmmakers, means well but can’t quite save Phoebe. Unfortunately, no extra material is included.Next: Criterion Blu-rays Last Year at MarienbadLast Year at Marienbad (Criterion, Blu-ray) — 93%Movie lovers who like a challenge should make note of Criterion’s Blu-ray release of Last Year at Marienbad, the oft-discussed and enigmatic 1961 film of French New Wave auteur Alain Resnais. Set within a gathering at an upper-class chateau, Marienbad offers dreamlike and fractured pieces of a puzzle that suggest that a man named X (Giorgio Albertazzi) and a woman called A (Delphine Seyrig) met a year prior and made plans to run away together. Or did they? An interview with Resnais, an essay on the film, a making-of feature and an interview with Resnais scholar Ginette Vincendeau highlight the extra features.Next: Rachel Leigh Cook in Bob FunkBob Funk — 22%Alcoholic, politically incorrect slacker Bob Funk (Michael Leydon Campbell) is a misanthrope whose own mother fires him from the family business in this misfire of a workplace comedy, adapted from a play by writer-director Craig Carlisle. As Bob tries to slime his way through life and ladies (including The Office‘s Amy Ryan), he must learn to make a change in earnest in order to win the heart of a new love interest (Rachel Leigh Cook). Sadly, critics agree that for a comedy, Bob Funk has too few laughs (and worse, zero bonus features).Next: Antonio Banderas buddies up with Morgan Freeman in the direct-to-DVD thriller,The CodeThe Code — N/ASometimes films go direct to DVD for a reason. (Ok, most of the time that reason is they’re just plain terrible.) Increasingly, however, we see films go direct to DVD because the current moviemaking climate simply can’t accommodate independent films with theatrical releases, no matter the talent or material involved. Case in point: The Code (formerly Thick as Thieves), a jaunty buddy-thief thriller starring Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman, directed by Mimi Leder; it’s a flick that could have opened decently in theaters, say, a decade ago. In fact, there’s a distinctly ’90s feel to The Code, which introduces the 48-year-old Banderas as a young upstart taken under the wing of Freeman’s seasoned criminal and proceeds to follow the traditional heist movie formula note by note, including cheeky banter, double-crosses, damsels in distress and, yes, a roomful of lasers. For a direct-to-DVD title, you can’t get much better than this.

For those whose interests are piqued by the words “direct to DVD,” we’ve also got two new animated adventures (Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic, Wonder Woman) and a titillating vengeance pic (Stiletto, starring Stana Katic, Tom Berenger, and Michael Biehn), plus a bayou thriller adapted from a James Lee Burke bestseller (In the Electric Mist, starring Tommy Lee Jones). Lastly, we offer the latest from Crow T. Robot and Co. (Mystery Science Theater 3000 Vol. 14) and a Blu-ray offering that will go well with some fava beans and a nice Chianti (Silence of the Lambs on Blu-ray).1. Australia — 54%Baz Luhrmann‘s epic tale of war and love in mid-century Australia was, to say the least, an ambitious undertaking; addressing the nation’s history of class inequality and its people’s can-do spirit against the backdrop of World War II via an opposites-attract romance and a dash of Aborigine mysticism — with an homage to The Wizard of Oz thrown in to boot — sounded complicated enough on paper, let alone brought to life onscreen. And yet, for better or worse, that is precisely what Lurhmann did.Australia isn’t for everyone; cynics thought it cloying, while fans thought it wondrous, although all agree its nearly three-hour-runtime is an endurance test. But if you’re a fan of stars Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman (or want to watch young Brandon Walters’ breakthrough debut performance, a child actor debut to rival those in Slumdog Millionaire) then Australia might be your cup of tea.Unfortunately, your options are limited as Australia is available only as a single-disc DVD (with two deleted scenes and nothing more) or on Blu-ray, with a handful of extra featurettes. Below, watch one of the deleted scenes, in which Lady Ashley (Kidman) is served a rude dinner by her angry household staff.Next: You know you want it — Beverly Hills Chihuahua2. Beverly Hills Chihuahua — 40%If you, like us, secretly chuckled to yourself when those Taco Bell commercials came on, then you might get another sly kick out of Beverly Hills Chihuahua. The dog-out-of-water tale follows a spoiled LA pooch (voiced by Drew Barrymore), who gets lost in Mexico and must find her way home with the help of some canine friends. Photo realistic pups talking with the aid of CG — and, unfortunately, often in stereotypical accents — sound silly, but will no doubt warm over the kiddies (moreso than most adults). A handful of bonus extras will keep fans entertained for an extra hour or so after watching the film, including the darn-catchy “Chihuahua!” song sung by a horde of choreographed Mexican Chihuahuas.Next: Kristin Scott Thomas in I’ve Loved You So Long3. I’ve Loved You So Long — 90%Philippe Claudel’s quiet character study reveals Kristin Scott Thomas as you’ve never seen her before, makeup-free and haggard-looking (but still gorgeous), distant and tortured (and speaking fluent French) in the role that earned her nominations from the BAFTAS, César, and Golden Globe Awards. Thomas plays Juliette, a woman struggling to re-enter society after serving a prison sentence for killing her own child; Elsa Zylberstein plays her sister Lea, a mother herself who is the only friend Juliette has left in the real world. While bonus materials are sparse, you can watch deleted scenes and access an alternate audio track dubbed in English.Next: Our Direct-to-DVD Pick of the Week — Stiletto!4. Stiletto — N/AStana Katic (The Spirit, Quantum of Solace, and the upcoming ABC show, Castle) stars in this direct-to-video action thriller as Raina, a gorgeous assassin who sets her sights on a former lover, a Greek crime boss (Tom Berenger), and a circle of ill-fated goons. Her weapon of choice? A stiletto knife, naturally. But wait, that’s not all! This R-rated vengeance flick not only hearkens back to the days of the female exploitation tales of the 1970s, it stars a veritable Walk of Fame of bad-ass actors (most of whom have seen better days): Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, Tom Sizemore, D.B. Sweeney, Kelly Hu, and Dominique Swain. Give Stiletto a rental and chalk it up as another guilty pleasure.Next: Tommy Lee Jones Goes Direct To Video With In the Electric Mist5. In the Electric Mist — N/AJoining Stiletto in direct-to-video land is In the Electric Mist, a fantasy- thriller that boasts a decidedly stellar cast led by Tommy Lee Jones. Adapted from James Lee Burke’s bestselling novel of the same name and directed by European auteur Bertrand Tavernier (‘Round Midnight), In the Electric Mist is born of impressive pedigrees, yet missed out on a theatrical release after screening at the Berlin Film Festival. In it, Detective Dave Robicheaux (Jones) is on the hunt for a serial killer in the Deep South, an investigation complicated by encounters with a band of Confederate soldiers…Next: Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic6. Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic — N/ALike a visual version of a book on tape, Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic serves up the landmark Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons graphic novel as a page-by-page story, enhanced with Flash animation and narrated by actor/veteran audio book narrator Tom Stechschulte, who even does the female voices. While the appeal of this 2-disc set might extend only to Watchmen diehards — probably the only people willing to sit through this 5-hour-plus version of Watchmen — it also comes with a sneak peek at this week’s Wonder Woman and $7.50 towards a ticket for Friday’s Watchmen.Next: DC’s Animated, Feature Length, and Feminist Wonder Woman7. Wonder Woman — N/AA host of Hollywood all-stars (Rosario Dawson, Virginia Madsen, and…Vicki Lewis) lend their voices to this direct-to-video animated film, which tells the origin story of DC Comics’ super-heroine, Wonder Woman, and gives her a modern-day adventure to boot. Keri Russell voices Princess Diana (AKA Wonder Woman), the heir to a race of Amazon women who is charged with returning a wayward pilot (Nathan Fillion) to New York City while defeating the evil god Ares (Alfred Molina); violent enough to earn a PG-13 rating, Wonder Woman also serves as a devoutly feminist diatribe (and is directed by a woman, Superman: Doomsday co-director Lauren Montgomery), for better or worse. Bonus episodes of Justice League, a commentary track, two feature-length documentaries and a sneak peek at DC’s next animated flick, Green Lantern, highlight the special features.Next: Mystery Science Theater 3000 is Back!8. Mystery Science Theater 3000 Vol. 14 — N/AJoel, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot are back in the latest installment of the adventures in movie watching known as Mystery Science Theater 3000. Volume 14 comprises episodes with four MSTK3K classics, each with its own case: Mad Monster (the 1942 mad scientist-werewolf flick), Manhunt in Space (a multi-episode feature from the Rocky Jones, Space Ranger television series), Soultaker (starring Joe Estevez, who also gives a new interview on the disc), and Final Justice (a Joe Don Baker vehicle directed by Greydon Clark, who also graces this set with an interview).Next: Wong Kar-Wai’s Ashes of Time Redux9. Ashes of Time Redux — 80%Unlike many of his peers in Asian cinema, Wong Kar-Wai is not a director known for action spectacles or historical epics. But in 1994, he made just that: Ashes of Time, the story of an embittered ex-swordsman and the people who come in and out of his life, all adrift and consumed with their memories, lost loves, and their own selfishness — like an emo wuxia film, if such a hybrid could exist. A box office failure during its initial release, Ashes of Time got a shiny new redo from Wong himself in 2008, resulting in a much shorter, remastered version of the flick, also bolstered with new music from Yo-Yo Ma. Retrospective making-of interviews with Wong, longtime DP Christopher Doyle, and cast members like Tony Leung Ka-Fai highlight the DVD, along with an extensive Q&amp;A session between Wong and Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman.Next: Silence of the Lambs Blu-ray9. Silence of the Lambs Blu-ray — 96%We close this RT on DVD by recommending one of the standout Blu-ray releases of the week: MGM’s Silence of the Lambs Blu-ray, which has been delayed numerous times so far. Was it worth the wait? If you’re a Hannibal Lecter fan ravenous for tons of bonus materials and behind-the-scenes stories about the making of Jonathan Demme’s serial killer thriller, you’ll enjoy the assortment of deleted scenes (count ’em — 22 total!), featurettes, outtakes and making-of documentaries included here. Add to that the film’s lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and 1080p visual presentation, and you’ve got the perfect way to revisit this chilling classic — along with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, japanese, zero, reviews, TLC, VOD, richard, Photos, on, Emmys, spanish, Red","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Exclusive-Australia-Scene-Beverly-Hills-Chihuahua-and-More"},{"id":"47614704237695","title":"Cannes 2009: RT Interview – Sally Hawkins on We Want Sex","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: RT Interview - Sally Hawkins on We Want SexFresh from the Golden Globe, she announces new project.by Joe Utichi | May 20, 2009 |  CommentsThe Golden Globe seems to have done Sally Hawkins well. After winning the award for her part in Mike Leigh‘s hilarious Happy-Go-Lucky, having her name attached to any project seems to have become an instant arbiter of interest. As we meet with Hawkins in Cannes, where she’s announcing her role in new film We Want Sex, due to start shooting soon, she’s fielding interest from all the glossies as well as the usual selection of film mags and broadsheets — a sure sign of a star in the making.Hawkins at the Cannes photocallThe film, which is being directed by Calendar Girls‘ Nigel Cole (an RT fan, he tells us) and Brit producing favourite Stephen Woolley, is the tale of female workers in the Ford Dagenham plant in the late 60s who’d work long hours in terrible conditions while earning significantly less than their male counterparts. In 1968, when they’re reclassified by Ford as ‘unskilled’ they down tools and march on Westminster with improperly unfurled banners declaring, “We Want Sexual Equality,” from where the title originates. Hawkins explains more.[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011399[/tomatometer]Can you tell us about your character in the film, Rita?Sally Hawkins: Rita’s brilliant. She’s a fiery, feisty, intelligent and passionate woman in 1968 and she’s suddenly plunged into this world of politics. She’s a housewife, a seamstress and she’s working at the Ford factory in Dagenham suddenly fighting for equal rights and pay and leading this feminist fight in the 1960s.How important were these women?SH: Without these women at the Ford factory there’d have been no equal pay act of the 1970s and she galvanises the whole thing. It’s such a brilliant story and one that you think God why hasn’t this been told before? It’s so silly it hasn’t been told. It’s about these housewives being thrust into the world of politics on almost a global scale. Because of the strikes, and it wasn’t just a day strike as it started, they suddenly realised that the fight was much bigger. The more they fought the more they realised how important it was and this weight of responsibility and how hard they had to fight.It rocked the whole industry and the trade unions at the time. Waves travelled across the world. In Michigan, at the Ford factory there, there was this fat cat sitting at the top of the tree realising this woman in Dagenham piping up was suddenly affecting his work. It’s a great feel-good movie because you realise that without these women the whole industry came to a standstill. They were making the head rests, the interiors of these cars, and so without these women there was no interior and Ford had an image to maintain. It was very skilled work.Have you met any of the women?SH: I hope to. I’ve just dipped a toe into the research, really, and now I begin. This is day one. I go back home and do all the work! I know Stephen Woolley has met some of the women, and Rita’s sort of an amalgamation of the many women at the forefront at the time. There’s a few women that were right at the forefront quite similar to Rita, and they talk about it just as passionately today.Does it make it easier to have those points of reference?SH: Maybe. I’m not sure it makes it easier, perhaps it’s just different. You still feel a tremendous weight of responsibility. You want them to be pleased and for their voices to be heard. You want to get their particular tone right, and that’s quite an unusual thing. I do feel there’s a responsibility there, and I feel very honoured to be asked to do it.Will the experience with Mike Leigh help?SH: I think it will. I can use that experience of being thrust into this world and being forced to think on her feet. It’s such an emotional story and it’s emotionally on many, many levels. Not just politically, where it sort of stirs you, and not just as a woman or for factory workers or workers in hard situations today, it just stirs the emotions. It made me cry when I read it, a few times actually, with joy and also the frustration of it. It’s relevant on a personal level and it’s still relevant today.We Want Sex goes before cameras on 29th June 2009 and will shoot for seven weeks on location in the UK.

It’s a big, flashy biopic driven by the infectious sounds of Lavoe’s Salsa songs – a pure vanity project, as Anne Thompson aptly writes – and what’s more, J.Lo and Marc Anthony went from just friends to husband-and-wife during pre-production on the film. Add to that a built-in audience, fans of Lavoe and the Nuyorican Salsa movement, and Picturehouse’s reported $6 million buy seems a smart move. The Leon Ichaso-directed flick is expected to hit theaters next summer.Canadian actress Sarah Polley had her directorial debut, “Away From Her,” premiere in the prestigious Gala program at TIFF; festival buzz pegged it as a hot ticket film. So it came as some surprise when it was picked up – not surprise that it sold, but that genre distributor Lionsgate was the one to seal the deal. “Away From Her” stars Julie Christie as a woman whose loving, longstanding marriage is threatened by her increasing mental deterioration due to Alzheimer’s disease, adapted from a short story by author Alice Munro. Lionsgate plans a spring 2007 release, expected to emulate the year-long Oscar campaign of last year’s winner, “Crash.”John Waters and \"This Filthy World\" director Jeff Garlin, whose pic comes courtesy of Netflix’s Red Envelope labelAnother planned spring release is “The Prisoner: Or How I Tried To Kill Tony Blair,” from the director of “Gunner Palace.” The visually-enhanced documentary tells the true story of an Iraqi journalist and his two brothers who were held at Abu Graib for nine months, interrogated, and eventually released by the American government. Netflix’s new distribution arm, Red Envelope, bought the pic; with plans to add footage to the now-60-minute film, “The Prisoner” will likely see theaters next spring.Audiences can also look forward to seeing short film compilation \"Paris, Je T’aime\" early next year. First Look Pictures purchased North American rights mid-week, as the pic, a seventeen-part ode to Paris dedicated to each one of the cities’ neighborhoods, screened here after debuting in Cannes. Among the many international stars and directors involved are Steve Buscemi, Elijah Wood, Natalie Portman, Bob Hoskins, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Nick Nolte, Ludivine Sagnier, and Maggie Gyllenhaal; and Alfonso Cuaron, Walter Salles, Gurinder Chadha, Nobuhiro Suwa, Wes Craven, Alexander Payne, and the Coen brothers.The Weinstein Co. snatched up two very different pics earlier in the fest. “Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show,” which follows the actor and four comedians on a 30-day stand-up tour, sold for $2.5 million; teen slasher pic “All The Boys Love Mandy Lane” was a pricier deal at $3.5 million, despite a lack of recognizable cast members.Who will be next to make a deal? Perhaps Paul Verhoeven (here with star Carice Van Houten), whose \"Black Book\" premiered at Toronto…Hong Kong director Johnny To had three films in the festival, as his Triad intrigues “Election” and “Election 2” screened together as a Vanguard double feature and “Exiled” played in the Special Presentations category. “Exiled,” received well both at Venice and at Toronto, was sold to Magnolia Pictures and will be released sometime next year.A number of films closed deals even before the festival began, including the Morgan Freeman starrer, “10 Items Or Less” (THINKFilm); Michael Apted’s 18th century pic, “Amazing Grace” (Samuel Goldwyn Films/Roadside Attractions); “Dixie Chicks – Shut Up And Sing” (The Weinstein Co.); and Werner Herzog’s “Rescue Dawn” (MGM).Many more festival films are expected to close distribution deals out of their Toronto screenings. Pics by established directors are likely to sell, like Paul Verhoeven’s WWII thriller “Black Book” and Hirokazu Kore-eda’s samurai drama “Hana.” American pics with stars like the Joan Allen-Jessica Lange “Bonneville” and the Reese Witherspoon-Christina Ricci “Penelope” are also expected to make deals, despite garnering less than stellar, mixed reviews.For our full Tomatoes in Toronto festival coverage, click here!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"&, cancelled, Arrangement, thriller, Shondaland, Fox, streaming, Fresh, thriller, Cannes, caribbean, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"toronto-away-from-her-the-prisoner-el-cantante-and-more-purchased-at-fest"},{"id":"47614733619341","title":"Fantastic New Pics from Yimou’s \"Golden Flower\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Fantastic New Pics from Yimou's \"Golden Flower\"by Scott Weinberg | November 1, 2006 |  CommentsI’ll keep this short and sweet: If you’re a fan of movies like \"Hero\" and \"House of Flying Daggers,\" you probably have a rather large interest in seeing Zhang Yimou‘s latest, \"Curse of the Golden Flower.\" And now there’s all sorts of production stills and featurettes available for your perusal.Check out all the cool stills over at TwitchFilm.net, and then head on over to the flick’s official site for a lot more goodies.Synopsis, courtesy of ComingSoon.net: \"In the spirit of such landmark Asian films as Akira Kurosawa‘s \"Ran\" from Japan and Zhang Yimou’s own \"Hero\" and \"House of Flying Daggers,\" \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" promises to be Zhang Yimou’s most colorful and biggest production to date, fusing high drama and romantic intrigue with the best of contemporary martial arts.

BladeIts middle-of-the-road Tomatometer score belies its outsized influence and place in comic-book cinema. In our latest podcast ep, we're giving \"the Daywalker\" the respect he deserves.by RT Staff | February 4, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by ©New Line Cinema/courtesy Everett Collection)With 22 years of hindsight and history since its release,&nbsp;many writers and critics have pointed to Marvel comic-book adaptation Blade as the dawn of the modern superhero in film –&nbsp;or, at least, a wonderfully bloody bridge between the Batman &amp; Robin doldrums and the X-Men and Spider-Man films that kicked off our current golden age. But at the time of its release, Blade –&nbsp;though a hit –&nbsp;never really connected with critics as anything more than a routine actioner-of-the-week.It wasn’t that they bared their fangs, exactly:&nbsp;The movie is Rotten on the Tomatometer, but very close to Fresh at 56%, and most reviews at the time singled out star Wesley Snipes for his charismatic turn as the titular “daywalker” and heralded the movie’s fight scenes and set pieces. It’s just that they couldn’t see what many can see now with two decades of moviegoing to help us along: that Blade not only changed the game for comic-book movies, and opened up the door for R-rated superhero fare like Deadpool and more, but that its style and aesthetic would become iconic –&nbsp;and frequently imitated.So it is that we’re sinking our teeth deep into Stephen Norrington’s action-horror flick and giving it its due in the latest ep of our podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong. Joining hosts Jacqueline Coley and Mark Ellis to discuss everything Blade –&nbsp;from the awesomeness of the blood rave and the Wesley Snipes of it all to the movie’s outsized cinematic influence and what we can expect when Mahershala Ali takes on the character in the MCU –&nbsp;is stand-up comic, actor, and former pro-wrestler Jay Washington.Will he agree with Coley that the events of the movie all come down to one villain’s “twinkle”?

Well, the original Snake Plissken (that’d be Kurt Russell, of course) is none too happy about the decision.Mr. Russell actually winced when asked about the Butler doing it. And not exactly for the reasons you might think. Check out this quote: \"I will say that when I was told who was going to play Snake Plissken, my initial reaction was ‘Oh, man!’ [Russell winces]. I do think that character was quintessentially one thing. And that is, American.\"So maybe in this new version, Plissken isn’t American. Or heck, maybe Butler will employ an American accent. It’s been known to happen.And when asked if he’d consider a cameo role in the new version of \"New York,\" Kurt got even more animated: \"\"(Expletive) that! I am Snake Plissken!

He plans to either take a rest or do a smaller movie next, citing the tolls in doing movies like \"Superman Returns\" and \"X-Men.\"When asked if he’ll return to direct another \"X-Men\" movie, director Richard Donner answered for Singer that he will.

Vying for your pennies this weekend we have Daniel Craig in non-Bond mode for the WWII epic Defiance. Already a big festival hit, Danny Boyle‘s Slumdog Millionaire finally hits the UK cinemas, as do two US comedies in the Apatow-vein, Role Models and Sex Drive. So what did the British critics have to say?Defiance tells the incredible true story of the Bielski brothers, a trio of Jewish resistance fighters in Belarus, who saved thousands of lives through their actions in WWII. Directed by Edward Zwick and starring Daniel Craig, Jamie Bell and Liev Schreiber, Defiance is an all-action epic with an amazing true story at it’s heart, but it has split the critics. Currently standing at 52% on the Tomatometer, most critics were wowed by the previously rarely heard story, but felt the production was let down by clichéd narrative, drab cinematography and an all-round muddled approach to the central story. Xan Brooks of The Guardian summed up the general consensus:“Defiance makes a noise but leaves no echo. It feels progressively more bogus and less significant the further it recedes from view, and myths are meant to wax in the memory, not wane.”Danny Boyle has been a stalwart of British cinema since breaking onto the scene first with Shallow Grave, then the critically acclaimed Trainspotting. Always defying convention, Boyle has tried his hand at many genres, and has now turned his eye to Bollywood, with his Mumbai-set Slumdog Millionaire. With no Rotten ratings compiled from the UK reviews, Slumdog proudly stands at a very healthy, and Certified Fresh, 94% on the Tomatometer. There was universal praise for its uplifting tone, inspirational fairytale story, and stunning use of location and setting. Rob Daniel, Sky Movies, said about the film:“Hard hearts may balk at the unashamed sentiment, black and white morality, and question-flashback contrivances, but let them eat pie and mash: this is a tangy banquet of smile-on-the-face feel good.”Role Models and Sex Drive hit the UK cinemas this week both boasting impressive current US-comedy pedigree. Role Models stars Paul Rudd, Seann William-Scott and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (AKA McLovin of Superbad fame) in a comedy about two thirty-something slackers on community service, whilst Sex Drive features Clark Duke, James Marsden and Seth Green in a teen coming-of-age road movie. Role Models is currently faring better on the Tomatometer at a Certified Fresh 76%, whilst Sex Drive is lagging behind at 42% overall, but both films tallied a similar number of fresh ratings with the UK critics, so if a laugh-out-loud comedy is what you are looking for this weekend, you are spoilt for choice. Nigel Andrews of The Financial Times said of the two films:“Neither film wins a prize for visual style.

As the E3 expo bombards us this week with new games, new technologies, and new dimensions (highlighting the diminishing differences between gaming and cinema), we’re presenting a list of 14 iconic directors and the games they’d be adept at pulling out of your TV and plastering onto the big screen.ContraA film by John McTiernanThe game: Awesome weapons, rockin’ soundtrack, brutal difficulty.&nbsp;Konami Code mandatory. If you weren’t saving the princess, you were probably&nbsp;addicted to Contra.Why McTiernan? John McTiernan. The man behind&nbsp;Die Hard and Predator. Also the&nbsp;man behind bars for conspiring with Anthony Pellicano. McTiernan needs a comeback project bad. Enter Contra. It’s about bad guys getting wasted&nbsp;and big explosions in the jungle, inside laboratories, up waterfalls, and at the&nbsp;dark heart of an alien lair. Exactly the red-blooded, destroy-all-monsters freak&nbsp;show McTiernan (and cinema!) needs these days.Earthworm JimA film by Tim BurtonThe game: A radioactive spacesuit transforms an ordinary earthworm&nbsp;named Jim into a walking, talking, marginally intelligent superhero.Why Burton? This game’s got action, a strong set of characters, immature&nbsp;humor (what’s not to love about a final boss called Queen Pulsating, Bloated,&nbsp;Festering, Sweaty, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt?), and fantastically&nbsp;twisted art design. All it needs now is a guy like&nbsp;Burton to pull&nbsp;it all together and make it palatable for the Hot Topic demographic. One question,&nbsp;though: should it be live-action or animated?The Oregon TrailA film by Terrence MalickThe game: An educational odyssey of covered wagons, rifle hunting,&nbsp;disease, and long, horrifying winters. Option to cannibalize friends would’ve&nbsp;made this game easier.Why Malick? Only one man can depict this game’s sparseness. (After all,&nbsp;most of The Oregon Trail is spent sitting, reading updates why you&nbsp;shouldn’t turn it off.) Only&nbsp;Malick&nbsp;will deliver the meditative stares into the western plains, symbolic shots while&nbsp;buying a wagon axle, the pathetic desperation of frantically hunting squirrel,&nbsp;and the dysentery. Oh, God, all the dysentery.Little Big PlanetA film by Michel GondryThe game: Diminutive sackpeople run, jump, and solve puzzles. Stages&nbsp;are made out of cardboard, toys, and other assorted household items.Why Gondry? A major part of Little Big Planet is its deep,&nbsp;mind-blowing content creation mode, resulting in machinimas like&nbsp;a puppet theater version ofDuck Hunt, a marriage proposal&nbsp;disguised as a level,&nbsp;and recreations of Matthew&nbsp;Barney’s movies. So let’s see:&nbsp;Michel Gondry&nbsp;adapting a game about sackpeople who inhabit a world made out of disparate&nbsp;items. Too obvious? What about if Gondry made a feature-length movie/game using&nbsp;only the Little Big Planet content creator? Maybe that’ll quiet the&nbsp;games-aren’t-art troglodytes for a while. (Apologies to Ebert.)The SimsA film by Robert AltmanThe game: Humans visit and interact with each other, while looking&nbsp;for jobs, buying things for their house, and making babies.Why Altman? The late master would’ve had no problem mining the comedy and&nbsp;drama from Will Wright’s game of manners. House parties! Rooms tackily dressed&nbsp;in leopard prints by teenage girls! People putzing around, doing chores! All&nbsp;filtered through&nbsp;Altman‘s&nbsp;trademark wandering camera and overlapping dialogue! It’d be a swirling&nbsp;microcosm of boring human behavior that only Altman could make fascinating.Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?A film by David FincherThe game: The ACME Detective Agency deciphers clues and hints to&nbsp;discover the whereabouts of master thief Carmen Sandiego and her henchmen.Why Fincher?Fincher‘s&nbsp;eye for minutiae and detail (a foundation of the Carmen Sandiego games),&nbsp;proven proficiency at creating period locations, and his calculated, clean&nbsp;directorial style make him a perfect fit for the series. Sure, it’ll be like Zodiac. But with time travel.Katamari DamacyA film by Tim and EricThe game: The King of All Cosmos commands his son to roll up every&nbsp;object and living thing on Earth using sticky multicolored balls.Why Tim and Eric? Look at the picture of Katamari Damacy. Now look&nbsp;at the picture of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!! creators&nbsp;Tim Heidecker and&nbsp;Eric Warheim. How are this game and these nutjobs not a match made in chemically-induced heaven? Both make frequent use of&nbsp;rainbows, both execute ideas with deadpan creepiness, and both fuse their WTF&nbsp;sensibilities with bursts of surprising earnestness. Tim and Eric can create&nbsp;insanity with no money. Imagine what’ll happen if they get their hands on a few&nbsp;million bucks and a franchise about the cheerful psychedelic destruction of the&nbsp;world.JoustA film by Terry GilliamThe game: Knights on various flying birds lance each other over pits&nbsp;of rising lava for survival and sweet scores.Why Gilliam? Sure, there’s no real plot to speak of but&nbsp;Gilliam has&nbsp;never been particularly strong at emotionally investing viewers into storylines.&nbsp;His strength lies in premise and visuals, and what’s more visually appealing&nbsp;than watching dudes wearing visors, jousting atop ostriches, buzzards, storks,&nbsp;and even the occasional pterodactyl?Dance Dance RevolutionA film by Baz LuhrmannThe game: Loud music, lots of arrows, and a dance pad.Why Luhrmann? So Dance Dance Revolution is fairly lame. You’re&nbsp;synchronized jumping, you’re spreading your legs, you’re making a public&nbsp;spectacle of yourself to house music. It’ll takeBaz Luhrmann,&nbsp;he of resolutely flamboyant vision, to take the game’s frantic movement and&nbsp;cascade of color and noise, whilst adding a dramatic back story (probably&nbsp;something like West Side Story meets Step Up), to turn Dance Dance Revolution into a kitsch pop masterpiece.PaperboyA film by Larry ClarkThe game: A week in the life of a paperboy hurling news and&nbsp;contending with occupational hazards like runaway trucks, killer bees, and the&nbsp;Grim Reaper.Why Clark? Paperboy took gaming out of the realms of fantasy and&nbsp;science fiction, and dropped it onto the streets of suburbia (albeit a bizarro&nbsp;version where delivery became life and death). Meanwhile,&nbsp;LarryClark inhabits the insides of homes that subscribe to these papers;&nbsp;showing the teenage bohemian squalor and debauchery that go on behind porch doors.&nbsp;Combine the two and we’ll get a film that espouses a world view operating on&nbsp;extremes: sex and drugs on the inside, werewolves and breakdancers on the&nbsp;outside.RampageA film by&nbsp;Bong Joon-hoThe game: Three humans who have mutated into a giant monkey, lizard,&nbsp;and rat proceed to destroy every major city (and each other), coast to coast.Why Bong? At first, we nominated Cloverfield‘s&nbsp;Matt Reeves for the job, but, you know what? Rampage needs to be&nbsp;funny and Joon-ho Bong needs to make his big budget debut. Bong demonstrated in 2007’s&nbsp;The Host he can&nbsp;combine violent creature feature with deadpan comedy. Now, let’s see if he can&nbsp;prove himself with something multiplied 50 times in size. And with three of&nbsp;them. Hell, throw in a major plotline about trying to save the humans still&nbsp;trapped deep inside these cranky freaks and we’re talking best kaiju&nbsp;movie ever.Madden NFL ’94A film by John MaddenYeah,&nbsp;John Madden‘s the guy who did Shakespeare inLove. Yeah, we know this joke is awesome. We’re going to leave this&nbsp;as is and continue on.Animal CrossingA film by Spike JonzeThe game: It’s like The Sims: Twee Town. Animals and cute&nbsp;monsters explore, talk, fish, catch bugs, and buy a lot of crap they’ll never&nbsp;use from a raccoon named Tom Nook.Why Jonze? Maybe this is just based on our ardent desire for Where theWild Things Are to be the greatest movie ever made. And to see&nbsp;Spike Jonze&nbsp;to follow that up with more tenderhearted epics about giant freaky talking&nbsp;animals. Now while Jonze is a fabulist like his peers, he’s also more willing&nbsp;than Gondry, Jared Hess, and Wes Anderson to add to his projects some darkness,and a little real-world grounding. If anyone wants to see the logic of a&nbsp;Nintendo game translated for a wide movie audience, it’s gonna need to be&nbsp;Spiked.Operation WolfA film by Sylvester StalloneThe game: Take hold of the positional gun and blast through endless&nbsp;bad guy waves, via uninterrupted panoramic pans of jungles, villages, and&nbsp;insurgent camps. It’s like Bela Tarr meets Michael Bay!Why Stallone? With Rambo under his&nbsp;belt and TheExpendables currently filming,&nbsp;Stallone‘s&nbsp;going to need one more to finish his trilogy revival of insanely aggressive&nbsp;1980s machismo. I propose Operation Wolf. Something that requires no&nbsp;plot, no backstory, just reel-to-reel chaos and carnage. “There MUST be a way to&nbsp;cram more violence into 90 minutes,” Bill Watterson once wrote. Stallone’s the&nbsp;only filmmaker these days willing to take that bet.Are you listening, Hollywood? Perfect Tomatometers are practically guaranteed for any of these projects!

There was the PG-13 rating, and the fact that it’s been 12 years since Willis’ iconic Det. John McClane was on the case. Fear not, critics say.The pundits are calling \"Live Free Or Die Hard\" one of the series’ best installments, a popcorn-ready throwback to the pre-CG days of crazy stuntwork. Despite the title, the setting for the latest \"Die Hard\" isn’t New Hampshire; it’s Washington, D.C., where a group of super-hackers (led by Timothy Olyphant) are plotting to attack America’s computer infrastructure and bring the nation to its knees. McClane teams with a cyber geek to stop them; rousing pyrotechnics ensue. Critics say that while the plot is beyond preposterous, it’s of little matter with stunts and action this exhilarating and intense. And they also note that Bruno settles nicely into his iconic role. At 76 percent on the Tomatometer, \"Live Free\" is not only Certified Fresh, it’s the second-best-reviewed \"Die Hard\" after the original. (Check out RT’s interview with Bruce Willis here.)All these years later, and still no CGI.Die Hards:————96% — Die Hard (1988)66% — Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990)47% — Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"hispanic, halloween, Annual, comedy, emmy, movie, best, Games, america, we, Discovery, Apple, Western, Women's, Guild","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"critical-consensus-yippeekiyay-live-free-or-die-hard-is-certified-fresh"},{"id":"47614863790288","title":"Sydney Pollack dies aged 73","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sydney Pollack dies aged 73A first look back at the work of the legendary director, producer and actorby Joanna Cohen | May 26, 2008 |  CommentsAcademy Award-winning director, Sydney Pollack, has died at the age of 73.

Today, we’ve got some heavier seasonal fare — wartime dramas, family heartache, and a touch of yuletide murder.**The holidays are here, and it’s time to break out the sleds, roast the chestnuts, and watch a movie or five about yuletide magic (or a decided lack thereof). And when in doubt regarding your best viewing for any occasion, as always, we’re here to help; the merry elves at Rotten Tomatoes have listed the Tomatometers, checked them twice, and will be presenting, during the Five Days of Christmas, the best-reviewed holiday films in the following categories: Classics, Comedies, Animated/Children’s, Dramas, and Thrillers. Pour yourself a cup of eggnog and get ready for some fine seasonal viewing!**Top Five Holiday DramasIt might be the season to be jolly, but even Santa himself would go a little nuts if he couldn’t mellow out and give all that eye-twinkling a rest once in awhile. Whether the holidays put you in a reflective mood, or you just can’t stomach another 90 minutes of old-fashioned Christmas cheer, here are the five freshest dramas of the season!5) 8 Women (2002) 77%If you aren’t well-versed in French comedy murder mysteries, you may be unfamiliar with director Francois Ozon‘s \"8 Women\" — think of it as sort of like \"Clue,\" only with less Martin Mull and more females. (And musical numbers.) The plot is too intricate to get into here; suffice it to say a house full of women find their holiday preparations interrupted by an unexpected murder mystery, and much singing and dancing ensue. What would the holidays be without a little good-natured Sapphic love and tragicomic family intrigue?Starring: Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle HuppertDirected by: Francois Ozon4) Joyeux Noël (2006) 78%Based on the true stories of Christmas ceasefires on the front lines of World War I in 1914, \"Joyeux Noël\" isn’t what you’re looking for if you’re in the mood for a madcap holiday comedy, but for an extraordinary example of what the season can mean to people from all walks of life — even those on opposite sides of a battlefield — you could hardly make a better choice. With a pan-European cast led by Daniel Bruhl and Diane Kruger, \"Joyeux Noel\" was also last year’s French-language nominee for the Best Foreign Film Oscar.Starring: Diane Kruger, Daniel BruhlDirected by: Christian Carion3) A Midnight Clear (1992) 83%It’s easily one of the lesser-known films on our list, but no less worth seeking out — just take a look at the cast, which includes Ethan Hawke, John C. McGinley, Peter Berg, and Gary \"Lieutenant Dan\" Sinise. The plot, which centers around an American platoon in the waning days of World War II, has no shortage of cockles-warming holiday spirit, and Keith Gordon‘s Independent Spirit Awards-nominated screenplay may actually be one of the better ones on this list. Want to add something new to your holiday viewing rotation? Start with \"A Midnight Clear.\"Starring: Gary Sinise, Ethan HawkeDirected by: Keith Gordon2) Little Women (1994) 89%By our count, director Gillian Armstrong‘s 1994 adaptation of Louisa May Alcott‘s novel marked the story’s 18th trip to the screen, which makes its critical success an incredible exception to the cinematic law of diminishing returns. Of course, having a cast which includes Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, and Eric Stoltz doesn’t hurt. It goes without saying that the estrogen-impaired among us may be tempted to sneak off and watch a game while it’s on — if only to keep from sniffling at the injustice of scarlet fever.Starring: Susan Sarandon, Winona RyderDirected by: Gillian Armstrong1) Heidi (1937) 100%Like many 19th-century stories about children, \"Heidi\" has its share of mysterious illnesses and ridiculous plot twists, but for cute-as-a-button holiday cheer, you simply cannot beat Shirley Temple as the Alps’ most famous cinematic resident. Brew up some Swiss Miss, pop a few Ricola, and relax in front of the definitive film version of a timeless tale.

Beginning, as many feature filmmakers do these days, in the world of music videos, creating memorable short films for the likes of Blur and R.E.M., the pair burst into feature film with about as ambitious a project as one could imagine: Disney’s 2005 big-screen version of Douglas Adams‘ Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.Four years later and they present their follow-up, on a decidedly more pint-sized scale, Son of Rambow is a tribute to the sort of carefree youth film fans know only too well, as nippers Will and Carter take to the woods after a viewing of First Blood and decide to make their own sequel. A huge hit at Sundance, the film is out now in the UK and will find a release in the US on 2nd May and in Australia on 4th September. RT caught up with Jennings to find out more about the film, and how a certain other movie this year has had its own impact…When we spoke to you about Hitchhikers three years ago, you were talking about this movie then…Garth Jennings: Yeah, we were trying to get it made when we started Hitchhikers, and when you get offered a job like that you can’t not do it. Getting a chance to do a big movie that you love so much is the chance of a lifetime so we put this on hold and came back to it.What was it about this idea that so excited you?GJ: When Nick and I were first discussing the idea, it was kind-of funny the idea of kids making their own action movie. We all used to do it as kids. But there’s that thing, as well, of thinking back to that age when you have no fear and no concern for the consequences of your actions whether they’re dangerous or stupid or cruel, you know. You just kind-of go for it.“When you see First Blood way before you’re supposed to be seeing it, you think this is the coolest thing you’ve ever seen.”There’s a lovely, uplifting feeling about trying to capture that and that’s what we were trying to do, really, with Son of Rambow. Before we’d really worked out the plot we had this mission to make the film that made us feel like we used to do. It was never going to be slavish to reality – it was always going to be a romantic view of that time. Stand By Me has a similar sort of thing where it’s all heightened and they’re dodging big trains and it’s a little fantastical, but it’s got such a lovely feeling about it and even though I didn’t grow up in that period, that coming-of-age story is universal and timeless.This particular coming-of-age story is also quite special for anyone who discovered film as a kid, because this is what we were doing.GJ: Most of the fundamental influences come at that age. Whether they’re positive influences or negative ones they come around those formative years and when you see First Blood way before you’re supposed to be seeing it and you live on the edge of a forest you think this is the coolest thing you’ve ever seen. This man has a knife and a stick, he can sew up his own arm, he can do everything including take on 200 guys. I loved it.I guess it’s the idea of escaping to this magical world where these things are possible as well…GJ: Yeah, and having friends that you can do that with. It’s harder to keep that when you get older – things change, things become more serious, it’s about looking cool and all that sort of stuff. There’s this lovely window before all of that kicks in where you’re really uninhibited and you really can do anything you like. It’s sort-of lovely and you don’t even realise it when you’re going through it. It’s only after that you remember and you go, “That was brilliant.” We did whatever we wanted – eating as much ice cream as we wanted and making as many silly movies as we could.You haven’t even got to the point where people are saying, “You have to pass this exam and if you don’t pass this exam you won’t work and if you can’t work you’ll be miserable.” You’d have said, “No, I’m going to make things like this for the rest of my life.” What more does there need to be to life, apart from making trenches in the forest and living there for a few days?Did you get the opportunity to regress while you were making the film?GJ: Not really, the regressing bit happens while you’re writing because you’re trying to remember what you’d have done in the situations you’re writing, but as soon as you start making it you’re right into, “We’re running out of time people! Let’s get a move on!” There’s no time to stop and soak up how it used to be!Bill and Will are so brilliant in the film, I can’t imagine working with them was anything but a joy.GJ: They were the big thing for us, because it’s tricky casting kids who’ve either never acted before or who have acted so much that they’re like little mini-adults. Professional tiny people. These guys hadn’t done anything, and it was lovely that they had the confidence to do whatever we asked them to do and to not try and show off in any way. They weren’t at all self-conscious.They come from very solid families, the families were never interested in pushing them into show business, and that’s a big part of it. They’re so sweet, these kids, and they really were having the time of their lives. Their entire summer holiday was spent on the set of Son of Rambow jumping off trees and leaping about, it doesn’t get any better! I’d have loved to have been in their position!And now, of course, this is an eye-opener for them because the posters are going up and you guys are coming to talk to them. We did all the auditions in here, I think, and after five months it was like, “That’s the kid.” They were just amazing.It was a long process to find them, then?GJ: Yeah, five months. Our casting director went off to the schools and saw hundreds and hundreds of kids, whittled that down to the best and we see round two. With Bill, who plays Will Proudfoot, there was one kid who we thought was going to play the lead part, and dropped out the night before the call-back because he didn’t want to be famous or anything like that. The casting agent called and said, “I’m really sorry, he’s dropped out, but I’ve found this other kid and you have to see him.” It was Bill and we got him in the next day knowing he wouldn’t have time to learn the lines. In walked this sweet kid who didn’t know what was going on, and he had learned the lines and then he walked out again. He was the only one who didn’t try to be our friend, he just walked in and did his thing and left. It was instant – that was the guy. And it was the same with Will Poulter, it was extraordinary and instant.They sell the film in the end.“I thought [the new Rambo] was funny, but I don’t think it was trying to be funny.”GJ: I think you’re right. You do your best with the script and all the camerawork and the editing and all of the fancy bits, but if you don’t get them right it’s all worthless. It’s hard to get that right but because they’re so charming and because they became such great friends while making it, that comes across.The release of Rambo this year is the elephant in the room a little bit, who saw that coming?GJ: That was weird. When we started writing this eight years ago, as far as we were concerned that whole franchise – I hate that word, but it is – was well and truly over. The idea of another Rambo movie was a joke, because he would have been – as he is – in his sixties. It’s unbelievable that not only is it coming out in the same year but that they’re within months of each other. It’s crazy, but there you go.Did you enjoy it?GJ: I didn’t really enjoy it. I thought it was funny, but I don’t think it was trying to be funny. I don’t think it’s pretending to be anything other than what it is, that’s for sure, but as movies go it was a bit rubbish. People blew up a lot, I remember that, and I remember leaving before the emotional release. I could sense that coming, after the massacre when he’s just sitting on his big gun for ten minutes. He can’t move around anymore – it used to be a trap here, a trap there, “I’ll run around here and get you and then I’ll come over there.” None of that anymore, he just sits down for a bit. He’s dealt with the guy with the mirrored shades who’s so evil that he reflects the horror back at him and all that sort of stuff, but I couldn’t stick around for the last bit which was obviously going to tie back into the people of Burma and all that.But he doesn’t make those films thinking they’re anything other than they are and he even introduced it by saying, “You know, let’s be frank, I didn’t think I’d be doing this. I’m really old now and I’ve done the best I can, so there you go.” And then he walked off.Rocky was more successful, I think, at taking the idea that he was past it and running with that, but with Rambo he was still hammering nails with his hands and picking up snakes and doing all that stuff…Did its release cause you any problems?GJ: No, it was just a case of who owns what and then after we’d shown it at Sundance, making sure everyone was happy. We just worked out that instead of Paramount in the UK it would be distributed by Optimum because they’re owned by another company who own the rights to the Rambo movies. Those things all get worked out, but they just take forever, and in that time we got to go around all the film festivals and I’d never done that before and it was just marvellous.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Legendary, TV, Kemper, crime, female, Shondaland, Endgame, Network, Premium, Diego, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"director-garth-jennings-on-son-of-rambow-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47614918194406","title":"Hear Us Out: Rocky IV Is the Most Memorable Sequel in the Franchise","content":"Hear Us Outvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hear Us Out: Rocky IV Is the Most Memorable Sequel in the FranchiseFrom its outsized villain and political undertones to its memorable lines and, yes, its wealth of montages, Rocky IV still outshines its peers 35 years later.by Mark Hofmeyer | November 27, 2020 |  CommentsOn November 27th, 1985, audiences flocked to theaters to root for&nbsp;perennial underdog boxer Rocky Balboa&nbsp;yet again in&nbsp;Rocky IV, the&nbsp;third installment in the successful franchise to be both written and directed by its star,&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone. In the film, Rocky faces off against&nbsp;Russian boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a square-jawed, granite-fisted giant who kills Rocky’s best friend (and former rival) Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) during an ill-fated exhibition match.&nbsp;Stallone clearly drew inspiration for the film from another legendary fight of the 20th century:&nbsp;In 1938, American boxer Joe “The Brown Bomber” Louis faced German boxing champ Max Schmeling in&nbsp;a rematch heard around the world, as 70,000 screaming fans at New York’s Yankee Stadium watched Louis redeem an earlier loss to Schmeling and&nbsp;secure a&nbsp;victory not just for himself, but for American democracy. Swap out the Nazi-era Germans for Cold War Russians and add a tragic death for dramatic effect, and&nbsp;that basic outline should sound pretty familiar.Some might argue that Rocky IV’s&nbsp;jingoistic leanings and adherence to music-driven montages make it one of the lesser entries in the franchise. But after three films that saw Rocky evolve from a likable, leg-breaking enforcer to a world heavyweight boxing champ, this sequel earns its right to strip back its plot and simply focus on Rocky duking it out with a Russian titan for 15 rounds.&nbsp;Though it failed to strike a chord with critics,&nbsp;Rocky IV&nbsp;was a blockbuster smash that pulled in $332 million at the domestic box office (adjusted for inflation), and it remains a culturally relevant fan favorite 35 years after its release. Here’s why it still resonates with fans so much more than any of the other sequels.Apollo Creed’s Brutal and Surprising Death Still HurtsThough the MGM accountants&nbsp;tallying the box office totals and&nbsp;home video&nbsp;sales most likely didn’t mind, Stallone regrets killing off Apollo Creed to fuel&nbsp;Rocky IV’s&nbsp;revenge narrative, and it’s not hard to see why. Rocky and Apollo had endured so much punishment by 1985 that audiences&nbsp;had come to accept their&nbsp;skulls were essentially concussion-proof, so Apollo’s death at the hands of Ivan Drago was shocking. Sure, even those who didn’t watch the incredibly spoilery movie trailer could have guessed that the overly confident Apollo was going to lose to Drago, thereby setting up a rematch.&nbsp;But it’s hard to believe that any popcorn-munching audience expected to see Rocky cradling a dead Apollo in his arms while a murderous Russian dispassionately quips, “If he dies, he dies.”Part of what makes the death so cruel is that it was only supposed to be an exhibition match, and Apollo treats it as such. He dances his way through an elaborately staged entrance, complete with James Brown himself singing “Living in America.” When the fight finally starts, he prances around the ring, cheerful as ever, taunting Drago and throwing ineffectual jabs.&nbsp;Faster than you can say “Yo, Adrian,” Drago retaliates, and the atmosphere changes immediately as he batters&nbsp;Apollo&nbsp;from one corner of the ring to the next. When Apollo realizes what’s happening, his pride gets the better of him, and he insists Rocky not stop the fight no matter what — what follows still makes us scream at the screen 35 years later.Stallone directed this scene expertly, as the flashy entrance and cocksure antics&nbsp;give way to&nbsp;the shocking visual of Rocky’s white pullover stained red with Apollo’s blood. Some argue that using Apollo’s death as Rocky’s motivation is lazy, but it’s hard to debate how effective the shock was and how simply it sets up the iconic fight.The Training Montages Are LegendaryWhat makes Rocky IV a unique entry into the franchise is the 29 minutes of montage action, featured in eight separate scenes dispersed throughout the film. Some of them simply catch the viewer up on previous Rocky films, while others showcase the original songs by James Brown, Survivor, and John Caffer that Stallone commissioned for the film. The musical montages in particular were wise business decisions, as the soundtrack sold over a million copies and hit number 10 on the Billboard Top 200 list.The most iconic, perhaps greatest-ever montage happens after Rocky travels to Russia and begins a rustic training regimen that includes carrying logs, chopping down trees, and helping locals when their sleigh overturns in waist-high snow. His back-to-basics training, fueled by Survivor’s “Hearts on Fire,” is in stark contrast to that of Drago, whose&nbsp;routine sees him attached to heart monitors, running in cavernous halls, and pummeling things so hard they make Dwayne Johnson’s punches in Hobbs and Shaw&nbsp;seem like love taps. No, really: in Hobbs and Shaw, Johnson’s Luke Hobbs “only” punches with a force of 1235 psi (lbs. of pressure per square inch), but in Rocky IV, Drago hits&nbsp;register at 2150 psi (real-world boxers only average 1200-1700 psi). In other words, don’t sit in the front row of a Drago fight unless you want to feel the shockwave in your own ribs every time he lands a blow.Most importantly, though, the Rocky vs. Drago montage&nbsp;recalls&nbsp;the original 1976&nbsp;film,&nbsp;which&nbsp;depicts Stallone punching slabs of meat, downing raw eggs, and jogging up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Both are gritty, back-to-basics affairs that serve their purpose with maximum efficiency, and they’re awesome to watch.Ivan Drago Is A&nbsp;Villain for the AgesThanks to a&nbsp;spiky flat top and a chiseled, glycerin-soaked 6’5″ physique, Dolph Lundgren’s Ivan Drago is one of cinema’s most recognizable characters, and for good reason. Lundgren’s imposing physical presence would later lead to roles as a&nbsp;bionic supersoldier (Universal Soldier), a Marvel badass (The Punisher),&nbsp;He-Man (Masters of the Universe), and a guy who flips cars like they’re pancakes (Showdown in Little Tokyo). He also happens to be a Fulbright Scholar&nbsp;with a master’s degree in chemical engineering and a black belt in Kyokushin Karate.The one thing the Swedish-born actor realized he didn’t possess was the same kind of electric charisma that prior Rocky antagonists played by&nbsp;Carl Weathers, Hulk Hogan, and&nbsp;Mr. T&nbsp;flaunted effortlessly. So Lundgren worked with Stallone to capitalize on his stoic nature and subtle tics, crafting a machine-like uber-villain who might just have a little more lurking below the surface. Some critics like Roger Ebert called him “more of a James Bond villain than a Rocky-style character,” which isn’t exactly wrong — Richard Kiel’s Jaws comes to mind — but by focusing on Lundgren’s physical prowess and limiting his dialogue to a few memorable quotes, Stallone managed to get himself a nice little stew going. Believe it or not, Lundgren only delivered nine lines in the entire film, but with winners like “I must break you,” “You will lose,” and “If he dies, he dies” now entrenched in the&nbsp;pop culture vernacular, you’d have to admit he made them count.The Final Fight Manages to Feel FreshAfter two epic Apollo Creed fights and two short but thrilling brawls with Clubber Lang that saw Rocky going 2-for-4 and avenging losses to both fighters, audiences probably didn’t want to see the same formula repeated again. In the first two films, Apollo was either too cocky (and still won) or tired himself out chasing a knockout (and lost, though he could have won easily). After destroying&nbsp; Rocky easily in&nbsp;the third film,&nbsp;Clubber lost the second fight because Rocky got into his head, which&nbsp;resulted in a knockout after Rocky hit him so hard it sounded like a jet took off in the arena.What makes the fight between Rocky and Drago unique is the way Rocky makes Drago realize he’s a mortal. Drago has never faced a real challenge; his training partners seem like KO fodder, and Apollo clearly didn’t take him seriously. Sure, Drago’s power is near superhuman, and even when he misses, the air is enough to push Rocky back. But once Rocky opens up a cut on his face, and the crowd starts turning against him, he’s caught off guard, seemingly unprepared for any scenario in which he isn’t a dominating force. Rocky shatters Drago’s confidence and his nerves by standing toe-to-toe with him and forcing him&nbsp;to acknowledge and respect his iron will.The&nbsp;cherry on top is the&nbsp;catharsis of seeing Drago destroyed. In Rocky and&nbsp;Rocky II,&nbsp; Apollo was supremely charismatic, and you weren’t exactly rooting against him. In Rocky III, Clubber Lang is also magnetic and larger than life, and aside from his trash talk, he was just an excellent boxer Rocky had to overcome. Drago, however, killed Apollo, showed no remorse, trained on steroids, and represented America’s greatest threat during a tense period of the Cold War. When Rocky finally turns the tide of the fight and unleashes the decisive flurry on Drago, it’s thrilling and satisfying in a way that none of the franchise’s previous climactic bouts have been.Fun side note:&nbsp;In order to make the action more believable, Stallone and Lundgren actually punched each other during the fight, and at one point, Stallone insisted Lundgren “cut loose as hard as you can.” Stallone ended up in the ICU for four days.Its Influence Continues TodayWith an average of 89% on the Tomatometer and close to $400 million at the worldwide box office, Creed&nbsp;and Creed 2 reinvigorated the Rocky franchise, focusing on the rise of Adonis (Donnie) Creed (Michael B. Jordan) as a champion boxer under the tutelage of Rocky Balboa. The presence of Ivan Drago can be felt throughout the two films, as Adonis attempts to fight in the sport that killed his father and ultimately faces a Russian showdown of his own. In a clever callback to Rocky IV, Creed 2 specifically&nbsp;focuses on the battles between Donnie and Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan. Their first fight sees Donnie&nbsp;overwhelmed (like his father in Rocky IV), and the second meeting plays out like the Rocky/Ivan fight, as Viktor becomes dismayed that he can’t knock out Donnie and loses when Ivan throws in the towel to save his son from further punishment. The two Creed films owe a lot to the legacy of&nbsp;Rocky IV,&nbsp;introducing a new generation of&nbsp;fans&nbsp;to Ivan Drago.Even outside of the franchise, the wonderful College Humor 30 for 30 parody&nbsp;has racked up millions of views, and the legend of Lundgren sending Stallone to the hospital&nbsp;after a Swedish super punch has mad the rounds. Recently, Stallone announced he was working on a Rocky IV director’s cut; the news&nbsp;started trending on social media and the controversy surrounding&nbsp;the decision to remove the weird robot subplot has gotten a lot of press. People love Rocky IV, and that’s why 35 years later, it still inspires passionate discussion&nbsp;and remains one of the most popular sports films ever made.Rocky IV&nbsp;was released in theaters on November 27, 1985.Thumbnail image by&nbsp;(c)United Artists courtesy Everett CollectionOn an Apple device?

Blake was acquitted last March in a criminal murder trial, where the 72 year-old star of \"In Cold Blood\" and television’s \"Baretta\" stood accused of shooting his wife twice in the head in May 2001. The incident itself was something out of the movies: after dining out with Bakley one night in Studio City, CA, Blake left her sitting in his car while he went back to the restaurant to retrieve a gun he’d left behind. Upon returning to his car, Blake discovered his wife bleeding to death from gunshot wounds to the head. The subsequent media flurry unveiled the Blake marriage to be less than blissful; after a one-night stand in 1999, Blake had married Bakley only after a DNA test confirmed him as the father of their daughter, now 5 years old. Bakley, then a 44 year-old aspiring actress, was widely painted a con artist with a history of bedding older Hollywood stars (Jerry Lee Lewis, Christian Brando) and by many accounts garnered the resentment of her husband for scamming him into marriage.Prosecutors claimed this motive for murder in Blake’s criminal trial, but a lack of witnesses to the crime and DNA evidence compelled the jury to acquit. Not so the second time around, as civil jurors took eight days to decide that Blake had intentionally caused Bakley’s death by a 10-2 majority; co-defendant Earle Caldwell, Blake’s former bodyguard, was cleared of charges he conspired with Blake in the crime.The $30 million award goes to Bakley’s four children, including Blake’s young daughter Rosie — however, as O.J. Simpson did before him, Blake has already declared himself broke.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Hulu, play, game-of-thrones, 007, Annual","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"robert-blake-owes-30-mil-in-wrongful-death-suit"},{"id":"47614962979068","title":"Robin Williams Keeps Chatting About The Joker","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Robin Williams Keeps Chatting About The Jokerby Scott Weinberg | June 27, 2006 |  CommentsNo casting decisions have been announced just yet, so just relax.

Directed by Denzel Washington and written by Antwone Fisher himself, the Certified Fresh (78%) film centers around the story of Antwone Fisher (played brilliantly by Derek Luke) trying to find his footing in life after a childhood filled with physical, mental, and sexual abuse from his life in a foster home. Looking for a place where he can belong, Fisher joins the Navy, where his explosive temper leads him to counseling sessions with a Navy psychiatrist (Denzel Washington) who not only helps Antwone unearth his personal problems, but welcomes him into his own home — something Antwone has never experienced. The Blu-ray features commentary with Denzel Washington and producer Todd Black, cast interviews, a making of featurette, and a feature on how filming on a Navy base changed since 9/11 that could be of interest war movie buffs. For even the toughest of movie watchers, the human aspect of Antwone Fisher’s inspiring true story will tug at most anyone’s emotional heartstrings.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190943[/tomatometer]Jennifer’s BodyCritics didn’t much like this Diablo Cody-penned horror/comedy, and neither, it seems, did audiences — the film flopped after much pre-release hype, which probably oversold the Megan Fox lesbian liplock and raunchy redband elements to the point where everyone thought they’d seen the film. In truth, Jennifer’s Body was always going to be a tough sell, because it’s not gory enough to appease a horror audience, and it won’t satisfy young men hoping to drool over Fox’s body. With its high school hierarchy, douchebag dudes and intense central friendship between cheerleader Jennifer (Fox) and nerdy Needy (Amanda Seyfried), the film is less horror/comedy than teen grrrl cult movie; Kusama’s trashy direction and Cody’s whip-smart dialogue recalling Heathers and Ginger Snaps. Like those films, if it finds an audience, it’ll be here. The BD contains both Theatrical and “Extended” versions, the latter ramping up the gore; plus deleted scenes, two commentaries with Kusama and Cody, on-set diaries and amusing high school featurettes with Fox and Cody.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016397[/tomatometer]Planet of the ApesThere’s no denying that Planet of the Apes looks dated and quaint in the special effects department by today’s standards. Still, this heady blend of sci-fi and social commentary harkens back to a time in which the genre was more about ideas than hi-tech images; and Charlton Heston’s exasperated, intense performance is still something to behold. Planet of the Apes spawned a ton of sequels, a TV series, and a remake, but nothing tops the 1969 original and its widely-parodied-if-still-kinda-haunting finale. The 40th anniversary Blu-ray comes loaded with featurettes on the making of the film and its cultural impact, and there’s even a game and some in-movie pop-ups on the science behind the film, so if you’re a fan, you’ll want to get your paws on this.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1161030[/tomatometer]SunshineDanny Boyle is one of those directors who dabbles in a lot of different genres, from drug-fueled crime capers (Trainspotting) to horror (28 Days Later) to fantastical coming-of-age tales (Millions). And just before he went Oscar on us with Slumdog Millionaire, he released his entry into the sci-fi realm, 2007’s Sunshine. The story takes place in the not-so-distant future and centers around the crew of a spacecraft and their mission to reignite the sun; as they draw nearer to the dying star, problems arise, and it becomes apparent that some things aren’t as they seem. Some people had problems with the film’s third act, when the story takes a turn for the horrific, but Sunshine‘s mindbending story and chilling atmosphere still satisfied enough critics to earn Certified Fresh status. On Blu-Ray, the stunning visuals come through in spades, particularly in scenes displaying the sun in all its glory, and it’s a worthy addition to have in any hi-def collection.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1005846[/tomatometer]Die HardEveryone has their holiday movie traditions. Some go the Disney route, so go with live-action family comedies. However, cinephiles and action freaks would do well with Die Hard, the explosive 1988 Bruce Willis masterpiece. It’s only superficially about the holiday (it just happens to be set on Christmas Eve), but one should take any reason to see Willis at the top of his game, in a tense thriller that, while delivers the goods for violence seekers, is actually smart and something of a slow-burner. Willis doesn’t just go in guns blazing: he sneaks around the building, biding his time, taking out people quietly and one by one. Just like any smart NY cop would do.

When we last checked in with the series, which was created by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan and inspired by Michael Crichton’s 1973 film of the same name, Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) and Maeve (Thandie Newton), two robot characters who were initially programmed to bend at the whims of the park’s uber-rich clientele, had become fully sentient with violent results.Blind with vengeful rage, Dolores went on a murderous rampage. Before ultimately escaping the confines of the Westworld theme park, the killer host pillaged The Forge, the supercomputer holding all of the guest data the Delos corporation had been secretly stealing.&nbsp; She caused a flood, deleted a whole lot of those data pearls in the process, and installed her consciousness into the host replica of new Delos boss Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) before heading into the Valley Beyond.(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)Things for former brothel owner Maeve went a different direction, entirely. After her glitch woke her up, the sentient host infiltrated the inner-workings of the park, enlisting Hector, Armistice and the rest of their outlaw gang, as well as Head of Narrative Design, Lee Sizemore,&nbsp; to help in the search of her long lost daughter. Unfortunately for her, as she closed in on reuniting with the girl, Delores and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) rained hell upon the park, leaving Maeve shot. As she bled out, she watched her daughter exit the park for greener digital pastures with Native American host Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon).Discovering they were just pawns in a greater reality out-of-their reach is ultimately what drove each character’s journey after their awakening was complete. For Bernard, the right-hand to park-creator Dr. Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), his realization that he was a synthetic being this whole time — one who was created by Ford in the image of his former partner — was one of the show’s big reveals in its first season. This twist (and there were many) led Bernard to enable Dolores on her bloody journey all while attempting to pick up his own mental pieces, while he fell into an identity crisis, of sorts.(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)The HBO series delved further the&nbsp;white hat vs. black hat morality play originally introduced in season 1.&nbsp;It also filled in the blanks regarding the political drama unfolding behind the scenes within Delos. Less-than-savory struggles&nbsp;lie behind the character motivations of Charlotte, Dr. Ford’s tenacious young replacement, and Delos investor William (Jimmi Simpson) who evolved into the Man in Black (Ed Harris), the&nbsp;coldhearted gunslinger hell-bent on burning the whole park to the ground.The series, which puts the concepts of free will, corporate greed, and a towering god complex in a blender, gave viewers plenty of answers in the season 2 finale, only to lead us to many more questions once it all ended. Needless to say, ahead of its highly-anticipated return, which takes the story outside of the confines of the park and adds Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad)&nbsp;to the mix, expectations are running high. Does the new season live up to the hype? Here’s what the critics have to say:SEASON 3 IS A SLICK-LOOKING CYBERPUNK REBOOT(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)Ironically, the best part of Westworld Season 3 might be those overwhelming visual tableaus: the spectacular shots of a copter floating over a metropolis, the romantic European vistas of Maeve’s WWII world, and even the intimate hell that Caleb is going through. Westworld doesn’t just try to show us a haunted vision of the future, but it immerses us in it. — Meghan O’Keefe, DeciderTime has passed since the end of season 2, and we find Dolores dealing with her new life in the outside world. In Los Angeles, everything looks like Tesla’s version of Blade Runner, with Cybertruck police cars carving up a clean, Japan-inspired city. — Jennifer Bisset, CNETIronically, the best part of Westworld Season 3 might be those overwhelming visual tableaus: the spectacular shots of a copter floating over a metropolis, the romantic European vistas of Maeve’s WWII world, and even the intimate hell that Caleb is going through. Westworld doesn’t just try to show us a haunted vision of the future, but it immerses us in it. — Meghan O’Keefe, DeciderTHIS NEW COAT OF PAINT CAN’T COVER UP SOME CLUNKY STORYTELLINGWestworld wants to generate another existential conversation in Season 3, but even as the show swaps settings and introduces new faces, the details that make it come to life are perfunctory. — Brandon Katz, ObserverAction scenes are slick and easy-to-track, but they’re also detached, lacking the gleeful turns and grand lines that punctuated similar thrills from previous seasons. Backstory that used to be unveiled with a flourish is delivered sans showmanship, which can be refreshing when the new intel doesn’t warrant a whole to-do, but only contributes further to the new season’s straightforward execution. — Ben Travers, IndieWirePerhaps the flatness of its new setting might have served, or might eventually serve in the season’s second half, as ironic counterpoint: The peculiarity of the robot uprising exists against a backdrop so flat and familiar as to make it all the more intriguing. But what tends to happen instead is that the flatness inflects every corner of the story and sucks away the vibrancy. — Daniel D’Addario, Variety‘Westworld’ returns with the batteries charged in an energetic start.— Alberto Carlos, EspinofDOLORES IS A VENGEFUL ROBOT WORTH ROOTING FOR(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)Season 3 Dolores is a vast upgrade. She’s pissed off, but not blindly ruthless. She’s bent on giving humans what she thinks they deserve, but smart enough to know this world doesn’t operate like Westworld did. This is the kind of Dolores she should have been all along: a victim you feel empathy for with a cause worth fighting for — she’s seen the worst that humans can be and believes her kind is the next step in evolution. She’s not a one-note horseman of the robo-apocalypse. — Tim Surette, TV GuideDolores has often been a difficult character to track thanks to her regular identity crises, veering between damsel-in-distress and utterly unsympathetic villain, but in the third season, she finally seems to have hit a pleasant and steady middle-ground. We don’t fully know Dolores’ endgame, but we do know the ruthlessness with which she’ll pursue it and the remarkable capabilities she possesses to see it through. — Haleigh Fouch, ColliderAARON PAUL’S PERFORMANCE IS … FINE(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)Adding Paul as a new main character seems novel at first, but he quickly takes a backseat to everything else. — Chris Evangelista, SlashFilmAaron Paul walks sadly around a skyglass futuretropolis waiting for a popular smartphone app to assign him ATM robberies. — Darren Franich, EWIT’S STILL COOL AND QUITE CONFUSING(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)There’s still plenty to be confused about. Westworld is 100% back on its bullshit and, depending on how much you like your TV to be a rug-yanking crash course in skepticism, still presents beautiful illusion after beautiful illusion for you to doubt. — Jacob Oller, Paste MagazineAll of the standard questions Westworld brings up in viewers remain: Is this person real or a host? Is this something happening now, or a flashback or flash forward? What exactly is reality, anyway? If something feels real, and affects someone like a real trauma, does that mean it’s real even if it takes place in a virtual playground? — Ron Hogan, Den of GeekExpect the passions around “Westworld” to erupt once again when Season 3 arrives, confusion reigns and the series’ fans and detractors face off to defend their side. — Lorraine Ali, Los Angeles TimesWestworld&nbsp;season 3 premieres on Sunday, March 15 at&nbsp;9 p.m. ET/PT on HBO.Westworld: Season 3 (2020) 73%#1Adjusted Score: 77.497% Critics Consensus: Westworld successfully reboots itself by broadening its scope while tightening its storytelling clarity -- although some may feel that the soul has been stripped from this machine in the process.Synopsis: The third season of the drama series starts about three months after the ending of Season 2.
