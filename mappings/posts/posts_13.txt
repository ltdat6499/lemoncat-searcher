Chandor’s gritty crime drama and a Cannes-winning film starring Marion Cotillard. Then, we’ve got a few interesting selections you may not have had the chance to see in theaters. Read on for details:A Most Violent Year (2015) 90%Early on, A Most Violent Year was thought to be a contender for a handful of Academy Awards, due in large part to its pedigree, which included Oscar-nominated writer-director J.C. Chandor (Margin Call, All Is Lost) and a pair of fast-rising stars — Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac — who have amassed their own share of critical acclaim. Though the film ultimately didn’t net any nominations, critics still rated it Certified Fresh at 90 percent. The early ’80s-set thriller centers on an immigrant couple (Chastain and Isaac) who run a heating oil company and their attempts to make good on the American dream amid the rampant violent crime of New York City. It’s a heavy, slow burner of a drama full of strong performances — including supporting turns from David Oyelowo, Albert Brooks, and Alessandro Nivola — that probably deserves a watch.The Immigrant (2014) 87%Speaking of impressive casts, director James Gray lined up quite an ensemble for his own immigrant story, aptly titled The Immigrant. All three of his leads boast Academy Award nominations, and the film’s star, Marion Cotillard, earned a nod just this year for her work on Two Days, One Night. Cotillard plays Ewa Cybulski, a Polish immigrant who arrives at Ellis Island in 1921 and faces deportation, only to be saved by a charming schemer (Joaquin Phoenix) who forces her into prostitution. When the man’s magician cousin (Jeremy Renner) comes into her life, Ewa sees hope for the first time. Certified Fresh at 87 percent, The Immigrant won the Palmes d’Or at Cannes and earned praise for Cotillard’s performance, Gray’s sure-handed direction, and its stunning cinematography. If drama is your thing, this is a good week.&nbsp;ALSO AVAILABLE THIS WEEK:Happy Valley (2014) (88 percent), Amier Bar-Lev’s documentary profile of the football culture and recent controversy surrounding Penn State University.Killers (2014) (86 percent), a Japanese-Indonesian thriller about a serial killer and the journalist thousands of miles away he inspires to become a killer himself.The Voices (2015) (73 percent), starring Ryan Reynolds and Anna Kendrick in Marjane Satrapi’s (Persepolis) dark comedy about a seemingly normal man who suffers from hallucinations that influence him to kill.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-a-most-violent-year-the-immigrant-and-more"},{"id":"47612774342968","title":"10 Hidden Gems of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Stars","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Hidden Gems of The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Starsby Alex Vo and Ryan Fujitani | April 16, 2017 |  CommentsGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is fast approaching but did you know that its cast members have previously acted in other movies outside the franchise? And that some of them were good? We take the 10 biggest stars of Marvel’s intergalactic, planetary adventure and give you some Fresh and Certified Fresh movies of theirs that you may have missed. Put these on the mixtape!Chris Pratt&nbsp;(Peter Quill / Star-Lord)Film: Wanted&nbsp;(2008,  71%). This adaptation of the Mark Millar comic stars James McAvoy as an underachieving, over-medicated corporate drone who’s enlisted by the mysterious Angelina Jolie to join a secret fraternity of assassins, hone his hidden superhuman strength, and avenge his father’s murder.Role: A movie starring Angelina that made $350 million worldwide isn’t your normal “hidden gem,” but amidst the bullet curving and car chases it’s easy to forget Pratt’s role. He plays McAvoy’s delightful douchebag co-worker and memorably takes a keyboard to the face. Pratt essentially played the same dude in the first season of Parks &amp; Recreation&nbsp;before the character was re-written, turning him into a TV fan favorite and eventual legendary space outlaw.Watch TrailerZoe Saldana&nbsp;(Gamora)Film: Infinitely Polar Bear&nbsp;(2015,  82%).&nbsp;Sometimes when Mark Ruffalo gets mad, he turns into the green smashing Hulk. And sometimes he goes to the hospital and has his kids taken away from him, as in this bipolar disorder-addressing drama from Maya Forbes.Role: Saldana plays Ruffalo’s long-suffering wife, who moves herself and the kids into an apartment as her estranged husband gets help to get it together. Ruffalo puts in another of those highly-tuned sensitive performances, which Saldana matches scene for scene.Watch TrailerBradley Cooper&nbsp;(Rocket Raccoon)Film: The Midnight Meat Train&nbsp;(2008,  73%). The movie biz carves up another Clive Barker adaptation, this time telling the drenched tale of people getting butchered on a subway and the amateur photographer who makes it his quest to expose the truth.Role: Cooper plays the photographer, who becomes intensely obsessed with figuring out why the murders are taking place, at great risk to his health and relationship with his girlfriend. Studio politics effectively reduced this movie to being dumped directly to video, though it’s grown a small cult due to its unflinching gore and its mega-black ending.Watch TrailerMichael Rooker&nbsp;(Yondu)Film: Slither&nbsp;(2006,  86%).&nbsp;Guardians director James Gunn’s feature debut is a nasty little horror-comedy about a small town overcome by an alien parasite that begins its colonization of Earth by possessing a philandering car dealer. Before long, everyone’s pets are missing, the local livestock are turning up mutilated, and neighbor-on-neighbor violence is at an all-time high.Role: Rooker stars in Slither as Grant Grant, aka patient zero himself, the car dealer who becomes infected by an extraterrestrial slug and, in turn, whose mistress becomes the hive queen. The problem is, Grant still retains some of his human memories, and all of them lead back to his not-so-doting wife (Elizabeth Banks), who’s understandably less than thrilled to come home to a horribly disfigured man slowly transforming into a tentacled monster. It all amounts to a raucous mix of uncomfortable laughs and the ridiculous kind body horror that would make David Cronenberg proud.Watch TrailerKurt Russell&nbsp;(Ego)Film: Bone Tomahawk&nbsp;(2015,  91%).&nbsp;This surprisingly confident debut by writer/director S. Craig Zahler seamlessly introduces elements of horror into a deliberately paced Western about a local sheriff who leads a small party of gunslingers to face off against a tribe of ruthless cannibals after some of his townspeople are abducted.Role: Russell’s filmography is vast and varied, but this underseen thriller (and Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight, both from 2015) arguably makes the best use of his late-period gruffness and magnificent facial hair, and he is terrific as the sheriff who sacrifices everything for his town. The whole thing is a tightly wound slow build to a grisly, violent climax, and there are a few things in there you won’t be able to unsee.Watch TrailerBenicio Del Toro&nbsp;(The Collector)Film: Inherent Vice&nbsp;(2015,  73%).&nbsp;After the gold rush of the hippie era, reality and hard living sets in as 1970 rolls on in California. Perpetually stoned private dick Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix) is hired to solve a beguiling case while avoiding the LAPD and a life of responsibility.Role:&nbsp;Del Toro plays Doc’s attorney and occasional informant Sauncho. He gives a classically mumbly Benicio performance, but attach that to the film’s outsized characters and byzantine plot and it all weaves into a piquant psychedelic tapestry.Watch TrailerNathan Fillion&nbsp;(Simon Williams)Film: Waitress&nbsp;(2007,  89%). Adrienne Shelly’s smart and heartfelt romantic comedy centers on an unhappily married waitress (Keri Russell) who dreams of opening her own bakery and finds something akin to hope when her unwanted pregnancy leads to an affair with her equally married new physician.Role: Having done some space swashbuckling of his own (on FOX’s TV series Firefly and its follow-up feature film Serenity), as well as co-starring in another gem on this list (Slither), Nathan Fillion brings his effortless charisma to this decidedly understated charmer as the aforementioned doctor, striking up such a natural chemistry with Keri Russell that, maybe just for a little while, infidelity doesn’t seem like such a bad thing after all.Watch TrailerGlenn Close&nbsp;(Nova Prime)Film: Reversal of Fortune&nbsp;(1990,  92%).&nbsp;In the famous murder case of 1990, Claus von Bulow stands on trial, accused of sending his wife into a diabetic coma after pumping her with an overdose of insulin.Role: Close plays Claus’ wife Sunny and spends the entire movie with her eyes closed and her tongue hanging out of her mouth. Just kidding, reverse that: there’s plenty of Close and Jeremy Irons going at it in a dramatic exploration of this tense marriage.Watch TrailerElizabeth Debicki&nbsp;(Ayesha)TV Series: The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&nbsp;(2015,  68%).&nbsp;Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer play American and Russian secret agents who begrudgingly join forces during the Cold War-era ’60s to track down a nuclear weapon in this Guy Ritchie adaptation of the classic TV series.Role: Debicki wears killer dresses and assembles even deadlier bombs as one of the two major villains in this movie, which is celebrated for its action scenes and quirky humor (at least for a movie with this many explosions), though it struggled at the box office.Watch TrailerSylvester Stallone&nbsp;(???)Film: Nighthawks&nbsp;(1981,  70%).&nbsp;Originally conceived as a third French Connection, the film deals with urban terrorism in New York as Rutger Hauer, in his first English role and one year before the legendary Blade Runner, runs New York through the wringer.Role: Stallone is an NYPD detective named Deke DaSilva, tasked with taking down the sadistic Hauer in a city still at the height of its grime and grit. The film was plagued with production problems and multi-hyphenate Stallone took over directing duties briefly.Watch Trailer","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tyler, Month, movies, CNN, Disney, nature, Apple, Pop, HBO, Podcast, Amazon, media, Christmas, on, First","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"10-hidden-gems-of-the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-stars"},{"id":"47612783242553","title":"Awards Leaderboard: Top Movies of 2015","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Leaderboard: Top Movies of 2015We help you keep track of the awards season 2015/2016.by RT Staff | December 17, 2015 |  CommentsFrom December through February, the best movies of 2015 are getting honored by critics, press, fans, and members of the film industry from all over.

Then we’ve got a few decent choices in the smaller releases, including Chris Rock’s Certified Fresh comedy and a couple of selections from the Criterion Collection. Read on for details:Annie (2014)  28%First it was a comic strip, then it was a musical, and then it was a film (twice), so it’s sort of understandable that the makers of 2014’s Annie — whose producers include such names as Will Smith and Jay-Z — would want to do things a little differently this time. Plus, they hired a few talented actors and the adorable star of Beasts of the Southern Wild to play the titular orphan. What could go wrong? A lot, according to the critics, who saddled the film with a 28 percent Tomatometer score for its reliance on clichés, syrupy sweetness, oddly staged musical numbers, and crass messaging. Quvenzhané Wallis is as charismatic as ever as the little girl who’s swept into the political machinations of wealthy mayoral candidate Benjamin Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who initially uses Annie for her PR value but ultimately falls for her charm. But essentially everything else about this production rubbed critics the wrong way, which renders this remake a missed opportunity.Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014)  28%Speaking of missed opportunities, who could have predicted a biblical epic directed by Ridley Scott and starring Christian Bale would have misfired as badly as Exodus: Gods and Kings did? Maybe people were burnt out on Old Testament stories by high profile directors, having already witnessed what Darren Aronofsky did with Noah back in March. Whatever the case, Scott’s retelling of Moses’ (Bale) journey was poorly received by both critics and audiences alike, earning a lukewarm box office total and earning a 28 percent score to match Annie‘s. Exodus has its moments, critics said, but the updated visual effects and few story embellishments (Moses as a sword-wielding general?) weren’t quite enough to erase memories of The Ten Commandments, and the newer film suffered from the comparison. For those who are interested, however, the Blu-ray release features a historical guide, a number of deleted or extended scenes, and few featurettes exclusive to the 3D release if you decide to go that route.Song of the Sea (2014)  98%Back in 2009, director Tomm Moore’s film The Secret of Kells earned an Oscar nod for Best Animated Feature, thanks to an enchanting mythological tale and its unique, hand-drawn art style. Earlier this year, he repeated the feat with Song of the Sea, which employed those same signature elements en route to an impressive Certified Fresh 98 percent on the Tomatometer and another Academy Award nomination. Song explores the Celtic myth of the selkie, a creature that takes the form of a seal underwater and that of a human on land, as told through the story of a young boy named Ben and his young sister Saoirse, who live in a lighthouse with their father. When Saoirse discovers a shell flute that plays a mystical tune, they learn a magical secret about their mother, who passed away years earlier. Song of the Sea is visually spectacular and rich in story, which makes it both an artful film and an excellent choice for family viewing.Penguins of Madagascar (2014)  72%DreamWorks Animation’s Madagascar franchise is one of the rare few that has gotten better with each installment, and it’s been so successful that a few of the side characters — The Penguins of Madagascar — got their own TV show on Nickelodeon. In 2014, those pesky penguins even got their own movie, and it turned out pretty good. Unrelated in plot to the TV series, Penguins of Madagascar follows Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private as they attempt to thwart the nefarious plans of Dr. Octavius Brine (John Malkovich), an octopus with an anti-penguin vendetta, after a dashing wolf (Benedict Cumberbatch) recruits them into his super-secret spy organization. Thanks to its vibrant colors, brisk pacing, and manic silliness, Penguins of Madagascar entertained most critics and earned a 72 percent on the Tomatometer. Its constant, frantic energy might be a bit too much for some adults to handle, but it’s harmless fun that will certainly keep the kids occupied for a while.&nbsp;ALSO AVAILABLE THIS WEEK: The Way He Looks (2014) (91 percent), a Brazilian coming-of-age story about the struggles of a blind teenager. Top Five (2014) (88 percent), Chris Rock’s Certified Fresh comedy about a comedian (Rock) who reflects on his life as he’s being interviewed by a journalist (Rosario Dawson). Son of a Gun (2014) (60 percent), starring Ewan McGregor and Brenton Thwaites in an Australian crime thriller about a petty criminal on the run with a notorious armed robber after the pair break out of jail. Vice (2015) (0 percent), starring Bruce Willis and Thomas Jane in a futuristic thriller about a lifelike robot who becomes self-aware and escapes from a pleasure resort.

It will also introduce a Silicon Valley where trade secrets are protected with ruthless efficiency. The program is the product of writer-director Alex Garland, who spent the last several years mapping out the limited series.As the director of Certified Fresh films&nbsp;Ex Machina, which he also wrote,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Annihilation — to say nothing of his screenplays for films like Sunshine&nbsp;— Garland&nbsp;has emerged as one of the major voices of 21st century science fiction film (and now television). And even though our world increasingly resembles the one theorized by the major science fiction films of the 20th century, Garland told Rotten Tomatoes the role of science fiction is “exactly” the same in the hyper-connected world of 2020 as it was 40 years ago and even earlier.(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)“It’s a very good, and actually quite comfortable, way of holding a mirror up to something which is contemporary. Because if you hold a mirror up exactly to the thing that is contemporary, people find themselves reacting to the argument that’s being made [as] they would if they were to find someone having argued about contemporary politics,” he said.Where more direct critiques of current issues may bristle against a viewer or reader’s established views, science fiction still offers a “gentler way into that argument” whether it is The Time Machine’s critique of Victorian values, Star Trek’s use of aliens to discuss race relations or the way Devs looks at the billionaire class.But do not expect the show to be a screed against tech giants who often seem to have more money than empathy. Instead, viewers will quickly find Forest (Nick Offerman) a disarming, human presence as he introduces Sergei (Karl Glusman) to the secretive Devs team within the show’s fictional tech company, Amaya. In fact, Garland said Offerman’s own natural warmth was key to making Forest work.“He also has something else which is something soulful, I think. You could even in some ways describe it as melancholic,” he added.Although, he said, that sense of melancholy was something Offerman found within Forest:&nbsp;“It felt like a perfect, natural fit. Nick is a kind man, and that kindness comes through in the character.”Granted, as viewers will quickly see, Forest’s warmth is tinged with a willingness to protect the secret of Devs at any cost.“And so, if you create a character who’s been extremely morally problematic and then you have a kind, and warm, and empathetic person carry that role, you get a sort of weird and interesting dissonance,” he said.That dissonance will certainly form one of the questions viewers of Devs will be asking by the end of its first hour.Another question to be asked: Is the universe deterministic? In that theory of existence, every action is prescribed, and a person’s choices are only an illusion. It is the model Forest himself espouses even as Sergei offers a multiversal answer — which allows for free will — to a problem his team addresses early in the series. Both concepts have been the playthings of science fiction for decades, but Devs makes them the purview of a tech company mindset that many will find quite familiar thanks to the ascent of Google and Apple. And though the ideas may become more approachable within the context of the series, Garland thinks most people react to the concepts in the same way.“[They] actually find it, firstly, preposterous, and, secondly, unsettling. They don’t like the idea of multiple universes, because it stops them having primacy. What the Many-Worlds Theory really does, it says that each of the universes that exist — if they do exist — essentially has equal status to all of the other ones. So, there isn’t a main universe and then a bunch of branches, there’s just a very large number of coexisting universes. And people tend not to like theories that make them too small, I suppose.”It is a reaction which speaks to one of the central conflicts in Devs: what Garland called “our intuitive sense in conflict with the data.”“Quite aside from Many-Worlds, the data makes it very clear the universe is absolutely massive; close to unimaginably huge. And that’s now beyond any real doubt, because it could be proven in various sorts of ways,” he said. “And that is in conflict with people’s own experience of the world, where they are much more at the center of the universe and occupying quite a big space within the universe. You know, then [there’s] their family, their friends, their job, and, in a way, the more they lose proximity with these bonds, the smaller they feel.”Nevertheless, Garland noted conversations moving from the possibility of a mulitverse where free will exists to a deterministic view where there is no choice elicits an equally strong emotional response.“If I have a conversation with people about free will, nobody likes the idea that they don’t have it. And it is completely in contradiction with our own sense — ‘But I absolutely, definitely have free will. I can feel it now,’ [they say], which is… again, it’s what people feel, but it may not be supported by the data.”That view, as espoused by Forest, leads Devs’ main character, Lily Chan (Sonoya Mizuno), onto her collision course with the warm and melancholy Amaya CEO. And while discussing Lilly’s actions would lead to a level of spoilers we definitely cannot reveal in this or any other reality, it did lead to another question the show presents: Do ethics exist in a deterministic universe?“I don’t personally think it takes ethics and morality out of the conversation, I just think it means you react differently to the state of affairs,” Garland said.(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)To illustrate morality in a deterministic universe,&nbsp;he used a 15-year-old boy mugging someone at knife point as an example. In a universe with free will, the boy’s punishment (provided he is caught) proceeds from the notion he is in absolute control of his choices.“If you take deterministic view, you might say, ‘Well, hang on a minute. Because this kid is a crystal meth addict, and both his parents were crystal meth addicts, and he was addicted by the time he was 12, and he was trapped in a world that had given him a very distorted sense of ethics, and, as well as that, a sense of desperation, and no home, that led ultimately to the mugging.’ Under those circumstances, punishing the kid makes much less sense. Rehabilitating a kid makes much more sense.”“What we do then is make sure that [the kid doesn’t] do it again,” Garland suggested. “So, that doesn’t remove the ethics, because you still don’t want the kid to mug anybody. It’s just more that you’re not punishing him for something that wasn’t his own decision.”Of course, Garland was quick to point out that while his example leads to a morality with more empathy and compassion, it also suggests atrocities are also unavoidable in a deterministic universe. “I don’t think anybody wants to let Adolf Hitler off the hook in the way that you might let a 15-year-old off the hook,” he quipped.Nonetheless, the morality of what Forest calls “tram lines” will no doubt feature in discussions of Devs when its full shape is revealed with the show’s finale six weeks from now.Part of that shape, though, is the modernist, mid-20th-century-style Amaya campus, shot partially at UC Santa Cruz and the University of Manchester. The style branches out of the campus and into the way much of the series is shot. To Garland, that style is a great container for science fiction stories because of its “utilitarian” essence.“By looking at the [modernist] structure, you understand something about why it was built and how it was built. It’s less concerned with the kind of a flamboyance that you might get in a Victorian or Edwardian period church, which is trying to proclaim something about itself, and is not exactly utilitarian. Or for that matter, elaborate science fiction citadels with gleaming spires or whatever it happens to be.” Instead, the modernist feel has “this sort of blunt quality that I like, it’s sort of arresting.”While Devs represents Garland’s first television work, he said he would consider telling other science fiction stories in the film format.“I personally cannot imagine how I would tell this particular story within two hours,” he said. “The things I wanted to do — or was hoping to do with the characters — and with the narrative, would have just felt incredibly crudely crunched together if it was two hours.”(Photo by Miya Mizuno/FX)But, he added, “there are other spaces” film offers even if there is the implicit expectation of action.“I think films often have to be a bit more ‘sugar rushing.’ Film is so much… I mean, it doesn’t have to be, but it tends to lean towards urgency and economy, and I guess that then leads people towards action sequences,” he explained.For Devs, he needed television’s acceptance of people “talking in rooms” to fully realize characters like Lilly, Forest, and Kenton (Zach Grenier), Amaya’s dedicated chief of security, to his satisfaction. At the same time he agreed “there are so many great science fiction films” and an idea more suited to film could appear at any moment. “It would certainly depend on the narrative,” he added.As for Devs narrative, Garland said he hoped to “give a very fair account of the world” within a science fiction context “by trying to be fair about the idea to do with physics that it contains, and also the way we interact with each other.” The series, in his mind, is really full of partnerships and “the sort of good people who love each other to one extent or another, as colleagues, or friends, or partners, or parents.”“Its intention is not to be removed, its attempt is to be connected, and I hope that’s ultimately how it comes across,” he added.For&nbsp;this writer, Devs definitely connected in no small part because of the weird synchronicity of sharing a last name with Forest’s company.“It must be kind of weird to see that suddenly you’re the head of the corporation that does quantum computing,” Garland quipped when he noted the connection.As it happens, the name was chosen because the girl who plays its enigmatic face is also named Amaya: Amaya Mizuno-Andre. Often Japanese in origin, the name also appears to enter the Romance languages from the Basque Country — though opinions do differ&nbsp;— where it translates from Euskera into English as “the beginning of the end” or simply “the end.”“Oh my God, that is hilarious!” Garland said upon hearing about the Basque origin. “That was completely unintentional.”Devs&nbsp;launches on Thursday, March 5&nbsp;on FX on Hulu.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Kids, review, Hear, Pride, winner, The, Lucasfilm, Emmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"alex-garland-on-devs-free-will-and-science-fiction-television"},{"id":"47612808929597","title":"Writers Guild Awards 2016: Full Winners List","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Writers Guild Awards 2016: Full Winners Listby RT Staff | February 14, 2016 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) tonight announced the winners of the 2016 Writers Guild Awards for outstanding achievement in writing for film&nbsp;and&nbsp;television&nbsp;at concurrent ceremonies at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza in Los Angeles and the Edison Ballroom in New York City.FILMOriginal ScreenplayBridge of Spies 90%Sicario 92%Spotlight 97%Straight Outta Compton 89%Trainwreck 84%Adapted ScreenplayThe Big Short 89%Carol 94%The Martian 91%Steve Jobs 85%Trumbo 75%Documentary ScreenplayBeing Canadian 33%Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief 95%Kurt Cobain: Montage Of Heck 97%Prophet's Prey 93%TELEVISIONDRAMA SERIESThe Americans 96%Better Call Saul 97%Game of Thrones 89%Mad Men 94%Mr. Robot 94%COMEDY SERIESBroad City 99%Silicon Valley 94%Transparent 90%Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 96%Veep 93%NEW SERIESBetter Call Saul 97%Bloodline 62%The Last Man on Earth 85%Mr. Robot 94%Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt 96%LONG FORM ORIGINALAmerican Horror Story: Hotel 64%Flesh and Bone 59%Saints &amp; Strangers 80%Sons of Liberty 58%LONG FORM ADAPTEDFargo 93%The Red Tent 77%Show Me a Hero 96%ANIMATION“Gayle Makin’ Bob Sled”Bob's Burgers 91%“Halloween of Horror”The Simpsons 85%“Hank After Dark”BoJack Horseman 93%“Housetrap”Bob's Burgers 91%“Sky Police”The Simpsons 85%“Walking Big &amp; Tall”The Simpsons 85%EPISODIC DRAMA“Explosivos”Narcos 89%“International Assassin”The Leftovers 91%“Mind’s Eye”The Good Wife 93%“Mother’s Mercy”Game of Thrones 89%“Person to Person”Mad Men 94%“Uno”Better Call Saul 97%EPISODIC COMEDY“Alive in Tucson”The Last Man on Earth 85%“Connection Lost”Modern Family 85%“Joint Session”Veep 93%“Racegate”Maron 75%“Rock, Paper, Scissors, Gun”black-ish 92%“Sand Hill Shuffle”Silicon Valley 94%COMEDY / VARIETY (INCLUDING TALK) – SERIESConanThe Daily Show With Jon StewartThe Late Show With Stephen ColbertReal Time with Bill MaherThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy FallonCOMEDY / VARIETY – SKETCH SERIESInside Amy Schumer 86%Key &amp; Peele 97%Saturday Night LiveSHORT FORM NEW MEDIA – ORIGINAL“Back to Reality” (Weight), Written by Daryn Strauss; weighttheseries.com“Born This Way” (Anyone But Me), Written by Susan Miller; hulu.comSHORT FORM NEW MEDIA – ADAPTED“Chapter Two: Phoebe” (Heroes Reborn: Dark Matters), Written by Zach Craley; nbc.com“Part 8” (Fear The Walking Dead: Flight 462), Written by L.

It’s a moment made even more bittersweet now that 20th Century Fox, the studio that has shepherded this Marvel franchise, has been acquired by Disney. Fox has a film library accumulated over 84 years as one of Hollywood’s majors, now finding a new home in the House of M(ouse).X-Men started in the tenuous superhero years between Batman &amp; Robin and the first Spider-Man. And though the mutants traded spandex costumes for leather (it was still practically the ’90s), the film still kept its outsider spirit, its theme of the status quo destroying the gifted, and the question of what happens when evolution disrupts a narrow-minded society. These concepts are some of the central bearings&nbsp;of science fiction, a genre Fox has had a storied history within, starting with black-and-white classic The Day the Earth Stood Still. Movies that followed, like Star Wars, Alien, Planet of the Apes, and Avatar, not only pressed up against the boundaries of sci-fi, but they shaped our pop culture as a whole.As the sun&nbsp;starts to set on a historic studio, we take one last look back on 20 of the most groundbreaking science fiction movies of 20th Century Fox.The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)  95%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Fox kicked off the creature feature trend of the 1950s with this actually reserved sci-fi parable of a visitor from beyond the stars named Klaatu with a draconian message to humanity: Shape up or face annihilation. To this end, Klaatu has brought his eye-blasting robot, Gort. Day the Earth Stood Still laid down the template for sci-fi combining fantastic visuals with social commentary, that would have immediate influence on ’50s pop achievements like the original Godzilla and The Twilight Zone, and then well into the future.Invaders from Mars (1953)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In the race to getting color on the silver screen, the sci-fi grand prix came down between Fox and Paramount. The latter was gearing up to release the Technicolor War of the Worlds in August 1953. Fox, rearing to beat Paramount to the punch, put out Invaders From Mars in April, thus holding the record for first color depiction of aliens in theaters. Texas Chain Saw Massacre&nbsp;helmer&nbsp;Tobe Hooper remade the movie in ’86, with a screenplay by Alien writer&nbsp;Dan O’Bannon.The Fly (1958)  95%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)As science fiction became mainstream product in the 1950s, it expanded audiences’ taste for harder, deliberately shocking material. Enter The Fly, which revolted crowds and critics with its nasty transformation effects, effectively capping the swinging creature-feature ’50s with a swat of brutality. David Cronenberg broke into the mainstream in the ’80s with his Jeff Goldblum-starring Fly remake of the ’80s, going full-bore on his trademark body horror and psychosexual obsession.Fantastic Voyage (1966)  91%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)With the ’60s, the sci-fi movie standard animorphed from atomic age monsters to epic and/or disaster expeditions, with Jules Verne the popular source author: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth, Master of the World, and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Fantastic Voyage, though not a Verne story, took his sweeping style and turned it inwards, as a group of scientists shrink themselves down into a submersible to explore a human body. The rich concept has been done again many times over since, including 1987’s Innerspace, and in parodies in cartoons ranging from Family Guy to Futurama to The Magic School Bus.Planet of the Apes (1968)  86%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)First banana in the long-surviving series, with one of the most memorable and aped endings in history. Planet was the first sci-fi property to turn itself into a franchise in these pre-Star Wars years, with four direct sequels and several TV shows out by the mid-’70s. There was an unfortunate Tim Burton remake in 2001, before it was rebooted properly starting with 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, highlighting the series’&nbsp;enduring central theme of a three-way fight between man, science, and natural order.Zardoz (1974)  47%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In the post-apocalyptic future, red leather daddy Zed (Sean Connery) boards a gun-vomiting floating head named Zardoz, who deposits him in a paradise estate known as The Vortex, whose immortal inhabitants have grown bored with life. In a kind of psychedelic Pygmalion, the immortals use crude dude Zed for their amusement, while he secretly seeks to unravel the mystery of Zardoz and The Vortex. Director John Boorman decided to use his post-Deliverance cred to deliver this ambitious and goofy misfire that must absolutely be seen to be believed. It’s a reminder of the special kind of big-budget tomfoolery major studios are capable of putting out if they just put their heads together.Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)  92%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)The most influential sci-fi trilogy in the galaxy. The first film,&nbsp;A New Hope, remains a perfect standalone distillation of the hero’s journey template. The Empire Strikes Back showed you can have an inconclusive AND downer ending, and still make money. And Return of the Jedi had Ewoks. Star Wars regenerated science fiction to appeal to the youngest crowd ever, hooking them with bright and poppy visuals, and all the merchandising you want to express that adoration. The Prequel and Sequel Trilogies have kept the Force alive, and with it tie-in video games, novels, comics, TV shows, and beyond.Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Ridley Scott took a haunted-house-in-space script and turned it into a grimy, claustrophobic experience in terror, launching a media empire — or infestation — of xenomorphs that have crossed over to comic books, video games, and even other venerable sci-fi properties like Predator and Judge Dredd. Not to mention granting us an eternally badass female protag in the form of Ripley. The first sequel helped launched the career of James Cameron, while the second nearly killed David Fincher’s. Scott would return to the Alien series decades later with Prometheus and Covenant.The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984)  68%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Another idiosyncratic sci-fi movie from Fox somewhat in the vein of Zardoz, but this time on purpose. Peter Weller stars as multi-hyphenate Buckaroo, whose résumé includes New Wave rock god, neurosurgeon, and inter-dimensional crash test dummy, and who must root out in-hiding spacemen here on Earth. This film’s sense of humor is so specific and quirky, one can’t help but think there’s no way the guy who directed it ever got the chance again. And, yep, this is W.D. Richter’s sole movie as director. And now it belongs to zany film audiences who in the years since have propped it up as the ultimate cult movie, whose influence pops in the most unlikely places — like The Life Aquatic‘s end credits, which pays tribute.Predator (1987)  81%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Arnold Schwarzenegger had one of the most impressive hot streaks in the ’80s, and that includes rumble-in-the-jungle Predator. As military macho Dutch, he and his crew exterminate guerrillas in Central America before the real threat emerges: An outer-space hunter who stalks and skins its prey for sport, using invisible alien technology. Real honorable! Predator‘s minimal plot, maximum carnage remains a high point for a certain breed of ’80s filmmaking. Its sequels and Alien crossovers have kept the franchise in the conversation.The Abyss (1989)  89%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)After the grungy Terminator and action-focused Aliens, James Cameron finally came into his own with The Abyss, which for the first time carries everything you imagine when you think of the director’s movies: Enormous budget, ecological message, and cutting-edge technology. Like Blade Runner, this is a major studio sci-fi movie that doesn’t rely on poppy hooks, but instead slowly submerges the viewer with some big concepts and methodical pacing.Strange Days (1995)  63%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Approaching something as momentous as the dawn of a new millennium takes a genre like science fiction to work through. Set during the final two days of 1999, Strange Days is a hard-boiled noir of parties, murder, and technology that can record and commodify memories and emotions. The film is a compelling document of ’90s progressive politics, advertising-induced cynicism, end-of-the-world race riots and relations, and the uneasy optimism of the future ahead.Independence Day (1996)  67%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)In 1996, nothing felt bigger than Independence Day. The plot of evil space invaders was already decades old at that point, but the casting of Will Smith as lead felt fresh and in-the-moment, along with eye-popping special effects and quick pacing made it an all-new experience. With a sequel 20 years later, Independence Day has also become a poster movie for one of the major overriding emotions of the 2010s: nostalgia.X-Men (2000)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Comic book superhero movies had already found recent success with the Batman and Superman movies, but the whole ensemble thing had yet to be done successfully on the big screen. Enter X-Men, who were a natural choice to give it a try, with their popularity rising through video games and the animated series, and whose outsider status among humans gave the movie the necessary subtext to attract any viewer who felt maligned in life. The series has since been infamously inconsistent, but the original, X2, First Class, Days of Future Past, and Logan remain must-watches in the genre.28 Days Later (2003)  87%(Photo by Fox Searchlight. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland suspected the time was right to bring back zombies into the zeitgeist. Choosing to forego soft voodooism or implied crashing satellites, 28 Days Later&nbsp;– which is technically a Fox Searchlight film – went directly into the science-fiction route starting with its opening scene, which sees group of environmental extremists free test monkeys infected with a highly contagious rage virus on an unsuspecting populace. Credit this one with making zombies cool with the kids again.Idiocracy (2006)  74%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)A literal average Joe is cryogenically frozen, only to be awakened well past his due date: 500 years into the future to be exact. The world has dumbed down to an alarming degree, with the nation on the brink of stupid disaster, and Joe suddenly finding himself the smartest man in the world. Though frequently set in the future, science fiction is a mirror that can reflect and warp our current selves, and to that end Idiocaracy is a resounding, hilarious success.Avatar (2009)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Pocahontas in space! Dances With Blue People! Sorry, Avatar can’t hear you over the $2.7 billion (in 2009 money!) we gave the studio. The long-developed James Cameron project transported audiences the world over to Pandora, a resplendent living word inhabited by the Na’vi, leonine blue creatures. As Pandora’s being invaded by Earth, a Na’vi warrior falls in love with one of the humans.Avatar remains the highest-grossing movie ever (a record once held by Cameron’s previous film, Titanic), and represents Fox’s final crowning achievement in the sci-fi genre.Chronicle (2012)  85%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Combining sci-fi, found footage, and horror, Chronicle&nbsp;explores the lives of three teenagers who develop powers of telekinesis after being exposed to a mysterious crystal. The film’s explosive terror and slick editing made it an immediate hit, launching the careers of Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordan, and director Josh Trank, who later stumbled with the Fan4stic reboot.The Martian (2015)  91%(Photo by 20th Century Fox. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Putting the science back in science fiction, The Martian stars Matt Damon as a NASA astronaut accidentally left behind on the red planet when his crew takes off during a sandstorm. As STEM fields increase in popularity across all genders, Ridley Scott’s Martian became the movie reference about the power of logic, science, and technology to overcome what look like insurmountable odds.Alita: Battle Angel (2019)  61%(Photo by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. /Courtesy of Everett Collection)Almost like destiny, the final movie released by 20th Century Fox as an independent studio is Alita: Battle Angel, the cyberpunk adaptation of the anime of almost the same name. And, naturally, James Cameron is here too! Like all of his movies, Cameron was talking about making a Battle Angel movie for a long time before it finally became reality, ultimately under the direction of Robert Rodriguez. Critics were lukewarm but most of the relatively scant audience who watched it fell in love with Alita, and the movie looks to be another cult classic in the making.Like this?

Liam Neeson’s latest thriller kicks things off, followed by a Jack Ryan reboot starring Chris Pine. Then we’ve got a Certified Fresh British comedy, an Oscar-nominated documentary, and a few smaller films. The big news is that HBO’s hit mystery series, True Detective, finally hits shelves this week, but there are also a couple of other notable choices on the small screen, including Neil deGrasse Tyson’s science series. Read on for details:Non-Stop 62%Liam Neeson takes his very particular set of skills aboard a transatlantic flight as US Air Marshal Bill Marks, who begins receiving mysterious text messages from an on-board terrorist who promises a passenger will die every 20 minutes if he isn’t paid $150 million; as Marks narrows down his suspects, a larger conspiracy reveals itself. Co-starring Julianne Moore, Anson Mount, and Scoot McNairy, Non-Stop fell just short of Fresh at 59% on the Tomatometer, with critics mostly intrigued by the film’s premise but somewhat dissatisfied with its execution and its improbable climax. The Blu-ray release includes the film on DVD and digital download, as well as a couple of short behind-the-scenes featurettes. This is pretty solid weekend rental if you weren’t willing to pay full price for a theater ticket.&nbsp;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 54%Chris Pine steps into the shoes formerly worn by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck to portray Tom Clancy’s titular everyman operative in what essentially amounts to an origin story/reboot of the franchise. Upon recovering from a debilitating battle injury, US Marine Jack Ryan is recruited by the CIA to work as an undercover agent on Wall Street, surveying for potential crimes in the financial sector. When a Russian businessman’s accounts spark Ryan’s suspicion, he unwittingly becomes embroiled in an international terrorist plot. The first of the series not based on a Clancy novel, Shadow Recruit earned a mixed response from critics, who mostly found it a merely adequate action thriller that hit plenty of familiar notes and fell short of its predecessors (yes, even The Sum of All Fears). The Blu-ray combo pack includes a commentary track from director and co-star Kenneth Branagh, as well as a handful of deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and four featurettes ranging from 5 to 21 minutes long.&nbsp;Alan Partridge 86%Stateside audiences are probably unfamiliar with Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan), but folks across the pond know him from any number of media appearances and his BBC sitcom. In Alan Partridge, Coogan reprises his role as the egocentric radio dj and television presenter, whose radio station — under new corporate management — is taken hostage by a recently fired DJ; Alan finds himself at the center of the controversy when he is asked to play negotiator with his former colleague. Certified Fresh at 86%, Alan Partridge is a clever comedy that relies more on dry wit than laugh-out-loud moments, and while fans of the character will get the most out of it, it makes the most of Steve Coogan’s talents and should serve as a fun introduction for the uninitiated. Special features include a making-of doc, a commentary track with Coogan and writers Neil and Rob Gibbons, a slew of deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.The Missing Picture 99%Nominated earlier this year for Best Foreign Language Film, The Missing Picture — like last year’s similarly themed The Act of Killing — interprets an historical atrocity through the lens of art; whereas The Act of Killing utilized the medium of genre filmmaking, The Missing Picture tells parts of its story through clay dioramas and figurines. Cambodian director Rithy Panh intertwines these miniature scenes with stunning archival footage to retell the story of his family’s experiences during the genocidal reign of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Unique in its vision and presentation, The Missing Picture touched and captivated critics, who awarded it a Certified Fresh 99% on the Tomatometer. While a Blu-ray is already available in the UK, only a DVD will be coming out this week in the US, and it doesn’t look as though it carries any extras. Still, the film alone is worth a watch.True Detective – Season OneA huge hit for HBO this year, True Detective featured Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as a pair of former Louisiana police officers involved in a decades-old investigation. The show, produced as an anthology series made to focus on a different story each season, was characterized by occult themes, cryptic symbolism, and deep character development, all of which it accomplished in just eight episodes, enrapturing a rabid fanbase in the process. This first season notched a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer, thanks to powerful performances by its leads, creator Nic Pizzolatto’s writing, and Cary Joji Fukunaga’s strong directorial vision, and it’s available this week on DVD and Blu-ray. Special features on the latter include commentary tracks for two of the episodes, a 15-minute making-of doc, short behind-the-scenes featurettes for each episode, interviews with the cast and crew, and a pair of deleted scenes.Also available this week:Patrick: Evil Awakens (83%), a horror thriller about a nurse in a psychiatric hospital who comes under the spell of a braindead patient with psychic powers.A Short History of Decay (73%), starring Bryan Greenberg and Linda Lavin in a comedy about a struggling writer who moves home when his father falls ill.Godfrey Reggio’s Visitors (69%), a wordless documentary exploring the relationship between humanity and technology through images.Adult World (52%), starring Emma Roberts and John Cusack in a dramedy about a university grad and aspiring poet who stalks one of her idols.Atom Egoyan’s Devil’s Knot (24%), starring Colin Firth and Reese Witherspoon in a drama chronicling the events surrounding the West Memphis Three.Season one of Ray Donovan (76%), starring Liev Schreiber as the titular Los Angeles “fixer” who helps his rich clients deal with unsavory problems.Season one of Resurrection (52%), a supernatural mystery about a small town where dead residents return to their families.FOX’s much talked about Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, with Neil deGrasse Tyson hosting a modern “reboot” of Carl Sagan’s groundbreaking science series.And lastly, two choices from The Criterion Collection: Douglas Sirk’s 1955 romance All That Heaven Allows (92%), starring Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman, and Michelangelo Antonioni’s L’Eclisse (88%), starring Alain Delon and Monica Vitti, both get new Blu-ray/DVD combo packs.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"theme, Purge, Comics, parents, Emmys, Kemper, Network, BBC, Premiere, school, miniseries, Month, Unbreakable, Winners","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-non-stop-jack-ryan-and-true-detective"},{"id":"47612869334347","title":"2015 Oscar Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2015 Oscar Nominationsby RT Staff | January 15, 2015 |  CommentsActor Chris Pine, Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs, and directors Alfonso Cuarón and J.J.

Following in Spidey’s spandex footsteps, a number of new and upcoming games have adopted similar approaches, cleverly expanding on existing universes rather than retreading them for the interactive entertainment medium.From blockbuster film franchises (Fast &amp; Furious) to streaming serial hits (Game of Thrones), more and more of our favorite fictional universes are offering fresh, original opportunities for fans to interact with their characters, live in their worlds, and even shape their stories.Whether you’re a gamepad-clutching Potter fan, a Ghostbusting smartphone geek, or a virtual reality enthusiast with a superhero complex, these 12 titles include some&nbsp;that should keep you busy between TV binge sessions and movie marathons this holiday season, a few great video games to give as gifts for Christmas, and&nbsp;others that you can look forward to in 2019.How to give mobile games as gifts: iOS | AndroidOut NowREIGNS: GAME OF THRONESDeveloper: NerialPublisher: Devolver DigitalSystems: iOS, Android, SteamRelease Date: Available nowGame of Thrones doesn’t return to HBO until next year, but winter has already come in the latest game based on the Seven Kingdoms-conquering series.

Crazy Rich Asians was the first Asian-American major studio release in 25 years, and broke box office records in theaters. (It also became one of the best-reviewed rom-coms ever.)Another Certified Fresh film that month, Searching. On streaming, Netflix’s To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before and Hulu’s Minding the Gap got up close and personal with the next generations. Meanwhile, Fresh Off the Boat (already a record-breaker for being an As-Am sitcom that wasn’t cancelled after one season) was priming for its prime time return, and Netflix was in the midst of its stand-up comedy insurgency with specials like Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife. In the years since, we’ve seen the likes of Minari, Always Be My Maybe, and Driveways score with critics.Rotten Tomatoes looks at 18 movie and TV milestones that paved the way, some by pebble and some by bulldozer, for Asian-American representation.(Photo by New Yorker/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Chan Is Missing (1982)  96%The first Asian-American feature to get a national release and mainstream coverage, so we’ll start here. The title calls out the Charlie Chan detective caricature that was popular 100 years ago and inverts it: a guy named Chan is the one who’s nowhere to be found, and two friends poke around San Francisco looking for him. In a nod to Raymond Chandler, the mystery itself is unimportant; it’s about where the journey goes and what characters we meet along the way. A vibrant portrait of Chinatown life emerges through those characters and their varied, inconsistent descriptions of Chan. Writer-director Wayne Wang appears to be working two big ideas: the search for Chan is the search for Chinese identity in America, and that part of assimilation means disappearing into the diaspora.The Karate Kid (1984)  89%Cliches are like writers’ plutonium: blunt with potential power, and when handled improperly, liable to blow up in your face. But do it right, bring in something new, and there can be effective results. Asian-American Pat Morita takes on&nbsp;the cliche sensei&nbsp;role, but dollops of personal drama and backstory allow Morita to find and give his Mr. Miyagi a tempered gravitas, for which he was awarded a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Director John G. Avildsen, who did obvious wonders with Rocky, gives another improbable sports film that working class glow.Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Secret of the Ooze (1991)  35%The story of Asian-Americans on-screen, and representation in general, is about the power of image. The less you see yourself on-screen, the more amplified the impact when you do. In this sequel to the surprisingly dark original, Leonardo and squad are joined by Pinoy Ernie Reyes Jr., a New York pizza delivery boy who uncovers their existence. Maybe it’s discordant to give this much importance to a movie that paid Vanilla Ice to talk, but if you were an Asian kid growing up in the ’90s, seeing big Ern’ cut it up alongside your favorite crime-fighting freaks of nature has a lasting effect. In fact, it’s still paying off with stuff like Reyes’ stunt role in the recent Uncharted fan&nbsp;film, starring Nathan Fillion and Stephen Lang.The Wedding Banquet (Xi yan) (1993)  96%Family comes up a lot in immigrant stories. When you&nbsp;arrive in a new country unannounced, it’s typically the only thing you have. The conservatism and hierarchy that makes up much of the Asian family structure smashing against American expression and individualism is fertile storytelling ground, and becomes the basis for Ang Lee’s comedy of manners. Winston Chao stars as a gay Taiwanese man who picks a fake wife to show off to his parents, but is happily involved with another man (Mitchell Lichtenstein). In a way, the paucity of Hollywood-standard movies in Asian-American cinema has allowed even more under-served viewpoints to flourish,&nbsp;with&nbsp;LGBTQ films (the recent Spa Night for example, which has a 95% on the Tomatometer) and women-led projects, which we’ll see start ramping up moving forward.(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)&nbsp;The Joy Luck Club (1993)  86%This is the movie commentators are referring to when they say Crazy Rich Asians is the first major studio-produced Asian-American&nbsp;film in 25 years. Based on Amy Tan’s novel, this drama follows four Chinese women (Kieu Chinh, Tsai Chin, France Nuyen, Lisa Lu) who meet up to play mahjong and discuss and reflect on their relationships with their American daughters (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Lauren Tom, Rosalind Chao). It was an exploration of the gap between old-school values and new-world freedom, but on a budget and scale not seen up to that point.&nbsp;Joy Luck was a mild box office success, but it endures in conversation due to how vital and unique its remained until now, especially for movies starring women and told through the female perspective.ALL-AMERICAN GIRL (1994)Margaret Cho’s sitcom, the first to&nbsp;be led by an Asian-American woman, is set in history as a compromised project propped by networks giving every stand-up comic a show, and then subsequently padded with stereotypes. That Girl‘s failure was held up for decades as a reason to&nbsp;not bankroll under-served voices highlights the disproportional cultural weight these endeavors carry, something Crazy Rich Asians itself faces. Still, Cho breaking through to show up on ABC for 19 episodes weekly gave hope and possibility to thousands of young Asian girls, who had even less to look up to than the boys did. CRA‘s Awkafina has said that&nbsp;seeing Cho on television at a young age set her on the path towards performance.American Pie (1999)  61%Let us harken back to the days of 1999, when the American public was in the midst of a severe dumb catchphrase drought. “Yo quiero Taco Bell” had come and gone, and “Wazzzuup” was yet to divine itself into existence. The people demanded action. “MILF” answered the call, one of the many gifts sprung from the loins of American Pie, explained then yelled repeatedly by John Cho at a raucous high school party. There was something quietly, stupidly triumphant about this moment, which featured some normal Asian dude showing up to craft instant vulgar gold, especially when past Asian characters in the teen movie genre often came with&nbsp;heavy accents&nbsp;and mangled words and phrases. MILF: This aberration, this fine evolution of the English language, was on point.Green Dragon (2001)  61%President Gerald Ford’s compassionate Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, passed in 1975, allowed over 100,000 refugees from war-torn Southeast Asian countries to legally enter the United States. Green Dragon focuses on&nbsp;the South Vietnamese, fleeing total communist takeover after the fall of Saigon, arriving at Camp Pendelton near San Diego to await relocation in America. Patrick Swayze and Forest Whitaker play military personnel, with Duong Don as the assigned camp translator, and the three guide the new arrivals through days of fear and hope. It remains one of the very few movies set in the States told from a Vietnamese perspective.(Photo by MTV Films/courtesy Everett Collection)&nbsp;Better Luck Tomorrow (2002)  81%Amoral high school honor students turn to crime in this sardonic dismantling of the model minority myth, from future Fast &amp; Furious helmer Justin Lin. Roger Ebert famously gave the movie an outspoken defense at Sundance, after an audience member confronted Lin on how he could present “his” people in such a low manner outside of the accepted cultural image. This line of questioning is a compelling example of how outsiders are required to navigate the immediate, invisible prejudices of others.Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004)  74%Having survived the danger of being branded “the MILF guy,” Cho settles into the post-college role of Harold, an obsequious company drone. He gets down though with his roommate Kumar (Kal Penn), as they smoke weed, chase girls, and quest&nbsp;for hamburger sliders. The Harold &amp; Kumar movies are high-water marks in the representation game, framing the Korean&nbsp;and Indian bros&nbsp;as outwardly “normal,” while engaged in their own personal battles: Harold wants to please others but really is just afraid of confrontation, as Kumar sabotages his father’s efforts to make him&nbsp;a doctor.(Photo by Frank Ockenfels 3/AMC)&nbsp;The Walking Dead: Season 1 (2010)  87%For seven seasons, Glenn Rhee (Steven Yeun) navigated us through the zombie hellscape of The&nbsp;Walking Dead. He matured and surprised, he killed and he loved, and like all of us, spent a long night under a dumpster. Most stories have the character you root for, the one you follow further into the rabbit hole. This time it happened to be the Korean guy. In our Five Favorite Films interview with Yeun, he said, “Glenn kind of sneaks up on people. [He’s] the one that you could just parallel yourself to.” Representation isn’t just shallow theatrics — it’s about finding the anchor that you can hang the most of yourself onto, to invest more fully in the picture.Fast Five (2011)  77%After director Justin Lin took over and Sung Kang joined as Han in Tokyo Drift,&nbsp;the Fast &amp; Furious series would emerge as the most inclusive, if not ridiculous, property rolling around the movie biz.&nbsp;Drift&nbsp;wasn’t a box office hit, and follow-up&nbsp;Fast &amp; Furious&nbsp;posted the franchise-worst Tomatometer at 29%, so kudos to Universal (whose media umbrella Rotten Tomatoes falls under) for allowing Lin to drive on. Next came the groundbreaking&nbsp;Fast Five, which saw critics finally giving in to the series’ absurd pleasures and giving its first Certified Fresh entry, as Lin doubled down on making its cast as diverse (and attractive) as possible.To Be Takei (2014)  90%The original ’60s Star Trek series proclaimed to boldly go where no one had gone before, and this time that includes beyond Gorns and Tribbles. Trek‘s ongoing mission also had earthbound accomplishments, like casting the first African-American woman in a major TV role (Nichelle Nichols as Uhara), alongside an Asian-American: George Takei, who played Sulu. Doc To Be Takei explores Takei’s legacy and relationship with Trek, while illuminating his life’s journey from growing up in California during World War II, to his blooming into savvy social media icon. This also includes the pain of being placed in internment camp during the war, and the Broadway musical Allegiance that experience inspired.(Photo by ABC/Bob D’Amico)&nbsp;Fresh Off the Boat: Season 1 (2015)  91%ABC’s second try at an As-Am sitcom, with considerably more lucrative results than All-American Girl. It was rough waters at first, especially when Eddie Huang, who wrote the original source memoir, left and disavowed the sitcom. The second season refocused on the parents — affably sweet Louis (Randall Park) and driven Jessica (Constance Wu, who is the lead in Crazy Rich Asians) — and the show has been a prime time fixture ever since, even now hitting enough episodes for syndication once its upcoming fifth season wraps.Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife (2018)  100%Wong approached celebrity status for being a Fresh Off The Boat staff writer during the first three seasons, but it’s her stand-up routine that now plants her in the spotlight.&nbsp;Wong’s raw and filthy material has massive crossover appeal,&nbsp;despite how specific her jokes are to a Chinese/Vietnamese-American experience combined with a marriage to a&nbsp;Filipino/Japanese man. Comedy, it turns out, gets funnier when you sweat the details. Between this and her previous Netflix special Baby Cobra,&nbsp;Wong laughs at dehumanizing stereotypes as a means to strip them of their power. She tears off labels like an old bandage and, in her own explicit way, finds the real woman beneath.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"History, 4/20","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"asian-american-movie-and-tv-milestones"},{"id":"47612896460116","title":"Writers Guild of America 2015 Award Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Writers Guild of America 2015 Award Nominationsby RT Staff | January 7, 2015 |  CommentsOn Wednesday, Januray 7, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) released their list of nominees for their annual WGA Awards, honoring outstanding writing in film, television, radio, and new media.

So while it’s always important to shed some attention on the little guys (which we’ll be doing soon enough), it’s also fun to note that SXSW will be offering high-end \"gimme\" titles like \"V for Vendetta,\" \"The Notorious Bettie Page,\" \"American Dreamz,\" and the geekily-anticipated \"Slither.\"As a movie nerd who’s covered SXSW for several years now, I can honestly opine that it’s one helluva good time.

Bell (Troy), Marque Richardson (Reggie), DeRon Horton (Lionel), and John Patrick Amedori (Gabe), who discussed their characters’ pivotal moments in season 2 and what they’re most excited to see in a potential third season.SPOILER ALERT! Stop reading&nbsp;if you haven’t finished watching the Netflix comedy’s second season.Logan Browning as Sam(Photo by Netflix)After a season of dancing around each other post-breakup, Sam and her ex-boyfriend Gabe finally hooked up again.“But even after we were together and we don’t know what we’re doing,” she says. “Which honestly, it’s almost like a full circle,&nbsp;and sometimes relationships do that. We’re laying in a bed, what are we?”In the final episode, the outspoken Sam faced off against a popular conservative commentator during an on-campus debate. The commentator was played by none other than Tessa Thompson, who originated the role of Sam in the Dear White People movie.“I’ve been a fan of Tessa’s for a really long time. I’ve always been able to see myself in the characters she plays, this one included, so to just play opposite her was dope,” she said. “I feel like from an outside perspective, watching someone who is literally having a scene with a person playing a role that they did already, that was incredible. That was so cool! To be honest, I think the three of us, me, myself, Justin [Simeon, creator], and Tessa just wished we had more time because we had to shoot that scene so quickly.”DeRon Horton&nbsp;as LionelAfter budding journalist Lionel teamed up with radio host Sam to investigate the mysterious Xes they’d seen around campus, they came face-to-face with Giancarlo Esposito —&nbsp;the series’ narrator.“Lionel and Sam, they are seeing a lot of Xes, and Lionel is realizing that there is a lot of hidden things at Winchester that he wants to uncover. He’s realizing that a lot of the systematic racism is stemming from the secret societies — or at least he thinks so. So, I think Sam is going to help him uncover that and now there is this elite group of people … and the narrator’s come in. I guess that’ll be a window into what the secret societies are about. I would hope!”Brandon P. Bell as Troy(Photo by Netflix)No longer a buttoned-up future politician, Troy hasn’t been the same since he threw a chair through the window in a riot that ended the first season. In the second season, Troy embraced the slacker life and even tried his hand at stand-up comedy.“I like the different dynamic —&nbsp;the dynamic of, like, picture perfect versus just a mess and unsure. As an actor its fun because it’s two sides of the same person. It was great to play, because even though he has a sense of liberation when he shattered the window, he’s still in turmoil. He’s masking that by drinking, partying, because he doesn’t want to deal.”As for the stand-up, “Me and Marque, who plays Reggie, took stand up classes just as an exercise. It’s extremely difficult. You have to really like, not care, and its easier said than done. Because when you get up there and nobody laughs at what’s funny with your friends, you instantly get insecure. Instantly. And there’s nothing you can do to mask that other than to practice it. So, I’ll say out of respect for the medium, I suck at stand up comedy. It is so hard.”Antoinette Robertson as CocoCoco’s episode focused on her decision of whether or not to have an abortion. And after a flash-forward, fantasy future in which she had the child, she snapped back to the present and decided to terminate her pregnancy.“I’m super proud of her for being courageous enough to listen to her heart and her feelings and not let anyone else — not society, her family, whatever the case may be — dictate what she decided to do with her body. I think that’s a big deal. Especially when we see through the flash-forward episode, the Sliding Doors [moment], you see that she could either live vicariously through her daughter, or she could choose herself and give herself the potential to reach the height of success that she’s always dreamt of, so I’m happy that she chose herself. And I’m super proud of her for being courageous and doing so.”Ashley Blaine Featherson&nbsp;as Joelle(Photo by Netflix)Joelle not only repaired her friendship with roommate Sam, but she also (finally!) hooked up with Reggie.On Joelle and Reggie: “As a fan of the show, I was happy that they finally got together. And I don’t know what’s going to happen going forward, but I think that moment was still pretty satisfying. And I like that it wasn’t so easy. It wasn’t just like, oh now they’re [together]. They had a conversation, they still went through nine episodes in the second season playing at it.”On Joelle and Sam: “Logan and I are really good friends in real life, so it just is always a joy to play besties. … You realize that now that they live together, despite how close they were in season one, that they were hiding things that just have to come up and have to be addressed because they’re four feet away from each other.”John Patrick Amedori as GabeOn Gabe and Sam’s future: “I don’t know where it’ll go, but I do think they’ll both be a little bit mature in how those situations with each other from now on. It really broke down a lot of emotional walls with each other.”On what he learned about his character: “I just learned more about Gabe’s conviction, his motivation. He’s an emotional person. He’s very susceptible to Sam’s emotions and her struggles even though he doesn’t understand it. I just learned more about how much he’s willing to put himself out there to be an example, which may or may not come into play later on in season 3 or something, but I think that’d be cool to explore more, because I feel like that’s a strength of his, is his empathy, and his willingness to put himself out there.”Marque Richardson as Reggie&nbsp;(Photo by Netflix)On what he learned about his character: “I learned that Reggie really doesn’t know who he is at all, or who he wants to be, which I think is blocking his healing —&nbsp;especially going through the PTSD and still having that façade of badass, tough guy, whatever, and not fully leaning in to his vulnerability with other people and even himself. He hasn’t even gone there yet, so we’ll see how it all plays out.”What does everyone want to see in season 3?Bell: “I want to see more about Lionel’s heritage. Because it’s obvious how important and influential our upbringing is. Like, Coco not getting enough from her mother. Troy’s dad, this is the result of that, and Lionel is still kind of a mystery. We found out in season 1 his dad left really early.”Howard: “I want to see that! I mean, I feel like a lot of times for people of that demographic, who find themselves later on, find out, ‘Oh, I like this rather than that.’ I think there’s a coming-to-Jesus moment sometimes, or that’s what I’ve heard and studied. And, I feel like there’s a certain point in life they realize, ‘Oh, that’s it.’ I’m curious to see when did he discover that?”Robertson: “I want to see Coco have more fun. I just do. I feel like everything was so heavy this season that when you saw her with Kurt there was this moment that you saw this giggly Coco that you really haven’t ever seen before. You saw Colandrea, maybe, a little bit more. The guard was down more, but seeing Coco, still vixen outside, but giggle when a boy kissed her, even though its not serious, was nice to see her life after an abortion. She made a decision, and she wasn’t in a room with her head down and super depressed. It was, ‘I’m going to go out, and I’m going to live my life, and I’m going to be true to myself and what I want.’ And I love that.”Richardson: “More car chases.”Featherson: “I’m excited about the Order of X, and I’m also excited to see what happens with Giancarlo.”Browning: “I’m excited for more group scenes because in season 1, the groups were all pitted against each other. Season 2, there was all of us coming together. So with season 3, now we get to play. It would be fun to have more group scenes where everyone is interacting again in a space where they’re not butting heads.”Featherson: “I’m excited to see if Coco and Sam stay friends, or if they are friends. I don’t really know what’s going on. That’s exciting. Oh, Joelle and Coco too.”Amedori: “Troy doing his stand-up.”Dear White People&nbsp;seasons 1 and 2 are now available on Netflix.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, stand-up, political, The, south, The, and, cancelled, books, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"dear-white-people-stars-on-cameos-secret-societies-and-season-3"},{"id":"47612912209243","title":"21 Most Memorable Movie Moments: Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma (2014)","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})21 Most Memorable Movie Moments: Crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma (2014)Congressman John Lewis and actor Stephan James reflect on the movie's final, triumphant bridge-crossing, and what Selma – the movie and events –&nbsp;means to them.by Jacqueline Coley | June 18, 2019 |  CommentsWatch: Congressman John Lewis of Georgia and actor Stephan James&nbsp;on the making of&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;above.In 2019, Rotten Tomatoes turns 21, and to mark the occasion we’re&nbsp;celebrating the 21 Most Memorable Moments from the movies&nbsp;over the last 21 years. In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all. In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series, Congressman John Lewis and actor Stephan James, who portrayed Rep. Lewis in Selma,&nbsp;share their memories from production and reflect on the movie’s importance.&nbsp;VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLTHE MOVIE:&nbsp;Selma (2014)  99%Fifty&nbsp;years after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and a host of activists and religious leaders marched from Selma to Montgomery to protest voting&nbsp;discrimination, Ava DuVernay released Selma into theaters. The first film from a major studio to chronicle the Civil Rights icon’s life,&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;was no Wikipedia-style, all-encompassing biopic; instead, the&nbsp;movie focused on three months of&nbsp;the southern pastor’s life, and – after documenting earlier attempts to start the march in devastating scenes – culminated in a moving recreation of the historic&nbsp;procession across the Edmund Pettus Bridge&nbsp;that began the Selma to Montgomery march of 1965.With meticulous attention&nbsp;to historical accuracy, stirring drama, and memorable imagery,&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;heralded&nbsp;publicist-turned-director DuVernay’s arrival as one of the most significant African American filmmakers of her time; she would become, with&nbsp;Selma,&nbsp;the only Black woman to have directed a Best Picture nominee, and go on to such landmark achievements as the documentary&nbsp;13th&nbsp;and this year’s Netflix miniseries&nbsp;When They See Us.&nbsp;It also offered a new and nuanced take on Dr. King – magnificently portrayed by David Oyelowo – and educated a whole new generation on the fight for the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Congressman John Lewis of Georgia was there back in 1965, walking the bridge with Dr. King, and here he reflects on making the movie and its impact, along with Stephan James, who portrays him on screen.David Oyelowo plays Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Some people did not know that people couldn’t register to vote just because of the color of their skin.”Rep. John Lewis:&nbsp;“I truly believe that Oprah, Ava, and the staff working on&nbsp;the film sought my involvement because they knew my history. Selma represented an attempt to redeem the soul of America, to help us move closer to the participation of all people&nbsp;in the political process.&nbsp;This film can educate and inform&nbsp;the mind of hundreds and&nbsp;thousands&nbsp;of young people around America and around the world.&nbsp;So many people did not know that people couldn’t register to vote just because of the color of their skin. They did not know that people were segregated. They did not know that lawyers and doctors, college professors, and teachers we discriminated against simply because of the color of their skin. They’re not participating in the democratic process. They did not understand that people were murdered attempting to register to vote. It was real. The whole story of Selma and the State of Alabama.”“I was so honored to be able to step into Congressman Lewis’s shoes, and I hope I and the rest of the cast did him, and the story, justice.”Stephan James:&nbsp;“I was so honored to be able to step into Congressman Lewis’s shoes and I hope that I and the rest of the cast did him, and the story, justice. Really it was just about being grateful to him and gracious to him, for being such a big supporter of the film, a supporter of me. He’s always made me feel like this role was meant for me. He’s always expressed how proud he is of the film and of his portrayal. So for me, it’s just one of those things you’re just grateful for. You just wanna tell him how much you’re thankful for what he’s accomplished.”Ava DuVernay on the set of Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“[Ava] got everybody on the same page and created a familial environment where everybody felt that we were creating this story from a place of love.”James:&nbsp;“Ava really is one of a kind. It takes a special sort of filmmaker to pull off what&nbsp;she did in Selma. And on her first big-budget film. She really hadn’t made a film for over a million dollars before&nbsp;Selma. And for me, I can just remember being just a little bit in awe of the way she helmed the set. We had all these days of hundreds of background actors, horses, and just wild and crazy things. It could be a lot for a director.&nbsp;But she got everybody on the same page and created this familial environment where everybody felt [the] energy that we were creating this story from a place of love, and understood the responsibility in telling the story.”THE MOMENT: The Final Crossing Of the BridgeUnder the crippling Alabama&nbsp;sun, the movie’s&nbsp;cast of Oscar-caliber actors, talented newcomers, and hundreds of background players and crew members assembled on the Edmund Pettus Bridge to recreate history – over and over. The film depicts three attempts to cross the bridge. The first&nbsp;attempt took place March 7, 1965, and became known as “Bloody Sunday” after State Troopers attacked the protesters – a confrontation DuVernay captures&nbsp;in unsparing detail.&nbsp;Two days later, Dr. King led a group of thousands to the bridge, including clergy from across the country&nbsp;who took to their knees to pray with him in front of gathered troopers, before&nbsp;he turned the march around – a pivotal move that encouraged President Johnson to introduce the&nbsp;Voting Rights bill into Congress shortly thereafter. The final time we see the bridge is for DuVernay’s depiction of the events of March 21, 1965, when Dr. King led the federally sanctioned march from Selma that would end with a rally on the steps of the Montgomery capitol four days later. It’s this final triumphant march in the film that lingers as a testament to what Dr. King achieved, but much of its power rests on the raw depiction of the events that preceded it.Wendell Pierce and Stephan James in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Wearing a backpack the same way that I did on March 7, 1965… The young man who played Dr. King was dressed like Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;“Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“I did have a chance to spend time with the young man who played me and the young man who played Martin Luther King Jr. I got to know them fairly well. The two young people that I got to know, they really became the embodiment of the whole struggle in Selma. They made the film so real, not only the way they spoke but the clothing that they wore. I really loved the way they tried to walk in our shoes. It made the film so real with the young man wearing a trench coat and&nbsp;wearing a backpack the same way that I did. The young man who played Dr. King was dressed like Martin Luther King Jr., and he spoke like Martin Luther King Jr.”James:&nbsp;“It’s a big credit to the great wardrobe stylists, the head of costumes, Ruth E. Carter. We were totally factual in terms of the clothes of John Lewis, Dr. King, and everybody on Bloody Sunday. We were 100 percent accurate. We followed those photos from those exact moments.”“I think we all understood how sacred that bridge was, and what our jobs were in reenacting this whole moment.”James:&nbsp;“We didn’t have a whole lot of time. I’d say maybe three to five [takes] of the full walk. There are&nbsp;so many people, cast and background actors; we only have a few shots at this. And everybody would just get together, get on the same page and did it in unison. I can’t remember how many people there were but, cast and crew included, and there was just this sort of solemn sort of energy where everybody sort of understood what we were doing. I think we all understood how sacred that bridge was and what our jobs were in reenacting this whole moment. We were retracing historical footsteps – I mean you’re literally tracing the steps. These steps that have guided us through the history of our country. It’s meaningful. And it gets to the point where you’re not just making a film; you’re recreating a moment in time.”Marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. (Photo by Atsushi Nishijima/©Paramount Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“You just think about how brave this man is and what he did to inspire a generation of people like him.”Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“I did get an opportunity to visit the set at a church in Atlanta. And while being there, visiting the set, a storm came up, and it started thundering and lightning, and they had to cut off the filming for a while and start it over again. But it reminded me of sometimes, during mass beatings and rallies&nbsp;and church services, a storm would come up, in Alabama or some other part of the deep south, and you had to get in the action.”James:&nbsp;“I really hadn’t spoken to John in the flesh. I had some communications with him through email. But to actually see him in the flesh for the first time… He walked in the middle of one of our scenes, and it was one of those moments where everything like freezes, and he’s the only person who is still in real time. You just think about how brave this man is and what he did to inspire a generation of people like him who are changing the world now today. And he’s still doing incredible work. I&nbsp;just saw him the other day at the Academy Awards. We shared a little moment. It’s pretty special to meet a guy like that in person and just know the impact he’s had on your life and the impact that he’s had on the world.”THE IMPACT: A New&nbsp;Legacy of ActivismSelma&nbsp;earned rightful praise for its historical accuracy, the nuance and beauty of its storytelling, and for its performances – it sits Certified Fresh at 99% on the Tomatometer. And it ushered in a new wave of formidable talent; not just DuVernay, but Oyelowo and co-stars like Tessa Thompson, LaKeith Stanfield, Andre Holland, and, of course, James, who would go on to star in Amazon’s&nbsp;Homecoming. Its impact off-camera has been powerful, too.&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;has become a standard in history classes, and some say it was the turning point for major changes to the Academy Awards.The movie received two Oscar nominations at the 2015&nbsp;ceremony: Best Picture and Best Original Song for “Glory,” performed by John Legend and featuring Common, which would win on the night. But many moviegoers and industry insiders&nbsp;were shocked to see DuVernay and Oyelowo left out of the Best Director and Best Actor categories, respectively. Frustrated by&nbsp;the snubs and the fact that no persons of color were nominated for major awards that year,&nbsp;Twitter user April Reign created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag that trended globally for several days, and which had an impact that would last years. The Academy responded to the controversy by passing new rules and voting guidelines that helped to make membership more closely resemble that of the general moviegoing audience. The efforts have resulted in a new crop of Academy voters and possibly the nominations that would go to non-traditional films like Mad Max: Fury Road, Black Panther, Lady Bird, Get Out, and The Shape of Water.&nbsp;In recreating history, DuVernay had made some history of her own.“It moved me.&nbsp;They were able to make the&nbsp;drama&nbsp;come alive&nbsp;on the streets&nbsp;of Selma.”Rep. Lewis:&nbsp;“Watching the film and just listening to the music. It moved me.&nbsp;They were able to make the drama come alive&nbsp;on the streets of Selma. To make the words, the suffering, the tears, the crying, but also the strength and the determination that, in spite of everything, that we were going to continue until we got the Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed. People started singing ‘Glory.’ I watched with students — high school, elementary school, teachers, parents — and we just start singing ‘Glory’ and I start singing, and they cry, then I cry, and we are crying together. Because&nbsp;you cannot separate the essence of&nbsp;Selma&nbsp;without ‘Glory.'”James:&nbsp;“I can’t remember anything that I’ve been prouder to be a part of than Selma. I think the way that the whole film came together… I just felt incredibly fortunate to have been a part of that cast, with that ensemble, under the direction of Ava. And to share that moment with my mom and my cousins who I brought to the film’s premiere. I don’t know, it felt like a dream come true and something I won’t forget.”Stephan James and John Lewis at the premiere of Race. (Photo by Photo by Teresa Kroeger/WireImage)“Words can’t express what it’s meant for me to be a part of a film you’re able to teach to young kids.”James:&nbsp;“Selma feels like a triumph; it’s always felt like a triumph. Words can’t express what it’s meant for me to be a part of a film like that, where you’re able to teach to young kids. It blows me away that we’re able to show this story to young kids. Selma&nbsp;is in high schools, and&nbsp;middle schools, and kids are&nbsp;able to learn not just about the history of this country but the history of the world. And to learn about these young men and young women who were out there on the front lines of justice every day doing things, sacrificing things that we couldn’t imagine, just so we can do what we’re able to do today. That to me is the defining purpose of what Selma means, the fact that we’re able to teach people about history. A history that often gets watered down and washed away with time. And what better way to do that than through cinema? It strikes me as an important film and important&nbsp;moment for cinema.”Selma&nbsp;was released on November 18, 2016.&nbsp;Buy or rent it at FandangNOW.Like this?

Even if you never find another Southern Gothic, slow-burn, anti-buddy detective story that strikes every creepy chord of True Detective, you might enjoy one of these:Top of the LakeWhat it is: Elizabeth Moss (Mad Men) plays Detective Robin Griffin searching for a 12-year-old pregnant girl in Sundance Channel’s miniseries directed by Jane Campion and Gerard Lee.Commitment: The complete series is seven 50-minute installments. (Learn more in our Top of the Lake Weekly Binge).Why you might like it: Atmospheric and disturbing, the mystery unravels in a remote enclave of Southern New Zealand where misfits are the norm. Compelling digressions build strong characters.The Wicker Man 89%What it is: No, not the one with Nic Cage punching a bunch of ladies in the face. The 1974 version by British director Robin Hardy holds up as cult horror film and compelling mystery.Commitment: A short but intense ride, the original Wicker Man movie runs just 88 minutes.Why you might like it: Creepy factor is a 10 on account of religious themes and folksy terror (and animal masks). The mystery will keep you guessing until the end — and stay with you for a long time.The BridgeWhat it is: On the bridge connecting El Paso and Juarez, the discovery of a corpse — which turns out to be the halves of two different women — forces a duo of detectives from opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border to work together.Commitment: Season one delivers the entire story arc of this particular crime in 13 episodes. Season two is coming to FX this summer.Why you might like it: The unlikely partnership between a Texan straight-laced female police officer with Asperger’s and a not-so-by-the-book Mexican male detective takes this manhunt figuratively and literally all over the map.WallanderWhat it is: Kenneth Brannagh is Kurt Wallander, a rumpled, middle-aged, self-loathing detective whose most challenging mystery is his own existential crisis. PBS’s Masterpiece Mystery! miniseries is based on popular Swedish crime novels by Henning Mankell.Commitment: So far, Wallander is three seasons, with a total of nine 90-minute stand-alone mysteries.Why you might like it: Brannagh’s world-class acting animates an intriguing character, while the dark mysteries satisfy the pickiest at-home sleuths. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) interprets the Swedish countryside with gloomy beauty, even in broad daylight.The Silence 88%What it is: Baran bo Odar’s German crime film is an intense, psychological whodunit which connects two murders over the span of 23 years.Commitment: The Silence takes two hours to accomplish what other storytellers need an entire season of television to do.Why you might like it: Similar to True Detective, the heinous crimes in The Silence occur decades apart, weaving a narrative about the investigators, victims and killers from past to present.Angel Heart 79%What it is: A crime noir starring Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro and Lisa Bonet, the movie Angel Heart follows a sleazy private investigator’s unpredictable journey from Harlem to the heart of the bayou.Commitment: Experience the descent into hell in just under two hours.Why you might like it: Angel Heart showcases strong acting against the steamy, occult-ridden backdrop of New Orleans in the 1950s. Also, Matthew McConaughey picked it as one of his Five Favorite Films.BroadchurchWhat it is: After the mysterious death of an 11-year-old boy in a British coastal village, Detectives Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller probe the lives of multiple suspects.Commitment: BBC America aired the eight episodes of season one in 2013 and season two is on its way.Why you might like it: Impeccably paced, Broadchurch sustains a multidimensional character study with masterful acting and an ominous, vivid sense of place. In a small town where everyone is a suspect, paranoia and grief are treated with equal weight.HannibalWhat it is: Hannibal Lecter is a brilliant psychiatrist consulting for FBI agent Will Graham in NBC’s prequel to Silence of the Lambs.Commitment: Season one is 13 42-minute episodes; NBC is currently airing new episodes of season two, which is Certified Fresh by critics.Why you might like it: Hannibal takes a more cerebral (and totally gross-out) approach to the serial killer genre than other prime-time procedurals, using multiple episodes to unfold each mystery, along with Lecter and Graham’s especially dark connection.Sin Nombre 88%What it is: A thrilling Spanish-language film depicts a teen’s attempt to quit a notorious Mexican street gang.Commitment: Sin Nombre is 96 fierce minutes.Why you might like it: In his directorial debut, True Detective director Cary Joji Fukunaga delivers an immersive character study within the richly detailed world of Mexican gang violence.Zodiac 89%What it is: David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) renders the perplexing true-life mystery of San Francisco’s Zodiac Killer with suspense, style and an all-star cast.Commitment: At 157 minutes, Zodiac is the perfect rainy-day movie.Why you might like it: Fincher’s ability to build tension over long sequences of moody photography will have your hairs standing on end and — even though Zodiac is a long one — when it’s over, you’ll wish there were more.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"ViacomCBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"life-after-true-detective-what-to-watch-next"},{"id":"47612901667159","title":"Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski’s Oral History of Action Game-Changer John Wick","content":"Oral Historiesvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski's Oral History of Action Game-Changer John WickThe star and director of John Wick go deep on their long history –&nbsp;they met on The Matrix! –&nbsp;bringing the Wick world to life, and making some of cinema's most memorable action moments.by RT Staff | May 9, 2019 |  CommentsThe story of New York’s stylish and deadly Baba Yaga began in Sydney, Australia where Keanu Reeves and then stunt-double Chad Stahelski met while shooting&nbsp;The Matrix in the 1990s.&nbsp;There, the two men formed a strong bond and drew a great deal of influence from&nbsp;Matrix&nbsp;directors the Wachowski siblings.&nbsp;More than a decade later, they would be working together again on the first&nbsp;John Wick&nbsp;film, with Reeves in the lead role and Stahelski as co-director with David Leitch (Stahelski would go on to direct&nbsp;Chapter 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chapter 3, solo).

Stan finds touching humor in Bucky’s impossible circumstances (yes, we get Bucky on a date, and it is everything), and Mackie’s expressive eyes and face bookend the episode with two wordless yet striking scenes. We don’t need any explanation for Sam’s grief, doubt, and disappointment when we watch the actor in those moments. –Proma Khosla, MashableBetween the jaw-clenched brooding and reflective staring, Mackie and Stan find small but meaningful moments to illustrate their innate charms. Mackie’s smile has a natural glow that’s impossible to resist, and he gets to crack it a few times while “Uncle Sam” (yup) jokes with his young nephews or cajoles his sister into a new business plan. Stan, meanwhile, has this simple little moment with a Maneki-neko that’s destined for meme glory (while still conveying Bucky’s deep desire for the world to stop moving, just for a second, so he can catch up). Once these two get together, making enough time for fans to enjoy their natural charisma among the requisite action scenes may be the show’s greatest challenge. –Ben Travers, IndieWireFor Mackie — a prolific character actor many first noticed in his role in “Half Nelson” fifteen years ago — this is an overdue moment in the sun. Mackie’s work in the Marvel films has been consistently strong but somewhat underwritten, given the magnitude of his talent. What is striking about his presence here is that he is permitted to embody complexity. –Daniel D’Addario, VarietyDOES IT STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN ACTION AND DRAMA?(Photo by © Disney+, @ Marvel Studios)On the surface, the action sequences are arguably some of the best seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. –Dewey Singleton, AwardsWatchThe trailers for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier promised a lot of action in this series, and the first episode doesn’t have much of it. The few action sequences that are in the premiere are stellar, but this is a show that doesn’t mind taking its time. –Charlie Ridgely, ComicBook.comTonally it’s along the lines of The Winter Soldier and the start of Civil War, at least regarding political jockeying and America-centric military issues. That’s both good and bad. On the one hand, the series could delve into some very worthy considerations of what it means to serve, to come home, to feel unmoored by a world that has moved past you; it could even reach Wanda-levels of introspection and emotional resonance regarding consequence. On the other, it could devolve into more of how this first episode starts: Call of Duty-esque mumbo jumbo, murder, explosions. –Allison Keene, Paste MagazineHOW DOES IT PORTRAY&nbsp;THE POST-BLIP WORLD?(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios)With this show, we’re able to get more of Sam’s backstory, which hasn’t been much of a focus previously. Poised to perhaps take the reigns from Steve Rogers, we’re able to connect with him on another level; learning more about his family and life before The Avengers. And we’ll also see how he’s dealing with returning post-“blip”, having missed five years, and what that experience is like. –Jordi Sirkin, Jordi Reviews ItBy honing in on Sam’s anxiety as a black man on the precipice of taking up the moniker of America’s Aryan saviour, the writers have added a layer of complexity to his character that we hadn’t seen before. Mackie, too, steps up to the plate in a big way, exhibiting a rawness that is hard to come by in superhero fare. –Ben Allen, GQ Magazine [UK]The Falcon show features the boffo action opening, and also a richer exploration of the lives of those left behind in the Snap and of the internal contradictions of being a Black superhero in a country that doesn’t fully embrace Blackness than Marvel has ever approached. –Daniel Fienberg, Hollywood ReporterSpellman and his writers have a blast with the post-Endgame world, using the space allowed a TV series to ask questions that movies simply don’t have time to address. Do Avengers get paid? What actually happens to a nation’s infrastructure when billions of people reappear after five years? The nerdy world-building is given room to breathe and it’s a hoot. –Jacob Hall, SlashFilmNow, with his mind finally free of Hydra’s influence, Bucky is a 104-year-old man trying to find peace — or at least his version of it. In many ways, Bucky’s story is a sadder version of the one presented by Steve Rogers. After Steve was thawed out from the ice by Nick Fury, fans only got to see brief glimpses of him readjusting to modern society. The Falcon and Winter Soldier gives viewers more time to see Bucky attempt his rehabilitation tour. –Tim Adams, CBRIS THE PRODUCTION VALUE WORTHY OF THE MCU?Primetime Emmy–nominated director Kari Skogland (The Handmaid’s Tale; The Loudest Voice) is easily the biggest standout here, as she brings a very unique eye to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Some of the camera angles she utilizes throughout the first episode feel so intimate, it’s almost like you’re inside the characters’ heads, a trick that works especially well in Bucky’s therapy scene. The premiere does feel familiar — staying true to the tone set by the Russo Brothers in The Winter Soldier and Civil War — but under her direction, everything feels oddly fresh and exciting at the same time. –Rohan Patel, ComicBookMovie.comThe excellent production values and interesting writing/directing is what make The Falcon and The Winter Soldier worth watching. –Allison Skornick-Rose, Flick DirectANY FINAL THOUGHTS?(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Marvel Studios)As enjoyable as it is to catch up with the two leads (while being treated to some jaw-dropping action), this is definitely something of a slow burn which drops plenty of hints about what’s to come without rushing into bringing in characters like Sharon Carter and Zemo. –Josh Wilding, ComicBookMovie.comWith a timeliness its creators could not have predicted, “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier” will likely grow to feel as necessary to our national conversation as “Wandavision” did this winter. Possibly even more so, with themes of national chaos and what “American values” really mean.And, maybe most importantly, how we move forward. –Brigid Presecky, Impressionist MediaThe series has so much inherent potential to be a breakthrough moment for action storytelling, so long as it leans more into the unique skills of its nimble characters, and not just what makes them flashy in short bursts. –Nick Allen, RogerEbert.com“The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” has yet to reach its ideal cruising altitude but it’s smooth, slow climb that promises to take viewers to new, exciting destinations. –Lorraine Ali, Los Angeles TimesThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier premieres Friday, March 19, on Disney+.On an Apple device?

A thoughtful, well-considered biopic can do what your history textbook never could: make the past come alive and comment on our present moment. Here’s a batch of fresh-rated biopics of people famous — Jackie Robinson, Queen Elizabeth II — and not-quite-so. That’s the other secret power of films about real people: immortalizing nearly-forgotten institutionalized female artists and recovering drug addicts who go on very long hikes.42 (2013)  81%This underappreciated film should have made Chadwick Boseman a movie star. He’s that good as baseball legend Jackie Robinson. Of course, Get On Up also should have made Chadwick Boseman a movie star. He played James Brown in that one and nobody went to see it, either. But back to 42: Boseman all but resurrects the patient, determined, no-nonsense athlete who broke the color barrier in professional baseball way back in 1947 during his rookie season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. It was, as you might imagine, not an easy task. Hate from fans and his own teammates tested the man every time he took the field, but Robinson never gave anyone the satisfaction of clapping back. Director Brian Helgeland, along with his extremely talented lead, creates a sobering look back at the historical realties of American sports and American racism. As for Boseman, he’s about to enter the Marvel universe as Black Panther. Movie star achievement coming soon.Watch TrailerBelle (2014)  84%Maybe you thought this was just another period British costume drama, the kind that country creates with impeccable precision, all for your mom to enjoy. But Belle glides along in its own lane, taking on the ugliest truths about the English aristocracy, and inspired by the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). She was the mixed race child of Admiral John Lindsay, raised by her great-uncle Lord Mansfield in a world of privilege, one punctured by the restrictions of her race. It was the time of slavery in England, after all, which meant Belle was unable to participate fully in the world in which she lived. Solution: fight the power and work as an abolitionist, of course. Amma Assante’s direction is clear-cut and modern, necessarily imposing today’s wisdom on historical horror, while Mbatha-Raw (who was also excellent in the same year’s underrated Beyond The Lights) moves slyly through a story that demands her character’s allegiance to strict codes and the disobedient nerve to break them.Watch TrailerBright Star (2009)  82%So it’s the early part of the 19th century and you are a passionately-in-love couple of young people. But you have to keep it secret. That’s the problem faced by English poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and headstrong, fashion-minded Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish). They don’t even like each other much, at first, which is romantic-drama-speak for “gotta have it,” and no one approves, of course, which makes it that much hotter. But if you think you know how this all goes, then you should also know that it’s a film by Jane Campion (The Piano), one of the world’s great directors. Campion understands the clichés inherent in this kind of story and she navigates around them with skill and intensity, delivering instead a truthful film about living a real life in a time that required a crushing denial of that same reality.Watch TrailerCamille Claudel, 1915 (2013)  80%If you’re here for demanding, difficult director Bruno Dumont, then you’ve already seen this one. But chances are you’re here because Juliette Binoche is one of best actors on the planet and you never even knew this film existed. Well, get ready to work, because Camille Claudel, 1915 is an exacting drama of the long-take school, featuring a deeply felt, and highly specific performance from Binoche as an artist whose life was marked by slow, inexorable tragedy. Claudel, once the mistress of sculptor Auguste Rodin, is committed to an asylum in southern France and left to waste away. Binoche, burrowing deeply into the emptiness, speaks very little, but says everything. A tough but rewarding feel-bad experience for people who don’t need happy endings.Watch TrailerFruitvale Station (2013)  94%At the moment, Michael B. Jordan is impressing audiences in Creed, but his promise was announced with this earlier film by Creed’s director Ryan Coogler. It’s a true story, one that could have been taken from any headline of the past few years, and stars Jordan as Oscar Grant, a 22-year-old black man in Oakland, California, who lost his life on New Year’s Day, 2009, when he was murdered by a police officer at an Oakland BART station. It begins with cellphone video of the real killing. But instead of delving into documentary-style drama about the event itself, Coogler shows you Grant moving through his last day, dealing with work and family and friends. This approach heightens the despair and sense of wasted life by forcing the audience to live with the everyday humanity of the crime’s victim, rather than a just-the-facts approach resulting in one more numbing statistic created by institutional racism.Watch TrailerPhilomena (2013)  91%This tear-jerker is based on the harrowing story of Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), an Irish woman whose youthful unplanned pregnancy resulted in her confinement to a cruel, prison-like convent, her child put up for adoption against her will. In her later years, she joins a journalist (Steve Coogan) in the hunt for her now-adult lost child, unprepared for what she’ll find. Now, when the deck is this stacked with tragedy, a strong center is required to avoid overselling the pain. That means you go get Judi Dench. Audiences have placed massive amounts of goodwill in her, and for good reason. She’s a walking empathy machine, gently and intelligently tugging at your heart when lesser actors would mercilessly wrestle it to the ground. Her soft-spoken, perhaps needlessly naïve and devout truth-seeker (compared to the real life woman, whose relationship with the Church that abused her involves no love lost) is all goodness, all forgiveness. This is how she earns your tears. And you will shed them.Watch TrailerThe Queen (2006)  96%Is this really how Queen Elizabeth II behaved behind closed doors in the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death? Did she have a genuine crisis of manners and standards? Was she forced to contend with the changes taking place outside the confines of royal life, where contemporary public expectations of figureheads shifted, altered by that public’s relationship with Diana herself? We’ll probably never really know for sure, but as portrayed by Helen Mirren, we now want to believe that the stoic monarch in the pastel-colored hats had a dormant heart that grew three sizes the moment Elton John re-recorded “Candle in The Wind.” Mirren carries the film like it all rests on her shoulders – it does, by the way – and she does so gracefully, balancing regulation and feeling like a proper queen. She won a well-deserved Oscar for it, too.Watch TrailerSelma (2014)  99%One of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2014 was, strangely, ignored at the box office and by award-giving organizations. Perhaps it all felt like it might be the moviegoing equivalent of homework, but Ava DuVernay’s Selma is a huge achievement, both in re-examining the past through fresh eyes, as well as in sheer entertainment. This is not a saintly MLK. David Oyelowo portrays the legendary civil rights leader as a real, flawed, sometimes frightened, sometimes furious man, and you can’y take your eyes off him. Maybe people stayed away because the story of King’s campaign to secure the Voting Rights Act of 1965 might have felt too real in a moment when politicians are still trying to figure out ways to keep non-white Americans from voting. Whatever your reasons for avoiding it were, you were wrong. Go watch this one today.Watch TrailerViolette (2014)  86%You’ve heard about the famous French writer Simone de Beauvoir. Well, this is not about her. Instead, it’s the story of Violette Leduc, a French author who was deeply involved with de Beauvoir for years. As played by Emmanuelle Devos, this lesser-known literary figure is a fascinatingly complex cauldron of conflicting feelings, a woman filled with unhappiness who was stoutly determined to get what she wanted, grasping for life and personal connection anywhere she could find it. She had an iron will and a prickly personality that you won’t like, but also won’t soon forget. Sometimes it’s the unlikeliest people who make the most interesting subjects.Watch TrailerWild (2014)  88%This is not Reese Witherspoon’s 127 Hours, her Incredible Journey, or anything else you think it is. It’s a much more subtle story about a woman’s determination to finish what she starts and heal herself along the way. Based on Cheryl Strayed’s memoir, Wild tells the story of the troubled author’s 1,100 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. She encounters danger and despair, but not the kind you expect. In fact, very little of this movie relies on the usual prestige picture story beats and cathartic uplifts, the kind that secure nominations and awards. Meanwhile, Witherspoon’s performance rivals her Oscar-winning turn as June Carter in Walk The Line. She’s that good, as is Laura Dern as her mother.Watch Trailer","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cats, awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"10-biopics-to-watch-immediately"},{"id":"47612959421803","title":"RT’s 2015 Oscar Picks","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT's 2015 Oscar PicksHere's who we think will win, and why.by Marya E. Gates | February 20, 2015 |  Comments.content_body .col_right{overflow:hidden!important}This time every year we at Rotten Tomatoes lock ourselves in a room, put our collective heads together and try to do the undoable: guess who will win at the Academy Awards. We know this is somewhat futile, but we love it. Last year we were 21/24. Let’s see if history repeats itself.Best Picture: Boyhood  97%Like last year, we see the race split between two frontrunners: Boyhood and Birdman. While Birdman has been gaining momentum with wins at the guild awards, we think it will be rewarded elsewhere. Best Picture seems the natural final leg for Boyhood‘s twelve-year journey.Best Director: Alejandro González Iñárritu for Birdman  91%That said, this is where we see the split heading, especially after Iñárritu took home the top prize from the Director’s Guild. While Linklater’s held his vision for twelve years, it’s hard to ignore Iñárritu’s impressive work with a large ensemble cast of actors and the film’s strong visual style.Best Actor: Eddie Redmayne for The Theory of Everything  80%Early on in the race, it seemed this was Michael Keaton’s award to lose. But as the race progressed, Redmayne’s transformation into Stephen Hawking took center stage, taking home the BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG awards.Best Actress: Julianne Moore for Still Alice  85%This marks Julianne Moore’s 5th nomination (she’s lost four times, including the year she was nominated in two categories). The Academy loves to reward people for years of consistent good work (except poor Peter O’Toole!), and this year is Moore’s year. She’s already got the BAFTA, Critics Choice, NBR, Golden Globe and SAG. It’s time to make space on her mantle for one more.Best Supporting Actor: J.K. Simmons for Whiplash  94%In the role of his career, consummate character actor J.K. Simmons steals the show as the acerbic music teacher of your nightmares. Simmons is as sure a bet as you’ll find this year, having already won in this category at the BAFTAs, Critics Choice, Golden Globes, SAGs and countless film critic groups. His performance is just the Academy’s tempo.Best Supporting Actress: Patricia Arquette for Boyhood  95%While Emma Stone has been up-and-coming for years now, her nomination is her prize. This award is as good as Arquette’s. Critics and voters seem to agree that while the film is called Boyhood, it’s Arquette’s steadfast mother who is the heart of the film. Like J.K. Simmons, she’s racked up wins at the BAFTAs, Critics Choice, Golden Globes, SAGs and critics groups.Best Foreign Language Film: Ida  96%A couple of us here at Team Tomato would argue that this film should have made its way to the Best Picture category. This homage to the Polish New Wave of the early 1960s has already won several awards in this category.Animated Feature: Big Hero 6  90%In a year with no Pixar release (and a shocking lack of The Lego Movie), we think this Certified Fresh Disney crowd-pleaser will take the gold. We can’t wait to hear Baymax’s speech.Best Documentary: Citizenfour  96%The perfect storm of an interesting (and timely) story told in an interesting way, CitizenFour has been cleaning up in this category all season.Original Screenplay: The Grand Budapest Hotel  92%This is Wes Anderson’s third nomination in this category, but the first time one of his films has made the leap to Best Picture (and director and 7 more categories), so we think this is where the Academy will reward Anderson for bringing us his quirky, unique cinematic worlds for the past twenty years.Adapted Screenplay: Whiplash  94%While we debate the validity of putting this in the adapted category, we think this is where the Academy will show love to writer/director Damien Chazelle.Best Cinematography: Birdman  91%After losing in this category five times, it seems Emmanuel Lubezki is set for a back-to-back win after nabbing gold for Gravity. His work on Birdman helped create the illusion of a film that takes place in one seamless shot, hopefully ending on a podium.Best Film Editing: Boyhood  97%It’s often said a film is born in the editing room and without the work of Sandra Adair, Boyhood is just twelve years of footage. Side note: Adair has edited all of Linklater’s films since Dazed and Confused.Best Costume Design: Into the Woods  71%Costume designer Colleen Atwood practically is this category. She’s been nominated a whopping 11 times in the last twenty years, and we think this Sunday she’ll see her fourth win.Best Production Design: The Grand Budapest Hotel  92%Wes Anderson films have long been known for their distinct style and this film is the pinnacle. A world within a world within a world, all unique and exquisitely detailed.Best Music – Original Score: The Theory of Everything  80%The heart of this film is the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane, and Jóhann Jóhannsson’s swelling, romantic score brings the viewers into their passion without ever overwhelming us with schmaltz.Best Music – Original Song: “Glory” from Selma  99%One of only two nominations for Ava DuVernay’s MLK biopic, it’s tough to think that if it doesn’t win here, it’ll go home empty-handed.Best Sound Editing: American Sniper  72%The Academy loves a well recorded war pic.Best Sound Mixing: Whiplash  94%Did you hear this movie? Did you see those drums? Our hearts are still beating to Fletcher’s tempo.Best Visual Effects: Interstellar  72%While Caesar and his clan were seamlessly brought to life in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Guardians of the Galaxy boasted some eye-popping visuals, we think every one of the nominees in this category utilized their effects in much the same fashion and achieved similar goals with them. Every one of the nominees, that is, except for Interstellar, whose depiction of mindbending theoretical concepts sets it apart from the pack.Best Makeup and Hairstyling: Guardians of the Galaxy  92%Big hair and fake noses are great and all, but the complete transformations of Zoe Saldana and David Bautista into their alien characters are out of this world.Best Short Film – Live Action: The Phone CallThe Phone Call stars the great Sally Hawkins as a suicide hotline operator and the great Jim Broadbent as the grief-stricken man on the other line. That’s right: this one’s got two recognizable actors, which means it’s twice as likely that Oscar voters got around to watching it.Best Short Film – Animated: The Bigger PictureWritten and directed by Daisy Jacobs, The Bigger Picture sounds like a run of the mill drama: two brothers take care of their elderly mother. But what makes this film exceptional is the animation itself: life-size characters painted on walls interacting with real objects, resulting in a refreshing “How’d they do that?” from viewers.Best Documentary Short: Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1American Sniper isn’t the only Oscar-nominated film about the psychological wounds of warfare; Crisis Hotline focuses on a suicide prevention call center for servicemen. It’s a haunting, observant document of a vital issue, and it’s sure to resonate with members of the academy.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"marvel, witnail, halloween","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rts-2015-oscar-picks"},{"id":"47612975977840","title":"2014 GLAAD Media Awards Nominations","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2014 GLAAD Media Awards Nominationsby RT Staff | February 4, 2014 |  Comments.awmovie .celeb,.awmovie .nopic,.awmovie .single{float:left}The GLAAD Media Awards, which “recognize and honor media for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and the issues that affect their lives,” announced its nominees on February 4.

This month, the actor reprises his role as Dr. Lazslo Kreizler in The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, season 2 of the period drama that based on the second book in Caleb Carr’s Kreizler series. With the TNT show and the highly anticipated&nbsp;Marvel Cinematic Universe&nbsp;series, The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, in which he’ll once again be playing the villainous Helmut Zemo, Brühl&nbsp;finds himself back in some familiar shoes.The details behind the Disney+ series are still a bit vague, as the project hasn’t fully completed filming. One thing we do know&nbsp;is that Brühl will finally be donning the Baron Zemo mask,&nbsp;which, if we’re being honest, is a super-exciting detail to whet our collective appetites.View this post on Instagram„Longing, Rusted, Seventeen, Daybreak, Furnace, Nine, Benign, Homecoming, One, Freight Car.“ Zemo is getting ready #SDCC @comic_con @marvel @marvelstudiosA post shared by Daniel Brühl (@thedanielbruhl) on Jul 23, 2019 at 10:57am PDTThen there’s his role in The King’s Man, the origin story for and prequel film to the Kingsman series of movies. The film, from 20th Century Studios and starring Ralph Fiennes and Harris Dickinson, was originally scheduled for 2019, but Disney’s takeover at Fox reportedly prompted its move to February 2020. It’s release date is now September 18, 2020.That’s a lot of press junkets in one year for any actor.The Alienist: Angel of Darkness&nbsp;returns to TNT next week with a two-episode premiere event, and buzz behind the Emmy-winning program’s return is running high. For good reason: the tonal mashup of procedural crime drama and gritty period piece — The Alienist drops audiences smack dab in the middle of New York’s Gilded Age —&nbsp;elevates&nbsp;a familiar television narrative by&nbsp;embellishing&nbsp;it with lavish costumes and historic details.It’s worth noting that Angel of Darkness, while&nbsp;technically a sequel to the first season,&nbsp;works as its own standalone story. Brühl’s Dr. Kreizler reunites with his rag-tag investigative cohorts Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning), now running her own detective agency, and New York Times journalist John Moore (Luke Evans) as they work to solve a string of baby murders amid a backdrop of political and cultural turmoil. The themes of women’s rights, police brutality, and racism create a conflicted, yet timely, story here.Ahead of the show’s return, Rotten Tomatoes spoke with Brühl about how his character has evolved since the series premiere, whether the show’s disturbing subject matter gives him nightmares, how the themes explored in The Alienist: Angel of Darkness are relevant today, and if&nbsp;the COVID-19 shutdown delayed his work on The Falcon and The Winter Soldier.(Photo by TNT)Aaron Pruner for Rotten Tomatoes: This season focuses a lot on Sara Howard, while Kreizler is cultivating his own relationships. Has Kreizler, as a character, changed in how you interpret him since you first took on the role?Daniel Brühl: Knowing about Sara’s psychological skills, Laszlo Kreizler is eventually willing to share power and to give in and to let Sarah Howard be in charge of that new mystery and of that new case. He becomes, emotionally, a more open-minded man thanks to the friendship with Sara and John and eventually even finds a kindred spirit, someone who he finds very fascinating.It’s so interesting because my wife is an alienist in real life. And she told me that many times the most brilliant psychologists you know, become very nervous when they have to deal with, you know, their own introspection and their own inner life. So they may be brilliant in, you know, analyzing their environment, and yet, they have problems in expressing what they are going through.The theme of child murder continues in season 2.&nbsp;Is it tough to separate yourself from the&nbsp;dark subject matter of the show?Brühl:&nbsp;It didn’t affect me that much when we were shooting the actual show, but watching it now gives me nightmares. I’m the father of a little boy and expecting my second baby to arrive soon. The fact that this show this time around deals more with motherhood and fatherhood, respectively, felt more universal. It was also interesting to realize how engaged my wife was when she watched the show. She said that it resonated more with her than the first season.(Photo by Nelly Kiss/TNT)This is a period piece, yet the issues explored in the series continue to feel quite timely — women’s rights, sensationalism in the news, police corruption, income inequality, and racism. What message are you hoping viewers will take away from watching?Brühl:&nbsp;It is very sad to see how long it takes for mankind to really make a change. It’s funny how history goes in waves. I wouldn’t say that it always goes in the wrong direction. Sometimes we advance, sometimes we evolve, and then, sometimes we go three steps back. So it is sadly fascinating to see that a story set in 1897 and a book written about that period that was published in the 1990s still feels so current.And what the story tells us is that it always takes a couple of courageous liberal modern minds to make a change. Unfortunately, mankind needs to have the worst things happen in order to move on. So the eruption that, fortunately, we witness these days internationally, due to the things that happened in the U.S., gives me a bit of optimism, because that avalanche, that eruption, and that message that racism has to stop, is being heard loudly and clearly at the moment. I hope that, finally, we will change and, hopefully, carry on doing so. We always have to hope that we will learn something from history.(Photo by Marvel)It’s been a busy year for you. Were your scenes in The Alienist or The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;(pictured) affected by the shutdown?Brühl:&nbsp;The Falcon and Winter Soldier was. I still have to go back, and hopefully, we’ll be able to finish that project in Prague. We’ll see how the situation is in a month or two, but that’s the plan.Surprisingly, I was able to shoot my directorial debut, which is a film [called Next Door] that I had been thinking about and writing and developing for two or three years. When we were about to start the rehearsals, the quarantine kicked in and so for a moment, I thought that this project would die. Fortunately, it didn’t. We were able to shoot it in Berlin in a studio and trimmed down the crew a little bit. And so there weren’t any major problems that we were facing, and I just finished it.Have you been able to take any piece of wardrobe or prop home from The Alienist set?Brühl:&nbsp;My cane with that little bird, which became a toy for my little boy. He’s now using it as a sword. So I have to protect it from the night games he’s playing.What else? I think I may have taken a hat. The other stuff felt too period. I mean, it looks incredibly flashy and cool, but I think people here in Berlin would think, “What the heck happened to Daniel?”The Alienist: Angel of Darkness premieres&nbsp;Sunday, July 19 at&nbsp;9 p.m. on TNTThe Alienist: Angel of Darkness (2020) 86%#1Adjusted Score: 86.805% Critics Consensus: Tense and thrilling, if not terribly distinct, Angel of Darkness takes The Alienist in a darker direction while giving the superb Dakota Fanning more time to shine.Synopsis: In The Alienist: Angel of Darkness, Sara has opened her own private detective agency and is leading the charge on...

Not a whole lot, mind you, considering the best-reviewed stuff this week is, again, mostly limited to TV and the smaller theatrical releases, but it won’t be long before the awards contenders start showing up in this column. Speaking of which, we want to note that we previously wrote about The Act of Killing back in the beginning of December, when it was originally scheduled to hit shelves, and it turns out it was actually pushed back to this week; we apologize for the mistake. With all that said, here are this week’s selections:Closed Circuit 43%This thriller opened back in late August but failed to make much noise at the box office; critics weren’t particularly enthused about it either. Directed by John Crowley (whose well-received 2007 film Boy A was Andrew Garfield’s big screen debut), Closed Circuit stars Rebecca Hall and Eric Bana as ex-lovers who are reunited when they’re separately hired to defend a suspected terrorist in a high-profile trial. As classified details are uncovered, however, the pair begin to unravel a conspiracy that could endanger their lives. The film boasts an accomplished cast that includes Jim Broadbent, Ciaran Hinds, and Julia Stiles in supporting roles, but most critics found the conspiracy angle a bit predictable and the overall narrative a bit lacking in believability. At 40% on the Tomatometer, Closed Circuit is a mediocre legal thriller that never quite accomplishes what it’s going for.Runner Runner 7%As long as we’re talking about subpar thrillers populated by otherwise impressive actors, we might as well mention Runner Runner, director Brad Furman’s disappointing follow-up to surprise hit The Lincoln Lawyer. Justin Timberlake plays Richie Furst, a Princeton student with a penchant for online gambling who loses big and travels to Costa Rica to confront Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), the gambling mogul he believes has fleeced him. Instead, Ivan takes Richie under his wing, which draws the attention of an FBI agent who wants to put Ivan away for good. Critics largely conceded Runner Runner had the seed of a decent plot, but they also overwhelmingly agreed the film wasted its potential on a lifeless, poorly crafted script. At a mere 9% on the Tomatometer, this is one you can probably skip unless you’re really bored.Thanks for Sharing 50%If Steve McQueen’s Shame was too serious for you, maybe Thanks for Sharing is more your bag. It wasn’t for about half the critics who saw it, but hey, everybody’s different. The film follows three couples dealing in different ways with sexual addiction and stars folks like Mark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Gwyneth Paltrow, Patrick Fugit, Josh Gad, Joely Richardson, and, in a role that impressed quite a few folks, Alecia Moore, better known as pop artist Pink. Critics generally liked the performances here; they also felt that the material was treated a bit too superficially&nbsp;and that it couldn’t quite decide on a balanced tone. Thanks for Sharing sits at 49% on the Tomatometer, so it’s not entirely terrible; a little underwhelming might be more accurate.Archer – Season 4Those who remember the early days of Adult Swim and Home Movies are already well familiar with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin. These days, he pulls double duty as both the voice of frumpy patriarch Bob Belcher on Bob’s Burgers and that of cocksure super-agent Sterling Archer on FX’s Archer. This week, the fourth season of Archer goes on sale, complete with the first episode that finds Archer, having lost his memory, flipping patties at Bob’s Burgers while his wife and three kids mill about the restaurant. Over the past few years, the show has found its footing and a dedicated fanbase, and the fourth season currently rates a 93% on the Tomatometer, so it’s a pretty solid buy for anyone who’s a fan.Top of the LakeJane Campion has focused primarily on film over the past couple of decades, but she’s had success on television as well, most recently with her 2013 miniseries Top of the Lake. A joint production of BBC Worldwide and the Sundance Channel, the six-part series is set in New Zealand and stars Elisabeth Moss as a detective charged with investigating the disappearance of a pregnant 12-year-old girl. With a supporting cast that includes David Wenham, Holly Hunter, and Peter Mullan, to name a few, Top of the Lake received near universal acclaim from critics, who praised the acting and strong, atmospheric storytelling. Certified Fresh at 93%, it’s a relatively short but riveting trip worth taking.Also available this week:Birth of the Living Dead (95%), a documentary about George Romero and the societal impact of his debut, Night of the Living Dead.Inequality for All (92%), a Certified Fresh documentary exploring the widening income gap in America that’s equal parts witty and informative.We Are What We Are (87%), a Certified Fresh mystery/thriller about the dark secrets behind a strict, small-town patriarchal family.Big Ass Spider! (78%), a sci-fi comedy about two Los Angelenos who attempt to stop a giant rampaging spider.Tiger Eyes (66%), the big screen adaptation of the Judy Blume novel of the same name about a girl coming of age in a new town after the sudden death of her father.Linsanity (65%), a documentary chronicling Asian-American NBA star Jeremy Lin’s path to success, beginning with his early life.Season 2 of Copper (100%), the BBC America television series about an Irish detective working the Five Points neighborhood in 1860s New York.The first season of The Following (65%), starring Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy in a series about FBI agents tracking down a serial killer and his cultish followers.Season 3 of the North American remake of Being Human, a TV series about three Boston roommates who happen to be a ghost, a werewolf, and a vampire.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"renewals, Thanksgiving, Prime, of, Turner, king, Films, transformers, of, Bravo, kong, Grant","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-archer-closed-circuit-and-more"},{"id":"47612963640685","title":"Interview: Kathleen Hanna on The Punk Singer, Sexism, Riot Grrrl and More","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Interview: Kathleen Hanna on The Punk Singer, Sexism, Riot Grrrl and MoreThe feminist rock icon talks about her career, the movies that influenced her, and the new documentary about her life.by Luke Goodsell | November 28, 2013 |  CommentsThough she’d probably hate to admit it, Kathleen Hanna is a punk rock icon. As one of the founding members of Bikini Kill, Hanna was at the epicenter of the ’90s “riot grrrl” movement and a key music figure in radical feminism, a role she carried on into her dance pop outfit Le Tigre and her new band, The Julie Ruin. Along the way she’s inspired countless female (and male) musicians, gotten infamously punched by Courtney Love, and coined the phrase “Smells like teen spirit” (the latter incidents are unrelated, as far as we know.) She’s also one of the coolest (and nicest) people you could talk to.Hanna is the subject of Sini Anderson’s new documentary The Punk Singer, a biopic of sorts that charts the singer’s rise from performance art through punk rock and beyond, and doubles as a mini-history of the riot grrrl era. Featuring interviews with the likes of Joan Jett, Kim Gordon, Carrie Brownstein and Hanna’s partner, Adam Horowitz, the movie offers an intimate portrait of the musician, and allows Hanna herself to speak frankly about her life and her recent battle with an undiagnosed case of Lyme disease.Here, Hanna chats about the movies that inspired her, sexism in media, reconciling the past, the future of riot grrrl and more.I was hoping we could start by talking a little about movies. We’re always asking about people’s favorite films and I’m really curious as to some of yours, or perhaps some of the ones that were influential on you.Kathleen Hanna: Well, a really big movie for Bikini Kill was Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains, starring Diane Lane and Laura Dern. They’re in a punk band called The Fabulous Stains, and there’s members of The Clash that play kind of the rival boy band, called The Professionals. [Laughs] And their song is [sings] “We’re the pro-fess-ionals! Join the pro-fess-ionals!” It’s actually really good. I don’t know if you’ve seen that movie.Oh, I’ve seen it many times. Which version of “Professionals” do you prefer? ‘Cause there’s that one over the end credits where they’re all dolled up to do the MTV-style version.[Laughs] I like all of them! I like both of them. That was the thing about it. It was kind of interesting because it was kind of like what happened to Madonna — you know, with everybody copying how she dressed and showing up at her concerts. And it was also talking about this commercialization of things, and kind of going in the direction that the ’90s would go in — like, “You’re a sellout” and all that kind of stuff. I didn’t really realize that at the time. I mean, in high school we would say stuff like, “Oh, they’re sellouts now” and we didn’t really know what that meant. [Laughs] You know what I mean? It was like, “This band’s first EP was so great, but then everybody got into them,” and because everybody got into them that made them sellouts. Which is completely some random high-school way of thinking about things. But I remember that being the first film that I heard the term “sellout,” and I saw this feminist band being like, “Well we don’t care of you call us that — we’re gonna do whatever we want.” And that was a really powerful message for me and [Bikini Kill band members] Kathi [Wilcox] and Tobi [Vail], who were watching it on laser disc at Tobi’s parents’ house.It has such an interesting history that movie, too, with the writer Nancy Dowd having her name taken off it ’cause she was worried about the final product. It’s odd how her original intent survives in the movie, even though it was directed by a guy and mishandled by the studio.Yeah. Things like that always happen. I mean, films are such long processes that all kinds of weird sh-t happens during them that are too complicated to go in to. I kind of understand that world a little bit more now, and how things can go kind of wonky.So Stains was a big one for you. Were there any other films that made an impact?Definitely Born in Flames by Lizzie Borden. That was huge for me — like, monstrously huge. Oh, and the movie Working Girls that she made — not the Melanie Griffith one. It’s about sex work. I don’t know if you’ve seen that one.No, I haven’t seen that one.It’s just as amazing in a totally different way. It basically shows this woman who seems like a high-price call girl who works out of a fancy apartment, and her job is really boring. The whole movie is really boring. And I sat there laughing and loving how really boring it was, because I’ve been a stripper and I’ve been asked about it a lot. People would say, “Oh, you were a sex-positive stripper,” and I was like, “It doesn’t have anything to do with sex, to me.” It’s really boring and pathetic and embarrassing to everyone, and I don’t think that it’s sex-positive to be a stripper. I think of it as a way to, you know, put food in your mouth and be an artist and pay for college. I didn’t ever think that I was doing this sex-positive thing. [Laughs] So, watching this movie that was about sex work that was really boring was awesome, and I laughed through the whole thing. I was so happy.Diane Lane in Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous StainsBecause it was so accurate in depicting the boredom?Yeah! I would always joke, like, “Have you seen Pretty Woman, that documentary about prostitution?”[Laughs]You know what I mean? Movies like that. The mainstream public is supposed to believe that prostitution is like that.That’s an interesting choice. I’ll have to see it.Have you seen Out of the Blue?Yes, the Dennis Hopper movie with Linda Manz? Love that.It’s pretty amazing.Okay, well I have to ask you this, because I’m an idiot. What is your take on Cassavetes? Do you have a favorite?[Laughs] I would have to say say A Woman Under the Influence. That’s the one where the dog pops in. [Laughs] You know what I mean? In that scene where they’re in the living room and the German Shepherd just shows up?That’s a really odd, specific detail to remember.Yeah, I always thought that was so genius. Because it was just like, it said, “I know this is a film.” And it was playful.I’m with you on the movie. Gena Rowlands’ performance in that film is just something else altogether.Yeah. She’s out of control. She’s totally so good. So good. I mean, I also love her in Gloria.Okay, staying with movies for a moment. You’ve had a long history, with both Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, of fighting sexism in the rock world. Do you have any thoughts on sexism as an issue in film? Is there any correlation between the music and movie industries, in terms of what girl bands and actresses have to deal with?Yeah, I think definitely for actresses the big thing is weight. You’ve either gotta be rail-thin or, you know, you’re Rebel Wilson — you’re bigger and that’s how you’re sold.There’s no in-between?Right. It’s like, you’re just supposed to be extremely tiny and extremely good-looking, and you’re supposed to be 20 forever — all that kind of stuff. I think that’s similar. The thing about music is that it’s like flash-in-the-pan style — something will be really popular for like five minutes and then everybody forgets about it. It’s like, that person, in the mind of everybody, is gone. But they’re not gone, they’re still out there and making work; it’s just not being recognized or noticed. In terms of sexism in film, I’m sure it’s really just more of the same. You know, dealing with asshole male technical people who wanna make you feel like an idiot, and all that kind of stuff. I mean, look at how few female directors there are — in comparison.Hanna with Kim Gordon in Sonic Youth’s “Bull in the Heather”Which is weird when you consider that in the early days of cinema, women were a major force in directing and writing movies. People like Alice Guy, who kind of made the first narrative movie. Why do you think there are so few now?I think it’s sexism. You know, movies are a traditionally male field; I don’t know — I can’t explain it beyond that.There’s that old saying that the history of cinema is tied up in the male gaze, that of men photographing women.[Laughs] Yeah, that’s a great saying.There’s also a different standard, I think, by which female filmmakers are assessed. For example, it’s rare that anyone ever talks about Sofia Coppola without invoking her “privilege,” as though she couldn’t possess her own talent, irrespective of her father.Yeah, I mean, I think that happens all the time. I’ve done so many interviews where all they want to talk about is, you know, my husband, and my relationship with my husband [Hanna is married to musician Adam Horowitz]. And I opened that Pandora’s box in the film, so I understand it being a question, or two questions, but I don’t understand people who spend their entire 20 minutes with me talking about the Beastie Boys, you know? [Laughs] I’m like, “You do know that the film’s about me, and it’s called The Punk Singer?” [Laughs] So there’s always the thing where it’s just about the woman’s personal life; it’s never about her art. And they’re gonna give out that kind of criticism, no matter what. It’s not just. It’s like, a lot of men can get away with a ton of sh-t — a lot of white, straight men can get away with a ton of sh-t — and if a woman makes one mistake, it’s wallpapered all over the city. It’s hard to live like that. It’s hard to live feeling like one slip of the tongue and you’re over, whereas men can get away with just about anything. You know, if you say “F-ck you” to the wrong person and you’re a woman, you might be out of work forever — whereas men are expected to say “F-ck you” to each other. [Laughs]Right. And I see so many interviews with you where people are like, “What do you think of Lady Gaga?” “What about Miley?” And the intent feels like “Let’s get a bitchy quote” and sort of play everyone off against each other.Uh-huh. But you know, I know what they’re doing. It’s not like I don’t know what they’re doing — and I use it to my benefit. I also use it to keep the conversation about feminism in public going, because I think it is okay that we comment on each others’ work; I think it’s okay that, you know, I say I don’t appreciate it when women — or men — bandy about these stupid stereotypes about feminism that are age-old, and that are meant to keep people turned off from it. It’s like, “All you have to do is Wikipedia feminism to know that it’s not about man-hating — so shut up.” That makes me annoyed. And if I say that, then so be it. If people turn something into pull-quotes where I hate some female journalist or some other female musician, you know — I don’t hate any other musicians. But — I don’t like every other musician’s work. The same way that filmmakers don’t like every other filmmakers’ work. Just because I’m a feminist doesn’t mean I’m gonna say that I like every other woman’s work, or that I appreciate another statement that another woman publicly made. But I also understand that we all say stuff that’s stupid sometimes. [Laughs]Next, Hanna talks about Kurt Cobain, coming to terms with her Riot Grrrl past, her illness, and what she hopes is her legacy for a new generation.Let me back up for a second, because I will ask you one question about Adam. I know that you had the opportunity to have people like Thurston Moore and Calvin Johnson talk in The Punk Singer, but that you chose to leave them out because you didn’t want a lot of “male experts.” Did you consider cutting Adam’s interviews at all?You know, Sini never interviewed Thurston or Calvin Johnson or Ian MacKaye, or anybody like that. I just sort of said at the beginning of the film that I feel like a lot of times those three people — and nothing against them — they’re always used as the experts on underground music. I really wanted Tobi Vail, the drummer for Bikini Kill, to in a way be the expert, because she’s such a musicologist, but she’s very camera shy. So they got Ann Powers, who I thought was fantastic. But I did have a reservation about putting Adam in. I didn’t want to be “the girl who married the Beastie Boy.” I had a reservation about putting anything about Kurt [Cobain] in, because I didn’t want to be the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” girl. But at the same time I am the person who wrote that on the wall, and it ended up being this huge deal — and that’s interesting. That’s an interesting thing that happened in my life, and leaving that out of a film about me would just be weird. I’m not gonna react to sexism by censoring myself. And I feel like leaving my relationship [with Horowitz] out of the film would not only be a total lie, because it’s the most important thing in my life, but also because it’s like — how can you say this? I used to do this thing when everybody thought I was a bitch in Bikini Kill. Everybody thought I was difficult. So when we would show up at clubs, I would be nicer than nice — like, so, so nice, because I wanted to counter that stereotype, you know, that feminists were bitches. And I didn’t want to do a similar kind of thing in this film. Some people are gonna do this really sexist thing where it’s like, “Oh, Beastie Boy girl, ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ girl,” and that’s all they’re gonna take away from it. I don’t want my life and my art to mainly be associated with men, but then it’s like, I can’t control what people do — and if people have that kind of sexist reading, then that’s their problem. Who’s gonna leave out the fact that they wrote “Smells like teen spirit” on a wall and it became this massively huge hit, and then shifted underground culture and mainstream at the same time? Who’s gonna leave that out of their life story? I’d be crazy. Don’t you think?For sure. The other thing about that is that while Kurt has become this rock idol, what people forget is that — and correct me if I’m wrong here — he was also a feminist.Yes. He was actually an interesting person, who cared deeply about other people. Maybe too deeply, but, yeah.Rebel girls: Bikini Kill in the ’90sSo by having that story in your movie, it helps realign him with the ’90s feminist movement — instead of just being a poster on a wall next to Jim Morrison and a bunch of other dead guys. That’s good thing.I think so. I mean, I think he was influenced by a lot of stuff. He really loved heavy metal. But in this film they happened to mention his connection with the North West, and with our band and stuff like that. We were always, in Bikini Kill, we didn’t want to be associated with Nirvana, because we were worried that that would overshadow what we were trying to do. But in this film I felt like it was crazy to leave out these things that people already know, just because people would be like “Oh, she’s using that to get attention.” I mean, of course I am! I use everything to get attention — that’s why I’m a performer. [Laughs] That’s why I allowed a movie to be made about my life.Was there anything where you thought, “No, this is too personal, I can’t put this in the movie”?The thing that I almost had taken out, and I didn’t have taken out, was that picture of my father. I talk about him honestly, from my perspective. He’s still alive, and I was nervous about showing his face. But I felt like it was really weird showing a picture of my mom and to not show a picture of my dad. So I told the truth, as I know it, and that’s all I can do. That was hard for me. The stuff where I was talking about my dad was really hard for me, and I had to think about that one. I was pretty open and honest in absolutely everything, but it’s very difficult — no matter how abusive my father could be, and how boundary-crossing — it’s very hard to disconnect from your family. It’s really hard to feel like you’re a traitor to someone in your family, no matter what they do that’s despicable. So that was hard. The Lyme stuff was easy. Because in the movie, you know, that’s not even half of it. All they showed was me crying and having a hard time talking, and having some tics — not ticks, you know what I mean, but facial tics. In real life it was so much worse than that. [Laughs] So when I see that part I’m like, “Uh, next!” [Laughs]May I ask how you are at the moment? Are you well?I’m in treatment right now, so I’m, you know, still in my pajamas as I’m talking to you.So, what kind of pajamas does Kathleen Hanna wear?[Laughs] They’re just blue. Basic and nondescript. I’m pretty boring, fashion-wise, when I’m not on stage. So I’m still in treatment, and I have two more treatments after this. It’s basically antibiotics. They make me very fatigued, so I kind have to do that for a few weeks and struggle as best I can until the treatment gets a little better. After the third one, which will be in January, I’ll only have three treatments — and they shouldn’t affect me at all. So by then I should be pretty much myself again. Even if I get to 80 per cent I’ll be totally psyched for that.That’s good! I wanted to ask you a couple more questions before you go, about the new Julie Ruin stuff. There are a couple of tracks, like “Run Fast” and “Goodnight Goodbye,” that seem to find you at a kind of bittersweet crossroads — you’re almost saying farewell to the past as you move on. Does that reflect in a sense where you’re at in your life now, and why you decided to do the movie?Well, I think that when you’re really sick and you think you’re going to die, you make a lot of different decisions to what you would when you’re well. And archiving my work was a big part of that, because that’s what you do; you know, you’re 80 years old and your time’s coming, you make sure all of your stuff and your art is there, so your friends don’t have to deal with it. That’s a lot of what I was doing, so I had to look back at the past and kind of come to terms with it. In doing that it was really funny, you know, because you think that you keep everything in this kind of locked box, and then that’s how you deal with it: “That was then, this is now, and I’m like a shark — I’m just gonna keep moving.” I’ve always been like, “Okay, I’m on to the next thing.” I don’t sit there and listen to my old records; I don’t watch myself performing, you know what I mean? I’m just like, “What’s the next thing that I’m gonna do?” And through this archival process I’ve had to actually stop and look at what I have done, and, you know, be proud of a lot of it and be ashamed of a lot of it — and really kind of face it. And in facing it I was able to say goodbye. I’m not the head of Riot Grrrl, you know — I never was. Let’s say goodbye to some of the toxic residue from that time, that I still maintain I sort of allowed to control my decisions. I’m not that person anymore.Hanna in Sini Anderson’s documentary, The Punk SingerDo you get the sense that you helped cultivate a new generation? I mean, you only have to look at the Internet to see a bunch of Riot Grrrl stuff, whether it’s on Tumblr, or Rookie or wherever. Does it feel like it’s living?I hope so. I don’t really want “riot grrrl” to be living, because I’m not that interested in, like, fetishizing what already happened. I’m really interested in women who wanna actually make something more interesting than what we did, and who will challenge and critique the stuff that we did; and through that critique come up with something way better. That’s what I’m excited about; not, you know, fan sites with pictures of Riot Grrrl bands.Or a list on Buzzfeed like, “10 Things That Were Awesome About ’90s Alternative Girls.”Yeah, exactly.Are there any current artists who you think might be that next wave?I mean, I think that M.I.A. being absolutely huge, and kind of disappearing and reappearing, is really interesting. I think she’s an interesting person to follow as an artist. She’s amassed a lot of young kids who are saying stuff that they wouldn’t have said without her as a role model. So I think she’s pretty amazing. I also really like Grimes. She’s a young artist who’s producing her own material, and who’s unabashedly “No, I’m a feminist.”I saw your conversation with her on MTV.Yeah, and she requested me! And I’m like a total weird, old fogey.[Laughs] Really? That’s kind of pushing it.Oh you know what I mean. But it was nice. I think one of the things that’s happening now is that — because there’s a sort of resurgence of Riot Grrrl, and my band’s out on tour again, and people are interested and all that — there’s a generational thing going on, where a lot of the younger artists are being stirred into the pot with us older artists. And that’s really great, to have that kind of cross-pollination, you know; to have somebody who’s 45 being influenced by somebody who’s 25, and vice versa. It’s nice, and it does challenge the ageism that is typical of the music industry — although I’ve never really considered myself a part of the music industry, so… I don’t really have to deal with that! [Laughs] Except for when I was in Le Tigre and we did one major label record, and our record was up against JoJo. I don’t know if you remember her, but she was like a 15-year-old.Really vaguely. Which record — This Island?The last one, yeah, This Island. But they really needed to spend more time on JoJo’s record. [Laughs]And now everybody remembers Le Tigre, but poor JoJo!She had some song that was like [sings] “Get back! Get outta my face!” or something like that. [Laughs]Well on that note, I feel bad for keeping you so long — so I might let you go.“Might” let you go. [Laughs] “I might let you go… actually, nah.”Yeah, I’m really gonna get you to record some answering machine messages now.[Laughs] “Can you call my cousin, in Massachusetts, and sing her Happy Birthday?”How did you know?The Punk Singer opens theatrically in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, with VOD and further locations to follow.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"of, America, Day","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"interview-kathleen-hanna-on-the-punk-singer-sexism-riot-grrrl-and-more"},{"id":"47612956146026","title":"On DVD This Week: Ghostbusters, The Legend of Tarzan, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Ghostbusters, The Legend of Tarzan, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | October 10, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve&nbsp;got a blockbuster comedy reboot, a retelling of a familiar legend, the fifth chapter in an animated franchise, a true-life thriller, and more.

On top of that, there’s also the relatively well-received biopic about Alfred Hitchcock and the making of Psycho and a quirky Sean Penn-powered road trip drama. Lastly, we have a feature adaptation of the famed Cirque du Soleil troupe’s performances, as well as a handful of notable reissues. See below for the full list!Life of Pi 86%Yann Martel’s 2001 novel Life of Pi was a worldwide success, so it’s not surprising that development of a film adaptation began as early as 2003. Many considered the book “unfilmable,” however, so we didn’t get the movie until Ang Lee took up the helm (after several others dropped out) and felt technology was up to snuff to tell the story. The fantasy adventure revolves around Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma), an Indian teen whose parents own a struggling zoo and decide to sell all their animals to a buyer in Canada, where the family will settle. En route to Winnipeg, their freighter encounters a massive storm that wrecks the ship and leaves Pi stranded alone on a lifeboat with a few animals, including a fearsome Bengal tiger. Like its source novel, Life of Pi was met with both critical and commercial success, and was nominated for eleven Academy Awards; it won four Oscars, including Best Director for Ang Lee. Certified Fresh at 88%, it’s a trasportive, beautifully shot, technically impressive film, even if its underlying message may not resonate with everyone.Rise of the Guardians 75%Another film based on a book (or series of books, rather, authored by William Joyce), Rise of the Guardians reimagines mythical childhood figures like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and Jack Frost as warrior-like protectors of the world’s children — in addition to their regular duties delivering presents and hiding Easter eggs, that is. Voiced by Chris Pine, Jack Frost is a bit of a mischief maker, starting snowball fights and conjuring blizzards, until he’s recruited by the existing guardians to help defeat Pitch (Jude Law), a dark spirit intent on taking over the world. In the process, Jack discovers both his true worth as a guardian and the secrets of his past life. Though critics felt the story itself could have been a little more focused, they also liked the clever premise of the film, as well as its lush animation and brisk pacing. Certified Fresh at 74%, Rise of the Guardians is a fresh take on some familiar characters that most will be able to appreciate.Hitchcock 60%Screenwriter Sacha Gervasi’s directorial debut, 2007’s Anvil! The Story of Anvil, earned heaps of praise, so hopes were high for his film about Alfred Hitchcock, especially considering Anthony Hopkins would be filling in the role of the great director and Helen Mirren would be playing his wife and collaborative partner, Alma Reville. Hitchcock specifically chronicles the director’s efforts to finance and produce Psycho and the tumultuous relationship that resulted between him and Reville during the making of the film. Although critics would have liked to see a bit more subtlety and insight, most found the film stylishly directed and worth watching, even if only for the inspired performances from Hopkins and Mirren. At 63% on the Tomatometer, Hitchcock isn’t the be all and end all of biopics on The Master of Suspense, but it’s a well-acted glimpse into his life and old Hollywood.Sound City 100%Last year, musician Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) purchased a vintage Neve 8028 mixing console from Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, where he had taken part in recording the seminal Nirvana album Nevermind in 1991. The purchase inspired him to direct a documentary recounting the history of the influential studio, which oversaw the recording of several rock legends and musical icons ranging from Neil Young, Elton John, and Grateful Dead to Barry Manilow, Weezer, Metallica, and many more before it closed in 2011. Peppered with interviews and performances by many of those artists, Sound City weaves together the complete story of the studio and culminates in the purchase that inspired the film in the first place. The film, which opened in limited release just a month ago, has so far earned a 100% Tomatometer, with critics calling it an affectionately crafted passion project that’s thrilling, nostalgic, and a must-see for music fans.Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away 3D 45%Cirque du Soleil has been an expanding Las Vegas mainstay for several years now, but they’ve been a touring troupe for even longer, their television specials have won awards, and they’ve adapted their shows into films before. This latest venture, Worlds Away, is unique in that it also offers a 3D perspective for the first time, and what’s more? It’s James Cameron-approved 3D. Though it is, in fact, just another showcase for the talents of its performers, there is a narrative framing device: a young woman named Mia (Erica Linz) visits the local circus and falls into a dreamlike world with an aerialist; in order for the two to reunite, they must traverse the various tents of the circus and navigate through their performances. Critics were fairly split here; while some thought the film incoherently plotted and most conceded it was inferior to its live equivalent, others felt it was still beautiful to look at and entertaining enough. At 46%, Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away won’t compare to the real thing, but it’s not too bad if you can’t make it to one of the live shows.Smashed 83%Aaron Paul has already built up a considerable fanbase from his role in Breaking Bad, but while Mary Elizabeth Winstead’s star is slowly rising, she hadn’t quite landed the starring role that showcases her talents properly… until Smashed came along. In this low key indie, Paul and Winstead play Charlie and Kate, a young married couple who both decide to come to terms with their alcoholism. When Kate, an elementary schoolteacher, vomits in the middle of class, then drunkenly succumbs to smoking crack later that same night, she consequently joins group therapy and resolves to change her life. Critics roundly applauded Winstead’s performance, as well as director James Ponsoldt’s sensitive direction and the film’s melodrama-free script, en route to a Certified Fresh 84% on the Tomatometer. Costarring Nick Offerman, Octavia Spencer, and Mary Kay Place, Smashed failed to generate much heat at the box office, but here’s hoping it leads to more substantial roles for Winstead.This Must Be the Place 67%At first glance, This Must Be the Place might seem simply like the latest in a long line of quirky indie comedy-dramas: Sean Penn, looking like a cross between Bono and Edward Scissorhands, is aging former rock star Cheyenne, who travels home to New York from Ireland in order to reconcile with his estranged father as he lies on his deathbed. Though his father dies before he arrives, Cheyenne soon discovers that he was an Auschwitz survivor whose lifelong mission was to track down the man who abused him there; Cheyenne takes up his father’s quest and sets out across the US to find his father’s persecutor. It’s a strange tale, to be sure, but critics mostly found it surprisingly touching, buoyed by Penn’s oddly charismatic performance. At 68%, This Must Be the Place might be a little too off-kilter for some, but if you give it a chance, it might surprise you.Also available this week:A 25th Anniversary Blu-ray release of Disney’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit (98%), with a collection of extras ported over from previous releases and an in-depth commentary track.Two choices from the Criterion Collection: The original 1958 The Blob (69%), now on Blu-ray; and Fritz Lang’s Ministry of Fear on both DVD and Blu-ray.Some animated Disney films, paired with their direct-to-DVD sequels: Mulan (86%), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (74%), and Brother Bear (38%).Ron Howard’s 1988 fantasy flick Willow (46%) on Blu-ray.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cancelled, Film, leads, movies, television, Discovery, and, York, Critics, renewed, monsters, police, FOX, Land","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-life-of-pi-and-rise-of-the-guardians"},{"id":"47612985666933","title":"10 Movie- and TV-Based Video Games That Dazzled E3 Goers","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Movie- and TV-Based Video Games That Dazzled E3 GoersThe Walking Dead, Jurassic World, Spider-Man, and more TV and film favorites shuffle, stomp, and swing through this year's annual video game expo.by Matt Cabral | June 18, 2018 |  Comments(Photo by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment)The 2018 Electronic Entertainment Expo offered some promising new titles inspired by our favorite films and television shows when it hit the Los Angeles Convention Center June 12-14. Games based on movies and serialized TV are nothing new, but the genre has a history of pushing out products more focused on promoting an IP than offering a quality interactive experience.That’s changing. Game developers, passionate about the same titles as the rest of us, are shelving the marketing-spun schlock in favor of crafting ambitious projects that put us in our favorite fictional worlds.Here are 10 we can’t wait to play!JURASSIC WORLD EVOLUTIONDeveloper: Frontier DevelopmentsPublisher: Frontier DevelopmentsSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: Available nowAs fans of the Jurassic Park franchise films are well aware, the movies are primarily action-ratcheting affairs focused on dinos unleashing all kinds of hell on unsuspecting park-goers. Jurassic World Evolution, however, trades epic destruction for careful construction, as it tasks players with planning, building, managing, and monitoring their very own prehistoric theme park. While the game’s more of a cerebral stimulation, it’ll still spike your adrenaline when, say, your burgeoning management skills accidentally let a velociraptor loose in the food court.LEGO THE INCREDIBLESDeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros.Systems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo SwitchRelease Date: Available nowIf seeing&nbsp;Incredibles 2 hasn’t completely satisfied your craving for the superhero family’s unique brand of crime-fighting fun, you may want to suit-up for LEGO The Incredibles. Brimming with block-y bad guys, brick-based puzzles, and the LEGO series’ signature personality and humor, this latest plastic toy-packed adventure lets fans relive the best moments from both entries in the popular Pixar franchise. Tons of playable characters – including fan-favorite Edna Mode – and special moves, requiring the entire Parr crew to participate, round out this family-friendly romp.MARVEL’S SPIDER-MANDeveloper: Insomniac GamesPublisher: SonySystems: PlayStation 4Release Date: September 7, 2018Set in a sprawling, open-world New York City, this original Spider-Man tale – from veteran developer Insomniac Games – forgoes the origin story slog in favor of putting players behind the shooting webs, acrobatic combat, and wisecracking sense of humor of a more seasoned Spidey. An eye-popping visual presentation, adrenaline-spiking set pieces, fluid action, and more iconic villains than you can cram into Raft prison complement the cinematic wall-crawling, web-spinning action.WORLD WAR ZDeveloper: Saber InteractivePublisher: Paramount PicturesSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: 2018Plenty of games task players with shooting zombies, scavenging for supplies, and generally doing whatever it takes to survive the undead apocalypse. World War Z – which borrows more from the Brad Pitt film than Max Brooks’ book – breaths some fresh life into the rotting corpse genre, however, by putting up to 500 flesh-eating freaks on screen simultaneously. Of course, these hungry hordes can also form horrifying zombie pyramids, making it more difficult for you and your co-op partners to fend them off and live another day.SHADOW OF THE TOMB RAIDERDeveloper: Crystal DynamicsPublisher: Square EnixSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: September 14, 2018Fans of the Tomb Raider films and games can expect to meet a very different Lara Croft in this trilogy-capping entry. More Predator than Indiana Jones, Shadow of the Tomb Raider sees a confident, capable, vengeance-craving Croft camouflaged in mud and employing brutal combat tactics to turn exotic jungle locales into goon graveyards. Though&nbsp;Shadow isn’t your typical relic-hunting romp, players can still expect seat-of-the-pants storytelling, cinematic set pieces, and, yes, plenty of tombs to raid.LEGO DC SUPER-VILLAINSDeveloper: TT GamesPublisher: Warner Bros.Systems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PCRelease Date: October 16, 2018TT Games has no less than three Batman-starring installments in their stable of brick-busting LEGO adventures, but their latest DC entry is taking a decidedly different approach to the iconic comic book universe. As its title suggests, LEGO DC Super-Villains is all about the bad guys, from Harley Quinn and Lex Luthor to Poison Ivy and the Crown Prince of Crime himself, the Joker. Rather than playing as these iconic foes though, players will join them as their very own, fully customizable and upgradeable evildoer.OVERKILL’S THE WALKING DEADDeveloper: Overkill SoftwarePublisher: Starbreeze Studios/505 GamesSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 6, 2018Hundreds of games have pitted players against hordes of foot-shuffling foes, and a handful of those have even unfolded in Robert Kirkman’s walker-infested world. Overkill’s The Walking Dead separates itself from the brain-craving bunch, however, by translating the unforgiving world of the comic books into thumb-blistering gameplay. For fans, this means strategically cooperating with three other players to not only survive brutally difficult encounters with the undead, but also joining forces to fight the game’s most challenging enemies, a human faction dubbed “The Family.”HITMAN 2Developer: IO InteractivePublisher: WBIESystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: November 13, 2018We haven’t seen the bald, bar-coded assassin on the big screen since Rupert Friend wore his signature sharp suit and red tie in 2015’s Hitman: Agent 47. Fans needn’t wait for a film sequel to be reunited with their favorite hired killer, however, as Hitman 2 is headed to game consoles this fall. Assuming the role of the titular professional, stealthy players will travel to stunningly-realized exotic locales, don disguises, and incorporate improvised weapons – such as rat poison, frying pans, and frozen fish – to permanently silence high-level targets.RESIDENT EVIL 2Developer: CapcomPublisher: CapcomSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PCRelease Date: January 25, 2019Long before zombie shooters and apocalypse survival sims spread through the video game world like a population-wiping plague, players were fighting virally-infected canines and gobbling up green herbs in Resident Evil. Now, Capcom is inviting fans back to Raccoon City to relive what’s widely considered the seminal survival horror series’ best entry. More than a mere remaster though, Resident Evil 2 is a completely rebuilt re-imagining, featuring brand new visuals, audio, controls, and a nerve-fraying narrative to rival any contemporary take on the walking corpse genre.KINGDOM HEARTS IIIDeveloper: Square EnixPublisher: Square EnixSystems: PlayStation 4, Xbox OneRelease Date: January 29, 2019The Kingdom Hearts series has always been defined by its appealing, if unlikely, mash-up of Disney and Final Fantasy characters. Its long-awaited sequel though, is doubling down on the Disney – and Pixar – content, inviting fans to explore worlds and interact with heroes and villains from a variety of favorite films from Walt’s vault. From Frozen, Tangled, and Toy Story to Hercules, Wreck-It Ralph, and Pirates of the Caribbean, this fan-servicing sequel has something for Disney and Pixar enthusiasts of all stripes.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"PlayStation, street","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"film-television-tied-video-games-featured-at-e3"},{"id":"47612994854263","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: The Grey, Chronicle, and Albert Nobbs","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: The Grey, Chronicle, and Albert NobbsPlus, a couple of unpopular releases, a couple of underseen indies, and a new Criterion.by Ryan Fujitani | May 15, 2012 |  CommentsAfter a couple of pretty thin weeks on home video, we’ve got a good number of new releases this week, and a few of them are actually pretty decent. First off, if you’re looking for hi-def re-releases of older films, the choices are many, but random: Bernardo Bertolucci’s 1900, Jon Voight thriller The Odessa File, New York Stories, and the original 1973 version of Walking Tall, for example. But we’ve got some good choices this week, including Liam Neeson’s angsty survival thriller, a superpowered found-footage film, an Oscar-nominated period piece, and Woody Harrelson’s latest effort with Oren Moverman. Sure, we’ve got a couple of stinkers too, but the new Criterion should help make up for that. See below for the full list!The Grey 79%While several of Liam Neeson’s most recent films have been critical misfires or downright flops, The Grey proves he’s still capable of captivating an audience. Here, he leads a group of plane crash survivors as they attempt to navigate their way through the snowy Alaskan wilderness, facing both the elements and a pack of hungry wolves. With an equal focus on thrills and existential philosophy, The Grey managed to surprise critics and become one of those rare Certified Fresh hits released during the early part of the calendar year.One for the Money 2%Katherine Heigl continues her post-Knocked Up string of Rotten films with One for the Money, her lowest-rated film since the Judd Apatow hit. Based on the bestselling novel of the same name, One for the Money stars Heigl as Stephanie Plum, an out of work debtor who signs up to be bail bonds recovery agent, only to discover her biggest task is bringing in the man who dumped her in high school. With the similarly themed The Bounty Hunter having hit theaters just two years prior, Money didn’t fool anyone, and critics slapped it with a damning 2% Tomatometer.Chronicle 85%The initial reaction to Chronicle was, “Another found-footage movie?” but those who were lulled in by the superpowers angle were pleasantly surprised. The story revolves around three teens who are saddled with unnatural abilities after they make a curious discovery; as their powers grow stronger, their darker sides begin to emerge. Despite its gimmicky handheld format, most critics felt that Chronicle transcended its genre with all the elements of a solid movie: smart writing, a brisk pace, and engaging performances from its mostly unknown cast.The Devil Inside 6%If ever there were an argument against the recent found-footage trend, The Devil Inside would be it. While the genre certainly allows for heightened realism, it only works if the acting is noteworthy, the writing is clever, and the director demonstrates firm control over the hand-held camera gimmickry. The Devil Inside, about a young woman who visits her institutionalized mother to determine whether she’s insane or, in fact, actually demon-possessed, exhibits none of those characteristics, earning a well-deserved (according to most) 7% Tomatometer. And if that weren’t enough, reports indicate that its abrupt ending is also one of the most inane in recent memory.Albert Nobbs 56%A passion project for Glenn Close that she spent 15 years bringing to the screen, Albert Nobbs was met with lukewarm reviews but received Oscar nods for both Best Actress (Close) and Best Supporting Actress (Janet McTeer). Reprising the role she first played on stage in 1982, Close stars as the titular character, a woman who has spent decades assuming a male identity in order to secure employment at a hotel. After meeting a fellow employee engaged in a similar ruse (McTeer), Nobbs decides to pursue domestic ties with a maid (Mia Wasikowska), who has troubles of her own. While some critics found the film thought-provoking and poignant, others felt it didn’t dig deep enough into the issues it presented, resulting in a 55% Tomatometer score. At the very least, though, most agree that the performances are top notch.Rampart 74%Woody Harrelson has enjoyed a bit of a career resurgence in recent years, thanks to films like No Country for Old Men, Transsiberian, Zombieland, and The Messenger. Last year, he joined up again with The Messenger director Oren Moverman for another Certified Fresh film, this time about a hard-nosed cop in LA’s notorious Rampart Precinct who must face the consequences of his renegade ways as the details of a large scale corruption scandal hit the news. While critics agreed that Harrelson’s character, Dave Brown, is far from sympathetic, Harrelson’s performance keeps viewers locked in, making this worth a watch for him alone.Norwegian Wood 74%The literature of Japanese novelis Haruki Murakami is often dreamlike and surreal, focusing on themes of loneliness and isolation, so it’s fitting that the film adaptation of one of his most popular works, Norwegian Wood, is appropriately moody. Helmed by acclaimed French-Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung (The Scent of Green Papaya), Norwegian Wood tells the story of Toru Watanabe, a young student in 1960s Tokyo who falls in love with his classmate Kizuki’s girlfriend, Naoko, after Kizuki suddenly commits suicide. Suffering from the death, Naoko checks herself into a sanatorium, and that’s when Toru meets Midori, the polar opposite of Naoko, and begins to form a bond with her as well. Certified Fresh at 73%, Norwegian Wood lingered just a bit too long at times for some critics, but most found the melancholy mood infectious, making for a visually stunning and ultimately powerful meditation on youthful love and loss.Being John Malkovich – Criterion Collection 94%Director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman announced their arrival on the feature film scene with a giant bang, establishing their knack for clever, inventive, and visually creative storytelling. Being John Malkovich stars John Cusack as Craig Schwartz, a down-and-out puppeteer who accidentally discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich; as his co-worker (Catherine Keener) and wife (Cameron Diaz) become involved, complicated sexual politics ensue, leading to a bizarre and quietly chilling finale. This week, Criterion releases their edition of Being John Malkovich, complete with brand new extras like commentary featuring Jonze and Michel Gondry, interviews with Malkovich and Jonze, a behind-the-scenes doc, and the full versions of the two films that appear within the film. Great pickup for fans of the film and all those involved in its making.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney, marvel, Pop, Company, animated","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-grey-chronicle-and-albert-nobbs"},{"id":"47612982219123","title":"5 Survival Movies You Need to See Before The 33","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})5 Survival Movies You Need to See Before The 33by Tomatazos Staff | November 12, 2015 |  CommentsOn August 5 2010, a mine collapsed in the town of San José, Chile, prompting a&nbsp;seemingly impossible rescue mission that unfolded over the course of three months. This week’s&nbsp;The 33 dramatizes&nbsp;the event as a testimony to the human struggle against the elements, and in that spirit, our Spanish-language partners over at Tomatazos have offered up a brief list&nbsp;of similar stories to get you into the “rescue mood” before you purchase a ticket.Apollo 13 (1995)  96%Even though it drifts away stylistically from the following entries, this space epic heads our list because it also shares some of their fundamental characteristics. Even when everything seems perfectly planned out, including daily chores, one small failure (a technical one in the Apollo’s case) is all it takes to make things go sour in a hurry, prompting all those involved to face risky situations in order to regain control. Kind of makes you believe “13 is an unlucky number,” dosen’t it?Watch Trailer127 Hours (2010)  93%This tale feels like something lifted straight&nbsp;out of a Eugène Ionesco play (the whole “eating yourself to survive” business), and it’s doubly shocking because it was, of course, based on a real story. It’s claustrophobic, anguishing, and crude; no wonder it got James Franco an Academy Award nomination.Watch TrailerInto the Wild (2007)  83%Almost every character in this list is a victim of circumstance; that is to say, they obviously did not choose to be burned&nbsp;in space or trapped between a literal rock and a hard place. But not Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch,) the daunting protagonist of this film, who chose to leave his whole life behind and be “one” with nature.

Throughout&nbsp;23 films (and counting), there are crossover characters, intersecting storylines, and resonant names, locations, and even brands. Of course, when you step back, you realize that the MCU was only doing what comic books have been doing in print for decades. Take another step back, and you’ll notice that what they’ve done isn’t all that unique to movies, either. Because Quentin Tarantino, for one, has been doing it for decades, too.From his earliest days as a struggling screenwriter to his iconic and era-defining films, Tarantino has built his own world of interconnected characters and original brands. In honor of the 25th anniversary of his legendary opus Pulp Fiction&nbsp;(released October 14, 1994), let’s take a look at the QTCU — the Quentin Tarantino Cinematic Universe.My Best Friend's Birthday (1987) A short film co-written, directed, and starring Tarantino while he was famously working at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California (it’s no longer there, so don’t plan a visit), My Best Friend’s Birthday only exists in a truncated 36-minute cut because large parts of it were destroyed in a fire. Still, the seeds of the QTCU are there. For one, Quentin plays a character named Clarence who, early on, discusses his love of Rockabilly music and Elvis’ acting ability. This would, of course, foreshadow Christian Slater’s character in True Romance, a script written by Tarantino but directed by the late Tony Scott. In Birthday, Tarantino’s Clarence hires a call girl to show his friend a good time on his special day — a sequence of events that would be flipped in True Romance,&nbsp;when Slater’s Clarence finds himself on the receiving end of a birthday call girl surprise.Reservoir Dogs (1992)  92%Tarantino’s signature work, the movie that launched him as a filmmaker. In this tale of a jewel heist gone wrong, the audience is treated to flashbacks that fill in the stories of each of the movie’s black clad, code-named criminals. We find out that Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) used to run with a partner named Alabama. Of course, a woman named Alabama Whitman (later, Worley) is seen getting a taste for a life of crime in True Romance, the Tony Scott film that Tarantino wrote (see below). We also learn that Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) is named Vic Vega, as in the brother of John Travolta’s Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction.True Romance (1993)  92%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Apart from the obvious connections&nbsp;to earlier films — the Rockabilly-loving Clarence and call girl-turned-crook Alabama — there is a more subtle cinematic link in Tony Scott’s Tarantino-penned action adventure. The movie climaxes with a drug deal in the hotel suite of big time movie producer Lee Donowitz (Saul Rubinek, channeling real life producer Joel Silver). Donowitz is a producer of war movies — fitting because his father, Donny Donowitz, fought in WWII as part of the Inglourious Basterds. You might remember him as the baseball bat-wielding avenger known as “The Bear Jew” (played by Eli Roth).Pulp Fiction (1994)  92%(Photo by Miramax Films)Pulp Fiction, which celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, is arguably the Iron Man of the QTCU, because it’s really the one that takes the threads and begins to weave them together.&nbsp;The film&nbsp;introduces us to several brand names that would become central players in Tarantino’s world, starting with “that Hawaiian burger joint” Big Kahuna Burger — Samuel L. Jackson’s Jules takes the world’s most intimidating bite of one of these burgers and washes it down with “a tasty beverage” from the place early in the movie. Later, Bruce Willis’ Butch Coolidge orders a pack of Red Apple cigarettes, a brand that shows up in just about every subsequent QT movie. Finally, Christopher Walken’s Captain Koons — he of the legendary “gold watch” speech — is also a descendant of “Crazy” Craig Koons, one of Django’s bounties in Django Unchained.Natural Born Killers (1994)  48%(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Although Natural Born Killers was&nbsp;directed by Oliver Stone, the script was pure Tarantino. We mentioned earlier the brother connection between Vic and Vincent Vega, but there is another set of brothers that was first introduced in Reservoir Dogs, too. In Dogs, Vic complains about a pain-in-the-ass parole officer named Seymour Scagnetti (we never actually see him), whose own brother, Jack, would show up in Natural Born Killers (played by Tom Sizemore).Four Rooms (1996)  14%In the Tarantino-written and -directed segment of this anthology film, the characters are seen smoking Red Apple cigarettes. Tarantino’s character also refers to his drink as a “tasty beverage,” which echoes the same colorful turn of phrase Jules used in Pulp Fiction.From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)  62%Tarantino wrote the script for this Robert Rodriguez-directed horror film and peppered in some of his signature touches. There are Red Apple cigarettes present and accounted for, and George Clooney’s Seth Gecko at one point makes a run for Big Kahuna Burgers. The movie also introduces gravelly-voiced, no-nonsense Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (played by Michael Parks), who would become a key player in the QTCU. It’s also worth noting that the movie features yet another pair of brothers (Seth and his brother, Richie, played by Tarantino) who have a thing for black suits.Jackie Brown (1997)  87%(Photo by Miramax Films)Beware of people who claim that, because it was based on an Elmore Leonard novel and not an original Tarantino idea, there are no overt connections to the QTCU in Jackie Brown. They’re just not paying attention. Midway through the film, we see Jackie in the Del Amo Mall&nbsp;food court, enjoying a meal from Teriyaki Donut — the same fictional fast food franchise whose food Ving Rhames’ Marcellus Wallace is carrying when Butch Coolidge runs him down in Pulp Fiction. In a second food court scene not long after, we not only see Jackie indulging in Teriyaki Donut again, but her accomplice Sheronda (LisaGay Hamilton) sits down at her&nbsp;table with a tray full of food from Acuña Boys, which would later be referenced in Kill Bill Vol. 2 and appear a couple of times in Grindhouse.Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)  85% and&nbsp;Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)  84%(Photo by Miramax Films)We’ll treat this kung fu-inspired magnum opus as one film, with plenty of easter eggs to link it to the larger QTCU. For one, if you look at The Bride’s (Uma Thurman) old gang, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, you’ll notice that they all fit a little too easily into Mia Wallace’s description of her failed TV pilot, Fox Force Five – the blonde leader, the Japanese kung fu master, the black demolition expert, the French seductress, and Mia’s. character, the deadliest woman in the world with a knife (or sword?). The first cop on the scene after the Bride’s wedding day massacre is, of course, Earl McGraw, and Red Apple and Big Kahuna also make appearances. And remember&nbsp;Acuña Boys from&nbsp;Jackie Brown?&nbsp;In Vol. 2, they happen to be the name of the gang that Michael Parks’ Esteban Vihaio runs.Grindhouse (2007)  84%(Photo by The Weinstein Co./Dimension)In both the Tarantino portion of this double feature homage, Death Proof, and the Rodriguez portion, Planet Terror, there are connections to the QTCU. Big Kahuna burgers are mentioned, and Red Apple cigarettes are smoked. On top of that, an ad for&nbsp;Acuña Boys “Authentic Tex-Mex Food” — first glimpsed in&nbsp;Jackie Brown&nbsp;—&nbsp;pops up during intermission, and one of Stuntman Mike’s early victims, Vanessa Ferlito’s Arlene, can be seen sipping from an&nbsp;Acuña Boys cup. Texas lawman Earl McGraw also reappears, along with his son, Ed, and we learn there is a sister named Dakota, too, who features in Planet Terror.&nbsp;As kind of a bonus, Rosario Dawson’s Abernathy has a familiar ringtone on her phone&nbsp; — it’s the same melody whistled by Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) in Kill Bill Vol. 1.Inglourious Basterds (2009)  89%(Photo by Francois Duhamel/©Weinstein Company)In addition to Donny Donowitz, Michael Fassbender’s English soldier-turned-spy Archie Hicox has deep ties to the QTCU, it turns out. Late in the old west-set Hateful Eight, it is revealed that Tim Roth’s Oswaldo Mobray is actually a wanted man named “English Pete” Hicox, Archie’s great-great-grandfather.Django Unchained (2012)  87%(Photo by The Weinstein Co.)We’ve already mentioned “Crazy” Craig Koons, but there is another deep cut reference to Django hidden in an earlier Tarantino movie. In Kill Bill Vol. 2, Bill’s brother Budd (played by Michael Madsen – also another pair of QT brothers!) buries the Bride alive in the grave of Paula Schultz. This is the lonely final resting place for the wife of bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in Django.The Hateful Eight (2015)  74%(Photo by The Weinstein Company)In addition to the Hicox family tree, Red Apple tobacco — the early version of the soon-to-be ubiquitous (in the QTCU, anyway) cigarette brand — makes a couple of appearances here. Demián Bichir’s Bob smokes a “Manzana Roja” right after the intermission, and Channing Tatum gets a custom-rolled&nbsp;Red Apple cigarette — his “favorite” — from&nbsp;Dana Gourrier’s Miss Minnie.Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85%(Photo by Columbia Pictures)At one point in Kill Bill Vol. 2, The Bride drives a blue Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. That same car shows up (driven by Brad Pitt’s Cliff Booth) in Hollywood. And not only do Booth and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton smoke Red Apples (of course), but there’s an end-credits scene in the movie that shows Dalton doing a TV commercial for the cigarette brand.Pulp Fiction was released in theaters on October 14, 1994.#1Pulp Fiction (1994) 92%#1Adjusted Score: 99.222% Critics Consensus: One of the most influential films of the 1990s, Pulp Fiction is a delirious post-modern mix of neo-noir thrills, pitch-black humor, and pop-culture touchstones.Synopsis: Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the...

Pictures, ©2020 Disney/Pixar)For some, December 25th movie releases have traditionally offered an escape from uncomfortable family time while providing theater employees a chance to make that sweet holiday pay. Most of us won’t be heading to cineplexes on Christmas Day this year, though, due to&nbsp;the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread business closures associated with it. Like a lot of things in 2020, it’s an unprecedented situation, and movie lovers looking for something to pass the time will instead likely turn to HBO Max’s&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984 or&nbsp;Disney+’s&nbsp;Soul to fill that gap. All of this got us thinking about the&nbsp;movies of Christmas&nbsp;Past, and we&nbsp;thought it might be both fun and enlightening to look back at every film ever released on December 25th and try to figure out if one rises above all the rest.One might understandably&nbsp;assume the list would be littered with holiday classics,&nbsp;but since they’re typically released earlier than, you know, Christmas Day, we ended up with a hodgepodge of just about anything you could imagine. Considering they include&nbsp;titles&nbsp;as diverse as&nbsp;Magnum Force, Tombstone, An American Werewolf in Paris, and that most celebrated of yuletide standards,&nbsp;47 Ronin,&nbsp;it’s clear&nbsp;that there isn’t any rhyme or reason&nbsp;to Christmas Day releases beyond “Let’s cross our fingers and hope this makes a lot of money.”(Photo by Frank Connor/©Universal Pictures)Before we jump in, though, we need to clarify a few things about the process. First, our data set includes films that received wide releases on December 25th and have Tomatometers, Audience Scores, and reliable box office numbers. Regarding the latter, we had to stick to domestic box office earnings due to reliability issues with global market totals. Unfortunately, this meant older films&nbsp;like&nbsp;There Was a Crooked Man and Friday Foster&nbsp;failed to make the cut due to incomplete or insufficient data. Once we collected the relevant information, we ranked all the movies by Tomatometer, Audience Score, and Domestic Box Office (adjusted for inflation), added up their ranking numbers, and arranged the results in descending order so that the film with the lowest rank total would take the top spot. We know; it’s a lot to digest.With the logistics out of the way, let’s get to why you’re here. After compiling all the statistics and ranking all 124 movies we looked at, we were able to narrow the list down to a Top 10. Will the top spot go to a bloody revisionist Western, an all-timer heist flick, or a stylish take on a legendary sleuth? Check out the full list below, along with each film’s rank in our three data categories and a little bit of context, to find out which one is the Best Movie Released on December 25th!10.&nbsp;Tombstone&nbsp;(1993) – 50 Points(Photo by ©Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank): 74% (21st)Audience Score (Rank): 94% (4th)Domestic Box Office (Rank): $125 million (25th)While we have no evidence of this, it’s safe to assume that many adults would’ve been O.K. to receive tickets from Santa to go watch Tombstone when it was released on December 25, 1993. The thought of watching legendary lawman Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell) go to war against an outlaw gang of red-sashed murderers, led by Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn, is simply too epic to pass up. Not only was Tombstone a hit in 1993, but it’s grown in stature&nbsp;since then as its memorable mustachioed characters, epic gun fights, and iconic lines (“I’m your Huckleberry”) have become more and more popular. It also doesn’t hurt that the cast also includes&nbsp;– deep breath&nbsp;–&nbsp;Val Kilmer, Bill Paxton, Sam Elliott, Billy Zane, Michael Rooker, Charlton Heston, Stephen Lang, Thomas Haden Church, Billy Bob Thornton, and Dana Delaney, and they’re all excellent. Tombstone is a rollicking good time, and despite some behind-the-scenes friction and director swaps, it’s&nbsp;still a fan favorite that boasts an outstanding 94% Audience Score.It’s tough to single out the best moment, as the movie features a plethora of memorable scenes. Whether it’s Wyatt Earp’s&nbsp;takedown of a bully (Billy Bob Thornton in a fun cameo) or Doc Holliday’s “I’m your Huckleberry” right before he puts one in Johnny Ringo’s forehead,&nbsp;Tombstone has a deep bench of epic moments and characters, which is why it’s on our list.9.&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;(2009) – 49 Points (Tie)(Photo by Alex Bailey/©Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;69% (25th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;77% (20th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$250 million (4th)Riding high off the success of 2008’s Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. stepped into the well-worn shoes of another famous brilliant person, Sherlock Holmes. The end result was an intriguing modern-day update of the character created by Arthur Conan Doyle in 1887. Rather than simply using his brain, Holmes uses his brawn as well, engaging in underground fist fights that showcase his six-pack abs and uncanny ability to anticipate his foe’s moves, which allows him to exert maximum pain on his bare-knuckle boxing opponent (is that cheating?).The Guy Ritchie-directed film about Sherlock’s hunt for an aristocratic serial killer would go on to collect $524 million worldwide and spawn a sequel two years later, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, which also cleared the $500 million mark at the global box office.Fans and critics alike were fairly impressed with the performances by A-listers Downey, Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Strong, as well as the stylized directing of Ritchie, which breathed new life into an old character. We’re even scheduled to get a third entry in the franchise in December of 2021.9.&nbsp;Magnum Force&nbsp;(1973) – 49 Points (Tie)(Photo by Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;72% (23rd)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;77% (20th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$211 million (6th)As the second entry in the five-film&nbsp;Dirty Harry&nbsp;franchise, Magnum Force&nbsp;had the luxury of trading on the blockbuster success of its predecessor, but it also carried the expectations of the popular film that featured San Francisco Police Department Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) asking people if they felt lucky. Focusing on Harry’s&nbsp;hunt for corrupt cops who take the law into their own hands, Magnum Force features explosions, murder, blood, profanity, and more explosions – you know, typical holiday movie stuff&nbsp;– which thrilled 1973 audiences who were looking for all of those things. Director Ted Post, who also worked with Eastwood on the well-received 1968 Western&nbsp;Hang ‘em High, knew what he was doing (making an action sequel), and there is no better evidence of that than in the opening credits: the cast and crew list&nbsp;is played over Harry’s .44 Magnum gun, which he then points towards the screen and shoots (think American James Bond) in a bonkers breaking of the fourth wall that tells the audience immediately what they’re in for.7.&nbsp;Broadcast News&nbsp;(1987) – 48 Points(Photo by ©20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;98% (2nd)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;79% (18th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$116 million (28th)Written and directed by James L. Brooks, the workplace comedy Broadcast News was nominated for seven Academy Awards and is considered to be one of the greatest movies ever about journalism.&nbsp;Holly Hunter, William Hurt, and Albert Brooks all received&nbsp;Oscar nominations for their lively performances, and it would be tough to find a more likable and well-written comedy about three people who love/hate making television together. Hunter famously joined the project shortly before production started, and she’s so good you’d think Brooks wrote the role just for her. Also, if you’ve never watched Broadcast News, go ahead and check out&nbsp;Aaron’s (Albert Brooks) sweating scene; it’s an uncomfortable moment that features an excellent reporter absolutely bombing on camera, and Brooks plays it to perfection.&nbsp;Glancing at the reviews, you’ll see the phrases “uproariously funny,” “warm and heartfelt,” and “enormously entertaining” pop up time after time, and for good reason. Broadcast News gave audiences a lot to cheer for on December 25, 1987.6.&nbsp;The Aviator&nbsp;(2004) – 47 Points(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;86% (11th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;79% (18th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$147 million (18th)Directed by Martin Scorsese, and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett (who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar), and Kate Beckinsale, among others,&nbsp;The Aviator focuses on the early life of director/aviator/entrepreneur Howard Hughes and his legendary antics. Much like Hughes, The Aviator is larger than life as Scorsese loads it with glamour, plane crashes, and excellent visual effects that blend seamlessly into the period setting. The Aviator was the second (of the now five) collaborations between DiCaprio and Scorsese, and it netted DiCaprio his first Best Actor Academy Award nomination (he was previously nominated for Best Supporting Actor for What’s Eating Gilbert Grape); it also happens to be the first of three&nbsp;– yes, three&nbsp;– appearances on this list by Leonardo DiCaprio. The $110 million-budgeted drama won five Oscars (of a total 11 nominations) and still holds up beautifully, as the work of editor Thelma Schoomaker and cinematographer Robert Richardson give the 170-minute biopic an epic feel.5.&nbsp;Little Women&nbsp;(2019) – 42 Points(Photo by Sony Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;95% (5th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (6th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$108 million (31st)Powered by&nbsp;Greta Gerwig’s Academy Award-nominated script and direction, the $40 million-budgeted Little Women pulled in $216 million worldwide and was met with near universal praise.&nbsp;The feat is all the more impressive (and not altogether unexpected, since Gerwig loves the novel) considering Louisa May Alcott’s iconic story about sisters growing up in Massachusetts during the civil war has been adapted for the screen multiple times, dating all the way back to 1917. What makes this adaptation stand out among the rest is the way Gerwig includes a nonlinear storyline and a different ending to offer audiences something fresh and unexpected. Also, bringing back her Lady Bird star Saoirise Ronan&nbsp;to play the pivotal role of Jo March&nbsp;was a smart idea, as the two work wonderfully together, and Ronan received Academy Award nominations for both films. Plus, Gerwig didn’t stop with Ronan;&nbsp;she and producer Amy Pascal also landed the immense talents of Meryl Streep, Florence Pugh (who received a Best Supporting Actress nomination), Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and a host of other incredible actors, lending the film the kind of A-list shimmer you’d expect to see in a prestige picture.4.&nbsp;To Kill A Mockingbird&nbsp;(1962) – 30 Points(Photo by Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (7th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;92% (6th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$148 million (17th)Since its release in 1960, Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird&nbsp;has been an American institution that has&nbsp;sold over 40 million copies and been discussed and re-evaluated in classrooms across the country. Two years after its publication, director Robert Mulligan&nbsp;brought&nbsp;To Kill a Mockingbird&nbsp;to the big screen, and it was a smash hit that won three Academy Awards and eventually earned the 25th spot on the American Film Institute’s Top 100 Films list.&nbsp;Anchored by Gregory Peck’s Oscar-winning performance and Horton Foote’s faithful screenplay,&nbsp;Mockingbird tells the story of Atticus Finch (Peck), a lawyer in the depression-era South defending a Black man named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) who has been put on trial for an undeserved rape conviction.Putting aside the important cultural discussion that continues to this day, To Kill a Mockingbird is an example of a book adaptation done right. Mulligan and Foote knew they had excellent source material to work from, so they stuck to&nbsp;it (mostly), and with the help of Harper Lee presented a faithful adaptation that struck a chord with audiences who saw the movie as a gift when it opened on Christmas Day of 1962.3.&nbsp;Django Unchained&nbsp;(2012) – 28 Points(Photo by Andrew Cooper/©Weinstein Company)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;87% (10th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;91% (7th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$191 million (9th)Between Four Rooms, Jackie Brown, and The Hateful Eight, Quentin Tarantino sure loves releasing movies on December 25, but his biggest Christmas Day hit came from Django Unchained, a super R-rated revisionist Western featuring a final gunfight that leaves a Mississippi plantation estate flooded with blood. The movie pulled in a whopping $15 million its opening day (Catch Me If You Can only pulled in $9 million) and ended up earning $191 million domestic, winning Academy Awards for Tarantino (Best Original Screenplay) and Christoph Waltz (who won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar after earning his first for another Tarantino collaboration, Inglourious Basterds).Django Unchained tells the story of a freed slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with an eccentric German bounty hunter named Dr. King Shultz (Waltz) in exchange for Shultz’s help freeing Django’s wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the vile clutches of plantation owner Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio, making his second appearance on this list). Normally, hard R-rated exploitation films with 165-minute running times wouldn’t be nominated for five Academy Awards (and win two). Yet under Tarantino’s supervision, Django&nbsp;delighted audiences around the world and provided Christmas counterprogramming&nbsp;with silver-tongued devils, flesh-ripping torture, and Leo DiCaprio monologuing about skulls.2.&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can&nbsp;(2002) – 15 Points(Photo by ©DreamWorks courtesy Everett Collection)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;96% (4th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;89% (9th)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$257 million (2nd)It wasn’t a hard sell to get audiences into theaters to watch Catch Me If You Can&nbsp;in 2002. Directed by Steven Spielberg&nbsp;and starring Tom Hanks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;(and that makes three!),&nbsp;Catch Me If You Can is a rollicking film about Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio), a likable con man being chased around the world by Carl Hanratty (Hanks), a likable FBI agent who really wants to, well, catch him. During the globe-trotting caper, we also get to spend time with the very likable Frank Abigaile Sr., played by Christopher Walken, whose performance was so warm and welcoming he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.We’re not trying to be reductive about how “likable” the movie is, either.&nbsp;The expertise of Spielberg, the skill of his cast, and the Oscar-nominated score by John Williams make this 141-minute film&nbsp;fly by faster than a Pan Am airliner. Its appeal to people of all ages can’t be argued because it’s the rare film to receive nominations from the AARP, MTV, and Teen Choice Awards, which essentially makes it the Tom Hanks of movies.1.&nbsp;The Sting&nbsp;(1973) – 10 Points(Photo by Universal Pictures)Tomatometer Score (Rank):&nbsp;94% (6th)Audience Score (Rank):&nbsp;95% (3rd)Domestic Box Office (Rank):&nbsp;$835 million (1st)Looking to build off the blockbuster success of 1969’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,&nbsp;which grossed $661 million domestically and won four Academy Awards, director George Roy Hill and stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman reteamed for The Sting. With an “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mantra in place, The Sting once again showcased Redford and Newman’s unbeatable chemistry, playing lovable criminals who plan on swindling money from a&nbsp;shifty character played by Robert Shaw&nbsp;in 1930s Chicago (and hopefully avoid a freeze-framed death via a barrage of bullets). The Sting might be one of the most enjoyable films to ever to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards (it won a total of 7 Oscars&nbsp;from its 11 nominations). It also boasts an $835 million domestic box office haul, which would make almost any Marvel film jealous,&nbsp;and it’s currently the 21st highest domestic grossing film of all time. If you haven’t watched The Sting, do yourself a favor and check it out, because the A-list star power, the beautiful Oscar-winning costumes, and the charisma of Redford and Newman together are undeniable.On an Apple device?

The Dark Knight Rises. Skyfall. There were plenty of highly-anticipated, critically acclaimed films that wowed moviegoers this year. But you know all about that stuff already, so we at RT decided to give some love to a few of the overlooked, underappreciated, and, in some cases, critically dismissed movies that made an impression on us. Read on for a rundown of lesser-known gems from 2012 that we think deserve another look. 85%End of WatchMatt Atchity – Editor in ChiefThis was one of my favorite movies of the year (along with The Grey), but it really struggled to find an audience. So I was glad to see if get a recent re-release nationwide, and I really recommend seeing it if you have the chance. This story about two cops in South Central LA is sometimes funny, sometimes terrifying, and sometimes heartbreaking, and this movie caught me completely off-guard. I’m not sure what I’d been expecting, maybe another forgettable cop drama. What I got instead was a riveting ride-along with two cops (played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) that I really believed had been partners for years. They had an easy familiarity that looked like a couple of guys that had gone beyond being partners or friends, and into real brotherhood. You laugh with them when they laugh at each other, and you worry about them when they’re on their own. Anna Kendrick, America Ferrera and David Harbour all put in strong supporting turns, Kendrick as Gyllenhaal’s new girlfriend, and Ferrera and Harbour as fellow cops. As I said before, I strongly recommend this movie, and I’d really like to see some of this cast (especially Pena) get some notice as the awards season heats up. 89%The Turin HorseTim Ryan – Senior EditorNobody makes films like Hungarian director Bela Tarr. His spare, eerie meditations on morality and mortality occupy a bleak, mystical plane that seems to exist outside of time (or any notions of contemporary cinematic influence). The plot of The Turin Horse is simple — a man and his daughter tend to their farm while waiting for an apocalyptic storm to hit — and it’s told with an absolute minimum of artifice: the camera barely moves as our protagonists eat, work, and go about their daily business in near silence. I’m not even going to try to sell you on The Turin Horse; it’s the type of movie experience that will strike some as poetic and evocative, and others as a nifty cure for insomnia. But it casts a hypnotic spell, one that I’ve been unable to shake since seeing it. If you choose to watch it, I’ll give you one piece of advice: wear a sweater, because you can practically feel a wintery chill from the screen. 86%The Pirates! Band of MisfitsGrae Drake – Senior EditorSince I am terrible at remembering actual historical events, I love movies with revisionist history–especially when they involve pirates and claymation. Aardman Studios enlisted the help of Hugh Grant, Imelda Staunton, David Tennant, Jeremy Piven, Salma Hayek, and Martin Freeman to tell the tale of the Pirate Captain, who really isn’t a great leader, and his quest to impress a girl (Queen Victoria). Along the way, he meets Charles Darwin, enters a science contest, tries to win Pirate of the Year, and learns what friendship is really all about. This film is nothing less than what I have come to expect from the Wallace and Gromit folks– it’s hysterical from start to finish, has staggering amounts of charm, and provides phenomenal detail even within the foam on beer. Every time I watch it, I want to give this movie a hug. 95%The Queen of VersaillesRyan Fujitani – EditorThis critically acclaimed but largely underseen documentary surprised me not so much because it was good, but because I enjoyed it for very different reasons than I expected. Lauren Greenfield’s The Queen of Versailles begins with a portrait of a wealthy family living in excess: time-share mogul David Siegel and his wife Jackie are in the process of building their dream house, a 90,000 sq. ft. mansion modeled after the Palace of Versailles. But then, the 2008 economic crisis hits them hard, and Siegel is forced to make vast cutbacks, both in his corporate empire and within the Siegel home itself; construction on the mansion is halted. At this point, one might expect to be overcome by a sudden rush of gleeful schadenfreude – and certainly, I felt some of this as I watched the beleaguered patriarch agonize over his expenses – but the film begins to reveal the layers behind the glitz and glamour, and this shift is what took me by surprise. Jackie’s been warped by her wealth, sure, but she’s well-meaning, she’s loving, she’s supportive, and she wants so badly for her family to feel like a family; I have to admit, I was kind of touched. The Queen of Versailles is an absolutely fascinating glimpse at the lives of the super rich, but its power is in its portrayal of the Siegels who, at the end of the day, are just another family trying to adapt to changes they’re wholly unprepared for. Never before have I experienced such a mix between my sympathy for and smug satisfaction with the misfortune of others. 47%The ComedyLuke Goodsell – International EditorWhat can I say, I love movies about messed-up, unpleasant people — and the more messed-up and unpleasant the better, as far as I’m concerned. Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim have been testing the dynamics of audience discomfort for years with their brilliant Awesome Show, and that laugh-or-cringe sensibility manifests in a complex, dramatic way in Heidecker’s character here. Giving easily one of my favorite performances of the year, Heidecker plays a kind of repulsive trust-fund monster whose money allows him to do literally nothing with his life — nothing, that is, apart from drift from situation to situation antagonizing people; as though some kind of slovenly Andy Kaufman had been resurrected for a Noah Baumbach movie. He’s hideous but he’s also hilarious, and The Comedy moves more like a drama — you’re just never sure whether you should be in howls of pain or hysterics. The most impressive thing about both Alverson’s direction and Heidecker’s genius underplaying is not just the truth they locate in this husk of a man-boy, it’s that they nearly make you care about his sad predicament by the movie’s end. It’s the kind of character and film that splits critics down the middle, as well it should — with 40% on the Tomatometer, there’s love and loathing aplenty. The Comedy had a miniature theatrical run, but it’s widely available on VOD. Watch it, and either thank me or despise me afterwards. 77%Jeff, Who Lives at HomeAlex Vo – EditorOf the 6,000 films Jay and Mark Duplass were involved with this year, Jeff, Who Lives at Home stands out. Not that I have any personal identification with a slacker who lives in his mom’s basement and believes he’s getting signs from the universe to do something meaningful, Jeff who (probably) eats too much cereal and (probably) is still hung-up on his ex. No identification at all. Instead, I connected with the movie’s charm and simplicity, from the title all the way down to its surprisingly generous spirit. Jeff (Jason Segel, essentially updating his Freaks and Geeks character for the information age) is presented as a lovable oaf, who could be a real underdog if it weren’t so inconvenient to getting high. And there is exciting depth to his friends and family, which includes people played by Susan Sarandon, Judy Greer, and Ed Helms, all of whom get a few great scenes. Jeff’s adventure is madcap and full of digressions, easing its way into an affecting finale against the backdrop of a setting sun. Mumblecore, aka hipster Dogme, may be fleeting but in considering Jeff’s little heartfelt accomplishment, we can see the signs of life.El DedoKerr Lordygan – Review AggregatorTossing around in my head films such as Smashed (possible Oscar buzz on this anyway) and Bait (2012, funny, silly, exciting with quite creative gore), I ended up opting for El Dedo (“The Finger”). A selection of the Global Film Initiative, the film handles a slightly grotesque premise with lightheartedness and charm. The results are sometimes comical and always endearing. The plot is just ridiculous enough to be true. Based on real events, a few of the real-life subjects co-star, breaking the fourth wall to bring us closer. A beloved townsmen running for mayor in a town’s first election is murdered and his finger is saved for sentimental purposes. The town looks to the severed index finger for guidance, but will it still win the mayoral election? The characters are so likeable, the plot is almost surreal, this one is a winner, even for those who might not ordinarily watch foreign films. 53%People Like UsCatherine Pricci – Review AggregatorThis Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks drama may not necessarily be off the radar, but overall it was poorly received. And that’s unfortunate since this underappreciated film had fantastic performances by its two leads. A lot of critics felt this film lacked depth and was melodramatic, but most agreed that Pine and Banks put in standout performances. And audiences should keep an eye on newcomer Michael Hall D’Addario, who played Banks’s son; he stole most of the scenes he was in and is definitely someone to look out for in the future. If you like films with great performances, and don’t mind a tear or two, this one is worth another look. 26%This Means WarBeki Lane – Production AssistantI’m here to recommend a flick that got crushed on the Tomatometer, but is still tasty if you can handle a little pulp. This Means War is formulaic, but I believe that plot formulas exist because, just often enough, they work. This one really surprised me. If you don’t make the mistake of going in expecting something more than what it is, this film offers a lot of laughs and a really good time. Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are really funny, and keep it stylish to boot. This film doesn’t fall into the chick flick category, nor does it cater exclusively to the bros. Rather it has great balance, and can be appreciated by all. In the civil unrest that can arise during the debate of what DVD to select for a stay-in date night, This Means War can bring both sides to a suitable accord. 79%DreddJulio de Oliveira – Project ManagerDredd is not one of those movies that you never heard about, but it’s probably one you didn’t care to watch when it hit the theaters earlier this year. Let’s face it, its box office was far from great, but – as a comic book fan – I decided to give it a shot, and I’m really glad I got to watch it in all its 3D glory. The guys behind Dredd did a pretty good job giving life to Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic metropolis dominated by crime, where cops enforce the law onto its citizens as judges, jury and executioners. The city looks so overpopulated, chaotic and hopeless that it convinces the audience that the unorthodox methods applied by the judges are the only way to go. Instead of spending a long time introducing this dystopic reality, director Pete Travis let you learn as you go. He basically shows a day in the life of the always-frowning Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) and rookie psychic partner Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who get trapped in a gigantic residential complex called Peach Tree – more like a vertical concrete slum, dominated by drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). The movie is packed with action, God-they-are-not-gonna-make-it moments, and loads of gory violence. I also really like its beautiful, dark cinematography and the visual impact of the well-applied slow-motion technology and bullet-time effects. It’s a visual masterpiece. Dredd is still not available on home entertainment, but it will hit 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on January 8, 2013.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Premium, franchise, asian-american, miniseries, on, Apple, Awards, Mystery, Spectrum, awards, love, Lucasfilm","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2012"},{"id":"47613051069833","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Super 8 and Conan the Barbarian","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Super 8 and Conan the BarbarianPlus, the latest Spy Kids, a solid Holocaust film, and a couple of notable classics.by | November 21, 2011 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got an interesting mix of choices, and at least a couple of them may be a bit controversial. As for items we won’t be discussing at length: there are new Blu-rays for films like The Three Amigos, Rushmore (the existing Criterion edition), and ESPN’s 30 for 30 series (which we covered when it first arrived on DVD). The big titles this week are J.J. Abrams’ sci-fi treat, an update on a classic fantasy hero, and the latest of Robert Rodriguez’s Spy Kids films. Then we’ve got a French drama centered on the Holocaust experience, a unique look at the Hussein family, a controversial silent film, and a bona fide courtroom classic. See below for the full list!Super 8 81%J.J. Abrams has been known to keep his projects super secret, whether it was a major plot point in his hit television show LOST or the unveiling of the monster in Cloverfield, which he produced. It was no different with his latest directorial effort, Super 8; the first trailer released thrillingly depicted a collision between a pickup truck and a freight train carrying something ominously powerful, but not much else. As it turned out, the film follows a group of kids making a home movie with a super 8 camera who happen to be present when the aforementioned collision takes place, and their camera inadvertently captures something they never expected to film. When strange things begin occurring in town, the children take it upon themselves to solve the mystery. Many agree that Super 8 is an earnest throwback to the kid-friendly sci-fi adventures of the 1980s, and with Steven Spielberg producing, it’s no wonder. With plenty of thrills, visual dazzle, and emotional depth, Super 8 is Certified Fresh at 82% and a pretty good choice if you’re looking for some good, old-fashioned, nostalgic fun.Conan the Barbarian 25%It’s been almost three decades since the last big screen portrayal of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the Barbarian, and most will remember that he was famously played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. How, then, would a remake fare, with a new story and a new Conan? Not very well, actually. This time around, Jason Momoa (of recent Game of Thrones fame) plays the titular warrior, who is born in the heat of battle and trained as a warrior until his entire family is slaughtered by an evil warlord named Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) in search of pieces to a mystical mask. Conan escapes the onslaught and lives on as a pirate until a chance meeting provides him with a new lead to seek vengeance for his clan’s extermination. Co-starring Rose Mcgowan, Rachel Nichols, and Ron Perlman in small role as Conan’s father, Conan the Barbarian failed to impress critics, who felt the film lacked any good characterization, worthy dialogue, or competent acting. It’s gory and over the top, so if you’re looking for a mindless action flick with those credentials, have at it; if you’re looking for anything more, search elsewhere.Spy Kids: All the Time in the World 4D 22%As with plenty of franchises before it, the Spy Kids movies may be running low on creative juice, but that doesn’t mean they know when to pack it in. Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, the latest entry in Robert Rodriguez’s venerable kiddie adventure series, wasn’t exactly greeted fondly by critics, who haven’t enjoyed a Spy Kids movie en masse since Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. Jessica Alba stars as a retired spy who’s lured back into action when a maniacal supervillain threatens the free world. She’s joined in her mission by some newly recruited spy kids. The pundits said the movie will probably appeal to the little ones, and there are moments of visual inventiveness, but for the most part adults may be less than charmed this time out. For all you Spy-hards out there, the new Blu-ray has plenty of cool extras, including an interview with Rodriguez by an intrepid kid reporter, behind-the-scenes footage, and deleted scenes.Sarah’s Key 72%The first thing one might be inclined to say about Sarah’s Key after hearing its premise is, “Oh, another Holocaust movie?” While this is true, most critics will tell you that this one is certainly worth watching. Somewhat of a two-part film, the first half of Sarah’s Key focuses on the titular Sarah (Melusine Mayance), a young Jewish girl living in France who falls victim to the Vel’ d’Hiv Roundup in 1942, wherein French police in German-occupied Paris rounded up Jewish families to be shipped off to Auschwitz; Sarah is able to escape, but not in time to save her little brother, and this haunts her until her death as an adult. In the present day, an American journalist (Kristin Scott-Thomas) learns that her French husband has inherited the same apartment where young Sarah once lived, and she begins an investigation into the apartment’s past that uncovers Sarah’s history. Critics found the film absorbing and impeccably acted all around, even if it had a few minor plot issues. Certified Fresh at 75%, Sarah’s Key may not be the definitive Holocaust film, but it’s one that will engage you until the credits roll.The Devil’s Double 54%Much has been made of Saddam Hussein’s multiple doppelgangers, who the notorious dictator used to stay one step ahead of those who might capture — or kill — him. Based on factual events, The Devil’s Double focuses on the same phenomenon as it applied to one of Hussein’s sons, Uday Hussein. Dominic Cooper here plays dual roles as both Latif Yahia, the Iraqi lieutenant chosen as Uday’s double, and Uday himself; as Latif discovers the depths of Uday’s dark and psychotic behavior, he must come to terms with what he’s been asked to do in Uday’s name. Critics were fairly split about The Devil’s Double, thought most praised Cooper’s dedication to the role. Directed by Lee Tamahori (Die Another Day) and co-starring Ludivine Sagnier, Philip Quast, and (surprise!) Latif Yahia himself in a supporting role, The Devil’s Double earned a 53% on the Tomatometer, with many critics balking at the graphic portrayal of Uday Hussein’s cruel and sadistic nature, but willing to recognize the strength of Cooper’s performance.The Birth of a Nation – Special Edition Blu-Ray 93%We’re stuck with The Birth of a Nation. Few would deny its profound influence on movie history, but fewer still can watch its loathsome treatment of African Americans with anything less than disgust. For as much as D.W. Griffith’s epic helped codify the modern language of filmmaking (utilizing the most sophisticated editing techniques and camerawork that cinema had yet seen), its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan as heroes of the Reconstruction era was pretty controversial even upon its release in 1915. Griffith was a man of his time, and a not particularly ideological one at that (he was surprised at the negative backlash the movie generated) and yet his masterwork was so skillfully made that it remains a flashpoint of film scholarship — is it possible to admire, or even enjoy, a film with such an odious message? Kino’s lavish three-disc The Birth of a Nation – Special Edition will certainly add to the conversation; in addition to a new transfer of the film, the set features a number of Griffith’s short films and plenty of bonus featurettes and documents about the making of the movie and the controversy it caused.12 Angry Men – Criterion Collection 100%Cinema history is loaded with courtroom dramas, but 12 Angry Men remains the most influential — and one of the most perpetually watchable — of the bunch. Directed with verve and urgency by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men is the tale of a jury tasked with deciding the fate of an impoverished murder suspect; as the jurors examine the evidence, they come to realize that perhaps the case wasn’t as open-and-shut as it first appeared. Sure, it’s a “message movie,” but with electric performances from the likes of Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, and Jack Klugman, it never feels preachy. A new Criterion edition of the film features a fresh transfer of the movie, new and archival interviews with Lumet and other crew members, and an earlier, made-for-television version of 12 Angry Men.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"criterion, PaleyFest, Certified, Comic, unscripted, FOX, Pixar, Lucasfilm, werewolf, fast","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Super-8-and-Conan-the-Barbarian"},{"id":"47613035638148","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Contagion Spreads to Home Video","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Contagion Spreads to Home VideoPlus, a successful Irish film, a couple fright flicks, and a classic Western bargain.by | January 3, 2012 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a couple of solid new releases, a couple of so-so features, a couple of bombs, and an impressive three-movie collection at a very affordable price. Steven Soderbergh’s latest, a star-studded epidemic film, and the highest grossing independent Irish film of all time come home. Next up, the Guy Pearce/Katie Holmes-powered haunted house movie and a medical conspiracy thriller starring Chris Evans, followed by a joyless creature feature and the Sarah Jessica Parker vehicle that rehashes her Sex and the City character in a more domestic setting. Last but not least, we’ve got a 3-pack of some of the most iconic Westerns every filmed. Check out the full list below!Contagion 85%Steven Soderbergh is one busy man — he’s directed at least one film a year since 1995, with the exception of 2003 — and he’s also one of those directors who has successfully navigated both independent and mainstream waters with finesse. Last year, we got his latest ensemble hit, Contagion, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly epidemic starring some of Hollywood’s biggest stars, and while we?ve seen outbreak movies before (like, for example, 1995’s Outbreak), critics found Contagion worthy of a Certified Fresh 84% Tomatometer. The story follows multiple threads as a lethal airborne virus rapidly goes worldwide, charting the paths of those tasked with mitigating the global impact of the disaster and those simply trying to cope with its deadly effects. Bolstered by an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, and Marion Cotillard, just to name a few, Contagion is a tense, tightly plotted, and exceptionally smart disaster movie that simply adds another notch to Steven Soderbergh’s already stellar career.The Guard 94%At first glance, The Guard may look like a buddy cop comedy with fish-out-of-water elements, but we’re pretty far from Rush Hour territory here. To be specific, we’re in the cold, rural climes of County Galway, where Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) enforces the law in a highly idiosyncratic (read: often unprofessional) manner. Enter Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle), a straight-laced FBI man, who teams up with Boyle to solve an international drug trafficking case. Boyle is so fond of drugs, hookers, and politically incorrect pronouncements that Everett (and the audience) is never quite sure if he’s a buffoon or a genius, and Gleeson’s performance is so strong that he rarely tips his hand. The Guard won raves for its fine performances, witty dialogue, and evocative sense of place, and it’s a great example of a film that makes age-old conventions feel fresh again.Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark 60%After back-to-back supporting roles in Thank You for Smoking and Batman Begins back in 2005, Katie Holmes took a break from the movies — call it maternity leave — before returning to the big screen in 2008. Unfortunately, the film that marked her return was Mad Money (23% Tomatometer), and since then, she’s appeared in six straight Rotten films. To its credit, Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark is the highest rated of those, and it’s just shy of Freshness at 59%, but critics just couldn’t entirely get behind this remake of the 1973 TV movie of the same name. Starring opposite Holmes is Guy Pearce as Alex Hurst, who, along with his girlfriend Kim (Holmes), is restoring an old mansion to prep it for the real estate market. When Alex’s young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) is placed in his care and begins to hear voices calling to her from the basement, the mansions dark secrets gradually begin to unfold. Critics found the haunted house flick’s effective atmosphere initially quite scary, but ultimately felt the film failed to deliver chills as successfully as the original. It’s not the scariest movie you’ll see, but it might be worth a rent on a cold, rainy night.Shark Night 3D 18%With that, we move on to a different kind of horror movie in Shark Night 3D. Styled after the nautical terror of Jaws and its ilk, Shark Night follows the misadventures of a group of undergrads vacationing in Louisiana who are methodically hunted by various ravenous sharks who have inexplicably taken up residence in the lake surrounding the house. After one of the coeds is brutally mauled while waterskiing, the others make an effort to get him medical attention, which, of course, merely results in more death as they attempt to traverse the dangerous waters of the lake. Shark Night performed poorly with the critics, who awarded it a paltry 15% Tomatometer score, and fared only slightly better at the box office. Hampered by its PG-13 rating, the film failed to deliver the goods in either of the two major draws of the genre: gratuitous violence and/or gore, and gratuitous sex and/or nudity. Shark Night brings nothing new or exciting to the formula, so it’s pretty difficult to make a recommendation out of it.I Don’t Know How She Does It 17%Writer/director Douglas McGrath has got a couple of good ones on his resume (Emma, Infamous), but his first film in five years was not a welcome return for him. Banking on the star power of Sarah Jessica Parker, coming off the second Sex and the City movie, I Don’t Know How She Does It purports itself to be a comedy about a working mother named Kate Reddy (Parker) who has it all, but must learn how to balance her career, her marriage, and her children. Unfortunately, critics didn’t really seem to care much about how Kate did it, as the film teetered hesitantly between comedy and drama and relied on hopelessly outdated viewpoints on gender to deliver its message. Despite a supporting cast that included the likes of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, and Christina Hendricks, I Don’t Know How She Does It is probably best suited as entertainment for those who are looking for just a small taste, just one more fix, of Sarah Jessica Parker in full-on, Sex and the City Carrie mode.Puncture 52%Not long after his turn as Captain America, Chris Evans hit theaters again, but this time in a very small, very limited release called Puncture. Based on true events, the film focuses on a pair of Houston lawyers (Evans and co-director Mark Kassen) who agree to defend an ER nurse (Vinessa Shaw) who’s been pricked by a contaminated needle. As the attorneys delve deeper into the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy that involves a widespread medical issue and the shady underbelly of the pharmaceutical industry. Critics were willing to go with the story, which they found compelling, but most were a little reluctant to buy into the formulaic plotting that drove the narrative along. At 53% on the Tomatometer, Puncture isn’t quite the equivalent of The Insider, but it should get the job done for those looking for a passable potboiler featuring a rising star.The Searchers/The Wild Bunch/How the West Was Won Blu-Ray Triple FeatureAny Western fans out there? Sure there are, and to be honest, if you’re one of them, chances are you’ve probably seen all three of the movies in this nifty little 3-pack. That said, the three movies included here are so good that we couldn’t forego mentioning this little gem. What we have here is a triple header that features The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, and How the West Was Won; in other words, three of the most iconic Westerns ever to be filmed, starring the likes of John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, William Holden, and Ernest Borgnine, just to name a few. And if you haven’t seen many Westerns in your time, this is probably about as good as it gets, from masters of the genre like John Ford and Sam Peckinpah. Need more proof? The three films listed above hold Tomatometer scores of 98%, 97%, and 100%, respectively. Still wondering if it’s worth picking up? Alright, we’ll sweeten the deal by telling you that the triple feature is available on Blu-ray and costs less than $25. Granted, you won’t be getting a lot of bonus features (if any) on a package this inexpensive, but all three films are certainly worth having in your collection.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"competition, TV, Studios, Walking, &, ID, satire, asian-american","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Contagion-Spreads-to-Home-Video"},{"id":"47613030578562","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Crazy, Stupid, Love & Cars 2 & Water for Elephants","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Crazy, Stupid, Love &amp; Cars 2 &amp; Water for ElephantsPlus, a silent era Phantom, a traditional Christmas, and a saucy documentary.by | November 1, 2011 |  CommentsThis week brings us another handful of interesting releases on home video, with a mixture of Certified Fresh choices and critical duds. Notable “also-ran”s for this week’s column include both the 1951 adaptation of A Christmas Carol and the 1988 Bill Murray version Scrooged, as well as the Robin Williams Peter Pan tale Hook and a Blu-ray set for the Toy Story trilogy, all ideal for the holidays. George Clooney’s Confessions of a Dangerous Mind also gets the hi-def treatment, as does the British miniseries Brideshead Revisited. That said, we’ll be focusing on the recent Steve Carell/Ryan Gosling romcom, Pixar’s most recent sequel, and a Robert Pattinson/Reese Witherspoon drama. Then we’ve got Errol Morris’s latest doc, a faith-based Christmas story, Joel Schumacher’s hostage movie, and a creepy silent era classic. See below for the full list!Crazy, Stupid, Love. 79%Steve Carell’s big screen career thus far has been quite fruitful for him, but though the talented actor has already notched a few starring roles, Crazy, Stupid, Love. marks the first one since The 40 Year Old Virgin to earn the Certified Fresh stamp (if you don’t include his work in animated films like Despicable Me). Carell plays Cal Weaver, a family man suffering from marital problems who befriends smooth-talking womanizer Jacob (Ryan Gosling) in order to get back into the dating game. Soon, however, Jacob himself begins to earnestly fall for Hannah (Emma Stone), and both he and Cal must lean on each other for support through their tumultuous love lives. With a supporting cast that also includes Julianne Moore, Marisa Tomei, and Kevin Bacon, Crazy, Stupid, Love. charmed critics, who called it unabashedly sweet even if it doesn’t quite live up to the “crazy” part of its title, to the tune of a Certified Fresh 77%. While it may not necessarily elicit the biggest laughs of the year, it should make for a pleasant rom-com elevated by a terrific cast.Cars 2 40%Though it sports a Certified Fresh 74% on the Tomatometer, 2006’s Cars is widely regarded as Pixar’s least impressive film, especially when considering the fact that every other entry in the animation studio’s canon has earned between 91% and 100% on the Tomatometer. What, then, prompted this sequel, when there would appear to be so many other worthy entries to expand into franchises? Some argue that it was a money grab, seeing as how Cars merchandise has been disgustingly popular with the kiddies. Others argue that… Well, okay, we haven’t heard much in the way of a counterargument, considering Cars 2 went on to become the first Rotten movie for Pixar. This time around, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) and his buddy Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) do a bit of globetrotting for a World Grand Prix, during which Mater becomes unwittingly involved in an international espionage operation. Despite the film’s fantastic visual flourishes, critics say, Cars 2 lacks compelling storytelling, making it possibly the first Pixar film not to appeal successfully to adults as much as children. The cast, which includes Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, and more, is great, though, and kids will undoubtedly love it, so there you go.Water for Elephants 60%It’s a bit too early to tell whether or not Robert Pattinson will forever be known primarily as Twilight‘s Edward Cullen, but it would seem that Water for Elephants, based on the NY Times Best Seller of the same name, isn’t the film that will memorably set him apart from the popular teen vampire series. Pattinson plays Jacob, a twentysomething Cornell veterinary student during the Great Depression who, after learning his parents have died tragically and left a mountain of debt, decides to hop on a passing train in lieu of returning to school. As it turns out, the train belongs to the Benzini Brothers Circus, who hires Jacob as the circus’s vet, and he soon falls in love with the head animal trainer’s (Christoph Waltz) wife, Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). While the tale is tastefully told and beautifully filmed, critics felt that that Water for Elephants suffered from a pronounced lack of chemistry between its leads, earning it a just-barely-Fresh 61%. It might do the trick if you’re looking for an old-timey romance, but don’t expect many sparks to fly.Tabloid 92%When is an Errol Morris (Gates of Heaven, The Thin Blue Line) documentary ever uninteresting? The acclaimed filmmaker has been crafting award-winning docs for decades now, and Tabloid, Certified Fresh at 92%, proves he still has what it takes. Of course, it certainly helps if your subject is Joyce Bernann McKinney, the former Miss World contestant with a colorful past who turned up in the news again when a woman going by the name of “Bernann McKinney” traveled to South Korea in 2008 to have her pet dog cloned. As chronicled in Tabloid, McKinney was previously tied to a 1977 investigation in which a Mormon missionary living in Surrey, England alleged that McKinney kidnapped him, chained him to a bed, and raped him. As critics noted, Tabloid isn’t Morris’s most thought-provoking work, but it’s nevertheless a smart, spirited, and engaging look at tabloid culture and one very fascinating woman, and that makes for a solidly entertaining film.Christmas with a Capital CFaith-based films have never done very well with critics, typically because such films have a difficult time balancing effective storytelling (and decent acting, to be honest) with heavily message-driven themes. We can’t really tell you what most professional film critics thought of Christmas with a Capital C, however, because, for the most part, only Christian organizations bothered to review it. What we can tell you is that, upon the release of the film’s trailer, a lot of people on the internet had a lot of funny things to say about it, so we’re including it here as a curiosity. The story is pretty straightforward: Dan Reed (Ted McGinley) is a small-town mayor in Alaska who relishes the traditional Christmas celebrations every year, and when his high school rival Mitch Bright (Daniel Baldwin; why not Stephen is anyone’s guess) returns home from the big city, things heat up quickly. You see, Mitch isn’t comfortable with the public displays of religious themes, and in an effort to bring the town in line with the consitution’s Establishment Clause, he decides to run against Dan in the mayoral race. The film, in other words, is basically a feature-length illustration of the so-called “War on Christmas” and is intended to cater to those who firmly believe Christmas should remain a Christ-centric celebration. If you fall into this constituency, then this will be a perfect holiday treat; if not, then your life will likely not have been significantly affected by skipping the film.Trespass (2011) 11%Those who are intent on scrutinizing Nicolas Cage’s career as he takes role after role in films of ALL sorts may want to give this one a look, if only for a few more of his trademark freakout moments. Helmed by Joel Schumacher and co-starring Nicole Kidman (honestly, what is she doing in this?), Trespass follows a wealthy young family who are taken hostage in their mansion by extortionists looking to score on a home invasion run. Unfortunately, as the critics tell it, the film simply relies on too many familiar elements from other similar films like Panic Room, rendering the tension ineffective, and is far too nasty and aggressive to be entertaining. At 13% on the Tomatometer, it’s not much of a surprise that the film opened almost exactly two weeks ago and is now already finding its way to home video. (You can read about Joel Schumacher’s Five Favorite Films here.)Phantom of the Opera (1925) Blu-ray 90%If you’re in the market for some post-Halloween creepiness, you’re in luck: The Phantom of the Opera is hitting shelves on Blu-ray. Starring Lon Chaney in perhaps his most iconic role, this supremely gothic 1925 masterpiece is unlikely to shock contemporary slasher fans (or even adherents to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s smash musical), but it still has the power to get under your skin and stay there. Chaney plays Erik, a disfigured, misunderstood music star who slinks around the dark corridors below the Paris Opera House, causing all sorts of havoc in a misguided attempt to win the heart of his beloved Christine (Mary Philbin). Featuring grotesque makeup and innovative color sequences, Phantom remains disquieting stuff; for silent movie buffs, the disc has some interesting bonus materials, including a commentary track, the original script, a photo gallery, and a souvenir program.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Mary, docudrama, YA, Star, Best, movies, Cosplay, NBC, cinematic, Mystery, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Crazy-Stupid-Love-and-Cars-2-and-Water-for-Elephants"},{"id":"47613028505985","title":"AFI Fest Selections Score Big During Awards Season","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})AFI Fest Selections Score Big During Awards SeasonAs an incubator for Oscar buzz, the festival has a strong recent track record.by Tim Ryan | November 12, 2013 |  CommentsIn the pantheon of film festivals, the AFI Fest ranks a few notches below Cannes and Sundance in the public’s imagination. As an incubator for awards season buzz, however, the fest has had a bigger impact than its reputation would suggest.In 2012, the AFI Fest hosted screenings of Life of Pi, Silver Linings Playbook, Lincoln, The Impossible, Amour, and, in a secret screening, Skyfall, each of which ended up being nominated for an Oscar (with Life of Pi, Lincoln, and Skyfall each taking home multiple statuettes). Plus, four of the five films nominated for Best Foreign Film (Amour, Kon-Tiki, A Royal Affair, and War Witch) were shown at the fest.The 2011 fest wasn’t quite as jam-packed with future Oscar winners, but it still sported a pretty decorated lineup that included eventual Best Picture winner The Artist along with nominees My Week with Marylin and Pina and three of the five Best Foreign Film hopefuls (A Seperation, which won, along with Bullhead and Footnote). On the other hand, the 2010 lineup was a veritable murderer’s row of films that garnered Oscar noms, including The King’s Speech, Black Swan, Rabbit Hole, Blue Valentine, and The Fighter.Of course, not every AFI Fest selection goes on to earn awards season glory; for every Life of Pi, there are films like J Edgar, Love and Other Drugs and Hitchcock that earn polite reviews but no hardware. It will be interesting to see how this year’s lineup fares come Oscar season; we wouldn’t be surprised if Idris Elba or Christian Bale get Best Actor noms for Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom and Out of the Furnace, respectively. Or if Meryl Streep or Judi Dench get Best Actress nods for August: Osage County and Philomena. Or if Bruce Dern is up for Best Supporting Actor for his turn in Nebraska. Or if Spike Jonze gets a Best Screenplay Oscar for Her.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Funimation, laika, toronto, jurassic, dc","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"afi-fest-selections-score-big-during-awards-season"},{"id":"47613041660295","title":"Awards Tour 2012: Producers Guild of America Awards Winners","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour 2012: Producers Guild of America Awards Winnersby RT Staff | January 21, 2012 |  CommentsThe Producers Guild of America (PGA) announced today the motion picture and long-form television nominations for the 23rd Annual Producers Guild Awards.

The end-of-winter release date and the bright LA streets kicked off a metaphorical heatwave for McConaughey’s career that led to blockbuster hits, R-rated gems, and a Best Actor Oscar at the 2014 Academy Awards.After stumbling a bit in the films Ghosts of Girlfriends Past and Surfer Dude, McConaughey surprised viewers by fully inhabiting the role of Michael “Mickey” Haller, a Defense Attorney (who never gets car sick) whose office is a Lincoln Town Car driven by a former client named Earl (Laurence Mason). Adapted from the 2005 book by Michael Connelly, the R-rated film collected $80 million worldwide on a $40 million budget and was adored by critics and audiences who declared it guilty of being an excellent courtroom thriller. McConaughey is in nearly every second of the Brad Furman-directed film, and the fly-on-the-wall camerawork full of pans and zooms by cinematographer Lukas Ettlin follows him around the streets of LA as he works on a high-profile case involving a rich maniac named Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe).Later in 2011, the Richard Linklater-directed Bernie&nbsp;and William Freidkin-directed Killer Joe&nbsp;erased the bad taste of Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&nbsp;and catapulted Failure to Launch&nbsp;out of people’s memories, ushering in the “McConaissance.” McConaughey followed these up with The Paperboy, Mud, Magic Mike, Dallas Buyers Club (which won him the&nbsp;aforementioned Oscar), The Wolf of Wall Street, True Detective, and the $700 million-grossing worldwide blockbuster Interstellar.&nbsp;In other words, McConaughey was doing “alright, alright, alright,” as everything he touched turned to gold (well, except for Gold, which, after Fool’s Gold and Sahara, proved he should avoid treasure hunting).Here’s five reasons why The Lincoln Lawyer&nbsp;was the perfect film to put McConaughey on the expressway to the McConaissance.1. McConaughey Is an Excellent Movie Lawyer(Photo by ©Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)While many consider McConaughey’s breakthrough performance in Dazed and Confused to be his launching pad, it was the 1996 film A Time to Kill that pushed his career into orbit. The John Grisham book adaptation featured McConaughey as a defense attorney for Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), a man who murdered his daughter’s rapists and injured a cop in the process. The film killed it at the box office, bringing in $152 million worldwide, and McConaughey was awarded the “Most Promising Actor” distinction from the Chicago Film Critics Association. A year later, McConaughey starred in&nbsp;Steven Spielberg’s&nbsp;Amistad, which was based on the true story and 1987 book Mutiny on the Amistad: The Saga of a Slave Revolt and Its Impact on American Abolition, Law, and Diplomacy. McConaughey once again played an attorney, this time defending a group of Africans who took control of the slave ship bound for the Americas that they were imprisoned on. Both films were Fresh successes, and proved he could excel in courtroom dramas.After a decade of romantic comedies and Reign of Fire&nbsp;— which is awesome, by the way; McConaughey is swallowed whole by a dragon —&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer and Bernie saw his return&nbsp;to&nbsp;the courtroom and reminded everyone of his rakish charm and acting prowess. Mickey is in almost every frame of The Lincoln Lawyer, and you can tell McConaughey loves playing the character. Whether it’s his off-the-charts chemistry with Marisa Tomei&nbsp;or the way he sucks the life out of Ted Minton (Josh Lucas), the overmatched state’s attorney, McConaughey thrives in the slimy-yet-likable role. When Earl asks Mickey if he’ll still have a job after Mickey&nbsp;gets his license back (he lost it due to a DUI),&nbsp;Mickey says he’s already had&nbsp;it&nbsp;for three months; the two smile, say nothing, and continue on with their day. It’s at this exact moment you realize you actually kind of like Mickey, the divorced alcoholic attorney hated by so many because he’s so good.&nbsp;After 10 years, this scene still hits us every time.2. The Film Gave Him His Edge Back and Allowed Him to ResetIf&nbsp;you saw Dazed and Confused as a teenager, McConaughey’s character Wooderson may have come across like a mythical figure. In hindsight, though, it probably dawned on you that Wooderson is an older dude who kind of creeps on high school girls, and you probably wouldn’t want him hanging out with your children or their friends. That’s the magic of McConaughey: he can find the charm in people you’d&nbsp;probably want nothing to do with otherwise. While he certainly earned his share of fans in rom-coms like&nbsp;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Wedding Planner, many forget he got his start playing sleazy or mysterious figures in movies like&nbsp;Dazed and Confused, Lone Star, and Frailty.McConaughey is at his best in films like Killer Joe, Magic Mike, and The Gentleman, when he can embody a square-jawed menace. His speech about the laws of the jungle in The Gentlemen&nbsp;and every second of his Killer Joe screentime are laced with unpredictable anger and a “don’t come at me” vibe that had been lost in movies like Surfer, Dude. In The Lincoln Lawyer, he’s a bad dad and a terrible husband, and he’s responsible for destroying an innocent man’s life (Michael Peña) after he refused to listen and fight for him. However, despite these glaring flaws, he’s still exceedingly likable, and&nbsp;he still possesses&nbsp;something of a moral compass. When Mickey visits Peña’s character&nbsp;to confirm a suspicion, you see in the course of just a couple minutes that McConaughey is nervous, shaken, and desperate as he tries to right a prior wrong.Reviews for The Lincoln Lawyer use phrases like “very refreshing,” “never-better,” and “the only actor in Hollywood who can swagger while sitting down.” This performance hit the reset button for McConaughey, who admitted in an interview with Cigar Afficionado magazine (of course) that the so-called McConaissance was more a case of him saying&nbsp;“f*** the bucks” and taking roles that “scared” him after a decade of easy, lucrative rom-coms. While he enjoyed giving audiences “90-minute breezy romantic getaways,” he wanted to be an actor again, “going as deep as you can in a role,” and&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer marks the beginning of that journey.3. McConaughey Soars in R-Rated Films(Photo by Everett Collection)It’s also fitting that&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer marked Matthew McConaughey’s comeback because the Tomatometer scores in his filmography reveal an interesting trend. His R-rated films boast a Fresh 60.2% average, whereas his PG-13 films&nbsp;sit at a Rotten 40.9% average. In other words, he has thrived in more adult-oriented fare, as 14 of his 15 best-reviewed films are rated R (Kubo and the Two Strings is the lone exception). McConaughey won his Oscar for the&nbsp;Dallas Buyers Club, and most recently, The Gentleman collected a 75% Tomatomometer and an 84% Audience Score&nbsp;en route to earning&nbsp;$115 million worldwide. Basically R = McC glory — with the exception of&nbsp;Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, Tiptoes, and Surfer, Dude, but even those three have cult followings of their own.Though it was a television program, the HBO crime drama&nbsp;True Detective sported a similar&nbsp;TV-MA rating, which is appropriate for a show that features brutal murder, copious profanity, and a sense of dread that weighs on you like a Lincoln Town Car. McConaughey’s performance in&nbsp;the first season of the series&nbsp;earned him Golden Globe and Emmy nominations for his turn as “Rust” Kohle, a Lone Star-swigging detective who goes through super dark times while hunting for a serial killer.Now, his PG-13 films have made much more money at the box office — Interstellar (that crying scene…) and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&nbsp;in particular were giant hits. But movies like Mud, Killer Joe (which actually received an NC-17 rating), and Magic Mike were low-budget marvels that found him hitting new gears and allowed him to work with people like&nbsp;Steven Soderbergh and Jeff Nichols.&nbsp;Yes, 2019’s famously panned&nbsp;Serenity is also rated R,&nbsp;but it’s insane, and we love that it exists — because it’s insane.What’s wild is that between 2003 and 2011, McConaughey’s only Fresh film was Tropic Thunder,&nbsp;the R-rated comedy epic that saw him dueling with Tom Cruise&nbsp;and throwing TiVos in the air to stop deadly rockets. The role is a minor one, but Rick Peck, Hollywood Agent, is another cocky creation who is just as&nbsp;dedicated as Mickey Haller is&nbsp;to his clients.4. He’s at His Best Playing Characters Whose Names Begin with M(Photo by ©STX Films, Jim Bridges/©Roadside Attractions, Saeed Adyani/©Lionsgate)Bear with us here: Between Mud, The Gentlemen, The Beach Bum, The Wolf of Wall Street, Frailty, and The Lincoln Lawyer, R-rated movies in which McConaughey’s character’s first or last name begins with an “M” have a 76.5% Tomatometer average. This is well above the 60.2% average of his R-rated films in general. During the McConaissance, five of his best films have him named Mud, Mickey, Moondog, Michael, and Mark. Is this mere coincidence, or is there some other cosmic force at work?Two of McConaughey’s most underrated performances are in The Beach Bum and Frailty (which isn’t part of the McConaissance, but it’s legit). In The Beach Bum, Harmony Korine’s follow-up to Spring Breakers, he returned to Florida and cast McConaughey as a pleasure-loving author who gets entangled in shenanigans that involve great white sharks, cannabis, and explosions. Moondog is a peculiar entity who feels like an alternate version of McConaughey himself from a different timeline. The film moves at a leisurely pace, and it’s kept together by a dedicated McConaughey who knows he’s in a singular role of a lifetime. In Frailty, the Bill Paxton-directed horror film, McConaughey plays a guilt-ridden man named Adam/Fenton Meiks who believes he is on a mission from God to eliminate demons that walk among the living. He also tells excellent stories about past murders and family trauma, which he would do again in True Detective.5. The Film Boasts a Deep Bench of Supporting Characters(Photo by Saeed Adyani/©Lionsgate courtesy Everett Collection)While The Lincoln Lawyer may feature McConaughey in every scene, it helps that he’s surrounded by a&nbsp;supporting cast that’s deeper than the bench of the 2002-2003 San Antonio Spurs. It’s a treat watching John Leguizamo, Marissa Tomei, Josh Lucas, Laurence Mason, Michael Peña,&nbsp;William H. Macy, Shea Whigham, Frances Fisher, Ryan Phillipe, and Bryan Cranston act against McConaughey. It feels like their energy made him raise his game, and you can see it on the screen.His chemistry with Tomei’s Maggie, Mickey’s ex-wife, is palpable, and Michael Peña gives him pure gold to work with as an innocent man doomed to decades in prison. It also helps that Ryan Phillipe oozes menace and gives viewers a villain who desperately needs to be found guilty. The&nbsp;ensemble is instrumental to the success of the film;&nbsp;he’s surrounded by an embarrassment of riches,&nbsp;which makes the film&nbsp;infinitely rewatchable.That’s another reason why McConaughey has flourished in the decade since The Lincoln Lawyer’s release: Between Interstellar, The Wolf of Wall Street, Mud, Dallas Buyers Club (Jared Leto also won an Oscar for this film), Bernie, and Magic Mike, he’s been surrounded by A-listers doing A+ work. It’s part of the conscious decision he made back in 2011 to seek out challenging, rewarding material and work with talented individuals at the top of their game, and it reflects his newfound commitment to his craft. Would the McConaissance have still happened if he didn’t choose to star in&nbsp;The Lincoln Lawyer? Maybe, probably, but thanks to a number of factors — both obvious and esoteric — there couldn’t have been a more appropriate vehicle. Also, we like to imagine&nbsp;it led to this.The Lincoln Lawyer&nbsp;was released in theaters on March 18, 2011.On an Apple device?

But before we get to those, let’s mention some of the other items coming out this week that we won’t be mentioning: The Robin Williams classic Good Morning, Vietnam is getting a 25th Anniversary Blu-ray, Criterion releases a new Blu-ray of Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic, and the recent Journey to the Center of the Earth gets the hi-def 3D treatment… you know, for the kiddies. As far as new stuff, there’s the George Clooney directed political drama starring Ryan Gosling, the new Christian film from the makers of Fireproof, two of the moldiest movies to come out in 2011, and a retro coming-of-age tale. Finally, Criterion is also introducing its new transfer of a Luis Bunuel classic featuring one of Catherine Deneuve’s most iconic roles. See below for the full list!The Ides of March 83%Now that awards season is fully under way, 2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for George Clooney. He’s already picked up a couple of awards for his work in The Descendants (which has garnered its own fair share of accolades), but his latest directorial effort, The Ides of March, was nominated for four Golden Globes, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. The star-studded cast includes Ryan Gosling (that fourth Golden Globe nom went to him for Best Actor) as an idealistic campaign manager who becomes increasingly jaded by politics, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his wily boss, Paul Giamatti as a competitor trying to woo Gosling away from his candidate, Marisa Tomei as a persistent reporter hungry for a scoop, and, of course, Clooney himself as the seemingly perfect presidential candidate who has a few secrets of his own. With talent like that and a timely story, the film was almost destined to do well, and it indeed managed a Certified Fresh 85% on the Tomatometer. Even if you’re not so much into politics, it’s still an expertly acted, smartly written drama.Courageous 36%Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they’re often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. According to critics, Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies — all fathers — who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. The primary complaint coming from most critics had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, they found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you’re a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but at 35%, don’t expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it’s going to say.Abduction 5%Let’s be fair here: some inspirational cinema may be a bit obtuse and unsophisticated, but there are plenty of worse films that don’t preach any particular spiritual message. Case in point: Abduction, which stars Twilight heartthrob Taylor Lautner as Nathan Harper, a teen who, while researching for a school project on missing children, discovers that his true identity has been kept hidden from him all his life. As Nathan uncovers more about his past, he and his friend Karen (Lily Collins) are plunged into the dangerous world of his biological father, a former CIA agent embroiled in an espionage war. Apart from Lautner, who has yet to establish himself as an actor of some range, the cast is surprisingly solid: Alfred Molina, Sigourney Weaver, Jason Isaacs, Maria Bello, and even the original Dragon Tattoo star, Michael Nyqvist are all on board here. We say “surprisingly” because, despite this pedigree, Abduction only managed to eke out a 4% on the Tomatometer, making it one of the worst-reviewed films of the year, with critics calling it soulless and incompetent. Things could have been worse though, and speaking of which…Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star 3%If you haven’t heard of Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, then you are one of three things: 1) only a sporadic reader of RT, 2) extremely fortunate, or 3) both. Considering it only made about $2.5 million in box office receipts and left theaters after two weeks, it’s an understandable oversight. Produced by Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison studio, the film stars comic Nick Swardson as the titular Bucky, a man-child who discovers his uptight parents were once famous porn stars. With this newfound knowledge, Bucky decides to follow in his parents’ footsteps and sets his sights on Hollywood, where his small genitalia make him a popular gimmick. There’s more to the story, but it’s really not worth getting into. At a whopping 0% on the Tomatometer, this aggressively unfunny and severely misguided comedy is the worst-reviewed movie of the year and winner of the Moldy Tomato; do what you will with that information.Dirty Girl 34%Though it may not seem obviously so, coming-of-age films are difficult to pull off, because the balance one must maintain in order to offer just the right amount of sentimentality — without crossing over into schmaltz — is a tricky feat to master. In Dirty Girl, first-time writer/director Abe Sylvia makes things even harder for himself by setting the film in the nostalgic 1980s and promising a subversive edginess in his titular protagonist, a promiscuous high schooler named Danielle (Juno Temple) who embarks on a cross-country road trip with an unlikely partner in crime: a closeted bisexual classmate named Clarke (Jeremy Dozier). According to most critics, unfortunately, Sylvia fails to bring it all together and make it work; they found Dirty Girl tame and uneven, never quite bringing the Dirty and then trying to tie it all up in a sentimental bow that’s wholly unearned. Despite an experienced cast that includes William H. Macy and Mary Steenburgen, Dirty Girl sits at 25% on the Tomatometer.Belle de jour – Criterion Collection 95%Celebrated Spanish-born surrealist director Luis Bunuel made a career out of exploring the various ways in which fantasy and reality intertwine, from his early work like film school staple Un chien andalou all the way up to his final film, That Obscure Object of Desire. 1967’s Belle de jour is one of the better known examples of his aesthetic, featuring a smoldering Catherine Deneuve in one of her most iconic roles. Here, Deneuve plays Severine, a wealthy Parisian housewife who, bored of her sexless marriage, entertains lurid fantasies and ultimately begins to visit and offer her services at a nearby brothel under the titular pseudonym. When she becomes involved with a gangster named Marcel (Pierre Clementi) and attempts to quit the brothel, jealousies lead to an explosive confrontation with rather ambiguous results; fusing daydreams with reality throughout the film, Bunuel leaves the end open for interpretation. This week, Criterion releases their brand new edition of Belle de jour, which comes packed with extras like a video examination of sexual politics, a new interview with screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, and an excerpt from a television interview with Carriere and Deneuve.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"french, cults, Year, 20th, drama, ABC, on, book, Sony, visit, Swim, awards, impossible","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-the-ides-of-march-has-arrived"},{"id":"47613073843602","title":"Kevin Feige’s Oral History of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","content":"Oral Historiesvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kevin Feige's Oral History of the Marvel Cinematic UniverseOn the eve of Infinity War, the Marvel Studios president reflects on the ups, downs, and twists in each phase of the MCU.by Joel Meares | April 23, 2018 |  CommentsPhase One: 2008-2012Iron Man (94%) |&nbsp;The Incredible Hulk&nbsp;(67%) |&nbsp;Iron Man 2&nbsp;(73%) |&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;(77%) |&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger&nbsp;(79%)&nbsp;|&nbsp;Marvel’s The Avengers&nbsp;(92%)Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. were not obvious pegs on which to hang a superhero movie — or the fortunes of a studio. Favreau’s biggest hit was a Christmas flick, which still had some time to go before becoming a classic, and Robert Downey Jr. was an acclaimed actor, but at that stage far from the world’s biggest star. But Marvel Studios and studio president Kevin Feige were determined to pick the best talent over marquee names. “It was liberating to make decisions like that, that I don’t know would have been made at other studios at the time,” Feige told Rotten Tomatoes when he sat down to talk about 10 years of the MCU. The decision paid off —&nbsp;Iron Man was beloved by critics (94% on the Tomatometer) and audiences alike (the film has an Audience Score of 91%).Not all of Phase One’s films fared as well: The Incredible Hulk, Louis Leterrier’s reboot of the character, starring Edward Norton, was a sturdy effort, and is Fresh on the Tomatometer at 67%, but failed to set the world on fire — or launch a trilogy, as all other Phase One movies did. Mostly, however, critics and audiences rapturously embraced the assembling Avengers that Marvel Studios unleashed on multiplexes. Joss Whedon’s Avengers then took things next level with a 92% — a score that wouldn’t be matched again until Spider-Man: Homecoming. The secret sauce, Feige says, was there in the very first MCU effort. “What Jon brought to the process and what Robert brought to the process, as we were making Iron Man, laid the foundations —&nbsp;not only with the narrative and the story for where we’ve gone, now, almost 19 films with Infinity War —&nbsp;but also the tonality of our films and behind the scenes, the way we made the films.”What follows is a history of the MCU, and reflection upon it, drawn form a sit-down interview between Feige and Rotten Tomatoes.&nbsp;PHASE ONE | PHASE TWO&nbsp;| PHASE THREE“If we were to fail, at least we would have failed with the best intentions.”&nbsp;“I had been involved and Marvel had been involved at certain levels on other films before Iron Man, but always as a partner, never as the lead decision maker. The other studios spent the money to make the films&nbsp;– they had control of the films. When we got the chance to do it ourselves, there was a lot of pressure involved, because it was all on us. But I was very comfortable with that because: If we were to fail, at least we would have failed with the best intentions. And,&nbsp;Iron Man being our first film, we really believed in Tony Stark, we really believed in having a character that was as interesting, if not more interesting, outside of the costume as he was in the costume.”Robert Downey Jr. and Director Jon Favreau on the set of 2008’s Iron Man (Photo by ©Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection)“Let’s just cast the best actor we can find.”“Deciding that Marvel Studios’ Iron Man will be the marquee name allowed us to say, ‘Let’s just cast the best actor we can find.’ And it’s funny to remember now, [when] Robert Downey Jr. is one of the biggest stars on the planet. What he was then was one of the best actors on the planet – [if not] necessarily one of the biggest marquee stars on the planet. It was liberating to make decisions like that, that I don’t know would have been made at other studios at the time.”“On those early Iron Man screenings, it was apparent that audiences loved Tony Stark, that audiences loved the redemption arc that Tony was undergoing in that movie.”“We do what we call friends-and-family screenings on all of our films, made up of neither friends nor family, but made up of people that we trust to tell us the truth and not tell anyone else about the horrifically rough version of the movie that we’re showing them at that point. On those early Iron Man screenings it was apparent that audiences loved Tony Stark, that audiences loved the redemption arc that Tony was undergoing in that movie. It was after those screenings… some of the executives at the studio at that time started making very big predictions for the opening weekend.”Edward Norton in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk. (Photo by ©Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)“Hulk is a great character –&nbsp;who I do think can have standalone movies, and who I think would be great in his own standalone movies.”“With The Incredible Hulk, we were trying to bring a Bruce Banner and a Hulk into the beginnings of the MCU, the beginnings of our cinematic universe. The thing about Hulk, and we realized this early on as we started working on The Avengers, is that he is a great character —&nbsp;who I do think can have standalone movies, and who I think would be great in his own standalone movies.&nbsp;There’s a wish fulfilment to Hulk that even the worst of us can be used for good – that, I think, is why that character has endured for as many years as it has. But there was also something fun that had never been explored on screen before, in either of the two movies or in his television series, [something] which had only been explored in the comics: Which was [what he is like] when he is part of an ensemble, when he is this unpredictable part of this ensemble.”Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). (Photo by Jay Maidment/©Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)“Agent Carter is unbelievably capable at a time when it was very difficult to rise up the ranks in the military. We really wanted to create these female characters that were as strong and as capable as the heroes.”&nbsp;“From the beginning of my career, the notion of the damsel in distress was outdated, and when we started to make our own movies, we didn’t want to fall into that trope –&nbsp;we wanted to avoid it as much as possible. With Agent Carter, she is unbelievably capable at a time when it was very difficult to rise up the ranks in the military. We really wanted to create these female characters that were as strong and as capable as the heroes. Now, as we’ve continued to grow, that’s gotten even more apparent, to the point where they are the heroes. Literally right this second, Brie Larson is on the set of Captain Marvel in the first few weeks of photography; Evangeline Lilly has finished her role as The Wasp in Ant-man and the Wasp – and it will only grow from there. What Ryan Coogler did with Okoye, Nakia, and Shuri in Black Panther…&nbsp;they’re already iconic characters, and people are already asking, ‘When are they getting their movies? When are we getting the Shuri movie?’ The answer is: Nobody wants to see that more than me. And that’s a testament to that film and to those actresses. And to the world being ready, and overdue, to see these types of characters on the screen.”Director Joss Whedon and Scarlett Johansson on set of The Avengers. (Photo by Zade Rosenthal, © Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection)“The big danger with the first Avengers was just getting overwhelmed with action. So many superheroes, so much spectacle, so many special effects.”“Early on, we realized that the role of the filmmaker on our films is to bring a unique tonality and be able to maintain and ride that tone over the course of production and through post-production. We have amazing artists and technicians who can help with the scale, that can help with as big a canvas as it is. &nbsp;What the filmmakers need to do is not get lost in all of that and to focus on the great character work. The big danger of the first Avengers was just getting overwhelmed with action. So many superheroes, so much spectacle, so many special effects. The most interesting thing about the Avengers is: Why in the world are all these people in the same room together –&nbsp;and what would they do when they were in the same room together? Joss Whedon was an amazing writer, and had done amazing things that showed that character would not get lost amongst the spectacle. And, he of course exceeded all of our wildest expectations – twice.”PHASE 1 |&nbsp;PHASE 2&nbsp;|&nbsp;PHASE 3","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney, Movies, children's, Family, TBS, Arts, Network, Review","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kevin-feiges-oral-history-of-the-marvel-cinematic-universe"},{"id":"47613079268757","title":"Ebert & Roeper: \"V For Vendetta\" Dark, Thoughtful, And That’s Good","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ebert &amp; Roeper: \"V For Vendetta\" Dark, Thoughtful, And That's Goodby RT Staff | March 13, 2006 |  CommentsOn their weekly syndicated show \"Ebert &amp; Roeper,\" Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave early reviews of \"V For Vendetta\" — and gave the comic adaptation two thumbs up.Ebert enjoyed the revolutionary superhero tale of a lone freedom fighter in a fascist future Britain, despite not being able to draw specific analogies between the film’s political message and any corresponding situations in the real world: \"The strange thing is I kept feeling it was a sharply pointed political parable but I couldn’t get the parallel going.\" Despite this apparent ambiguity, Ebert said \"it does make incoherence really entertaining.\"Equally impressed, Roeper commended the overall performances of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman — \"she kind of wrestled with her English accent here and there, but it’s a nice performance\" — and dismissed the controversy that \"Vendetta\" glorifies terrorism, noting that anarchist hero V is labeled a terrorist \"by someone who’s essentially Hitler, a dictator.\"Both Ebert and Roeper drew the quite obvious thematic parallels to \"Phantom of the Opera\" (V’s masked mentor), \"1984\" (with John Hurt as Big Brother), and even \"Beauty and the Beast\" (guess which is which). Both critics were also quite taken with the film.Ebert celebrated the growing maturity of comic book adaptations, which \"are getting more thoughtful and challenging in their stories and after \"Batman Begins\" and \"Spiderman 2\", \"V For Vendetta\" is one of the most intriguing so far.\"Roeper agreed: \"There are some great brilliant action scenes but this is more thoughtful, darker, and more in the vein of \"Batman Begins.\" And that’s a very good thing.\"For Ebert &amp; Roeper’s complete audio review, visit their official site.\"V For Vendetta\" comes out this Friday, March 17.

Why is this interesting? Because Hot Fuzz is the geek-droolingly anticipated follow-up flick from the boys who treated us to Shaun of the Dead.Continuing the company’s expansion of its feature slate, Rogue Pictures will domestically distribute Working Title Films’ contemporary action comedy Hot Fuzz, which began production last month. Rogue Pictures president of production Andrew Rona made the announcement today.A Working Title production in association with Big Talk Productions, Hot Fuzz marks the eagerly anticipated second feature from the co-creators of 2004’s award-winning sleeper hit Shaun of the Dead, the romantic zombie comedy (\"rom zom com\") which was also made by Working Title and Big Talk and released by Rogue domestically. As on the earlier movie, Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright have written the original screenplay, with Wright directing and Pegg and Nick Frost starring. Also as on the earlier movie, Natascha Wharton is executive-producing. Hot Fuzz is produced by Nira Park (Shaun of the Dead) and Working Title co-chairs Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.Pegg and Frost are joined in Hot Fuzz by a stellar U.K. cast, including Jim Broadbent (Academy Award winner for Iris), Paddy Considine (In America), Steve Coogan (Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story), Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Paul Freeman (Raiders of the Lost Ark), Anne Reid (The Mother), Billie Whitelaw (Twisted Nerve), Stuart Wilson (The Mask of Zorro), and Edward Woodward (The Equalizer); and Shaun of the Dead alumni Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy.Pegg stars in the film as London’s top cop, police officer Nicholas Angel. This tough law enforcer is good at his job – so good, in fact, that he makes his colleagues look bad. As a result, his superiors \"promote\" him to the village of Sandford, where all is garden parties and neighborhood watch meetings. Partnered with Danny Butterman (Frost), an oafish but well-meaning young local cop, Angel struggles to adapt. But he just can’t… until a series of grisly \"accidents\" indicates that foul play is afoot. Suddenly, this seemingly idyllic town is a case that Angel has to crack – hard.Rona commented, \"’Shaun of the Dead‘ was the very first Rogue Pictures release, so it’s especially gratifying to reteam with Edgar, Simon, Nick, Nira, and our friends at Working Title.\"Park added, \"We’re delighted to once again be joining creative forces with Rogue Pictures and Working Title on what’s going to be a very exciting and very funny film. With ‘Hot Fuzz,’ we’re going to give the police action genre the same treatment we gave the living dead!\"Production on Hot Fuzz, which is being shot on locations in North London and Wells, commenced in mid-March and is slated to finish in early June.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tour, Black","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rogue-shows-some-fuzz-love"},{"id":"47613075298707","title":"Kid Stars Sign Up for \"Spiderwick\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kid Stars Sign Up for \"Spiderwick\"by Scott Weinberg | July 24, 2006 |  CommentsYoung actors Freddie Highmore (\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\") and Sarah Bolger (\"In America\") have signed to star in Paramount’s big-screen rendition of \"The Spiderwick Chronicles,\" which is based on the very popular series by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi.From The Hollywood Reporter: \"Mark Waters (\"Mean Girls\") will direct the film from a screenplay by John Sayles (\"Limbo\")… In the movie, the three Grace children move to the ancient Spiderwick mansion, where they discover Brownie, an enchanted creature who introduces them to a world of goblins, fairies and sprites.\"Production gets underway in September.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kid-stars-sign-up-for-spiderwick"},{"id":"47613070101904","title":"“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… The Harry Potter Movies","content":"RT Podcastvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong\" About... The Harry Potter MoviesHats, schmats: We sort things by Tomatometer around here, and according to the numbers Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is the best movie in all of Potterdom. Is it truly the most magical entry in the series though? In this ep, we tackle RT's ranking of the Harry Potter franchise.by RT Staff | November 19, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Do you like your Harry Potter films light and frothy –&nbsp;like the early years? Or do you prefer your Wizarding World all broody and dark –&nbsp;like the later years? Perhaps your Potterverse sweet spot is in the middle films, like Goblet of Fire, which expertly blend both, capturing Harry, Hermione, and Ron at a time when they’re still innocent enough to be awed by the magic around them, and when He Who Must Not Be Named is moving from&nbsp;lingering threat to fully formed strange-nosed wand-swinger.Whichever way you lean Potter-wise, you’re likely to have some strong thoughts about our ranking of the Harry Potter films.Our list orders the movies&nbsp;by their Tomatometer score, which reflects the percentage of critics that gave the films a thumbs up. Not surprisingly, all eight Harry Potter movies score very well according to the Tomatometer, with&nbsp;each earning a Certified Fresh score of 77% or above. (It is the Ravenclaw of movie franchises.) Final film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 comes in at number one with a whopping 96%, with fan fave Prisoner of Azkaban close behind on 90%; in last place is Deathly Hallows – Part 1, which suffered – according to critics –&nbsp;from an inevitable feeling of being unfinished.In the latest episode of our new podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong (A Podcast from Rotten Tomatoes), we’re going big.

The Square, Nash Edgerton’s directorial feature debut, however, takes that unlikely location and weaves a twisted, compelling and darkly ironic tale.Raymond Yale (David Roberts) is in a loveless marriage. He’s also having a passionate affair with Carla Smith (Claire van der Boom) who, in turn, is married to gruff, angry crim Greg (a stand out performance from Anthony Hayes).Things start to heat up when Carla finds a bag of money from Greg’s latest crime. This is her chance to escape her controlling husband and flee with Raymond. A simple plan that soon careens out of control… but we won’t spoil it. This is a film best seen with as few expectations as possible.Nash Edgerton – deftly directs the script written by brother Joel Edgerton – who also appears in the film as pyromaniac Billy – and Matthew Dabner, who previously did script duties with Alex (The Crow; I, Robot) Proyas.Nash Edgerton started in the industry doing stunt work; a lot of stunt work.How did you get into the stunt game, Nash?NE: I never really considered it as a career at first. I used to always do things like jump off the roof. I was just out of school, doing an electrical engineering degree at uni and I just wasn’t feeling it.So you just up and started stunting?NE: Actually I was at a school formal and some guy said ‘stunt’ or was talking about stunts and the idea just sort of stuck in my head.The kind of idea that seems awesome after a couple of beers?NE [laughs]: I got the yellow pages and looked up “stunt”. I found a place that looked good, called them up and that was it.You have a huge collection of stunts to your name, including doubling for your brother, Joel. Is that because he’s a big girl?NE: I reckon Joel’s really capable but wouldn’t do half the things I do, probably because he’s smarter than me. But I’ve happily been his stunt double a number of times. I remember, on a TV show — it was 3am, I was getting hit by a car and he’s all rugged up with a coffee and I thought: ‘there’s something wrong with this picture.’So you just sort of charged right into the stunt caper, what about directing? Did you just decide to swap on a whim?NE: I didn’t swap. I still do stunts. Directing just seemed another challenge. And I know I can’t fall down stairs and get hit by cars forever. You get to a point where you can only be hit by cars and set on fire so many times.We’re going to have to apologise for this question in advance, because no doubt every other journo has asked it – but with you directing and Joel writing – do you see yourselves as Aussie Coen brothers?NE: Oh look, it’s a very flattering comparison. They’ve made a lot more films than we have!And Joel Coen directs, whereas Joel Edgerton writes and acts. It’s a bit of a dodgy comparison, but some points in The Square felt like the Coen’s first feature Blood Simple.NE: Blood Simple is one of my favourite films, and I’d love to work with Joel again. We’re both aiming for the same thing, both of us have the same objective in mind.The tone of the film, or the style, felt very Australian. But it never felt forced. There was no overtly ‘ocker’ stereotypes on display. Was that something you did deliberately?NE: There was a definite attempt to keep things realistic. I find the more realistic it feels the more chances of humour there are. Humour that comes from the situation and characters, I mean. Also, I think it’s a mistake to try and make an Australian film more Australian. You know: having shots of the Sydney Harbour Bridge or the Opera House for the sake of it. I’m an Australian and I’m shooting in Australia with other Australians. It’s going to be an Australian film – you don’t have to try!There was some nice linguistic quirks. ‘Good on ya’ was used several times to mean ‘shut up’ and ‘well done’.NE: It felt right to use some classic Australian terms but at the same time the story was universal. One of the uniquely Australian things we did have was Santa Claus rocking up on a boat for the kiddies.And the parents sitting back, chatting away, drinking beers because Christmas in Australia is bloody hot!NE: That’s right. You don’t see that in a lot of Aussie movies. But those moments aside, this is a story that could happen anywhere.Where’d the idea for film come from?NE: The idea came from Joel. He likes to read the weird, little stories in newspapers, the ones that have no information other than what happened. He found one where some people were digging up the foundation of a house and found the skeleton of a baby.Yikes.NE: Yeah, but there was no detail about why it was there, nor any chain of events that lead up to that. So we speculated on a story like that, starting with the end and going backwards. We also wanted to have someone commit murder but try to make the audience understand why they did it. And even feel sympathy for them. We wanted to show the results of their actions and them reaching a point of no return.That’s the beauty of The Square: everyone is doomed. But you don’t know how they’re doomed. It had a lovely random confluence of events interacting with people’s plans, a nicely nihilistic quality.NE: We also wanted the characters to have layers. Like, it would have been easy to have Greg be a wife basher or Ray’s wife be a total nag – but that would let them off the hook. It can’t be that black or white. If you make anyone completely bad or completely good you take away any sense of realism. Everyone has moments of both.There’s a scene that we won’t reveal the substance of, other than to call it the ‘dog scene’ – that seemed to be symbolic of the whole film.NE: Yeah, that was our way of saying, ‘just when you think things can’t get any worse… they do!’ Also, it’s a scene you’d never guess the end of. I love taking the story to places people don’t expect.Are you going to direct again?NE: If they let me!Directing a film does seems like an insane amount of hard work.NE: Oh mate, a couple of weeks in and I thought ‘I’m never directing again!’ but towards the end I was dying to direct something else – while all the lessons and tricks I’d learnt on set were fresh in my mind. But it’s really hard work. It’s a marathon.Do you have the next one lined up?NE: Yeah I’ve got another idea – it’s in my head and on scraps of paper at the moment. This last month or so it’s became clear what I want to do next.Same genre or something completely different?NE: Something different. More like my shorts like Spider. More twisted black humour. A lot of people have told me The Square is pretty twisted but I want to go further, do more.The Square opens in Australian cinemas on Thursday.

So when we had the chance to sit down with director Park Chan-wook, we leapt at it. The South Korean director doesn’t speak English, and our Korean isn’t all that hot, so we chatted with the help of a translator who’s worked with him for years. Read on as we talk about Thirst, his Cannes experience, the state of Korean cinema and Hollywood producers’ tendency to remake anything they can get their hands on.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213120[/tomatometer]I hear Thirst has been quite long in the making.Park Chan-wook: Well, although I say that this has been a film 10 years in the making, I’ve not necessarily spent all those 10 years making the film of course! At the beginning I didn’t think of it as something very serious, I didn’t give it that much of a thought. One night I thought of the idea of a vampire film and wrote it down on a couple of bits of paper.The idea that I had at the time was of a priest who was also a medical doctor. He started as a priest, who went on to study medicine, and so has a licence to practice as a medical practitioner. So as a priest/doctor, he volunteers to participate in this biological experiment in order to help save humanity, but despite his good intentions he becomes a vampire.That was the idea written down back then, but everything in the middle was a big blank. Somehow he would fall in love with a woman, after she realises he’s a vampire and thinks he’s a monster, he ends up taking her life, but turns her into a vampire. So these two ideas were written down way back then, and afterwards I was constantly struggling with how to fill out the rest of the story, but I went on to other more pressing films that I had been working on in that time.What was it that fascinated you about the idea of a priest who becomes a vampire?PC: It’s because of the differences between the characters. Here is one identity which, by its very existence, can be looked at as evil: A vampire, who takes other peoples’ blood in order to survive. On the other hand is this priest, which by the very meaning of the vocation is a vocation where you devote your life to others, living your life in service of others. Between these two identities, there is a huge ethical gap; a huge moral chasm. You have the moral height of being this noble priest, and the moral downfall to where you become a vampire, taking others blood. It’s such a height to make such a fall. And on the way down there are bigger scares and more thrills that you have to go to, that there is a bigger sense of vertigo that you feel.Did you struggle with the conflict, taking the character too far one way or the other?PC: They are actually inseparable, the identity of a priest and the identity of a vampire, so I didn’t have any concern about which extreme to take this character at all, because they had to co-exist. He is a priest who is forced to live on as a vampire despite his faith. This conflict, the suffering, and the pain that he goes through; this struggle is the main point of this film so the two need to go hand in hand.Let’s say I’m shooting a sequence about Beethoven, on the first performance of his ninth symphony, and when the concert finishes, and there is a roar of applause from the audience, but he can’t hear and he’s facing away from the audience, so one of the orchestra members has to turn him around to face the audience and take his bow. If I was to shoot this sequence, would you ask whether this was about the man with a hearing problem, or about a great composer? These two matters go hand in hand. If it hadn’t been about the man having a hearing disability, would we even shoot the sequence?Still from Thirst.In casting the female character Tae-joo, what considerations do you have to make about how she’ll play off Song Kang-ho?PC: Complexity, instability, and somebody who can cover all the different stages that this character has to go through, from almost child-like innocence to a downtrodden housewife who is burdened with all these chores and having to deal with everyday life situations. In this film, it almost feels as if her clock is running in reverse. She starts off as a downtrodden housewife, and then she turns into a young woman in love, and then when she becomes a vampire, there is this dialogue saying, “Happy birthday,” and this is where she is turned into almost a child, a baby.So I needed somebody who could handle all the performances for all these different states of the character, and could deal with all these different ages that this character goes through, so she needed the right appearance for that as well as the acting chops required.Oh, and lastly, sex appeal.Did you see all that immediately in Kim Ok-bin?PC: Yes. Even within five minutes of first seeing her, she exuded all those qualities that I needed, and I saw just how energetic she was.You’ve directed some quite disparate films. Are there any constants for you, as a director, which you feel apply to your body of work as a whole?PC: Yes, I feel there are constants throughout by body of work. Dealing with absurdity and dealing with surrealistic expressions.Continue on to page two as the director expands on his surrealism, updates on Korean cinema and discusses Hollywood remakes.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1213120[/tomatometer]Do you look to achieve surrealism through your visuals?Park Chan-wook: Not necessarily. Of course there are elements in my approach to surrealism, and perhaps the visual aspect of it is the most important, but I think it’s the situation itself which provides a surreal element to my film.Vampirism is a subject that has been covered in great length in cinema, books, music even, what did you want to bring to the mythology?PC: In this film, the biggest element is the moral downfall of the central character and the suffering that he goes through. So compared with other vampire works, it probably lacks the romanticism. In order to bring the moral aspects of the story to the fore, you need to remain very cold and approach it in a very realistic way, and that’s what sets it apart from other vampire films. Even if it’s not a vampire film, in a contemporary film, if the film is emphasising the moral aspects of the story, you may find that it’s old-fashioned. But somehow the moral emphasis and aspects make my films feel fresher.Do you have a fascination with the genre? What are your favourite films in this genre?PC: Nosferatu is my favourite vampire film out of all the classic films and even the modern ones too, with Herzog‘s remake. I’ve always had an interest in vampire films, not just Nosferatu, but there are many others that I have enjoyed; Abel Ferrara, Coppola, Neil Jordan.What does it mean to you to be premiering at Cannes?PC: It’s a festival which can cause headaches, and which can be very picky and quite cumbersome, but after a week’s schedule, going through all this pain, its also a festival where in that 10 minutes after your screening, it can make you forget about everything that you had been going through before, just with the reaction of the audience after your screening, where they express their supreme respect for the filmmaker.Still from Thirst.Do you find that the European audiences react differently to your films than the Korean audiences do?PC: I do, but overall it’s not fundamentally that different. Even in Korea itself, depending on which screen it was shown at, which theatre you go to, which screen time you choose, there are different people in the audiences and so the reaction is always different. So can you say that there is a range of difference found in domestic audiences when compared with the international audience? It’s hard to say.Do you think there is a bigger, more receptive, audience for Korean cinema outside of the country nowadays?PC: Yes there is. Korean films have been introduced to the Western and overseas audiences constantly in the past few years, so I find that they are increasing in popularity more and more. Whereas, up ’til now, Western audiences had found Korean films through DVD releases or festivals or even illegal internet downloads, now I think the time is right for the audiences to see these Korean films through commercial distribution at a cinema where the audience could see any film.Is there more money in the Korean film industry because those international channels are widening?PC: I don’t think that we’ve reached a level where we can say that, but certainly there are incremental changes; for instance, with Thirst, Universal came on board as an investor. But not just with this film, there are more and more remake rights being sold and exported into other territories outside of Korea. It’s not so much that you can say that there is an exponential growth of the money coming in.There are a lot of international directors going to Hollywood to make films, is that something that’s ever appealed to you, maybe even remake one of your own films?PC: When it comes to remaking my own films in the English language, I can only imagine that it is a very boring process, I wouldn’t ever dream of it. But much in the way that I have my radar on for a good script in Korea, if there is a good script coming my way from the US, of course I would go shoot a film there. Not just the US, but anywhere in the world.Can you tell us about your next project?PC: There isn’t a next film confirmed at the moment unfortunately. At the moment, all I can think about is taking some rest. If I was to start on the next film, I’d hope to do something closer to everyday life.Thirst is out in the US on Friday. It arrives in UK cinemas on 16th October.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comic-Con, One, Polls, nightmare, nfl, your, zero, zombies, language","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"director-park-chanwook-talks-thirst-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613134223781","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Buried and Animal Kingdom","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Buried and Animal KingdomPlus, a couple of Sam Fuller classics, and the re-teaming of Robert De Niro and Edward Norton.by Alex Vo | January 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis week, we’ve got a wide variety of choices, mostly fresh from the theaters. First up, we’ve got the winner of the AU Golden Tomato award, a slick little crime thriller that should please most. Then we’ve also got a highly rated thriller starring Ryan Reynolds, a heist flick with a big cast, a prison showdown between Edward Norton and Robert De Niro, another “is it real or fake” mockumentary about a teen losing his virginity, Philip Seymour Hoffman’s directorial debut, and a documentary omnibus film based on a popular nonfiction book. Then, to top it all off, we’ve got brand spanking new Criterion Collection editions for a couple of classics by Samuel Fuller. So dig in and see if anything tickles your fancy.[tomatometer]MovieId=770818882[/tomatometer]Animal KingdomIf you’re a regular visitor to RT, then you’re possibly already aware of this small Australian film that captured the attention of critics all over the world. One of the ten best-reviewed limited release films of 2010, as well as the top film from Australia, Animal Kingdom is a crime drama that paints a portrait of Melbourne’s seedy underbelly. The story focuses on Joshua “J” Cody (James Frecheville), young nephew in the Cody crime family, and his initiation into the “family business.” J becomes the subject of investigation by a police officer named Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce), who attempts to lure J against his family. Critics felt that the cast all performed superbly, and with a well-written script and a steady, kinetic pace, the Certified Fresh Animal Kingdom (96% on the Tomatometer) proves that Australia’s cinema is not to be ignored. If you’re into gritty crime dramas, this is definitely worth checking out.[tomatometer]MovieId=770819772[/tomatometer]Buried2010 saw the release of a handful of one-location thrillers, like Devil (an elevator) and Frozen (a stalled ski lift), but possibly the best-reviewed one of them all was a little-seen indie thriller that took place primarily inside a coffin. Ryan Reynolds stars as a man who wakes up to find himself buried alive with nothing to help his situation but a lighter and a cell phone. With air dwindling, he must quickly figure out why he’s been buried and who did it. Films like this depend heavily on the acting chops of their stars, and critics say that Reynolds holds the movie together terrifically, helping to create a gripping drama from a premise that could easily have lost its novelty quickly. At 85% on the Tomatometer, Buried is Certified Fresh, so don’t let its minimalist setting fool you; this is a thriller worth checking out.[tomatometer]MovieId=770803979[/tomatometer]TakersIt’s difficult these days to make a heist movie stand out from its predecessors, being that so many plot twists and turns have been explored in the genre. Unfortunately, despite featuring a cast that includes everyone from Matt Dillon, Zoe Saldana, and Idris Elba to recording artists Chris Brown and T.I., Takers ultimately falls prey to conventional heist movie clichés and poor characterization, leaving little for the viewer to indulge in aside from a few explosive set pieces. Dillon and Jay Hernandez play detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, who are hot on the trail of a gang of organized bank robbers led by Gordon Crozier (Elba). When an old crewmate (T.I.) thought to be in prison is released, he talks the gang into one more heist, and plenty of double crosses ensue. Takers only rang true to the critics to the tune of a 29% Tomatometer, but the other constant with heist movies is that, even if they are derivative, they’re usually still a bit fun to watch, so you might save this one for a rainy night.[tomatometer]MovieId=770871631[/tomatometer]StoneThe prospect of seeing Edward Norton and Robert De Niro square off with each other just doesn’t have the appeal that it did a decade ago. Back then, De Niro was coming off of performances in Casino, Heat, and Ronin, and Norton was hitting his stride in films like Rounders, American History X, Fight Club. So it wasn’t a surprise when 2001’s The Score, featuring both actors, was a hit. Fast forward to 2010, when Stone saw De Niro as a retiring correctional officer named Jack Mabry who takes one last case, namely that of Gerald “Stone” Creeson (Norton). In an effort to secure an early parole, Stone manipulates Mabry with mind games and instructs his own wife, Lucetta (Milla Jovovich), to seduce Mabry as part of the deal. Critics are largely split on Stone, but most agree that its premise is a tad farfetched and, despite a solid cast, veers wildly into strange territory. Not exactly a crowdpleaser, but if you’re a fan of either actor, you may still enjoy it.[tomatometer]MovieId=770767771[/tomatometer]FreakonomicsIn 2005, a non-fiction book took the country by storm, examining several sociological phenomena from the perspective of economics, or, as pointed out by authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, the study of incentives. Four years and four million copies later, a number of critically acclaimed documentary filmmakers, from Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room) to Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me) to Seth Gordon (King of Kong), were brought together to illustrate on film the principles featured in the book. While the results were both thought provoking and often humorous, critics felt that viewers might be better served by reading the book, which offered the same sorts of stories, but with greater insight and more detail. Nevertheless, the film still earned a decent 66% Tomatometer, so for those who just want the crash course, this should do just fine.[tomatometer]MovieId=771204351[/tomatometer]The Virginity HitDirectors Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland succeeded in writing one documentary-style film last year, The Last Exorcism, and that one did pretty well for itself, both critically and commercially. This wasn’t the case, unfortunately, for the film the duo directed, namely The Virginity Hit, the chronicle of one teenager’s quest to lose his virginity, as told via handheld home video cameras and cell phones. Though it’s unclear how much of the story was staged for the production, and how much of it was genuine (much like another similar film, Catfish), Matt (the teen in question) and his buddies occupy the screen like real life versions of characters from a Judd Apatow movie. Unfortunately, critics were not impressed by what they saw, calling the film shallow, uninteresting, and crass, despite a few funny moments. Maybe worth a look for the supremely curious, but probably not something that’s got widespread appeal.[tomatometer]MovieId=770814193[/tomatometer]Jack Goes BoatingPhilip Seymour Hoffman has had his share of success in front of the camera, and he’s also an accomplished theater director, so the next natural step for him was to direct a film, and that brings us to Jack Goes Boating, Hoffman’s directorial debut and a film adaptation of a play of the same name. Hoffman plays the titular Jack, a limo driver with a penchant for Reggae music, who’s introduced to Connie (Amy Ryan) through Jack’s friend Clyde (John Ortiz) and his wife Lucy (Daphne Rubin-Vega). As Jack and Connie grow closer, Clyde and Lucy simultaneously begin falling apart, and both couples must learn how to come to terms with these new developments. Hoffman played Jack in the original stage production, and the script for Jack Goes Boating was adapted by the writer of the original play, so there is some authenticity to the picture, and critics appreciated the honest characterization, giving the film a respectable 67% Tomatometer score. There is a little bit lost in translation from stage to screen, but it’s a well-acted romantic dramedy that should be perfect for some.[tomatometer]MovieId=20272[/tomatometer]Shock Corridor and The Naked Kiss – Criterion CollectionSamuel Fuller has never been a stranger to controversy, the most well-known case of which probably revolves around the production of his anti-racism themed 1981 film White Dog, which, ironically, was suppressed by Paramount Pictures for fear that the film would mistakenly be considered racist. But even as far back as the 1960s, Fuller was making excellent films about unpopular subjects, and two of them get the refreshed Criterion Collection treatment this week: 1963’s Shock Corridor and 1964’s The Naked Kiss. The former centers on a journalist who checks himself into a mental hospital in order to investigate a murder, but ends up slowly going insane himself; the latter is a satire of suburbia that sees a prostitute moving to a prim new town to start her life over, only to discover that it harbors its own dirty little secrets. Both films are offered in DVD and Blu-Ray formats, with Criterion’s typically outstanding special features, including archived TV interviews, a documentary on Fuller himself, and illustrations and essays.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"YA, MSNBC, Returns, Tour, ID, scary, Movies, vampires, Emmys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Buried-and-Animal-Kingdom"},{"id":"47613123169695","title":"Cannes 2009: Sidebar Awards Round-up","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: Sidebar Awards Round-upFIPRESCI, Critics’ Week and Un Certain Regard award their prizes.by Joe Utichi | May 24, 2009 |  CommentsIt’s the final day of the Cannes Film Festival today, and following yesterday’s announcement of the Director’s Fortnight awards, now we have word from Critics Week and FIPRESCI ahead of tonight’s official competition ceremony.

Maurice Sendak, the writer and illustrator of the best-selling children’s book (which has sold upward of 20 million copies), identified Jonze as the only man he trusted enough to render his story on film. That story focuses on Max, the boisterous boy in wolf pyjamas who, when sent to his room for bad behaviour, journeys in his imagination and travels to the realm of the Wild Things, a gaggle of hairy monsters who proclaim him king. The book contains only a few hundred words, and yet Jonze has created a full feature film, as wild as the source and as dark and brooding as any ancient fairy tale. The director joins Maurice Sendak and some of his key collaborators to explain exclusively to RT how they shaped the world of Where the Wild Things Are on the big screen.Maurice Sendak, author and illustrator:When I started working on the book back in 1960, I didn’t really know why I’d written it. I think the inspiration came from a lot of our family’s relatives who used to come from the old country to visit, and they were really unkempt, they didn’t speak English, their teeth were horrifying, their hair all crazy and they’d pick you up and hug you and kiss you and would say ‘Arrghhh, we could eat you up.’ And my brother and sister and I knew that these people really would eat anything, so I decided to render them as Wild Things.Spike Jonze, writer/director:I had gotten to know Maurice about 15 years ago. We worked on a movie that didn’t happen and through that became friends. One day he talked to me about doing Where The Wild Things Are. I was excited by it but also really nervous about it because the book is so short but I didn’t want to add some storyline or some plot. I’d look at it and say, ‘How could you add to this?’ And anything I felt like adding would just sound cheesy. But over the years, as I started thinking more about the book, I suddenly thought that the Wild Things could be wild emotions. Suddenly out of that everything tumbled and it felt like I could build from inside the book.Dave Eggers, co-writer:Spike wanted to make sure that what he remembered feeling through his childhood corresponded with what kids think today. He interviewed lots of kids of Max’s age, and it really confirmed that they all deal with very deep emotions. So with the screenplay, the Wild Things embody those emotions. The film really is about childhood. It’s about what it’s like to be eight or nine years old and trying to figure out the world, the people around you, and emotions that are sometimes unpredictable or confusing.Spike Jonze:We never set any rules about whether it would be a movie for kids or for adults. Maurice Sendak didn’t consider himself a children’s author; he wrote about what it felt like to be a kid. So it was really important that we got the main character right. For Max I wanted a real kid, not necessarily an actor that was going to give a typical ‘movie-kid’ performance. I wanted someone who was going to give a real, emotional performance, and after a very long search I found Max Records. He really is the heart of the movie, and he has such depth to him as a person. It doesn’t feel as though he’s acting at all. It’s such a natural performance.Max Records, actor (Max):One of my favourite scenes is the dirt clod scene, where the Wild Things and Max are chucking all this dirt at each other. I had a scene where I had to run through the forest and it was like a minefield with all these dirt clods exploding everywhere. That was maybe my favourite scene. My favourite moment was sliming Spike. There’s a scene where I get licked by a Wild Thing and covered in all this goo. So I got our revenge by covering Spike with goo, too!Catherine Keener, actor (Max’s Mom):Obviously Max and I didn’t know each other when we arrived on set, and I had to show him that he could trust me. I tried to play quite hard with Max, and encouraged him to really let loose. It’s funny, I have a young son who was on set and he asked me why Spike didn’t live with his mum and dad. I said it was because he was an adult, but that says a lot about Spike.Catherine O’Hara, voice actor (Judith):Spike is very much in touch with the child within. In fact, even more so than the man without! No, seriously, we had a wild time on this movie. We improvised with this wonderful dialogue everyday and had such terrific fun. We’d do a lot of childish things and go really nuts. Which was just what Spike wanted.Spike Jonze:The Wild Things are such a strange invention of Maurice’s and it’s weird to think that at some point they did not exist in the world. For me, since I knew it as a kid I knew thes designs, I knew these characters, and it is as though they always existed in this strange surreal dream-like way. Maurice had tapped into some primal thing when he created them. They are furry and cuddly but giants with teeth and nails, and they’re dangerous. But then they have the proportions. Their heads are half the size of their body so they are baby-like in that way. And they’re hairy. They have really captured something. It is creativity at its best. They are as close as you can get to creating something that really is magic.Forest Whitaker, voice actor (Ira):We didn’t get inside the suits — they had other actors for that — but we did the voices and Spike captured our facial expressions to layer onto the body suits, to get the facial expressions and so forth. Once, he even interviewed us as characters, to build a little back-story for us, so we could get a better handle on who were and how we viewed our universe.Spike Jonze:When we first screened the movie to the studio they were a bit freaked out. They thought it was too scary for kids. But we didn’t make this movie just for kids. This is a movie about childhood; for everyone. Thankfully, though, they learned to love our movie. The kids weren’t scared, it was just the executives that were scared. I think kids are just like us. They see something that’s honest and they are attracted to it. Kids are attracted to things that are funny but I think all of us are also attracted to things that are true.Maurice Sendak:No one could have guessed that when I created the Wild Things they’d have such a hold over people, even today.

That’s where London’s Framestore came in, the effects house needing to seamlessly animate all the monsters without compromising Spike Jonze’s naturalistic vision for the project. RT went to visit them this week at their Soho headquarters, where Animation Director Michael Eames and Director of VFX Tim Webber told us how they did it, and shared some exclusive behind-the-scenes shots.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:With Wild Things, I think they started shooting hoping they would be able to make it with these very heavy animatronic masks – mechanisms attached to heads. But Spike realised that it was impractical, and that he couldn’t get anything like the levels of performance that they wanted. So he talked to a few people about the approaches and this seemed the best way of getting what he wanted.This project is a great amalgamation of three different techniques. First of all, the voice actors, they physically acted the scenes, on a set. Tapes were then made of the performances. Spike then used these to rehearse with the suit performers on the set to recreate the actors’ work. Then having got those we came in with the animation, and the results that we managed to get were so much for having those stages done before.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:Framestore got involved pretty late on in the film, considering how long the movie has been in development. We begun work on it for the last out of five years of development. It was terrifying, because it was so much work! The animation technique we used should logically take less time but it isn’t really the case.The process is the ‘re-projection’ technique. You take the thing that’s photographed in camera on set – in this case the creatures – and you effectively warp an image in 2D to create the facial expression, even though its 3D. Then you re-project it back onto what you’ve shot. This — in simple terms — means that because you’re working with real footage the amount of distortion you can create is very limited. So the difficulty was in getting the extremity of emotion in the performances. For example one of the characters — Carol — has a scene where’s he’s crying and is incredibly upset, there’s a limitation to how much facial expression we can animate.Michael Eames, Animation Director:Personally I’ve always thought that the best approach is to do a mix of different kinds of effects – and this movie is a great example of this. The guy in the suit is a practical thing, and we’re doing the face – it’s using each bit for what it’s best at.I’m quite a believer in — even when we’re doing CG — giving it qualities that make it real, rather than creating creatures who don’t obey the laws of physics and can just fly around. With this technology, you can do anything with your camera and your creature, but you don’t want to because then it wouldn’t look real. As soon as you do something that doesn’t feel possible the audience knows it’s computer generated and then becomes uninterested. I think it’s important to stay on the physical borders of what is real.Tim Webber, Director of VFX:It was totally important that the animation we did looked as much like practical effects as possible. That’s what Spike was after, he made it perfectly clear. One of the difficulties for example were the characters of Carol and K.W.; both had very large mouths which is difficult because characters with big mouths look like Muppets. Spike didn’t want that, he wanted humanistic, subtle emotion. Our starting point with them was the eyes – we hoped to distract viewers away from the mouths and focus on the eyes.Michael Eames, Animation Director:The single most unique challenge was the depth and level of the animation that was required. Most visual FX stuff is either creatures, or its cartoony animation, but with this — the intensity of the emotion that Spike was after was unique. He wanted audiences to be able to be able to feel the emotion and on a fairly human and subtle level, however unhuman the characters were. That was the hard bit — to get those thought processes on screen.Michael Eames, Animation Director:Spike would say things like: “That character is sounding quite confident here, but I want you to show in the eyes that they’re not quite as confident as they’re sounding.” There were layers of emotion and feeling going on he wanted to capture. I guess it’s also unusual for animated characters to have the sort of dialogue that the Wild Things have. It’s much more natural, and therefore they absolutely have to have that level of natural animation.He was really great to work with, and that’s not just the standard thing that everyone says in interviews. He was very exacting, he’d worked on this film for 5 years and he really, really knew what he wanted, and so that was quite a difficult target to hit. The thing with Spike is that everything he does is a little bit different, but actually he understood the process really well. It’s also pretty rare to work that closely with directors in visual effects. For a start you’re not normally creating 7 of the lead characters of a movie. This was a bit different in that sense; we needed that close interaction.Where the Wild Things Are is out now.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Tarantino, all-time, archives, The, anime, critic, transformers, Turner, Elton, TCA, drama, documentaries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-effects-of-where-the-wild-things-are"},{"id":"47613126761889","title":"Everything We Know About Toy Story 4","content":"Everything We Knowvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Everything We Know About Toy Story 4After a long wait, Woody, Buzz, Rex, and the toys are back for another story: See plot details, release dates, new characters, and more.by Whitney Friedlander | November 20, 2018 |  CommentsIn June 2019, Disney’s Pixar will head to infinity and beyond, once again, with the release of Toy Story 4. Although it will be nine years since the last film in the franchise, bringing back the family favorite characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and others will no doubt result in a box office smash that – if history repeats – will warm even the coldest critic’s heart (all three of the first Toy Story &nbsp;have perfect or near-perfect Tomatometers, and&nbsp;Toy Story 3 was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar). But surefire revenue and review predictions aside, what do we actually know about the new film? Let’s explore what’s already been&nbsp;revealed.HEY HOWDY HEY! SAY HI TO THE RETURNING CAST MEMBERS(Photo by © Walt Disney Pictures)Hanks and Allen are returning to rekindle the on-again/off-again bromance between their respective cowboy Woody and astronaut Buzz Lightyear, and the fourth Toy Story also welcomes back Joan Cusack as cowgirl Jessie, Wallace Shawn as Rex the dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as Hamm the piggy bank, Annie Potts as Woody’s main squeeze Bo Peep, Estelle Harris as Mrs. Potato Head, and more franchise favorites.Don Rickles, who played Mr. Potato Head in the first three films, passed away in April 2017 before he recorded any work for the new film. However, the character was seen in a teaser video released in November, suggesting that he is a part of the project in some way. A replacement voice actor has yet to be announced – if, in fact, someone is needed and the filmmakers won’t rely on Rickles’ unused dialogue from previous projects – but that hasn’t stopped the fan speculation.NEW CHARACTERS! NEW PLOT?That teaser also introduced a new character: Forky, a spork voiced by Veep’s Tony Hale. Although he started out as kitchenware, Forky’s found new life as a toy, thanks to the meddling hands of the young Bonnie (a.k.a. the little girl who inherited some of the toys from the now college-age Andy at the end of Toy Story 3). Needless to say, Forky’s not handling this life change well – especially when Woody and Buzz make him an unwitting participant in a road trip dedicated to the awesomeness of being a toy.Said adventure may also have something to do with tracking down Potts’ Bo Peep, who was absent from Toy Story 3. However, that plot detail was shared in 2015, and there have been some shifts at Pixar since then (see below for more on that).Another teaser trailer showcased the voices of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele as carnival toys Ducky and Bunny and who are pretty much plush versions of the&nbsp;valet characters the actors played in their Comedy Central sketch series, Key &amp; Peele. Perhaps Woody and Buzz’s joy ride includes a stop at a fair?During an appearance on NBC’s&nbsp;The Tonight Show, Allen told host Jimmy Fallon that Keanu Reeves also has a tiny part in the film.There’s also a viral fan theory that puts a rather … adult … spin on the definition of which toys are allowed to have stories. There are slim chances any of that will make it into the movie.TOY STORY 4 HAS GONE THROUGH DRAFTS LIKE SID GOES THROUGH MATCHES(Photo by @ Walt Disney Pictures)While promoting Toy Story 3, director Lee Unkrich – who also worked on the first and second film – said that, although he was flattered by the suggestion, there were no plans for a Toy Story 4 and that he always considered the third film to be “the conclusion to one big story.” Continuing that thought, Pixar president Jim Morris has stressed that the fourth film will be a “separate story.”But writing that story? That’s been its own saga. Andrew Stanton, who co-wrote the previous Toy Story films, among countless other projects, wrote a treatment for the film with then-Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, Unkrich, and fellow Pixar regular Pete Docter.Rashida Jones and Will McCormack were also attached as writers but departed the project. When Lasseter left his post last year in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations, the duo stressed to The New York Times that they respect Pixar’s films but “it is also a culture where women and people of color do not have an equal creative voice.”In June of 2018, Potts told Radio Times that Pixar “threw out three-quarters of [the script] and rewrote” it, thus resulting in the film being pushed a year from its original June 15, 2018 premiere date. Stephany Folsom, who previously worked on Thor: Ragnarok and is now penning the Michelle Williams abortion drama This is Jane, stepped in to write the screenplay.PIXAR FAV JOSH COOLEY LANDS HIS FIRST FEATURE DIRECTOR CREDITLasseter’s departure also means that he is no longer co-directing Toy Story 4 with Josh Cooley, as originally planned. Cooley, whose credits also include serving as story supervisor on Pixar’s Inside Out and directing the short Riley’s First Date?, which included some of that film’s characters, is now the sole director on the film. It’s also his first credit as a feature film director.TOY STORY&nbsp;STILL HAS A FRIEND IN RANDY NEWMAN(Photo by @ Walt Disney Pictures)Musician Newman has an Oscar for writing the original song “We Belong Together” for Toy Story 3 and has nominations for writing the songs “You’ve Got a Friend in Me” for Toy Story and “When She Loved Me” for Toy Story 2. So it’s a no-brainer that he’s back with more original music for this film.Toy Story 4 is in theaters June 21, 2019.#1Toy Story 4 (2019) 97%#1Adjusted Score: 116.691% Critics Consensus: Heartwarming, funny, and beautifully animated, Toy Story 4 manages the unlikely feat of extending -- and perhaps concluding -- a practically perfect animated saga.Synopsis: Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is...

But really, Penelope will always be Pedro’s girl. Since he cast her a decade ago in steamy drama Live Flesh, Spanish auteur Pedro Almodovar quickly adopted Cruz as his muse and leading lady of choice. No other director has been able to unleash and harness her sexuality, vulnerability and star power so fully. Casting Cruz as a would-be actress and call girl in tricksy tale of art and lies, Broken Embraces is her fourth movie with Almodovar. As Rotten Tomatoes chatted with her at Cannes 2009, we get the feeling it won’t be her last.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1202277[/tomatometer]Broken Embraces is your fourth film with Pedro Almodovar. What’s so special about working with him?Penelope Cruz: We have developed this working relationship and this friendship now for many years. He was the reason why I decided to become an actress, because of the admiration I felt for him.Do you and Pedro work on a character for a long time?PC: We rehearsed every day for three and a half months for Broken Embraces. I like having that time. Just to find things, to be able to make mistakes, to try different ways to do a scene.Do you drop everything when Pedro has a film role for you?PC: He always tells me many, many months before. Sometimes a year before. Then if I know he wants to shoot there and he wants me to do it, I just skip everything so I am free.You’re rocking an Audrey Hepburn look in this one. Is she an inspiration to you?PC: Yes, always. She was a great actress. She had a very special quality. She was magic, that woman.Is she your favourite actress?PC: My favourite actress is Meryl Streep. Oh, and Anna Magnani.Do you still want to work with Lars Von Trier?PC: Well, I haven’t seen Antichrist, but yes I still want to work with him!Cruz in Broken EmbracesDo you remember how you first broke into the movies?PC: It was for Jamon Jamon. I felt very surprised that I was getting yes as an answer for the first audition that I did. It was really the beginning of a big change in my life, because after that I stated working all the time.You’ve starred in everything from Westerns to sci-fi films. How do you decide whether to say yes to a role?PC: The script, the director, the role… You just have to feel as though you can do something with it. In order to make anybody else feel anything with that character, you have to feel something first.Do nude scenes and sex scenes bother you?PC: It’s difficult to answer. I have fear, always on the set. Insecurity to the point where the first week I always think I could be fired. I think that’s a fear most actors have. But Pedro can intimidate me more than anybody. Because I care so much about him and I don’t want to disappoint him.What has it been like since winning the Oscar for Vicky Cristina Barcelona?PC: I feel everything has gone very fast. And I need to take a few months or a year away from work. To really digest this whole adventure.Are you better at dealing with your nerves now?PC: No, I just get used to working while I’m nervous and insecure. It doesn’t change that much after the second week or the second month. It stays. It’s just a very, very exciting thing that has happened. I don’t know about the confidence![tomatometer]MuzeID=1202277[/tomatometer]Is it true that you take your Oscar everywhere with you?PC: No, not now. But I did it for three weeks, I took it everywhere with me. I even took it to the beach one day. Because I was so excited! I would wake up and look at it and say, ‘No, that’s not mine. How could this happen?’Is there something you always take with you when you travel?PC: My grandmother’s ring.You have your own production company. Are you working on some movies now?PC: Yes. But the things I am starting to develop, I don’t want to talk about them. Because they are still very green.Is there a biopic you’d love to tackle?PC: Yeah, there is one. That’s one of the projects that we are developing. But I won’t tell you it! Because then I feel like I am talking about it too soon instead of putting my energy into doing it.Do you find making movies exhausting?PC: Yeah, that’s why I’m not going to work for the rest of the year. I can make one a year. One movie a year. I’m going to work promoting this movie and promoting Nine. But I’m not going to shoot another movie.With Almodovar on set.Nine is the musical you’re doing next?PC: Yes, it’s a fresh and new thing, but it’s 100 percent inspired by 8 ½. The story is the same one of Guido and his creative crisis. I play Carla, the mistress of Daniel Day-Lewis. I think Daniel is going to be incredible in it.What made you want to do it?PC: I love this character. I can’t believe I got this role. I did five castings to get the movie, because of the dancing and the singing. I was a student of dance for many years, but Nine is the first time that I do a musical. It was a lot of fun, but it was scary also. Most of my scenes are with Daniel Day-Lewis. He’s incredible. Such a gentleman.Did you know that Pedro said you’re the only woman he’s ever thought of having a child with?PC: What?That’s what he said!PC: Because he says it to me and I think he’s joking. But then he says it to you! So… I think he was probably joking. But I don’t know. I will ask him again if he was joking. I mean, I know he’s joking… It’s Pedro!Broken Embraces hits UK cinemas today.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"media, Pictures, Superheroes, Pacific, video, MSNBC, Christmas, Movies, Crackle, leads, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"penelope-cruz-talks-broken-embraces-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613150310829","title":"RT on DVD: Gran Torino, Crossing Over, Nobel Son Exclusive Look","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Gran Torino, Crossing Over, Nobel Son Exclusive LookSee what's new this week on DVD and Blu-ray!by Jen Yamato | June 8, 2009 |  CommentsThis week on DVD, celebrate the big screen heroics of two former movie heroes (Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino, Harrison Ford in Crossing Over) or watch Clive Owen and Naomi Watts do battle with an evil bank (Tom Tykwer’s The International). If comedy is more your style, you can go low-brow (the cheerleading comedy Fired Up!) or worse: direct to DVD (the bowling comedy Strike! starring Tara Reid). Take a gamble on a twisty, stylized thriller about kidnapping and dysfunctional families (Nobel Son, starring Eliza Dushku and Alan Rickman) or take your chances with a critically panned race drama (Spinning into Butter, starring Sarah Jessica Parker). What’ll it be?Gran Torino —80%A crabby old man comes to terms with his racial insensitivities (and comes to blows with a local gang of thugs) in Gran Torino, a film that showed us not only that director-producer Clint Eastwood still has it, but also that even a septuagenarian can be a shotgun-wielding antihero in the 21st century. Eastwood stars as the grizzled war veteran Walt Kowalski, a widower who develops a tenuous friendship with the Hmong family that lives next door while defending them from a local gang. Despite dipping into tongue-in-cheek comedy, this violent melodrama works on the sheer strength of Eastwood’s performance; catch Eastwood relaying his own Gran Torino experience on a Blu-ray-exclusive special feature.Next: Harrison Ford in Crossing OverCrossing Over —11%Speaking of old men, Crossing Over stars Harrison Ford in Wayne Kramer‘s mishmash of a melodramatic tale about people from all walks of life (illegally) seeking the American Dream. As a Los Angeles immigration agent, Ford stumbles across — or, as always in this type of familiar LA tale, crashes into — one illegal immigrant after another, from a desperate deported mother (Alice Braga) to a British musician (Across the Universe‘s Jim Sturgess) and his Australian girlfriend (Alice Eve) who herself is sleeping with an ICE officer in exchange for legal status (Ray Liotta). Then you’ve got the Bangladeshi student (Summer Bishil), the Korean kid (Twilight‘s Justin Chon), an irate Iranian (Cliff Curtis), and Ashley Judd. Critics pummeled the heavy-handed drama, which director Kramer and studio execs notoriously squabbled over; no special features are included in the disc.Next: Fired Up: raunchy but watchable?Fired Up! —28%When two high school jocks decide to chase girls all the way to cheerleader camp one summer, does hilarity ensue? That depends on your tolerance for well meaning-but-flat jokes, as critics decreed that Fired Up! tries hard but ultimately fails to capture anything but raunchy, formulaic comedy. With rated-R gags reworked to fit into a PG-13 rating, Fired Up! might appeal to those who snicker at sex jokes and the name Freedom Jones (which is the apparently made-up person credited with the film’s script); a generous helping of funny bonus features and an audio commentary by director Will Gluck and actors Nicholas D’Agostino and Eric Christian Olsen actually make this a watchable, if juvenile, DVD offering. After all, what do those initials spell?Next: Clive Owen battles an evil bank in The InternationalThe International —58%Dancing close to the edge of Freshness, this Clive Owen–Naomi Watts thriller is the perfect movie to watch on DVD — you know, the kind of flick that you pass over in theaters and figure you’ll see eventually. Director Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola, Run) injects his signature frenetic energy into the story of an Interpol agent (Owen) and a NYC district attorney (Watts) trying to take down a global financial conglomerate. And in these tough economic times, who can’t relate to fighting back against a villainous bank? While some of the story unfolds rather slowly, one show-stopping set piece shootout in the middle of the Guggenheim museum will leave you breathless. See how they did it in one of a handful of featurettes, which accompany a single deleted scene, filmmaker commentary, and more.Next: Strike bowls a gutter ballStrike— N/AHave you been wondering where Tara Reid, Robert Carradine, and Robyn Lively had disappeared to? We found them all in this direct-to-DVD sports comedy, about a slacker actor who flirts with fame and fortune as a professional bowler, only to destroy his personal relationships in the process. It’s a comedy, see? Unfortunately, we’ve seen this formula before (remember Kingpin?) and with a lower budget and newbie filmmakers at the helm, it doesn’t even come close to striking gold — more like a turkey, but not the good kind.Next: Sarah Jessica Parker Spinning a clunkerSpinning Into Butter — 17%Sarah Jessica Parker toplines this misfire adapted from Rebecca Gilman’s celebrated 1999 play of the same name, but the success of said original play might just be what’s wrong with the film. Director Mark Brokaw seems to cater too much to the play’s stagey plotting, and the result is a stilted, forced meditation on racism and denial. Parker stars as Sarah Daniels, Dean of Students at a liberal Vermont college who takes it upon herself to champion a campus forum to discuss race relations in the mostly white campus community; as tensions rise, the cast of one-dimensional characters take their turn atop the cinematic soapbox in an attempt to confront the ugliness of prejudice head on, though Brokaw’s ineffective direction and a monologue-driven script make for a painful movie watching experience. Next: An exclusive look at Eliza Dushku in Nobel SonNobel Son — 25%The makers of this indie thriller describe it as having “so many twists it could make David Mamet blush,” to which we ask, would that really be a good thing? Bryan Greenburg (One Tree Hill) stars as Barkley Michaelson, the nerdy PhD student son of a brilliant, if terrible, Nobel Prize-winning scientist (Alan Rickman). When Barkley scores a date with a hot poet named City Hall (Eliza Dushku), it seems like his night’s off to a great start — that is, until he’s kidnapped by Shawn Hatosy, tortured, and held for a ransom that his father refuses to pay. Lots of twists, turns, and cannibalism come into play in the over-stylized thriller, which also features appearances by Danny DeVito, Mary Steenburgen, Ted Danson, Bill Pullman, and Ernie Hudson.Next: The ’70s will never die as long as you have Woodstock on DVD/Blu-ray!Woodstock 40th Anniversary Director’s Cut — 100%Hippies old and new should take a look at the 40th Anniversary Director’s Cut of this seminal rock documentary, which captured the three-day 1969 love fest in upstate New York that served as a touchstone for an entire generation. The newly remastered version of director Michael Wadleigh’s film — edited by the likes of Martin Scorsese and Thelma Schoonmaker — also contains an extra hour of never before seen concert footage and is a must-own for former flower children and fans of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Jefferson Airplane, and the 20-odd musical performers who took the stage. Blu-ray owners have the added benefit of building interactive playlists that can be shared with other BD viewers.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Mudbound, Epix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Gran-Torino-Crossing-Over-Nobel-Son-Exclusive-Look"},{"id":"47613170265526","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Cloudy with a Chance of The Final Destination","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Cloudy with a Chance of The Final DestinationPlus, a couple of surf/skate docs, indie flicks, and Elvis doing karate.by RT Staff | January 4, 2010 |  CommentsThe new year is here, everyone, and with it comes another week of new releases on home video. Many of the most anticipated films have already come out on DVD and/or Blu-Ray, and the few remaining films in that category will be released in the coming weeks. For this week, however, this means our choices are somewhat tame again. For starters, we’ve got a surprisingly well-received animated children’s book adaptation and the last installment (so they say) in a horror franchise, as well as a few indie films that flew beneath the mainstream radar. Then we’ve got a few Blu-Ray reissues of some beloved older films, and one oddball choice profiling the martial arts antics of the King of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Read on for full details![tomatometer]MuzeID=1196077[/tomatometer]Cloudy with a Chance of MeatballsSony Pictures Animation has had a couple of big screen successes with its 2006 debut, Monster House, and 2007’s Surf’s Up. Earlier this year, they proved they had what it takes to stand out in the growing field of computer animated films when their most recent offering, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, became their highest rated release yet, earning an 85% on the Tomatometer on the way to Certified Fresh status. The story focuses on an aspiring inventor, Flint Lockwood (voiced by SNL’s Bill Hader), who succeeds in manipulating the weather so that food falls from the sky. Things go awry, of course, and it’s up to Flint and his weather girl love interest, Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), to figure out what’s really going on and put a stop to it. Critics largely felt the film was fun, quirky, and humorous enough to appeal to a wide variety of ages, as well as visually impressive. You can pick it up on DVD or Blu-Ray this week.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1207470[/tomatometer]The Final DestinationDo you like grisly, gruesome, ironic movie deaths? Yeah? Well, do you think you’d like them more…… if they were in three dimensions? That’s right, kiddies: critics say The Final Destination offers all the gore of the previous three installments, with the same amount of character development (zero) and quotable dialogue (again, zero). But this time around, all the deadly fatalities are comin’ atcha! (Oh, wait… the 3-D stuff only works on Blu-ray = which also includes a making of featurette and two alternate endings.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=10011022[/tomatometer]Fifty Dead Men WalkingAnother smallish film that went largely unnoticed this year was Fifty Dead Men Walking, which neither stars Sean Penn as a death row inmate nor features any zombies, as some might mistakenly assume the title to imply. This indie thriller centers around the civil conflict in Ireland during the late 80s and one man, Martin McGartland (21‘s Jim Sturgess), who was an undercover informant within the IRA. The film benefited from strong performances both from its lead and from supporting turns by Ben Kingsley and Rose McGowan, and it managed to earn Certified Fresh status with an 86% Tomatometer rating. For a crime drama on the road less traveled, you could do much worse.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1203312[/tomatometer]TruckerPlenty of actors and actresses pick out tiny independent films with quirky or rough hewn characters to make a mark they can’t really make in the soft and fluffy romcoms that pad their resumes (and bank accounts). After Michelle Monaghan was handpicked for her role in Shane Black’s Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang she seemed destined for big things-and she did have some classically Oscar-built supporting stints in North County and Gone Baby Gone thereafter. Technically those parts did get her bigger roles but in softer genre flix like Made of Honor. Crammed into the middle of this tennis match of a resume is Trucker, a low profile prestige item that hangs its drama on multiple standout performances, and though critics were mixed on it as a whole — many felt it was an overwrought collection of indie clichés — Monaghan herself won almost universal praise for her role. The DVD features a behind-the-scenes slideshow and footage of Monaghan in preparation for her role.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1172536[/tomatometer]The Hip Hop ProjectWith a likely bit of support from rap mogul Russell Simmons and an unlikely hand from actor Bruce Willis, The Hip Hop Project charts the growth of two talented singer/songwriters: Cannon and Princess. Their obstacles are harrowing but their support system is determined. Critics said that, while the story is touching, the film isn’t particularly inventive and the music is fairly middle-of-the-road too, but for fans of the live-the-dream doc or fans of hip hop, it’s uplifting. DVD is pretty spare, boasting a few sound options and subtitles.Battlestar Galactica: Season 1By now, most are familiar with this reboot of the classic television series; it garnered widespread critical acclaim for its portrayal of real-life issues set in a distant future… in space. After recently ending its run last March and releasing its companion piece, The Plan, on home video in October, the series is now finally releasing its first season on Blu-Ray. For those of you who missed out on all the hoopla the first time around, now’s your chance to catch up on the hottest sci-fi series to hit television in recent memory. The Blu-Ray is a four-disc set that includes all episodes from the first season, as well as lots of bonus features like episode commentaries, deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and an extra titled Battlestar Galactica Series Lowdown, featuring interviews with cast members.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088599[/tomatometer]Ten Things I Hate About YouSaddened fans everywhere more than likely revisited this teen movie gem sometime around two years ago when up-and-coming Australian actor Heath Ledger tragically passed away. Ledger played the romantic lead, Patrick Verona, in a modern interpretation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew, starring alongside Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Many saw early potential in Ledger, who was dashing and charming here in his star-making role. Overall, critics were somewhat lukewarm on the film, but for many, this represented some of the most entertaining teen cinema to come out of the 90s. This week, it’s available in a new two-disc special edition and, for the first time, on Blu-Ray.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1133970[/tomatometer]Riding Giants and Dogtown and Z-Boys – Blu-RayAlright, my fellow beach bums and California natives, these are the Blu-Rays you’ve been waiting for. Skateboard mogul-cum-documentary filmmaker Stacy Peralta made a couple of rousing documentaries in the early 2000s that clearly demonstrated his passion for surfing and skating. 2002’s Dogtown and Z-Boys and 2004’s Riding Giants were two of the most lovingly crafted pics about skating and surfing culture, respectively, and his affection for the subject matter shone through each production, earning Dogtown a Certified Fresh 91% and Giants a Certified Fresh 92%. Profiling the history of each sport, moving through their early development and culminating in modern times, Peralta focuses on famous figures and dramatic stories to inspire the same sort of awe that bystanders likely felt when witnessing them for the first time. Now that they’re both available on Blu-Ray this week, you can experience all the glory again in high definition.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1130898[/tomatometer]Dawn of the Dead (2004)Capitalizing on what was fast becoming a rebirth of interest in the zombie flick, Zack Snyder (that’s “visionary director Zack Snyder” to you Watchmen fans out there) took a stab at remaking a horror classic, namely George Romero’s original 1978 Dawn of the Dead. Did it succeed? Most would argue that it had a lot to live up to, what with the original currently rated at 95% on the Tomatometer, but Snyder’s vision for the film seemed to work for most audiences, and it managed to secure a healthy, Certified Fresh 76% Tomatometer score of its own. Critics felt that the reimagining of the film was fun in most of the right ways, sufficiently suspenseful, and gory when it needed to be (and sometimes more). Now available on Blu-Ray, you’ll get to pick the flaws out of the zombies’ makeup in high definition, so that’s always a plus.Elvis Presley Gladiators: The 1974 Elvis Karate Legacy ProjectHere’s a little item that might come in handy at your next trivia game. Back in the late 50s, Elvis joined the Army, and he was then introduced to the martial arts discipline of Karate. The King went on to study karate for several years, and even got into an onstage tussle with concertgoers. This documentary film seeks to chronicle those little known days of Presley’s life, and the DVD comes with lots of interesting little features, like some raw footage of Elvis, an interview with Wayne Carmen, who worked with Elvis for three years, a photo gallery, and 6 postcards of Elvis decked out in karate gear.Written by Tim Ryan, Sara Schieron, and Ryan Fujitani","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cars, Fox, Adventures, Plus, and, Mindy, scene, New, WarnerMedia, HBO, Drama, PaleyFest, Avengers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Cloudy-with-a-Chance-of-The-Final-Destination"},{"id":"47613145199018","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: 127 Hours and Love and Other Drugs","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: 127 Hours and Love and Other DrugsPlus, an action flick, a music doc, and another Disney classic.by | March 1, 2011 |  CommentsIn the wake of the Oscars last night, our top two entries for this week’s column feature the co-hosts of the festivities, James Franco and Anne Hathaway. Unfortunately, while Franco’s film was a multiple Academy Award nominee (including a Best Actor nod for Franco himself), Hathaway’s film… Well, let’s just say her film didn’t impress critics as much. After that, we’ve got the latest actioner headlined by Dwayne Johnson, a music doc about one of LA’s prominent clubs, a musical featuring Cher and Christina Aguilera, and a certain Disney classic about an orphaned deer. See below to check out this week’s new releases!127 Hours 93%This timely release comes on the heels of the Oscars, where the film was nominated for six awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, and a Best Actor nod for its star (and co-host of the evening’s festivities) James Franco. Directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire), 127 Hours tells the remarkable real life story of outdoorsman Aron Ralston, who embarked on a canyoneering trip in Utah in 2003. While he was passing through a narrow passage, a boulder broke free and trapped him within the canyon, pinning his right arm against the rock wall and beginning a five-day struggle to survive. 127 Hours was a hit with critics, who called it equally gut-wrenching and inspirational and praised Franco’s performance in particular. It didn?t come home with any Oscars on Sunday, but it did receive a Certified Fresh 93% Tomatometer, so if you missed it when it was in theaters, here’s your second chance. Be forewarned, though: there are some scenes that are not for the faint of heart.Love and Other Drugs 49%And here we have the latest film from the other co-host of the Oscars, Anne Hathaway; this one, however, wasn’t nominated for any of the awards. Starring alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, a smooth-talking pharmaceutical salesman (and womanizer) named Jamie, Hathaway plays Maggie Murdock, a woman with early onset Parkinson’s disease who proves to be a wit-for-wit match for Jamie. The two begin a casual, sex-based relationship, but eventually they fall in love and must deal with the consequences. Directed by Ed Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai), Love and Other Drugs failed to impress critics very much, earning just a 49% Tomatometer. The film suffered from a lack of narrative focus, and despite striking many as a refreshingly adult romance, the lack of balance between its plot elements ultimately was its undoing. If you’re fan of the stars, or just a fan of seeing them without their clothes on, this’ll be perfect for you.Faster 42%Dwayne Johnson seems to have been focused on family films and comedies as of late, with roles in The Tooth Fairy, Get Smart, and The Other Guys. In fact, he hasn’t been in a proper action movie since 2005’s Doom. So, in some ways, it was refreshing to see him step back into his tough guy shoes for Faster, a revenge flick about a recently released ex-con (Johnson) who must dodge both the police and a hitman while he seeks retribution for those responsible for the death of his brother. Unfortunately, critics felt that the film’s leaps in logic were a bit much to bear, and the story was riddled with too many subplots that distract from the issue at hand. As such, it’s got a 45% Tomatometer score, and it may satisfy those looking for some cheap action thrills, but it probably won’t do much more than that.Troubadours 64%Troubadours is a rock doc that definitely does not go to 11. Instead, it’s a celebratory look at a key moment in American pop ? specifically, the mellow, introspective singer/songwriter movement that coalesced around the famed L.A. club the Troubadour. James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Carole King, Jackson Browne and a bunch of other mellow rock luminaries are on hand to offer fond anecdotes about the time and the scene; if critics had a nit to pick with Troubadours, it’s that this amiable talking-heads portrait doesn’t go much deeper than surface level. However, fans of the music will be in heaven, and the DVD set comes with a bonus CD with cuts from Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Waits, and 2011 Oscar winner Randy Newman, among others.Burlesque 36%On paper, Burlesque must have looked like high-camp heaven. Cher and Christina Aguilera star class up a plot that’s older than dirt: a small-town girl goes to the big city, falls under the wing of an old showbiz pro, and becomes a star. Unfortunately, critics savaged the film, calling it a cliché-ridden mess lacking the kind of showstopping musical numbers needed to overcome the predictability of the plot. Still, if you’re in the mood for some old-school razzle dazzle, you could probably do worse, since they don’t make movies like Burlesque anymore, for good or ill. The DVD features a bunch of making-of featurettes, director’s commentary, a blooper reel, an alternate opening, and videos of the movies musical sequences.Bambi – Two-Disc Diamond Edition 90%Generations of children have been traumatized by Bambi. Now, with a sparkling new Bambi Blu-Ray, you and your family can experience the most horrifying mommy shooting in movie history — in high definition! Seriously, though, Bambi is yet another jewel in Disney’s crown, a beautiful, charming, and at times achingly sad perennial that continues to amaze nearly 70 years after its original release. Briskly paced, with plenty of adorable characters, Bambi may fall a notch or two below Snow White or Fantasia in the Mouse House cannon, but it’s a remarkable entertainment nonetheless. The Blu-Ray is chock full of goodies as well, including a making-of doc, deleted scenes, a look at some Disney artwork from the vault, a short film of Uncle Walt explaining the filming techniques, and a Silly Symphony animated short from 1937.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Skip","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-127-Hours-and-Love-and-Other-Drugs"},{"id":"47613147132331","title":"Awards Tour: 2010 People’s Choice Awards Winners!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour: 2010 People's Choice Awards Winners!Find out who won when the power went to the people!by RT Staff | January 6, 2010 |  CommentsGiving entertainment fans a place to vote for some of the biggest names and properties in pop culture, this year’s People’s Choice Awards delivered a diverse list of nominees across movies, television, and music.

There were some disappointments, but plenty of movies to get excited about, and RT was there for the whole festival checking out the best Cannes had to offer. So what’s worth keeping an eye on? Join us as we take a visual journey through the 10 Cannes films you absolutely have to see.Broken Embraces – Most critics agreed that director Pedro Almodovar was on fine form with his latest, which stars Penelope Cruz. “Fans of Almodovar will get plenty of what they expect here – rich saturated colours, hyper plotting, stylistic pyrotechnics and off-centre comedy,” said Barry Byrne of Screen International. David Gritten summarized the film nicely by saying, “while [Almodovar’s] new film parades his many virtues, it treads water rather than breaks new ground.”Find Out MoreDrag Me to Hell – As we write, Sam Raimi‘s return to horror is at 100% on the Tomatometer with 16 reviews in the bank. It’s “A visceral assault on the senses and will have you gasping for breath as the laughs and scares mount,” says Chris Tilly of IGN, while Peter Debruge of Variety is happy to celebrate the film’s flaws. “Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience’s buttons, and who better than Raimi to do the honors?”Find Out MoreFish Tank – Andrea Arnold came to Cannes in 2006 with her debut feature, Red Road, not long after winning an Oscar for her short. Then, she won the jury prize, an award she collected again this year for Fish Tank. “Powerful, punishing, funny and beautifully observed, it’s driven by a stunning performance from non-pro newcomer Katie Jarvis,” writes Jonathan Crocker in Little White Lies. Dave Calhoun agrees in Time Out that it’s “a very strong film — one that’s utterly gripping and always surprising.”Find Out MoreI Love You Phillip Morris – Playing in the Director’s Fortnight section of the festival, this Sundance hit stars Ewan McGregor and Jim Carrey and shocked and delighted critics in equal measure. It’s a “funny, sometimes tender and ultimately unsettling black comedy,” says Damon Wise in Empire. “The direction is more than adept,” says John Anderson for Variety. “Many of the laughs erupt at the end of scenes, as Carrey or McGregor toss off some seemingly random line, and it sticks.”Find Out MoreLooking for Eric – Ken Loach won the Palme d’Or when he was last in Cannes with The Wind That Shakes the Barley in 2006. Lightning didn’t strike twice in a row, but there was much love for his latest, which some claim is his most accessible yet. “When it works, Eric has many incidental pleasures,” says Derek Elley in Variety. James Christopher agrees. “Ken Loach couldn’t have painted a more perfect, bitter-sweet picture for Cannes.”Find Out MorePrecious – Surely the festival’s greatest surprise. Precious, based on the novel Push by Saffire, casts Mariah Carey, Lenny Kravitz and Mo’Nique in key roles and is still most memorable for its performances, with many tipping the latter for Oscars. It’s “a must-see portrait of life’s underprivileged which is utterly compelling,” writes Mike Goodridge of Screen International. He adds that a debut performance from the lead, Gabourey Sidibe, “is one of the most electrifying debuts in years.”Find Out MoreA Prophet – Critics raved for Jacques Audiard‘s latest, about a young prisoner swept into the world of organized crime. The film “works both as hard-edged, painstaking detailed social realism and as a compelling genre entertainment,” says Jonathan Romney in Screen International. Damon Wise in Empire says it’s “an astonishingly detailed crime drama that could end up being this year’s Gomorra, although it’s arguably more accessible.”Find Out MoreUp – Few doubted that Pixar’s latest could be an instant classic, but that doesn’t mean the result is any less impressive — at 26 reviews as we write, it’s 100% fresh. “a rare, wondrous story of true love and dream-catching,” writes Jonathan Crocker in Little White Lies. “Of holding on and letting go. You will believe a house can fly.” “Per usual, the nuances of human relationships are conveyed via Pixar’s predictably acute attention to detail, coded in a mysterious evocation of mood,” writes Ed Gonzalez for Slant.Find Out MoreThe White Ribbon – It wasn’t without reason that Michael Haneke‘s film took home this year’s Palme d’Or — it was one of the festival’s best. Todd McCarthy argued it was, “a difficult film to embrace,” a sentiment shared by many critics of the film’s tough subject matter. But he added that the narrative, “goes beyond its general analysis of humanity to implicitly suggest some tendencies in the German character and culture that could point to certain developments in the subsequent three decades.”Find Out MoreAntichrist – Lars von Trier‘s controversial latest may not be as well reviewed as the other nine films on our list, but it earns its place for the sheer love-it-or-hate-it lengths it goes to in provoking a reaction from its audience. “What Lars is driving at is something completely bizarre, massively uncommercial and strangely perfect,” writes Damon Wise for Empire, while Todd McCarthy argues for Variety that, “Lars von Trier cuts a big fat art-film fart, as if deliberately courting critical abuse.” Clearly one not to miss.Find Out MoreCatch up on all of our Cannes coverage right here.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"richard, killer, Signature, First, binge, cancelled, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"cannes-2009-rts-10-mustsee-movies"},{"id":"47613156409775","title":"Whip It Good: Our Favorite Rollerskating Jams","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Whip It Good: Our Favorite Rollerskating JamsDrew Barrymore's grrrl-power roller-derby film sent us back to the rink -- and the roller disco -- to pick some of the most memorable movie moments on eight wheelsby Michael Adams | October 1, 2009 |  CommentsAs Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka so eloquently put it: “If the good lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn’t have invented roller skates.” Indeed. Yet while this week’s Drew Barrymore-directed, grrrl-powered roller-derby film Whip It is garnering positive critical buzz, it’s only the latest in a — who would have guessed? — surprisingly long (if decidedly checkered) line of on-screen roller-skating jams to have touched wheels to the cement and the rink. Don’t believe us? Here then are some of the greatest, the shoddiest and the plain old weirdest of them — as we proceed to whip it, and whip it good…Rollerball (1975)In just nine years from now — 2018! — corporations rule a world pacified via the televised spectacle of… Rollerball! It’s a game in which company teams take to a circular track on skates and motorbikes and bash all kinds of hell out of each other as they try to get a metal ball into a magnetized goal. The brutal sport has been secretly designed to demonstrate the futility of individuality but, of course, one man has risen to become a global champion. And that man is Jonathan E and he refuses to retire, even when the powers-that-be revise the game’s rules — or lack thereof — with the intention of killing him. Norman Jewison’s flick features James Caan at his mid-’70s toughest amid some crunching action, terrific use of Bach’s Toccata and a dark vision of capitalism’s end-run around liberty. Why oh why did they have to remake it so badly in 2002?Xanadu / Can’t Stop The Music (1980)What was in the air — or the water — in 1980 that it gave us two legendarily camp movie musicals, both of which feature roller-skating interludes? Choosing the worst ain’t easy. In Xanadu we get Olivia Newton-John as the all-singing, all-dancing muse who’s never happier than when she’s skating ethereally around LA’s boardwalks and disused auditoria — or through dry ice smoke. And there’s Gene Kelly, in his last, er, roll, zipping along, and tap-dancing to, er, boot. (Kelly had done it before in the far classier 1955’s It’s Always Fair Weather — watch the clip below.) The Village People vehicle Can’t Stop the Music, meanwhile, features the ghastly spectacle of Steve Guttenberg trying — emphasis on trying — to roller-skate through Manhattan. And then, later, Bruce Jenner gets in on the roller-action.Boogie Nights (1997)It was great to see Heather Graham so well cast in The Hangover this year because too often the beautiful actress is seen wallowing in the likes of Killing Me Softly or Miss Conception. But arguably her best-ever performance, and one that provided a rare combination of her comedic and dramatic talents, was as “Rollergirl” in Paul Thomas Anderson’s towering porn-world epic Boogie Nights. Bubbly, sexy, innocent, crazy, dangerous — she projected it all, and often on rollerskates. Don’t try this at home, or in the dome.Roller Boogie (1979)Linda Blair (moving from Hell’s minion to Hell on wheels) and Jim Bray (former competitive skater) star alongside Beverly Garland (B-movie actress best known for It Conquered The World) for director Mark L. Lester (Class of 1984, Commando) in this tale of roller-skating kids in love who just want to roller boogie in the Roller Boogie competition, except for that dastardly developer who wants to knock down their Roller Rink! At the end, Linda Blair goes off to New York (in reality, she’d head into decades of schlock), Jim Bray goes to the Olympics (he couldn’t because he’d ended his amateur status by doing this movie) and 50 or so extras used here got ready to don the skates again for Xanadu, shot in many of the same Venice locations. What’s terrific about this is the roller-skating breakdancing on the rink, a couple years before the trend really took off in the mainstream. What’s less terrific is Cher’s song from the film, “Hell on Wheels”.The Muppets Take Manhattan (1984)In the annals of roller-skating, it’d seem that while Los Angeles wins out, thanks to its board walks and more laidback vibe and skater history, Manhattan has its share of stellar sequences. And none are more stellar than Miss Piggy strapping on some borrowed skates in Central Park to chase down a mugger who has stolen her purse. Her flying through the park to take him down is up there with the work seen in Unholy Rollers. Hiiiiyaaar! And no, Miss Piggy was not harmed in the shooting of this scene. The long shots are a human stunt double. In case it wasn’t, you know, really obvious.Unholy Rollers (1972)Think Whip It, if it’d been made by Paul Verhoeven. Former Playboy playmate Claudia Jennings is cat-food worker Karen who, following sexual harassment, makes ends meet by becoming a star roller-derby babe. Anticipating Jonathan E., she’s no team player, and, predating Nomi Malone by two decades, she uses her rising status to take down her lesbian nemesis. It goes without saying that this features plenty of gratuitous nudity and includes a skate rink strip and sex scene. Sadly, the gorgeous Ms Jennings would die before the decade was out, killed in an auto accident. Executive producer Roger Corman, however, would go on and on like the Duracell Bunny. We hope this one’s is included in the clip montage next year when he’s presented his lifetime achievement Oscar by Martin Scorsese…Kansas City Bomber (1972)Who knew 1972 was such a banner year for roller derby flicks? While the title sounds like a terrorist-stalks-a-city plot also popular at the time, it actually refers to Raquel Welch, whose character K.C. is, as the poster puts it, “the hottest thing on wheels”. In a deviation from other roller-skating epics, in this one K.C. is encouraged to be a star and supposedly it’s the fans you gotta look out for. That said, a lot of the movie’s taken up with in competition and out-of-game smack downs between girls, guys, team members and adversaries. The rivalry between K.C. and Jackie (played by Helena Kallianiotis, who was Golden Globe nominated for Best Supporting Actress — whip that, Drew!) though, has to be resolved (after an awesome punch in the face) by a “match race”. It sounds quite civil but, with its high-kicking, gut-punching and hair-flailing, it’s a bitch fight for the ages! A couple of quick questions, though: did Will Ferrell time travel to play the referee? And is that Sasquatch with the number 25 jersey on?Modern Times (1936)Charlie Chaplin had taken to the roller skates before in 1916’s The Rink (see below), but his crowning moment on the little wheels came in this classic. He and Paulette Goddard don the skates in the fourth floor toy room of a department store and he glides around ever-so-gracefully, blindfolded, right next to a precipice, while gorgeous gamin’ Goddard stumbles around trying to warn him. It’s classic. And still hair-raising! The effect, however, was created using a matte, so there was actually no huge drop and no risk to the actor. His blindfold, meanwhile, was a see-through mesh. But he did all the skating himself — devoting a whopping eight days to the short scene.Leprechaun (1992)A year before she became America’s Sweetheart on Friends, Jennifer Aniston made her movie debut in this low-budget cult horror comedy, which stars Warwick Davis in the title role. What’s weirdest about this story of one little Irish monster’s quest for his treasure (“I want me gold… now!”) are the remarkable modes of transportation he uses. You’ll find him zipping around on a kid’s tricycle, a wheelchair and a go-kart, and bouncing up and down on a pogo stick until he spears it through a dude’s chest. The horrible little beast eventually also gets around to roller skates, careening down a road, arms flailing, until he crashes into a white picket fence — leaving a Leprechaun-shaped hole, of course.Roller Blade (1986)Set in an alternative-universe post-apocalypse, this has the sometimes nude, always rollerskating nuns of the holy order of Roller Blade (no, we’re not making this up) infiltrated by the sexy — and roller-skating — minion of evil sock puppet Dr Saticoy. And then there’s Marshall Goodman, goodly skate cowboy, who’s trying to teach his son the ways of the little wheels. Soft-core girl-girl porn and Zen philosophy collide in the first of numerous weirdy-beardy roller-skating epics from the late, great Z-grade filmmaker Donald G. Jackson.Heaven’s Gate (1980)We’re not about to rewrite cinematic history by arguing Michael Cimino’s legendary flop is some sort of neglected masterpiece. True, it’s beautifully shot and the production design is wonderful, but it’s also tedious beyond belief in places. That said, the roller-skating scene is technically wicked. Acid-wit Joe Queenan, calling Heaven’s Gate the worst film ever made in The Guardian last year, also wrote: “This is a movie that has five minutes of uninterrupted fiddle-playing by a fiddler who is also mounted on roller skates.”Fletch (1985)That State of Play didn’t set the box-office on fire earlier this year probably had a lot to do with the fact that Russell Crowe didn’t go about his journalistic business with a series of wacky pseudonyms and disguises — and rollerskates. It certainly worked for Chevy Chase as Fletch. During this highpoint of his comic career, he introduces himself as Harry S. Truman, Igor Stravinsky and Don Corleone, not to mention Dr Rosenpenis/Rosenrosen and John Cocktolstone, and poses as a big-toothed aircraft mechanic and IRS geek. But Fletch’s most outrageous impersonation is Baba au Rum, a bald but bearded roller-skating beach hippie in long flowing robes.Derby (1971)Think Whip It, if it’d been made by Michael Moore. This is about Mike Snell, tire-factory worker who aspires to be a roller derby champion, and others who play the sport. While there’s plenty of roller derby action, it soon gives way to an intense, raw depiction of the American working class in the early 1970s. Read Roger Ebert’s review from back in the day and see if it doesn’t make you thankful the DVD was released earlier this year.Bonus absurdity:Prayer of the Rollerboys (1990)Okay, we know this one’s all about roller-blading, but we couldn’t resist. For those of you wondering what became of Corey Haim’s career, might we direct you to this 1990 futuristic actioner — a future in which, as the tagline reminds us: “it’s gonna take one man and his blades to save the world from another man…and HIS blades.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"female, Shudder, Swim, on, spinoff, 45, dramedy, Mudbound, Unbreakable","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"whip-it-good-our-favorite-rollerskating-jams"},{"id":"47613154568622","title":"Saturday Night Live Stars on the Big Screen","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Saturday Night Live Stars on the Big Screenby RT Staff | September 26, 2014 |  CommentsSaturday Night Live celebrates the premiere of its 40th season this weekend, and to celebrate, we’ve compiled a list of critically-acclaimed films featuring SNL alums. The movies listed here aren’t necessarily the best or the best-reviewed movies from these stars; rather, we wanted to give a sense of the range and versatility of the not-ready-for-primetime players. Featuring those who rose to prominence during their time on the show (Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Kristin Wiig) and a few you may have forgotten about (Robert Downey Jr., Julia Louis-Dreyfus), our list is a testament to SNL‘s continuing relevance as an incubator for some of the entertainment world’s brightest talents.Adventureland 89%Full of humor and nostalgia, and featuring wry supporting turns by Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, Adventureland is a sweet, insightful coming-of-age comedy that will resonate with teens and adults alike.Best in Show 93%A fine example of writer-director-star Christopher Guest’s gift for improv comedy, Best in Show boasts an appealingly quirky premise and a brilliantly talented cast.Bridesmaids 90%A marriage of genuine characters, gross out gags, and pathos, Bridesmaids is a female-driven comedy features star-making performances from Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph.City Slickers 90%With a supremely talented cast (led by Billy Crystal) and just enough midlife drama to add weight to its wildly silly overtones, City Slickers uses universal themes to earn big laughs.Elf 85%A movie full of Yuletide cheer, Elf is a spirited, good-natured family comedy, and it benefits greatly from Will Ferrell’s funny and charming performance as one of Santa’s biggest helpers.Enough Said 95%Wryly charming, impeccably acted, and ultimately quite bittersweet, Enough Said is a grown-up movie in the best possible way, and it offers a chance to see Julia Louis-Dreyfus play an intriguingly complex character.48 Hrs. 93%Marking an auspicious feature film debut for Eddie Murphy, 48 Hrs. is a briskly paced action comedy that succeeds largely due to the outstanding chemistry between its two leads.Ghostbusters 97%An infectiously fun blend of special effects and comedy, Ghostbusters derives many of its biggest laughs from Bill Murray’s hilarious deadpan wit and Dan Aykroyd’s enthusiastic geekiness.God Said, Ha! 86%God Said, Ha! plumbs poignant depths, but Julia Sweeney’s sharp, graceful wit makes this one-woman monologue a wise, big-hearted burst of uplifting — and perhaps therapeutic — entertainment.Good Hair 95%Funny, informative, and occasionally sad, Chris Rock’s Good Hair is a provocative look at the complex relationship between African Americans and their hair.Groundhog Day 96%Smart, sweet, and inventive, Groundhog Day highlights Bill Murray’s dramatic gifts while still leaving plenty of room for laughs.Innerspace 82%A manic, overstuffed blend of sci-fi, comedy, and romance, Innerspace nonetheless charms, thanks to Martin Short’s fine performance and the insistent zaniness of the plot.Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang 86%Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and a spot-on comic performance from Robert Downey Jr. in this dark, eccentric film noir homage.Mean Girls 84%Sharper and darker than the average teen comedy, Mean Girls benefits from refreshing honesty and a terrific cast that includes Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Tim Meadows.National Lampoon’s Animal House 90%The talents of director John Landis and Saturday Night Live‘s irrepressible John Belushi conspired to create a rambunctious, subversive college comedy that continues to resonate.National Lampoon’s Vacation 93%Blessed by a brilliantly befuddled star turn from Chevy Chase (as well as strong supporting work from Randy Quaid and a young Anthony Michael Hall), National Lampoon’s Vacation is one of the more consistent — and thoroughly quotable — screwball comedies of the 1980s.Nebraska 91%Elegant in its simplicity and poetic in its message, Nebraska is boosted by a poignant, bittersweet dramatic performance by Will Forte.Obvious Child 90%Tackling a sensitive subject with maturity, honesty, and wit, Obvious Child serves as both a showcase for Jenny Slate and a promising debut for writer-director Gillian Robespierre.Punch-Drunk Love 79%Odd, touching, and unique, Punch-Drunk Love is also delightfully funny, utilizing Adam Sandler’s comic persona to explore the life of a lonely guy who finds love.School of Rock 92%Full of high spirits and loads of heart School of Rock into a hilarious, rocking good time, thanks in part to sharp supporting work from Joan Cusack and Sarah Silverman.Shrek 2 89%Topical humor and exuberant vocal performances from Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy help to make Shrek 2 a funny, smart animated tale for audiences of all ages.The Skeleton Twins 86%Led by powerful performances from Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, The Skeleton Twins effectively mines laughs and tears from family drama.This Is Spinal Tap 95%Smartly directed, brilliantly acted, and packed with endlessly quotable moments, This Is Spinal Tap is an all-time comedy classic, and represents a high water mark for stars Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer.Trading Places 88%Featuring deft interplay between Eddie Murphy and Dan Dan Aykroyd, Trading Places is an immensely appealing social satire.The Truth About Cats and Dogs 85%Sharp, witty, and charming, The Truth About Cats and Dogs features a standout performance from Janeane Garofalo.Wayne’s World 78%An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catch phrases, Wayne’s World is also fondly regarded because of its endearing leads — played with infectious goofiness by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey.Whip It 84%Drew Barrymore’s directorial debut has enough charm, energy, and good-natured humor to transcend its many cliches — and it features fine supporting performances by Kristen Wiig and Jimmy Fallon.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sci-Fi, TV, Heroines, Pictures","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"saturday-night-live-stars-on-the-big-screen"},{"id":"47613185198525","title":"The 10 Scariest Animated Children’s Movies","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 10 Scariest Animated Children's MoviesOn the 35th anniversary of The Black Cauldron, we look back at 10 other animated films aimed at kids that terrified and traumatized young viewers.by Rafael Motamayor | July 24, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by (c)Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Far too often, animated movies are written off as overly kid-friendly, unsophisticated fluff, when the truth is the medium is capable of telling stories as mature as the most prestigious live-action dramas. Sometimes, however, an animated movie ostensibly made for children can also be spooky enough to terrify the most hardened youngsters, and even a&nbsp;few adults.One of Disney’s most infamous animated movies, The Black Cauldron, opened 35 years ago and traumatized kids of all stripes, and to celebrate its anniversary, we’re taking a look back at its peers. Whether they were intentionally spooky or simply featured a couple of freaky moments that made every kid hit fast-forward, we’ve put together a list of the scariest animated movies that terrified the young audiences they were meant to entertain.Coraline (2009)  90%(Photo by Focus Features)On the surface, this stop-motion adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel is a silly story of a spunky, bored little girl who finds a hidden door to a secret world where everything is perfect, yet slightly off. But just like its hidden parallel dimension, Coraline is freaky and&nbsp;frequently plain horrifying. As soon as Coraline finds the secret door, the story begins to unfold like a horror film, ramping up its creepy atmosphere and frightening creatures. But the real terror comes the moment Coraline is given her own set of button eyes, to be sewn on by her creepy Other Mother… before she transforms into a giant spider and all hell breaks loose. Moira MacDonald summarized it for the&nbsp;Seattle Times: “Children who like being scared will get a kick out of this wildly creative movie; adults needn’t have a child in tow to enjoy it, too.”The Great Mouse Detective (1986)  80%(Photo by Walt Disney Productions)A&nbsp;noir mystery starring mice may not necessarily seem like a film that would give you nightmares for days on end, but you would be wrong. Based on the children’s novel&nbsp;Basil of Baker Street&nbsp;— which itself was inspired by the tales of Sherlock Holmes —&nbsp;The Great Mouse Detective&nbsp;starts with a little mouse girl named Olivia celebrating her birthday with her father at home, when suddenly a one-legged bat breaks into the house and kidnaps the father. The film’s eerie atmosphere persists throughout its runtime, and even when there are moments of levity or sweetness, they’re usually followed by moments of utter terror. For many children, the bat represents their first experiences with jumpscares, as he is responsible for the two most frightening ones in the film: first, when he bursts into Olivia’s home at the beginning of the movie, and later when he leaps out of a baby carriage to abduct her. Nina Darnton wrote for&nbsp;The New York Times&nbsp;that “Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters — the Disney Studio’s gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary — but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs. Adults will enjoy the wit and style.”The Last Unicorn (1982)  76%(Photo by Jensen Farley Pictures)Horror and fantasy are two genres that don’t cross nearly enough, but when they do, they&nbsp;offer unique experiences. The Last Unicorn skews more towards fantasy, but it still packs enough spooky elements to make it a scary film for kids. Rankin/Bass may be better known for their holiday classics like the stop-motion animated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but this fantasy epic — about a unicorn who discovers she is the last of her kind and embarks on a quest to discover&nbsp;what has happened to her kin —&nbsp;is full of horrific dangers. Without a doubt, the most frightening for kids was the fiery Red Bull, evil incarnate, with its deep, blood-red color and almost hollow eyes that no doubt inspired countless nightmares. Writing about the film for Time Out,&nbsp;Geoff Andrew&nbsp;explained that The Last Unicorn has “Some horrific moments (the mark of the best fairytales) and some sublimely witty lines.”Monster House (2006)  75%(Photo by Sony Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Monster House is ultimately charming and fun for most, but this is, after all, the only “proper” horror film on this list, and while it’s largely kid-friendly, it’s also suitably frightening in spots, as any haunted house movie worth its salt should be. The film follows three kids who decide to explore&nbsp;the creepy old house in their neighborhood with a terrifying reputation.&nbsp;It feels like a 1980s Amblin movie, full of adventure and comedy and more than a little danger, thanks to a few intense scenes courtesy of the imaginatively rendered titular house. As&nbsp;L.A. Weekly’s&nbsp;Scott Foundas said of the film, “Monster House becomes one of those wonderfully weird adventure stories beloved of children who don’t mind getting a good old-fashioned case of the heebie-jeebies. It’s kind of a blast for adults too.”The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)  95%(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)Ask any horror fan and they’ll tell you that Christmas and horror make for a fantastic combination, but this is one of the rare times that the two cross over in animated form, and it’s mostly a delightful treat. From the mind of Tim Burton and Henry Selick comes the story of the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, Jack Skellington, who gets tired of the same annual festivities and decides to kidnap Santa Claus and take over Christmas. As sweet and funny as it is terrifyingly gruesome, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a visual treat, even if those visuals are frequently bizarre, off-kilter, and a little macabre for the toddler set. The best example is the burlap-sack villain Ooogie Boogie, who literally refers to himself as “the boogieman” and who meets his demise when he comes apart at the seams and&nbsp;reveals he’s full of creepy-crawlies. As Alan Jones wrote&nbsp;for the Radio Times,&nbsp;“Only the deliciously demented imagination of Edward Scissorhands director Tim Burton could have come up with such a dark vision of the holiday season.”Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998)  88%(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)For decades,&nbsp;Scooby-Doo&nbsp;and the Mystery Inc. gang have served as an introduction to horror for kids, offering mildly creepy stories that always ended with an “Aw, shucks!” and a smile. Well, not&nbsp;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, which marked the first time the gang faced a real supernatural threat as they set out to find ghosts and monsters in Louisiana. What starts as another typical&nbsp;Scooby-Doo&nbsp;adventure quickly devolves into a tale of voodoo, ghost pirates, vengeful cat demons, and of course, zombies, all tied together by a tragic backstory much darker than fans of the show would have been accustomed to. There aren’t any greedy tycoons in rubber suits here, and actual death — of werecats and humans alike — is a major element of the plot.&nbsp;There really isn’t anything else quite like this in the&nbsp;Scooby-Doo canon, and any kid going into it expecting the usual antics was in for a shock.The Secret of NIMH (1982)  93%(Photo by United Artists)If you thought animated movies featuring talking animals were all sunshine and rainbows, think again. This film based on the children’s novel&nbsp;Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH&nbsp;follows a field mouse as she tries to save her ill son both from his pneumonia and from the farmer whose land they live on before he plows through it. Don Bluth’s adaptation is full of truly terrifying moments involving the survivors of scientific experiments, including a rat-eating cat named Dragon. But the scene that really traumatized kids was the visit to the Great Owl, whose introduction includes a lair littered with the bones of his devoured prey, a gruesome encounter with an ill-fated spider, and a pair of&nbsp;creepy, glowing eyes that stared into your very soul. Bluth’s films always skewed a little darker than typical Disney fare, and this was a prime example of his aesthetic. As critic&nbsp;Christopher Null wrote for Filmcritic.com,&nbsp;“Never mind the G rating, this is scary stuff which sent my little one fleeing to another room inside of 10 minutes.”Spirited Away (2002)  97%(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Japanese animation maestro Hayao Miyazaki’s films have been described as beautifully made artistic wonders and visual masterpieces, but “frightening” isn’t a sensation you normally associate with his work. That being said,&nbsp;Spirited Away&nbsp;is his most haunting film, and it has more than its fair share of creepy moments that sneak up on you and make a lasting impression. The story of a girl lost in a world ruled by spirits is as whimsical as a Disney film, but it doesn’t shy away from disturbing imagery, like when young protagonist Chihiro sees her parents transformed into monstrous and endlessly hungry pigs, or when the spirit No Face begins to devour all the employees of the bathhouse in a wild frenzy. Children who toughed it out through the more frightening moments were rewarded with an enchanting, magical experience, but for some kids, that would have been a tall order.Watership Down (1978)  82%(Photo by Avco Embassy courtesy Everett Collection)It doesn’t take long for&nbsp;Watership Down&nbsp;to shed its “cute bunny film” facade and reveal a deeper allegory that flows red with blood. This adaptation of Richard Adams’ novel follows a group of rabbits on a perilous journey to find refuge after one of them has an apocalyptic vision about their home. For generations,&nbsp;Watership Down&nbsp;has traumatized children with haunting imagery of red-eyed rabbits ripping each other’s throats out or suffocating as they’re buried alive, and peril lies around every turn in the story.&nbsp;Walter Chaw of&nbsp;Film Freak Central summed it up succinctly: “Unsentimental and terrifying.”Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)  97%(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures)“Wait a second.&nbsp;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&nbsp;is a live-action movie,” you might say, and you’d be (mostly) right, but Robert Zemeckis’ loony live-action/animated hybrid deserves a spot on this list because it features one of Disney’s scariest villains, Christopher Llloyd’s Judge Doom, who — spoiler alert — is actually a cartoon himself. When we first meet Doom, he mercilessly murders an innocent toon without flinching, dumping it into a vat of corrosive “dip.” Then comes the pivotal moment when we discover Doom’s true identity; as played by Lloyd, he already resembled a half-desiccated corpse, a cross between the evil preacher from the&nbsp;Poltergeist&nbsp;movies and the&nbsp;Gestapo officer from&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark who gets his face melted off.&nbsp;But once he’s run over by the streamroller and pops back up, Doom is another beast altogether and the stuff of childhood nightmares.The Black Cauldron was released on July 24, 1985.Did we leave out one of your favorites?

For those of you who were hotly anticipating Sam Raimi’s return to the horror genre, you’ll be pleased to know that Drag Me to Hell is finally available on DVD and Blu-Ray, and fans of the sleeper hit animated series Futurama will positively geek out at the latest collection to hit shelves. Marvel loyalists will get a second chance to check out a few of their new animated films, and we’ll put you onto a couple of good indie flicks that failed to get much exposure. Have a look at what’s coming out and beef up that collection.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1198119[/tomatometer]Drag Me to HellDirector Sam Raimi earned a great deal of goodwill and respect from moviegoers with his work on the Evil Dead series, and many consider those his best films. So it was with great anticipation that audiences looked forward to his return to the horror genre with Drag Me to Hell, particularly after Spider-Man 3. Though the film was rated PG-13, Raimi amped up the “eww” factor with plenty of bodily fluids, capitalized on his dark sense of humor, and utilized the same sort of ambient tension that made the Evil Dead films so effective, and the result was an all-around crowd-pleaser. Alison Lohman plays a loan officer at a bank who denies a mysterious old woman an extension and earns herself a deadly curse in return — she must find a way to remove the curse, or in three days time, she’ll be, you know, dragged to hell. Simple, but oh so effective. You can pick up the movie this week on DVD and Blu-Ray; special features include production video diaries and a featurette, among other things.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189343[/tomatometer]Land of the LostFor as popular and low-risk as remaking pop-culture icons must seem, remaking Land of the Lost looked like nothing but a gamble, even with heavy hitters like Will Ferrell and Danny McBride on the line. Sid and Marty Kroft’s show, which began in the mid 70s then resurrected very temporarily in the early 90s, followed characters Rick, Will and Holly (here played by Pushing Daisies‘s Anna Friel) through space and time to a “Lost” place where Sleestaks and Dinosaurs mix freely with giant crustaceans, Roman galleys, B-52s and Ice Cream Trucks. DVD features include deleted scenes, a fake ad for Devil’s Canyon, and a short called “A Day in the life of a Big Movie Star,” while Blu-Ray editions include more deleted scenes, Dr. Marshall’s food dairies, and a making-of featurette, among others.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1206888[/tomatometer]The ProposalSandra Bullock has had a rough time as of late; 2007’s Premonition earned a meager 8% on the Tomatometer, and All About Steve, which opened just over a month ago, actually managed to make it onto our 2000-2009 Worst of the Worst list. The one recent semi-bright spot was The Proposal, which opened in June. Though the movie was also rated Rotten overall by critics, many cited the onscreen chemistry between Bullock and co-star Ryan Reynolds as a strength, and for all its formulaic turns of plot, there were still some funny moments to be had. It doesn’t break any new ground in the rom-com genre, but it might be worth a bowl of popcorn on a rainy day. You can pick it up on DVD and Blu-Ray this week.Futurama: The Complete CollectionOne megahit animated series just wasn’t enough for Matt Groening, so he figured he’d create another one. Okay, sure, it probably wasn’t that easy, even for the creator of The Simpsons, but we’re sure glad he decided to do it, because Futurama turned out quite brilliant. Though the series went off the air after just four way-too-short seasons, it was recently announced by Comedy Central that 26 new episodes would be created for 2010, and seemingly in preparation for that, Fox is releasing an amazing Complete Collection. The DVD set comes with 19 discs that hold every episode of the series, plus the four direct-to-video feature length movies that have been made since the show’s cancellation. There are commentaries, easter eggs, deleted scenes, and lots of other goodies, but the crown jewel might just be the packaging: a giant Bender head, complete with detachable antenna.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1020092[/tomatometer]The StepfatherThe 1987 version of The Stepfather appears on DVD this week, just in time for the film’s update of the same name to hit theaters this Friday. Terry O’Quinn (John Locke on TV’s LOST) stars as Gerard “Jerry” Blake, who’s a perversion of Reagan era Family Values if ever there was one. Half Prince Charming, Half Ted Bundy, Jerry Blake has a clear idea of what his family is supposed to be, and the genteel and dashing O’Quinn plays him so smoothly it’s not hard to see how divorcees and widows might take to his intensely protective interest in them. Of course, family life looks different once you enter it, and Mr. Blake has issues when things look, shall we say, less than ideal. Out October 13th, the DVD includes a featurette about the film’s legacy and the novel that also inspired a sequel, as well as a commentary track with director Jason Ruben.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088009[/tomatometer]South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut – Blu-RayWhat Would Brian Boitano Do? Well, if he’s in the market for a good DVD, the 10th anniversary editon Blu-Ray of South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut might do the trick. One of the most manic, profane, and perversely amusing animated features of recent years, South Park has enough wacky songs, inspired political commentary, and out-and-out naughtiness to recommend it – even if we don’t have Saddam Hussein to kick around anymore. This new release features audio commentary from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as well as a music video for “What Would Brian Boitano Do?”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1206666[/tomatometer]American VioletOne of the noteworthy independent releases coming out this week is a little seen film called American Violet, starring newcomer Nicole Beharie and directed by Tim Disney (that’s right, the grandnephew of Walt Disney). Based on a true story, American Violet is about a Texas woman with no prior criminal history who is thrown in jail on suspicion of dealing drugs. She must make a choice between staying in jail and fighting the charges, which could result in the loss of custody of her children, or plead guilty and return home a disgraced woman. The film came in just below Certified Fresh status at 72%, and critics applauded Beharie’s performance in particular. You can pick it up on DVD and Blu-Ray tomorrow.Marvel Animation – 6-Film SetAlso coming out this week is a collection of 6 previously released direct-to-video feature length films from the guys at Marvel. We’ll start by saying that if you’re looking for any new special features to accompany this package, you won’t find them. The collection is simply that: a collection, specifically of the already available editions of each film. However, if you’re a die hard Marvel fan who, perhaps, might not have seen many of them, then here’s your chance to snatch them all up en masse. The six movies you’ll be getting are Ultimate Avengers, Ultimate Avengers 2, The Invincible Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Next Avengers, and Hulk Vs., along with the extras already available on all of them individually.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209567[/tomatometer]Every Little StepTo paraphrase its show-stopping signature number, A Chorus Line truly was a singular sensation, merging the real-life tales of showbiz vets with the razzle-dazzle of the Great White Way. The Certified Fresh documentary Every Little Step focuses on the 2005 revival, but also make plenty of time for the 1974 original, chronicling the show’s history, past and present. The DVD features cast and crew interviews, deleted scenes, and director’s commentary.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1054150[/tomatometer]Natural Born Killers – Blu-RayOliver Stone’s stylistically bold meditation on our tabloid media culture generated a ton of controversy upon its release in 1994. Specifically, the level of violence was enough raise the hackles of cultural gatekeepers. Critics were mixed as well; while some found Stone’s rapid-fire methods exhilarating, others thought his satirical aims were muddled at best. The Blu-Ray includes several featurettes, an introduction and commentary track from Oliver Stone, a 44-page booklet, an alternate ending and loads of deleted scenes.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"awards, TV, Geo, james, thriller, Elton, Guide, Adventures, TV, female","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Drag-Me-to-Hell-and-All-of-Futurama"},{"id":"47613173967288","title":"RT on DVD & Blu-Ray: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD &amp; Blu-Ray: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansPlus a handful of 80s classics and Peter Jackson's epic trilogy on Blu-Ray.by RT Staff | April 6, 2010 |  CommentsWhat can we say? This isn’t a very robust week for home releases on video, so we’ve done the best we could to come up with some noteworthy (in one way or another) choices. Not all of these are going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but there are at least a couple of entries that should be widely appealing, if only for nostalgic purposes. The two selections competing for most interesting this week are a Werner Herzog-Nicolas Cage collaboration that many critics felt was Cage’s best performance in years (if not his entire career), while the other is Peter Jackson’s epic fantasy trilogy (do we even need to specify it by name?). We made the best of what was out there, so hopefully something here strikes your fancy.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1209562[/tomatometer]Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansWerner Herzog has stated in so many words that Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans is not intended to be taken as either a remake or a sequel to Abel Ferrara’s 1992 film Bad Lieutenant. While the films do share a title, as well as a central character who is a corrupt cop that regularly indulges in gambling and various drugs, Port of Call New Orleans takes on a slightly campier tone, what with Nicolas Cage in the lead. Here, Cage plays a Louisiana cop who injures his back and becomes addicted to prescription drugs as a result; as he tracks down suspects in a post-Katrina murder case, he sinks deeper and deeper into the dirty underworld of New Orleans. Critics largely praised the film, helping it to a Certified Fresh 85% on the Tomatometer, and many singled out Cage’s performance as one of the best of his career. Port of Call New Orleans didn’t open very wide, though, so if you’re curious to see the movie that many feel Cage was perfectly cast for, then you can pick this up this week.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1014762[/tomatometer]The Natural – Blu-RayAnother classic hitting Blu-Ray this week is Barry Levinson’s beloved sports drama The Natural, starring Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Kim Basinger, among others. The inspiring story of a young baseball player who meets with tragedy early in his life and attempts a professional comeback as a 35-year-old was adapted from a novel of the same name and is considered one of the best sports films ever made, incorporating elements of baseball’s grassroots origins and historical significance, and creating a sort of mythology of its own. The new Blu-Ray comes with the same extras found on the standard definition Director’s Cut DVD, which include several featurettes on the making of the film and baseball in general, with appearances by former players like Ryne Sandberg, Don Mattingly, and Cal Ripken, Jr, as well as a featurette on Eddie Waitkus, the former MLB player who was shot by a stalker and who was one of the inspirations for the novel upon which The Natural was based. Fans of great sports films, Robert Redford, or Barry Levinson will all enjoy the movie, which you can pick up this week in its Blu-Ray reissue.Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series – Blu-RayIn 2004, a classic sci-fi TV series from the 70s was resurrected with updated special effects and storylines that regularly referenced or paralleled current world events. The result was a highly successful new show that developed a bit of a cult following all its own and ran for four seasons. Now, the complete series of Battlestar Galactica has already been made available in Blu-Ray before, but that set came in a large box with a collectible Cylon head included. While many fans thought, “Free memorabilia? Cool!”, there were obviously some who just wanted the discs themselves in more traditional packaging. Well, that time has come, as BSG is being released in its entirety in a simple box set that’ll be available this week. If you held off on picking up the series before because you had no interest in the nifty Cylon, then now’s your chance to grab the set in a box that isn’t so hard to file away next to your other DVDs.Icons of Suspense: Hammer FilmsIts proof of powerful cinema that we can’t talk about slaughter on camera without invoking the ghost of one particular shower-related slashing from 1960. Well, Hammer Studios did for the post-Victorian button-up-your-collar prescriptions of Jolly Old England what J-Horror does for the uptight codes of Japanese business and society. However, Hammer Studios made more than BLOOD AND BOOBS pictures, and the fancy thing about this DVD box set (an international package out on Region 1) is its interest in Suspense over Gore or Fantasy. Cyril Frankel’s Never Take Candy from a Stranger, the Box set’s rarest inclusion, is a class-conscious drama about an elderly child molester with impeccable standing in the small town where he does his (ew) work. Plus, well after Michael Powell got publicly lambasted because of the release of his masterpiece Peeping Tom (aka The British Psycho), Hammer producer and executive Michael Carreras made Maniac (1963), a serial killer tale with plenty of nods to its British expat’s precursor. But the jewel in the crown may be Joe Losey’s 1964 These Are the Damned (aka The Damned), and it rolls around in all the angst of the classic exploitation film: backwater teens, atomic anxiety, technology-imposed human mutation, etc. There are six titles in this box, each of them skating lines of social acceptability; gotta love what’s borne of repression.Madonna’s Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour – Blu-RayOnly a few inches from the moral decrepitude and gaudy confusion of Hammer Horror we have Madonna’s Sticky Sweet Tour blu-ray. Those not in the know about Madge’s tours on DVD will think this is a sequel to Truth or Dare, but it turns out it’s the singer’s most extensively attended tour yet. Something like 3.5 million fans in 32 countries saw this Live Nation production and now Live Nation is helping the other bajillion fans and facebook gripers fill the gap in their soul left by missing that tour live. Ah, the magic of Blu-Ray. Fancy bit: the show was shot in Argentina and the highlight of that particular stop was a stand-alone performance of “Don’t Cry for Me Argentina.” Classics like “Material Girl” and “Borderline” are present along with newer titles like “Beat Goes On” (reportedly featuring Kanye) and “Get Stupid.” Behind the scenes bonus features included. And yes, that’s right, you just read an RT on DVD writeup for a Madonna concert DVD… Don’t blame us; blame the studios for releasing almost nothing this week![tomatometer]MuzeID=1004422[/tomatometer]Cocoon – Blu-RayAnother 1980s phenomenon finds its way to Blu-Ray this week, as Ron Howar”s 1985 sci-fi tearjerker Cocoon gets its first high definition rerelease. For those unfamiliar with the film: the story revolves around a handful of senior citizens at a rest home who discover strange alien pods resting at the bottom of their pool; when the seniors decide to take a dip anyway, they discover they feel rejuvenated in both mind and body, and this creates a stir amongst the rest of the residents. Starring a slew of distinguished older actors, including Don Ameche, Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Wilford Brimley, and more, Cocoon ultimately won two Oscars (including a Best Suporting Actor trophy for Ameche) and even spawned a sequel three years later. Special features include a Ron Howard commentary as well as featurettes on the actors’ underwater training, how the Antareans (the aliens) were created, and a general making-of special.The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy Blu-RayPeter Jackson made a name for himself when he adapted one of the most beloved (if not THE most beloved) fantasy novel series of all time, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. None of the three epic masterpieces he crafted received any lower than a 92% Tomatometer rating, and the series culminated in a multiple Oscar-winning finale with 2003’s The Return of the King. Now, watching the entire series in one sitting would be quite a feat, but if you really wanted to, now you can finally do it in Blu-Ray, as the LOTR trilogy is finally available in high definition. For those who haven’t yet experienced Middle Earth in all its glory and intrigue, what better way to make the introduction than on Blu-Ray? One thing to note here is that the box set contains the theatrical versions of each film, so you hardcore fans out there may have to wait just a little bit longer to get the extended editions in this format, but if you liked the theatrical versions just fine, then you’d be doing yourself a disservice not to snatch this up right away.Written by Ryan Fujitani and Sara Schieron","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, TV, wars, 007, FXX, cinematic, canceled, Baby, drama, Marvel, toronto, Wars, Max, Family, Carpet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-and-Blu-Ray-Bad-Lieutenant-Port-of-Call-New-Orleans"},{"id":"47613188665791","title":"The Damned United – A Photo Primer","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Damned United - A Photo Primerby Orlando Parfitt | March 27, 2009 |  CommentsBack in 1970s, before the Premiership, Sky TV and WAGS came to characterise the beautiful game, football managers were almost exclusively gruff Northerners who smoked 60 a day and avoided publicity like the plague. That is part from Brian Clough, perhaps the most charismatic, media-savvy and complex manager to have graced the sport. The film tells the story of the most bizarre spell of his otherwise illustrious career, but for those not up on their 70s football, here’s our frankly indispensible visual guide to The Damned United.The man himself played by the current master of the celebrity impersonation, Michael Sheen. A legendary figure because of his charismatic personality and plethora of one-liners, it’s also sometimes forgotten just how successful Clough actually was in his prime in the late 60s and 70s.The movie revolves around Clough’s ill-fated spell in charge of Leeds United. At this point they were the league champions and one of the best teams in Europe. He is seen here being welcomed by fans, but the manager soon made enemies after making it clear how much he still despised the club. Much of the David Peace’s novel (the source material for the film) is made up of psychological speculation as to why Clough took the job — did he want to destroy the club from the inside? Did he deliberately sabotage his time there to somehow punish himself for accepting the role?The main reason for Clough’s hatred was former Leeds manger Don Revie (seen here played sinisterly by Colm Meanie). The film opens with Revie somewhat reluctantly leaving his job to take over the England national team. The team Revie built was extremely successful (they won every trophy going except the European cup) but were despised by many — especially Clough — for their negative play, arrogance, and cynical attitude towards the game. Leg-breaking tackles and referee intimidation were just some of the tactics espoused by Revie.In contrast, Clough’s managerial style was good football (“If God had wanted us to play football in the clouds, he’d have put grass up there” is a famous Clough-ism) and gentlemanly behaviour on and off the pitch. Clough built his reputation with this management style whilst he was in charge at Derby County. The film moves back and forth between his time at Leeds and this highly successfully spell at the Midlands’ club. We see here his Derby side taking on Revie’s brutal Leeds in their first year in the first division. Amazingly, despite having just been promoted, Derby would go onto win the league, just pipping Leeds themselves to the title.Clough’s genius lay in his man-management, which — usually in conjunction with assistant manager Peter Taylor — varied from arms-around-the-shoulder empathy to full on hysterical bollockings, depending on the situation and the players’ personalities. This approach, however, failed miserably when he got to Leeds, and he had to try and tame Revie’s players, especially the likes of (from left to right) Johnny Giles, Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Trevor Cherry. He alienated them from the beginning by famously telling them, “you won all your medals by cheating.”Probably the most important factor in Clough’s nightmare spell at Leeds however was the failure of his longtime assistant, Peter Taylor, played by Timothy Spall in the movie, to move up north and join him at the club. One of the greatest talent-spotters the game’s ever seen, he was also the only person to say “no” to Clough. They had a complex relationship, however, with the quiet and taciturn Taylor constantly feeling undervalued and underappreciated compared to the flashy Clough. The pair eventually acrimoniously parted ways for good whilst at Nottingham Forest in 1982. Clough never won a major Trophy without Taylor by his side.The film switches back to Clough’s time at Derby late in the film, and shows how his combustible personality and distrust of authority lost him (and Peter Taylor) their jobs. Constantly clashing with County chairman Sam Longson (a suitably slimy performance from Jim Broadbent), who resented Clough’s fame and influence, he eventually resigned due to perceived boardroom interference – though he was just using this a ploy to get Longson sacked, and never believed his resignation would be accepted.One of the final set pieces of the movie is a joint interview Clough did for Yorkshire TV after his sacking from Leeds with Don Revie. The real-life broadcast went down in football history for the barely repressed loathing and disgust both men showed towards each other, with Clough telling Revie “I wanted to win the league, but I wanted to win it better!” Clough would go onto win two European cups with Nottingham Forest, whilst Revie would fail as England manager.The Damned United is released today in the UK and on 13th August in Australia. The US release is to be confirmed.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Festival, Pet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-damned-united-a-photo-primer"},{"id":"47613200557509","title":"RT on DVD: Rachel Getting Married, Milk Lead Super Fresh New Releases","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Rachel Getting Married, Milk Lead Super Fresh New ReleasesLet the Right One In, Batman Anthology also hit shelves.by Jen Yamato | March 9, 2009 |  CommentsHome video enthusiasts, prepare yourself for what may be the best week ever! This week you’ll have to choose between Academy Award flicks Rachel Getting Married (Best Actress Nominee, Anne Hathaway) and Milk (Best Actor, Sean Penn), plus a few films that should have been honored at this year’s Oscars (Happy-Go-Lucky, Let the Right One In). Next, consider a Certified Fresh comedy (Role Models), a Charlie Kaufman original (Synecdoche, New York), and a pair of period pics (Cadillac Records, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas). We won’t judge if you give Jason Statham’s latest a spin (Transporter 3), but we do insist that Blu-ray viewers pay attention to a few key re-mastered releases (Pinocchio 70th Anniversary Edition, The Batman Anthology). Dig in to RT on DVD for more!Rachel Getting Married — 87%Anne Hathaway put those Princess Diaries days behind her with an excellent (and Oscar-nominated) performance as Kym, a recovering drug addict who powers her way through her sister’s wedding like a locomotive in Jonathan Demme‘s Rachel Getting Married. Director Demme, best known for making films like The Silence of the Lambs (and in recent years, the acclaimed documentaries Neil Young: Heart of Gold and Jimmy Carter: Man from Plains), lends the proceedings the feel of a verité film, his viewer another guest at the weekend nuptials; the script from Jenny Lumet (Sidney’s daughter) stings and warms in equal measure.One notable DVD featurette examines the film’s eclectic soundtrack, which includes songs from Robyn Hitchcock (who performs on-screen during the wedding), and TV on the Radio’s Tunde Adembimpe (who in a key role, plays Rachel’s fiancé). Deleted scenes, a cast and crew Q&amp;A, and two commentary tracks highlight the remainder of the bonus menu. Watch an exclusive clip below.Next: Watch Sean Penn’s Oscar-winning performance in MilkMilk — 93%Two weeks ago on Oscar night, a pair of acceptance speeches reminded us that sometimes movies are about more than just entertainment. Both Sean Penn (who won the Academy Award for Best Actor) and Dustin Lance Black (who won for Best Original Screenplay) honored slain San Francisco politician and gay rights advocate Harvey Milk, whose life and work became the basis for Gus Van Sant’s moving biopic, Milk. Penn, no stranger to politics, and Black, a Mormon-raised gay writer who thanked Milk for helping him overcome his own struggles, are just two reasons to pick up the triumphant, bittersweet period drama this week. (Need another reason? It’s among the best-reviewed films of 2008.)Bonus features include deleted scenes and three featurettes on the real-life Harvey Milk and the intersection of Hollywood and gay rights.Next: The best movie you didn’t see in 2008, Let the Right One InLet the Right One In — 97%A piece of future advice for 2010: don’t get caught buying a ticket to the American remake of Let the Right One In without having seen the original. This Swedish vampire tale, adapted by writer John Ajvide Lindqvist from his own novel and directed by Tomas Alfredson, is a quiet miracle of a film that, in this writer’s opinion, deserved a shot at the Foreign Oscar race (it went un-nominated by its home country). Part fang horror, part coming-of-age romance, Let the Right One In tells the story of young, bullied Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) and his new neighbor, Eli (Lina Leandersson), a girl who appears to be Oskar’s age but in fact is a blood-drinking vampire who must keep her secret from the public eye; when her older human caretaker leaves (was he once, like Oskar, young and in love with Eli?) the pair turn to one another for help and companionship, captured poetically by Alfredson. It’s one of the most beautiful — and dark, and darkly humorous — films of last year, and a much-needed jumpstart to a genre that’s become reliant on mediocrity and gore.Deleted scenes and a making-of documentary comprise a disappointingly light special features menu, but if sales do well don’t be surprised to get a commentary track on an eventual double dip.Next: Catch Sally Hawkins’ infectious cheer in Happy-Go-Lucky!Happy-Go-Lucky — 93%Should British actress Sally Hawkins have earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of a supremely cheerful school teacher in Mike Leigh‘s Happy-Go-Lucky? We say yes, but judge for yourself this week as the intimate, infectious film makes its way to home video. Through a series of real-life trials that might test the patience of any normal person, the effervescent Poppy (Hawkins, who workshopped the role with Leigh) maintains a smile no matter how rough life gets — to the consternation of her grumpy driving instructor, Scott (a hilariously on-edge Eddie Marsan), and perhaps, also to viewers. Only a few extra features are to be found here, including a commentary track by director Leigh, although one behind-the-scenes featurette in particular provides insight into the creation of the film and of the Poppy character, whose bliss is anything but ignorant.Next: Raunchy laughs with Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott in Role ModelsRole Models — 76%Director David Wain has had a hit-or-miss career with his comedies (I blame that Stella sense of humor) but his latest flick, Role Models, is a solid combination of crass humor, strong characterizations, and dorkiness of the RPG-playing kind. Which is to say, I was sold. The Certified Fresh comedy — a rarity these days, unless your name is Judd Apatow — follows energy drink-selling buddies Danny and Wheeler (Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott) sentenced to mentor a pair of troubled kids as community service: sword-wielding LARP devotee (that’s Live Action Role Playing game to you non-nerds), Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, AKA Superbad‘s McLovin’) and foul-mouthed troublemaker Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson, who steals the show).The DVD includes both the theatrical cut and an uncut version that runs three minutes longer, as well as a host of featurettes/deleted scenes/alternate takes. Look for Knocked Up OB-GYN Ken Jeong in a scene-stealing role as the king of Augie’s role-playing realm.Next: Charlie Kaufman’s challenging Synecdoche, New YorkSynecdoche, New York — 62%If you’re a fan of Charlie Kaufman, chances are you’re enamored of the signature complexities of his screenplays for films like Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Well, if you like those Kaufman flicks, just try to wrap your mind around his latest, which also marks his directorial debut. Synecdoche, New York tells the story of a struggling playwright (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who decides to mount his life’s greatest work — an autobiographical play with no ending — in a giant warehouse, casting actors to play himself and his loved ones until the whole thing takes on a meta-quality that will have you scratching your head well past the end credits. It’s impressive stuff, if fairly impenetrable; as Roger Ebert advises, see it twice. Four DVD featurettes, including a Blogger’s Roundtable discussion of the film with Glenn Kenny, Walter Chaw, Andrew Grant, Karina Longworth, and Chris Beaubien, should help you filter Kaufman’s opus.Next: Transporter 3 the worst of the franchise, but hey — it’s Jason Statham!Transporter 3 — 37%There are two kinds of people in the world: those who actually want to see Transporter 3, and those who wouldn’t do it for a million bucks. (There’s also my kind — people who had to see it and wish they didn’t.) While the first Transporter (53%) is a straight-up pleasure, and the second (51%) is more of a guilty one, this third flick — directed by Olivier Megaton, who named himself after Hiroshima — is a slim imitation of a Transporter movie, and features the worst actress of the entire franchise (newcomer Natalya Rudakova, who was apparently discovered by Luc Besson on the street). But if you like the idea of watching Jason Statham fight baddies using a dress shirt as a weapon (all the while getting increasingly unclothed), then Transporter 3 might not feel like a complete waste of time.Next: Beyonce, Mos Def sing the blues in Cadillac RecordsCadillac Records — 68%If soul music is your bag, then Cadillac Records should be worth a rental; the biographical tale of Chess Records, the studio that brought musicians like Etta James (Beyonce Knowles) and Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) to the masses in the 1960s, earned decent enough reviews but critics agreed the light drama coasted on the strength of its music. Adrien Brody stars as Leonard Chess, the R&amp;B-loving businessman who made it all happen; Beyonce, Wright, and Mos Def (as Chuck Berry) hit all the right notes in performing their own songs. Featurettes, deleted scenes, and a commentary by director Darnell Martin supplement the disc.Next: Holocaust dramatics in The Boy in the Striped PajamasThe Boy in the Striped Pajamas — 63%A German boy befriends a Jewish prisoner and begins to question the Nazi way of life in this Holocaust drama, which drew mixed reviews from critics. While some thought it among the best films of the year, others criticized its execution and the decision to turn an event as horrific as the Holocaust into a parable. Deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, and a commentary track by writer/director Mark Herman and author John Boyne, who wrote the original book of the same name.Next: Pinocchio celebrates his 70th birthday on Blu-rayPinocchio: 70th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray — 100%It’s hard to believe that Disney’s classic adventure Pinocchio is already celebrating its 70th birthday, but what’s even more incredible is how good a job the Mouse House has done with this Blu-ray release; every single scene is a dazzling work of art. Disney’s remastering process has burnished the film with an amazing clarity and richness, so much so that watching Pinocchio again this way is like watching it for the first time. You’ll be swept away by the painterly details that the Blu-ray cut reveals — the way something as simple as an ocean wave laps against another in the background, or how the camera turns to follow Pinocchio walk up and down a street despite the medium’s two-dimensional constraints.Fans of the wooden hero (or of Disney animation history in general) should employ either the new pop up trivia track or the “Cine-Explore” track featuring film critic Leonard Maltin, animator Eric Goldberg, and J.B. Kaufman. In addition to behind-the-scenes documentary features that cover all things Pinocchio, Disney has included deleted scenes (told via storyboards), production galleries, archival trailers from every one of Pinocchio‘s theatrical releases, games, alternate viewing options (including the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio), and, as with Disney’s Blu-ray titles, a standard DVD of the film. Wish upon a star for this stellar (and limited edition!) Blu-ray release.Next: Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology on Blu-rayBatman: The Motion Picture Anthology 1989-1997 on Blu-ray — N/AIt’s that Bat-time, people: time to sit down with all four pre-Nolan Batman flicks and revisit the franchise before the franchise, from Batman (69%) to Batman Returns (77%) to Batman Forever (44%) to Batman &amp; Robin (12%)! Warner Bros. is releasing all four films to DVD and Blu-ray (each in their own 2-disc Special Edition), and though the set does not include either Batman Begins (84%) or The Dark Knight (94%) (or the camp-tastic 1966 version), keep in mind that a double and triple dip is inevitable. That said, if you’re a Batman completist and love the high def format, you’ll find that these remastered flicks look and sound good even one to two decades after initial release. Just watch out for those Blu-ray-enhanced codpieces.A host of commentary tracks, deleted scenes, featurettes, and even a four-film spanning “Shadows of the Bat” documentary come within the box set, though there are no added materials beyond what has already appeared in the anthology on standard DVD.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"all-time, Sematary, lee, GoT, Awards, Emmys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Rachel-Getting-Married-Milk-Lead-Super-Fresh-New-Releases"},{"id":"47613213892045","title":"UK Critics Consensus: Was W.

Wicked? Is Pride &amp; Glory Proud and Glorious?Plus; Easy Virtue, Does Biel Appeal?by Tom Butler | November 7, 2008 |  CommentsThis week in the UK cinemas we have Oliver Stone’s latest presidential dissection, the George W. Bush biopic W. with Josh Brolin in the title role. Also out is Pride &amp; Glory, a US cop thriller with a stellar cast, and an adaptation of the Noel Coward play, Easy Virtue, starring Jessica Biel and British stalwart Colin Firth. But what did the UK critics have to say?In a momentous and historical week when the USA got shot of President Bush and replaced him with a newer, shinier model, Oliver Stone’s latest film W. hits the UK cinema screens with some mischievous scheduling at play. Never shy of making incendiary political pictures, this is Stone’s third presidential picture, following JFK (84% on the Tomatometer) and Nixon (74% on the Tomatometer), but where does W. stand in comparison? At a rather bland, almost Fresh but not quite, 57% on the Tomatometer, it seems that W. doesn’t quite stand shoulder to shoulder with Stones previous political polemics. The critics enjoyed the performances in the film, with Josh Brolin being tipped for honours in the award season, and the stellar supporting cast putting in quality turns.Reviewers also applauded the films warmth, humour and honesty in its portrayal of a man who, rather than being the embodiment of imperialist evil, was actually simply out of his depth. This approach angered others however, with many grumbling at Stone’s apparently toothless and even handed approach to the subject. The director was accused of pulling his punches with a flippant and neutral film that many are calling a missed opportunity. Made on a shoestring budget, and rushed out to meet its election time scheduling, the film has also been derided for its cheap production values and throwaway nature. So not classic Stone then; and another example of his fading powers perhaps?Pride &amp; Glory is a cop procedural that brings together two of modern cinema’s more enigmatic and possibly problematic stars; Edward Norton and Colin Farrell. Norton’s last film was Marvel’s The Incredible Hulk reboot (a decent 67% on the Tomatometer), and Farrell has had a mixed year so far with the disappointing Woody Allen flick Cassandra’s Dream (49%) and the hilarious In Bruges (81% on the Tomatometer). So how would they do when they share the screen in Pride and Glory? Not very well as it turned out. At a measly 35% Pride and Glory has been dismissed by the critics for being a cliché ridden, predictable and hackneyed picture despite a decent turn from Edward Norton. Macho, derivative, generic and unforgivable are just some of the many adjectives used by the hacks to describe Pride and Glory, which means the film shouldn’t be proud, or expect to bathe in any glory at all.Easy Virtue is a big screen adaptation of the Noel Coward play of the same name, which recently showed at the London Film Festival. Starring the stunning Jessica Biel as Larita, the glamorous American bride recently married to Ben Barnes‘ English gent John Whittaker, who is brought to 1920s England to meet the stuffy parents. Some critics enjoyed the films fizzy and breezy tone, along with performances from the stars who deliver the witty dialogue with playful ease. Others however were less amused, slamming the film for its lack of laughs, heavy-handed approach to the source material, and its smug and irksome soundtrack, which may have been better suited to the small screen. Currently standing at 53% on the Tomatometer, Easy Virtue has not been given an easy ride by the UK critics.Also worth checking out this week…Let’s Talk About The Rain — A loose and subtle French ensemble comedy of manners with solid performances and a few witty one liners. 77% on the Tomatometer.OSS 117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies – This clever spy spoof plays politics and movie conventions for laughs and features a great turn by Jean Dujardin as a smarmy-suave nouveau-Bond. 76% on the Tomatometer.Quote Of The Week“A detonation of flatulent, macho-sentimental gibberish is what this ugly and violent film positively farts out of the screen at you.”Pride And Glory.

OSS 117: Cairo Nest of SpiesRT Obscura 12: Celebrating the other 2006 spy franchise reboot from France.by Kim Newman | February 21, 2008 |  CommentsRT Obscura, the exclusive column by renowned critic Kim Newman, sees the writer plumbing the depths of the RT archive in search of some forgotten gems. In his twelfth column, Kim scoots back to 2006 and discovers that year’s other spy franchise reinvigoration from France.Just as the new version of Casino Royale thoroughly reworked and revitalised the flagging 007 franchise for the new millennium, OSS 117: Le Caire nid d’Espions (2006) brings back France’s equivalent spy franchise. However, it takes exactly the opposite approach to the Bond property by setting aside dead straight thrills in favour of deadpan laughs.Insouciant agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, who goes by the code-name OSS 117, was created by author Jean Bruce in 1949, and has appeared in a library’s worth of pulp adventures. He made his screen debut, played by Ivan Desny, in OSS 117 n’est pas mort (1956), but didn’t click as a screen character until the post-Dr No scramble to put rival suave superspies into pictures.Sometime-Sinbad Kerwin Matthews was Hubert in OSS 117 se déchâine (1963) and Banco à Bangkok pour OSS 117 (1964), with Frederick Stafford taking over for Furia à Bahia pour OSS 117 (1965) and Atout coeur à Tokyo pour O.S.S. 117 (1966), followed by John Gavin in Niente rose per OSS 117 (1968) and Luc Merenda in OSS 117 prend des vacances (1970).Wooden and widescreen, full of gorgeously inexpressive actresses and attractive locations, these mid-range productions all scored English-language releases in the 1960s under bland retitlings (Mission for a Killer, Panic in Bangkok, Murder for Sale) which didn’t push the hero as anything special. Alfred Hitchcock, however, caught at least one of the series and cast Stafford as the bland, OSS 117-like hero of his least-remembered film, Topaz.This new take, courtesy of director Michel Hazanavicius, doesn’t present a Hubert who is as extreme a spoof character as, say, Austin Powers or Maxwell Smart, but does poke gently vicious fun at the spy’s overconfident blind stupidity. With slick hair, a Gene Kelly grin and an array of Rat Pack suits, Jean Dujardin manages a letter-perfect send-up of the heroes of yore. In a black and white prologue, Hubert (with pencil moustache) and his best friend Jack Jefferson (Philippe Lefebvre, who also writes and stars in Tell No One) thwart some Nazis during the last days of the war, all the while laughing insanely and — at least on Hubert’s part — barely repressing their attraction for each other. Then, in 1955, in full colour and sinuous widescreen, Hubert travels from Rome to Cairo to investigate Jack’s apparent death and take over his mission to spy on various factions who are after a shipment of Soviet arms.The basic joke is that, through simple-minded idiocies, Hubert actually causes the Suez crisis which will ultimately lead to the end of France as a colonial power. Furthermore, by getting out of bed early to tell a noisy muezzin to shut up during the call to prayer, radicalises local Muslims (he hasn’t heard of the religion and assumes it won’t catch on) to the extent that his confidence that Westerners will always be welcome throughout the Middle-East is sorely misplaced.Along the way, Hubert exerts his manly prowess in fistcuffs and wrestling with thugs (including a pyramid full of leftover Nazis), has steamy relationships with secretary-cum-rebel Larmina (Bérénice Bejo) and King Farouk’s niece (Aure Atika), is dogged by a djellaba-clad mastermind whose ultimate identity is fairly guessable (but prompts a terrific contradictory flashback joke), persistently misses obvious clues (a match-book with a name scrawled in it) that are literally thrust under his nose, is menaced by various conniving factions (including a Belgian chicken salesman who is furious that the poultry operation France runs as a cover for its local secret service outpost — which Hubert takes a childish delight in — is outperforming his legitimate business), impersonates an Arab cabaret star to do a catchy Eastern-inflected cover of ‘Bambino’ (known in English as ‘With his Little Mandolin’) only to be distracted by the sudden audience acclaim from his actual job of blending into the background, and escapes from certain death when tied up and dropped into the Suez canal (he tells Larmina he’s impressed that Egyptians could have dug this 4000 years ago).The political angle isn’t stressed, and there’s a refreshing refusal to trade in ‘funny foreigner’ comedy stereotypes as Hubert is presented as the only true idiot in the story, with various Arab dignitaries looking on in astonishment as he babbles. Hazanavicius has an eye for cool period trappings and smart compositions, recreating almost exactly the look and style of the original OSS 117 films, from the slick animated titles through the underpopulated panoramic backdrops to the magazine layout costumes. There is a healthy dose of low humour (involving chickens or barely-repressed bisexuality) amid the smart stuff and Dujardin brings just enough heart to the simple-minded, dangerously inept hero (who has never heard of Arabic but has bothered to learn hieroglyphics as prep for his Cairo mission) to make him worth putting up with for a whole film. A sequel is in the works.Like Dujardin’s surfing comedy Brice de Nice, a major hit on its home territory, OSS 117 hasn’t so far been widely exhibited outside France, but is well worth tracking down.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"comic, movies, USA, stand-up, Geographic, Golden, YA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"kim-newman-on-oss-117-cairo-nest-of-spies"},{"id":"47613219071440","title":"RT on DVD: The Dark Knight Is Here!","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: The Dark Knight Is Here!Plus Horton Hears a Who, complete series sets of The Wire and Deadwood, and more.by Jen Yamato | December 8, 2008 |  CommentsWelcome to The Dark Knight DVD week at Rotten Tomatoes! Warner Bros.’ dark, masterful sequel arrives on DVD and Blu-ray Tuesday as one of the most anticipated home video releases of the year. (Stay tuned for RT’s test drive of the Dark Knight BD-Live function, in which fans can record, upload and share their own commentary tracks set to scenes from the film.) Also see what else is new to DVD: The Wire The Complete Series, Deadwood The Complete Series, Horton Hears a Who, Man on Wire, and more!1. The Dark Knight — Two-Disc Special Edition and Blu-ray — 94%So last summer you might have heard of this little character-driven movie, in which a wealthy businessman-turned-crime fighter takes on a diabolical foe named the Joker whilst questioning the negative effects of his lifestyle choice on his fellow citizens. Doesn’t ring a bell? Well, that’s just fine, since this week The Dark Knight hits DVD and Blu-ray in a major way, giving you plenty of opportunity to watch and re-watch Christian Bale match wits with the late, great Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan’s artful comic book movie sequel.The Dark Knight (Certified Fresh at 94% on the Tomatometer and one of the year’s best-reviewed films) comes to DVD and Blu-ray with a host of special features designed to make you drool like a Pavlovian pup. Here you’ll find galleries of concept art and stills, the Gotham Uncovered documentary, and six episodes of “Gotham Cable’s Premier News Program;” featurettes on the Batpod, the Bat-suit and Hans Zimmer’s score; and all six sequences shot in IMAX, presented as they were originally intended.Of course, these features will look all the better in Blu-ray, which contains a total of three hours of bonus materials. The Dark Knight is also the very first Warner Bros. title to enjoy the BD-Live function, which you can use to create your own video commentary from select scenes from the film and share them with your friends. Below, watch our very own Editor in Chief, Matt Atchity, as he delivers a gripping commentary of his own using The Dark Knight‘s BD-Live function! (And yes, that’s yours truly riding shotgun.)Next: Saddle up with the complete set of Deadwood2. Deadwood – The Complete SeriesLike many of the denizens of its namesake town, HBO’s series Deadwood lived a vibrant, but short, life during its three-season run on television. With the possibility of tele-film sequels now as dead as Wild Bill Hickok, you and your favorite Deadwood fan can take solace in the fact that the entire series is now available in one 19-disc package. And for the low, low price of $179.99!Next: Horton hears a DVD!3. Horton Hears a Who! — 78%Reach back into the far recesses of your memory, beyond the Kung Fu Pandas and Wall-E‘s of this year, all the way back to March — when a little animated flick called Horton Hears a Who debuted in theaters. The Certified Fresh retelling of Dr. Seuss’ original tale delighted critics, who appreciated the whimsical, faithful adaptation of one of the Dr.’s best-loved stories.Pick up the 2-Disc Special Edition for a bonus-packed menu that includes two commentaries (one with the directors and producers, the other with stars Jim Carrey and Steve Carell), tons of deleted scenes and animated screen tests, featurettes, and perhaps most enticing of all, a sneak peek short film featuring the characters Sid and Scrat from the upcoming Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs.Next: Drift away with LOST: Season Four4. LOST – The Complete Fourth SeasonThe hit ABC show LOST bounced back from its mid-life slump with a Season Four that hooked viewers in again — a good thing, since the Castaways only have a few more seasons to go before the series meets its definitive conclusion, as previously announced. In Season Four, catch up with new rivals Jack and Locke, mourn the loss of the beloved (or to many, reviled) Charlie, meet a host of brand new characters from the freighter ship Kahana, and stay riveted as the show that defined “twist” for modern television explores the concept of the flash-forward. Special features include featurettes on LOST‘s location filming, composer Michael Giacchino’s score, deleted scenes and more.Next: One of the year’s best docs: Man on Wire5. Man on Wire – 100%Director James Marsh pieces together a portrait of one of the world’s bravest (or is it dumbest?) man in this critically acclaimed documentary, which also happens to be one of the best reviewed films of the year. In Man on Wire, meet Philippe Petit, a charismatic, iconoclast high wire walker who in the 1970s recruited a band of loyal collaborators to stage the dangerous stunt of walking (sans safety net) between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. The spectacle led to a few arrests, granted Petit instant fame, and caused the dissolution of many of his closest relationships, though by his own account the daredevil has absolutely no regrets. Watch this fascinating documentary on DVD, which also features an audio commentary and deleted scenes. Man on Wire made the Oscar documentary shortlist for this year’s nominations.Next: Take home the complete DVD set of The Wire6. The Wire – The Complete SeriesKnow any die-hard fans of HBO’s gritty series The Wire? We guarantee they’ll squeal with delight at unwrapping The Wire: The Complete Series this holiday season. The 23-disc set is essentially a collection of all previous season box sets in one place; included are all five seasons of the celebrated show, as well as special features like cast and crew audio commentaries, three prequel features, and a gag reel. The only hitch? It’ll set you back a cool $299.99, so start saving up.Next: The I Am Legend Blu-ray double dip7. I Am Legend – Ultimate Collector’s Edition Blu-ray — 69%If you bought your copy of I Am Legend the first time it debuted on Blu-ray, you’ll most likely want to bypass this double dip. But if you don’t yet own the Will Smith post-apocalypse thriller in High Definition, this is a great set to consider. While most of the special features were released previously, this set contains some new materials, like a new audio commentary with director Frances Lawrence and screenwriter Akiva Goldsmith. A 40+ page glossy production booklet makes this set a collectible, one supposes.Next: Import John Woo’s Chinese epic, Red Cliff8. Red CliffAsian cinema fans, take heed: John Woo’s highly anticipated historical epic Red Cliff is headed to Blu-ray…and it’s region-free. Despite breaking records in release in Asia, where the first of two feature-length parts has already debuted, Red Cliff has no set U.S. release date; picking up an import Blu-ray disc might be your best bet at watching Woo’s celebrated return to Hong Kong. The epic tale, based on the ancient Battle of Red Cliffs in the year AD 208, stars Takeshi Kaneshiro (Mongol), Tony Leung (Lust, Caution) and was reportedly the most expensive movie in Asian cinema history.Special features include cast interviews and press conferences, photos and a trailer.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"The, caribbean, A&E, razzies, blaxploitation, Out, cops, dramedy, Larson, video, Pirates, RT, boxoffice, war, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-The-Dark-Knight-Is-Here"},{"id":"47613205043656","title":"Awards Tour: Writers Guild Winners Announced!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Awards Tour: Writers Guild Winners Announced!The Hurt Locker and Up in the Air gain momentum.by RT Staff | February 20, 2010 |  CommentsThe Writers Guild of America announced its awards for Best Original Screenplay, Adapted Screenplay, and Documentary Screenplay on Saturday night.

Based on 1990 novel Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, the Amazon Prime limited series tells the story of agents of God and Satan who want to stop the Apocalypse&nbsp;— simply because it sounds like a terrible idea. Fortunately, it seems like the reluctant Antichrist has similar inclinations.Michael Sheen (The Queen) plays angel Aziraphale, and David Tennant (Broadchurch) is demon Crowley. The two first met when Crowley turned into a snake and slipped past Aziraphale into the Garden of Eden to tempt Eve. Theirs has been a fine bromance ever since.Rotten Tomatoes met up with the stars, Gaiman, director Douglas MacKinnon (Doctor Who), and, representing Terry Pratchett’s estate, executive producer Rob Wilkins, ahead of the series’ London premiere to find out just what makes the Amazon Studios and BBC Studios co-production Good Omens such a delicious binge-watching option.1. A Monty Python NonsensibilityStarting out the gate with the credit sequence, the series pays homage to Monty Python.But while in sketch series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, Agnus Nutter actually does expect the Spanish Inquisition when her time of judgment arrives.2. The Celestial Bromance at Its Core(Photo by Amazon Studios)Aziraphale and Crowley build their lovingly adversarial relationship one historical clash after another – including, during another nod to Monty Python, when Crowley turns up as the Black Knight.&nbsp;Sketches of Aziraphale and Crowley’s bond strengthening over the ages are pure joy and recommend further adventures of the collegial duo. And Welsh actor Sheen and Scottish actor Tennant spark onscreen in a way that critics have hailed.“Most of the show’s charm hinges on the unlikely camaraderie between an Angel and a Demon, played, with considerable gusto, by Michael Sheen and David Tennant,” CNN’s Brian Lowry wrote.New York Magazine’s Keith Phipps wrote, “Good Omens can work only with the right leads, so cheers to bringing in Sheen and Tennant, two actors who know how to make a three-course meal out of understated dialogue and cosmic absurdity.”And, from Allison Shoemaker of RogerEbert.com: “Together, it’s like watching two musicians at the top of their game play a duet; they positively sing.”In a press conference before meeting with reporters, Tennant explained the relationship further.“They’re not particularly good representatives of their respective head offices. They’ve rubbed off on each other, so much, that Crowley’s not that mean anymore, and Aziraphale’s not that holy,” he said. “So, between them, they’ve reached a common ground, and they’ve become each other’s, sort of, significant other, really … They’ve only got each other to rely on, and they’ve become — although they would deny it until the end of time, quite literally, they’re sort of each other’s yin and yang … But, it’s only when you see what head office is like — for instance, when the angel, Gabriel, appears — that you realize how humanized they’ve become by the mortal world, that they really like, quite a lot because it’s got wine.”3. The Obscene Wealth of Talent(Photo by Scott Garfitt/BACKGRID)Sheen and Tennant are just the start. The rest of the cast fills out with an enviable assemblage of talent for serialized entertainment:Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as Archangel Gabriel, who leads the angelic hostAnna Maxwell Martin (The Bletchley Circle) as Beelzebub, leader of the forces of HellJosie Lawrence (Enchanted April) as 17th-century witch Agnes Nutter, who produces the only accurate book of prophecies ever writtenAdria Arjona (True Detective) as Anathema Device, a witch and Agnes Nutter’s descendantMiranda Richardson (Harry Potter franchise) as part-time medium and prostitute Madame TracyMichael McKean (This Is Spinal Tap) as Witchfinder Sergeant ShadwellFrances McDormand (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) voices GodBenedict Cumberbatch (The Hobbit film franchise) voices SatanSam Taylor Buck as reluctant Antichrist Adam YoungThe series, a coproduction of Amazon Studios and BBC Studios, is directed by Douglas Mackinnon (Doctor Who) and also features Jack Whitehall, Mireille Enos, Brian Cox, Nick Offerman, Ned Dennehy, Ariyon Bakare, Nina Sosanya, Steve Pemberton, and Mark Gatiss.4. Expertly Drawn Characters(Photo by Amazon Studios)The series’ stars raved about bringing Gaiman and Pratchett’s characters to life.“Nothing is odd about this character; I think she’s entirely relatable. Particularly, the channeling of many, many souls, alive and dead, and riding a motorbike, in a cape, with a former member of Spinal Tap. It’s just part of the day job, really,” Richardson related in a press conference before breaking off to meet with reporters. “It feels like my element. I love it. Transformation and costume and inhabiting of other, but at the same time, the character is, all the characters are, incredibly humane. I just… I love that about this project. That’s what comes across, I think.And what will book fans think, especially given changes like Archangel Gabriel’s expanded role?“I think had we gone into this project without Neil,” Hamm said, “there would have been a different reaction, but because Neil was involved from the get-go and was so involved during the process of making it, it became like a version 2.0. So I think the fan base was jazzed, they were like, Oh my God, we’re getting more, we’re almost getting a sequel or something, we’re getting the extended version, the EP. … We were at New York Comic Con and there were 5,000 people that showed up for a panel discussion. It was bonkers. It was like a rock concert. It didn’t hurt that we had Doctor Who on stage. It was still pretty cool and that was when I was like, Oh yeah there are way more people that are just as excited about this as I am. Worldwide, it’s been published in 70 languages.”5. A Story With Heart(Photo by Mike Marsland/WireImage)Good Omens has a lot of heart. That’s baked into the series by Gaiman, the stars attest.“The writing is absolutely promoting humanity,” Richardson said. “You know, it’s very affirmative and optimistic, really, isn’t it?”“[Neil is] very centered,” she continued. “He knows what he thinks about everything. That doesn’t mean he’s not open. He is completely open. So you ask him a question, and it’s really considered. It’s not, ‘You don’t need to worry about that.’ It’s this is just what’s happened, or I think you should try that, or whatever it is. You know, everything is very considered. It’s great.”Lawrence: “He has time for you, which is wonderful.”Richardson: “Like having Daddy on set.”Lawrence: “Yes, it is, or a beautiful angel.”Hamm also noted that Gaiman brings something different to the process of creating a series.“What Neil really brings to everything he does is the capacity for storytelling,” Hamm said, “and that’s first and foremost. Also I think some people in the more traditional Hollywood aspect, they’re trying to make money. They’re making product, whether it’s a Marvel movie or what have you franchise, they’re not necessarily concerned with storytelling. They’re concerned with IP, or what’s it going to be on the second weekend or what’s the third movie going to be at franchise – Neil just wants to tell a story. That’s how he’s created this career that’s been so wide-ranging, and I think you’re going to see a lot more Neil Gaiman stuff get filmed because the stories are so compelling.”6. The Antichrist Has Never Been More&nbsp;EnchantingAntichrist Adam Young has the wide-eyed English-schoolboy charm of classic heroes like Mark Lester’s 1968 Oliver or any number of Nicholas Nicklebys throughout the cinematic age – until, of course, the boy inherits his powers. Aziraphale and Crowley’s attempts to manage the situation are akin to trying to stop a tornado with a butterfly net — a magical butterfly net, but still.7. Evolved Female Characters(Photo by Scott Garfitt/BACKGRID)Though Good Omens’ main characters, Aziraphale and Crowley, are male, we find engaging and richly drawn women among the secondary stars of the series. Anathema spends most of her time chasing a McGuffin, but in the end contributes greatly to the stop-the-Apocalypse cause.“There’s a big difference between a tough female character and a strong female character and Anathema’s strong, she’s very in her essence,” Arjona said. “She’s a woman and she’s sure of herself and so unsure of what she’s doing and messes up, and she’s flawed and she doesn’t get it right all the time — sometimes she does — and she has this guy that’s following her and never falls into romance. She’s like, ‘I gotta do what I gotta do — maybe after babe. I’ll catch you later.’ She’s doing her own thing and I love that about her, and I wish a lot of other characters would be like that because relatable to me, and I see my friends and the way they deal with their careers and their own life, and it’s very similar to Anathema.”Richardson’s Madame Tracy is a very rich character, who, despite her own flaws, endures a level of verbal abuse and emotional sabotage from Shadwell.“Madame Tracy has her own strengths. She, in some ways, feels a bit retro. I mean, her part is retro, and the fact that she’s making a living in the way she is, is a bit retro. But at the same time she’s providing an incredible help in the community, and she’s also very supportive, and she’s trying to be a little bit life-enhancing … so there are those feminine traits, things showing. She takes care of Shadwell, and she looks out for people. It’s rather lovely, but she’s her own woman.”Good Omens sets out to prove a love bond between the prostitute and the Witchfinder, but where she definitely shuts the door on the risk of her infidelity, his name-calling promises to continue.“I know it is a bit questionable,” Richardson said, “but maybe it’s, pardon the pun, better the devil you know. I don’t know, you know? She’s practical.”8. Unique Artistry(Photo by Amazon)The production design, effects, and costuming on the series lend a distinctive voice to the characters’ surroundings. Several of the actors noted that the costumes and unique environments helped them fully inhabit their characters.“There’s an opportunity to sort of portray this guy as the boss that everyone has, that everyone hates, who’s constantly smiling and telling you, ‘Great job,’ while also subconsciously saying, ‘You’re terrible,’” Hamm related. “And, I’ve worked for that guy before, and I’ve hated him, and it was kind of fun to play. Just like, ‘Everything you’re doing is wrong. Keep going.’ And, I got to wear so much cashmere in this, that it was A: warm, B: soft, C: comfy. But yeah, there was a lot to recommend for being on the heavenly side of thing, from a fabric point of view.”Arjona similarly credited the series’ style choices for aiding her performance: “I just tried on her boots and something happened, and I got really lucky because I didn’t have to do much work after I tried on her boots.”9. An Uncompromised Creative Vision(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)With Good Omens, Gaiman sought to fulfill a deathbed wish of his collaborator on the book, Terry Pratchett, and so, dug in his heels.“Being the writer was relatively pleasant and entirely stress-free in that nobody was really waiting for this. I wrote it, I promised Terry I would write it, I wrote it, did the adaptation, divided the book into six, every 50 pages: OK, that’s episode one, that’s episode two. Fair enough, I’ll write a mini movie through time that will kick off episode three. That was all simple and very stress free,” Gaiman said.“The problem is that I’d promised Terry Pratchett that I would make a TV show that he would want to watch, and I’d learned through my previous outings in television — some of which have been incredibly successful and some of which hadn’t — that the measure of which were successful and which weren’t were not the quality of the script to begin with; it was what actually wound up on the screen at the end. And I thought, OK, I have to be in a place where I can control that, where I have a director who I can work with who we share a vision with, where I can cast the people who I see in my head, where I’m there just making sure that a producer who — producers don’t understand scripts. I wish they did, but they don’t —”MacKinnon: “Some of them do.”“Some of them do,” Gaiman conceded. “A lot of the time, what a producer will do when they go, ‘OK, we have X amount of money. We have this in the script and here is a sequence that is both expensive and if we lose it, we’ll save a day of filming and nobody’s going to notice if that scene is gone,’ completely failing to understand that if they pull that scene out, nothing that follows it will actually make any more sense. This is something producers have been doing since the dawn of time.“To make this thing for Terry, what I had to do was be in a place where I could just say no when somebody said, ‘So, we think we’re going to lose Shakespeare’s Globe.’ I go, ‘Yeah, no we’re not.’ Sometimes I would come back with, ‘I’ll tell you what. If we need to save that money, we can lose this scene after that you really like but that actually doesn’t change anything. It can go.’”It’s the only instance of anyone tied to Good Omens who we’ve spoken to describing Gaiman’s behavior on the production as anything other than “lovely.”10. Heavenly Irreverence(Photo by Amazon Studios)Both Sheen and Tennant aren’t strangers to supernatural beings; Sheen appeared as Head Lycan in Charge Lucian in the Underworld vampires-versus-werewolves film franchise, then as The Twilight Saga vampire Aro. Tennant, meanwhile, not only played the titular extraterrestrial in Doctor Who for three seasons and in specials as the tenth Doctor, whose abilities were anything but earthly, but also turned up as witch and Voldemort loyalist Barty Crouch, Jr. in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.The actors appear to take on these heavenly creatures with ease and a sort of glee.“All those characters like vampires, werewolves, angels, demons, they get reinvented — don’t they? — by each generation, because they come to represent different things for each generation,” Sheen said. “And also budgets have changed. There’s a lot more money to make stuff that can really use those sort of effects quite well. But in terms of Heaven and Hell and angels and demons — the end of time’s and apocalypse is a whole other thing, I suppose — we’re starting to think about slightly differently. I think the angels and demons thing and Heaven and Hell is always partly about going, well you have these two extremes and real life is about somehow being in the middle somewhere and being in the gray area and that’s certainly what, I think, Good Omens is about.”There’s a good chance that Good Omens will ruffle some feathers, but Gaiman isn’t worried.“One of the things that I made a call writing literally page one, which was, I thought, Well, it could be Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and they’re not going to be white. So, in the first five minutes, you’re going to have to deal with the voice of God and she’s a woman and she’s Frances McDormand, and you’re going to have to deal with a non-white Adam and Eve. That’s your first five minutes. You can stop watching now. If you were upset or offended, great excuse to stop watching now. You will probably be much more offended by things later on like an 11-year-old Antichrist who is actually a good kid … But look, that was there for you: You had a five-minute warning — [Good Omens] actually starts with the word ‘warning.’”Good Omens&nbsp;debuts on Friday, May 31 on Amazon Prime.Like this?

Here, instead of spoiling your journey into these characters’ psyches, we take you on a trip to the past, showcasing eight cinematic gems from this season’s True Detective cast.Colin Farrell (Ray Velcoro)Film: In Bruges (2008,  84%), was the first of screenwriter/director Martin McDonagh‘s one-two punch of clever crime tales with sympathetic and sociopathic characters. The Oscar-nominated story follows two hitmen who’ve been ordered to kill a priest, but kill a little boy in the process as well. They’re banished to Bruges, a gorgeous city in Belgium, where sad hilarity ensues with a cast of characters including Ralph Fiennes and Brendan Gleeson.Role: Because of its slow-building cult success (despite the box office gross of less than half of the $15 million it was made for), In Bruges might seem like an obvious choice for Colin Farrell. It’s where many people finally decided that the Hollywood party boy from Ireland had some acting chops as hitman Ray. Indeed, he won a Golden Globe for it.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Vince Vaughn (Frank Semyon)Film: Into the Wild (2007,  83%), is the harrowing, exciting, crazy true story of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who foregoes his college education, athletic promises of grandeur, and all his worldly possessions in order to find his true self, live a true life, and feel truth in all its many forms. Based on the book by Jon Krakauer, a writer and mountaineer, the film — adapted for the screen and directed by Sean Penn — was only a mild box office success.Role: Wayne Westerberg is one of the many characters McCandless meets during his nation-wide journey — a grain elevator operator who befriends McCandless at a bar in the fall of 1990 in Montana. He first offers the wandering young ma a ride, then a place to stay, and eventually a job at his plant in Carthage, South Dakota. The two become close friends and Westerberg is actually the one to receive McCandless’s postcard in Denali National Park in Alaska.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Rachel McAdams (Ani Bezzarides)Film: State of Play (2009,  84%)is a political thriller à la All the President’s Men, but sexier. Russell Crowe plays Cal McAffrey, a reporter who goes deeper than he bargained for into an investigation against a Congressman (Ben Affleck) whose former aid — and the woman he was having an affair with — turns up dead. There’s a huge supporting cast including Robin Wright, Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, and Jeff Daniels, all directed by Kevin Macdonald, who had done mostly documentaries before the award-winning The Last King of Scotland.Role: Della Frye is the gutsy, go-getter blogger for The Washington Globe, who plays like a sidekick to Cal. For the role, McAdams got to really immerse herself in life on the Hill, spending time with reporters at The Washington Post to prepare for turning the tables onscreen and getting her chance to probe for once.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Taylor Kitsch (Paul Woodrugh)Film: The Normal Heart (2014,  94%) was first written as a play by Larry Kramer, who saw the rise of HIV/AIDS in the early 1980s claim the lives of dozens of friends and even more peers. HBO had him adapt it into a screenplay for their Ryan Murphy-directed version, which follows Ned Weeks (a fictional version of Kramer and played by Mark Ruffalo) and his unintended rise into political activism for healthcare for gay men and awareness surrounding the AIDS epidemic sweeping the nation.Role: In the same year, Kitsch showed us one type of strength in Lone Surivor as an Army Special Ops fighter, and another type of strength as Bruce Niles, the partner of a man whose death helped spur Ned Weeks’ movement for AIDS activism in San Francisco in the early 1980s. Although Niles, a Wall Street banker, is closeted, he shows great leadership and ideas about activism as the first president of the Gay Men’s Health Crisis and has to field the fiery Weeks’ attempts to out him on camera. The two — surrounded by supportive characters played by Julia Roberts, Matt Bomer, and Jim Parsons — have the same goal, just different approaches.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Kelly Reilly (Jordan Semyon)Film: Last Orders (2002,  79%)has cast full of British heavyweights in their early Golden Years — Michael Caine, Tom Courteney, David Hemmings, Bob Hoskins, and Helen Mirren. Jack, played by Caine, was a simple London butcher who loved his friends and his wife. His last orders before passing away were to have his ashes scattered in the sea at Margate, and the tale follows his mates on their journey, woven with flashbacks to his early days with them and the love of his life, Amy.Role: Young Amy was Reilly’s first major role outside of her many British television roles throughout the 1990s. She felt she was being typecast in comedy roles and actively sought a role to prove her dramatic chops. She and JJ Field, who played young Jack, portrayed the early days of the relationship, leading to love, trust, respect, and eventually the deathbed.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Afemo Omilami (Police Chief Holloway)Film: Tigerland (2000,  77%), is the nickname for Fort Polk, an infamous Army training camp in Louisiana. There, a group of recruits go through Advanced Infantry Training as a last stop before entering into the Vietnam War in 1971. The story’s hero is Private Roland Bozz (none other than our Mr. Farrell), an unruly soldier who’s got a problem with authority, disobeying orders and talking back to his superiors all in the hopes of maintaining his humanness, and not giving over to the machine.Role: True Detective isn’t the first time Omilami has gotten to bark orders at Farrell. Fifteen years ago, as Seargent First Class Ezra Landers, he gave Private Roland Bozz tough love and sound advice during training for Vietnam.Watch Trailer&nbsp;James Frain (Lt. Kevin Burris)Film: Hilary and Jackie (1998,  88%)is a film about the famed du Pré sisters — both musical geniuses — based on the book written by Hilary du Pré (played by Rachel Griffiths who was nominated for an Oscar for the role). Cellist Jacqueline du Pré (played by Emily Watson, also nominated for her part) emerges from the shadows of older sister Hilary’s more triumphant childhood successes to become the world-renowned musician — only to develop Multiple Sclerosis. The film was shrouded in controversy because the famous musicians who knew Jackie in real life condemned her sister’s version of the story in the book and film.Role: Daniel Barenboim is the famed pianist married to Jackie, who stays with her until her death in 1987 — despite Jackie’s affair with her sister’s husband, conductor Kiffi Finzi, and despite his own with Russian pianist Elena Bashkirova. Many instruments at play in this story, if you catch our drift.Watch Trailer&nbsp;David Morse (Eliot Bezzerides)Film: The Negotiator (1998,  74%)is the aptly named film about two top Chicago negotiators facing off. Directed by the then only 29-year-old F. Gary Gray (who was known for his high-profile music video direction), Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey star as Danny Roman and Chris Sabian. Roman is a celebrated police officer who finds out that he has been set up as a corrupt cop and a murderer. He takes control of a building in a panic, holding many hostages and will only negotiate with Sabian for his freedom.Role: Although Commander Adam Beck is not the central figure here in a high-stakes situation, he’s the man who is always right there by Sabian’s side. Morse has played many roles that put him in a stern, authoritative position. Perhaps it’s his 6’4″ frame, or perhaps it’s because he’s from Boston and everyone knows you don’t mess with a 6’4″ guy from Boston.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Gallery: 15 California Crime Stories on Film and TVTrue Detective Season Two ReviewsTrue Detective Season Two Photos","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"golden, Freeform, fiction, AMC, Sony","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"8-certified-fresh-gems-starring-the-true-detective-cast"},{"id":"47613281113577","title":"UK Critics Consensus: The Wackness aint Wack, but Babylon Blows","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})UK Critics Consensus: The Wackness aint Wack, but Babylon BlowsVin Diesel sinks while Ben Kingsley swimsby Tom Butler | August 29, 2008 |  CommentsSo the big movies out this week are Vin Diesel-powered Babylon A.D., yet another Judd Apatow-produced comedy about immature losers – Step Brothers with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly – and the 90s coming-of-age teen drama The Wackness, starring a bong-chugging, Olsen twin-snogging knight of the realm, Sir Ben Kingsley. What did the UK critics have to say?Denounced by its director, the Vin Diesel sci-fi action flick Babylon A.D. flops into the cinema with UK critics mirroring the US critics’ response, pretty much universally denouncing it for its indecipherable plot, tacked on action sequences, and wholesale shameless plundering of sci-fi flicks Children of Men and Blade Runner. With the Tomatometer tallying the UK response, Babylon A.D. has shot from a pathetic 0% to a measly 7%. When one of the only positive review reads, “It’s utter codswallop, yet enjoyable if you unplug your brain.” (The Times), you know you’ve got a stinker on your hands.Will Ferrell teams up with John C. Reilly again, and with their last effort Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby garnering a respectable 73% on the Tomatometer, the standards are set high, but can they repeat their success with Step Brothers? It’s had a mixed response from the UK scribes, with the general consensus being that if you like the relentless, absurd and puerile shtick peddled by Farrell and Reilly in Anchorman, Talledega Nights and Semi-Pro, then you’ll fall for Step Brothers too. On the other hand, if the sight of two grown men behaving like 12-year-olds, and sporting prosthetic testicles, seems a bit infantile to you, then steer well clear. Step Brothers is currently the black sheep of the family at 53% on the Tomatometer.Is 1994 too recent to be considered a period piece? The critics didn’t think so with most UK critics rating The Wackness fresh, mainly for the ever-versatile Ben Kingsley’s portrayal of the bong-smoking, long haired, last hippy on the block, Dr Squires, but also for its touching and quirky story of adolescence and love in mid-90s New York. The performances save the movie from its meandering, and at times soppy, sauntering pace, and at 67% on the Tomatometer, it has just enough Dopeness to stop it truly being The Wackness.Also worth checking out…Badlands. Terrence Malick’s 1973 debut gets a limited re-release. This masterpiece is worth seeking out. Currently 100% on the Tomatometer.Times and Winds. Lilting and meditative, Reha Erdem’s story of three adolescents in rural Turkey captivates with intimate details and long takes of the endless countryside. 83% on the Tomatometer.Quote of the Week“A sci-fi actioner that sees bald hero Vin Diesel back, stomping around the future like a small, gun-toting penis.”Babylon A.D. – Larushka Ivan-Zadeh, Metro.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Set, TruTV, USA, ABC, superhero, Rom-Com, Video, Toys, Exclusive, winner, new, who, batman","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"uk-critics-consensus-the-wackness-aint-wack-but-babylon-blows"},{"id":"47613224423891","title":"RT on DVD: Zombie Strippers, Meet Kit Kittredge!","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Zombie Strippers, Meet Kit Kittredge!Plus Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D and more spooky laughs for Halloween.by Jen Yamato | October 27, 2008 |  CommentsFor the week leading up to All Hallow’s Eve, there’s a surprising dearth of new horror releases hitting DVD. Rest assured, though, titillation and scares can be found in a trio of horror comedies (Zombie Strippers, Poultrygeist, and the reissued slasher classic, Pieces). (Watch our interview with Zombie Stripper Jenna Jameson below.) For tamer fare, check out Kit Kittredge, Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D, and Disney’s CGI Tinker Bell.1. New to DVD: Zombie Strippers Unrated Special Edition – 40%If forty percent on the Tomatometer seems surprisingly high for a horror comedy about strippers-turned-walking dead starring former adult actress Jenna Jameson, think about this; it’s about 30 percentage points better than Saw V, and you can watch it in the safety of your own home this Halloween! Zombie Strippers is about, well, undead exotic dancers, who comprise one side of a strangely philosophical battle with their still-human counterparts when a secret government experiment is unleashed upon the unsuspecting denizens of the Rhino club.Do zombies dance better? Are regular old strippers passé without super-human pole dancing skills and a ravenous hunger for human flesh? Find out with the Unrated Special Edition DVD, which includes a few featurettes, deleted scenes, and a commentary track by director Jay Lee and actors Joey Medina, Jenna Jameson, and Robert Englund.Watch our exclusive one-on-one chat with Jameson below!Next: Kit Kittredge: An American Girl2. New to DVD: Kit Kittredge: An American Girl – 78%Resist the urge to dismiss little miss Abigail Breslin, whose star turn in this summer’s period adventure about an intrepid Depression-era girl has put her in the running to overtake Dakota Fanning’s tween queen crown. At 78 percent on the Tomatometer and Certified Fresh, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl is one of this week’s best bets for quality flicks on DVD, so give it a try — and fellas, you don’t have to tell a soul if you enjoy it.Based on the uber-popular children’s doll and book franchise, the film follows aspiring newspaper reporter Kit Kittredge (Breslin) as her family struggles through the Great Depression and she unravels a mysterious rash of crimes. Breslin gets class-act support from an impressive cast of grown-ups that include Julia Ormond, Stanley Tucci, Jane Krakowski, Chris O’Donnell and Joan Cusack. A digital copy and DVD-ROM with bonus content accompany the film.Next: Journey in 3-D3. New to DVD: Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-DThough Jules Verne’s classic sci-fi tale has been adapted before for the screen (some good, some bad), it hadn’t yet been adapted into the future of movie-watching: 3-D. Until now. Brendan Fraser stars in this loose reimagining as Trevor Anderson, a geologist who finds himself in otherworldly underground danger with his teenage nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and an Icelandic hottie (Anita Briem). In three dimensions!Pick up the Limited Edition set for a 2-D cut and a 3-D version, which comes with four pairs of 3-D glasses.Next: Tarantino can’t save this Hell Ride4. New to DVD: Hell Ride – 11%Thanks to the genre-obsessed films of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino (who produced Hell Ride), the B-movie grind house aesthetic has returned to vogue. If only replicating that grimy, gleefully vulgar sensibility consistently translated to compelling cinema. B-movie actor Larry Bishop enlists the likes of Michael Madsen, Eric Balfour, and Dennis Hopper in this gratuitous and indulgent biker movie, written, acted, directed and produced by none other than B-movie actor Larry Bishop.Bishop also shows up on a comprehensive commentary track and making-of featurettes on the “Bikes,” the “Babes,” and the “Guys” of Hell Ride.Next: Pledge Delta with Animal House 30th Anniversary set5. New to DVD: Animal House 30th Anniversary Set – 89%Did you ever wish you could live amongst the irreverent, partying brothers of Delta Tau Chi fraternity? Well, now you can take home the Delta house itself, in an all new Animal House 30th Anniversary DVD housed in the most raucous domicile of Faber College.The collegiate gross-out comedy classic from director John Landis celebrates middle age with a 2-disc Special Edition ($19.98) and gift set package ($34.98) that include all-new special features, Scene-It trivia games, and reunion interviews with the cast and filmmakers. Drop a few more bucks for the frat house-shaped gift set, which also includes a new 98-minute documentary and a collectible yearbook.Next: Tinker Bell’s starring debut6. New to DVD: Tinker BellFollow Disney into the 21st century with this CGI-animated spin-off film starring Peter Pan’s beloved fairy BFF, Tinker Bell. In her first solo adventure, Tinker Bell (voiced by Mae Whitman, AKA George Michael Bluth’s girlfriend “Bland” Ann Veal, who reportedly beat Brittany Murphy for the role) arrives in the town of Pixie Hollow to determine her destiny, meeting plenty of A-list fairies along the way (voiced by Kristin Chenowith, Lucy Liu, America Ferrera, Anjelica Huston, and more). But what’s a Disney film without musical numbers? And will such a familiar character hold up to the liberties taken in the name of updating Tinker Bell’s legend for children of today (speaking for the first time, for example)?Tots will likely be enraptured, as will anyone who recognizes the names Jesse McCartney (who voice acts), Katharine McPhee, and Selena Gomez (who contribute songs to the soundtrack).Next: The lens turns on celeb photographer Annie Leibovitz.7. New to DVD: Annie Leibovitz: Life Through a LensHaving shot some of the most iconic celebrity photographs in the last few decades (John Lennon on the eve of his death, Demi Moore nude and pregnant, and Miley Cyrus most recently), it’s about time photographer Annie Leibovitz got her own documentary. Shot, written, and directed by Leibovitz’s sister Barbara, Life Through a Lens follows Leibovitz at work snapping celebrities, interviewing a handful of them about their photo shoot experiences while discussing the life and career of the woman who gave Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair some of their most intimate celebrity portraits ever.Next: Brazilian police get brutal in Elite Squad8. New to DVD: Elite Squad – 50%If you enjoyed 2002’s City of God, check out another crime drama set in the heart of Brazil’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Based on the nonfiction book Elite de Tropa, about Rio de Janeiro’s elite BOPE special police force, Elite Squad follows police captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) as he struggles to find his own replacement before retiring. While critics split over the brutal, violent tale, this is precisely the type of film that finds a life on DVD.Next: Troma flies with Poultrygeist9. PoultrygeistThose familiar (and amused by) the antics of Lloyd Kaufman and his merry band of indie moviemakers will thrill at the latest Troma release, a horror musical-comedy that shows what could happen when a fast-food fried chicken restaurant gets built over the burial grounds of ancient native Americans: homicidal ghost-chickens! Kaufman himself directs and makes an appearance; Ron Jeremy shows up playing a character named “Crazy Ron.” Cinephiles, skip directly to the next entry!Next: Our Halloween slasher pick of the week!10. Halloween Slasher Pick of the Week: PiecesJust in time for Halloween, pick up this 1982 cult horror flick and prepare yourself for one of the most outrageous, gory, and audacious slasher films ever made! In Pieces, a killer is on the loose at a Boston college, murdering his victims with a chainsaw to build a puzzle out of pieces of flesh. Throw in a random scene of kung-fu and a finale to remember, and Pieces earns its place among the schlockiest of schlock classics.

For family audiences there is the animated extravaganza Kung Fu Panda starring Jack Black while Adam Sandler counters with his latest laughfest aimed at young men, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan. The new choices will offer some variety to a marketplace dominated by the female-skewing event pic Sex and the City and the old-school adventure tale Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. With so many worthy choices, and four movies likely to top $20M, it looks to be a sizzling session at the box office as the top five films alone have the strength to beat the entire Top 20 from a year ago.Jack Black leaps into theaters anchoring Kung Fu Panda playing a Chinese panda bear who trains to become a martial arts expert in order to save his village. The PG-rated toon features voices from a wide array of actors including Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen, Ian McShane, and Jackie Chan. The marketplace is certainly ready for a major family film right now. Since March’s Horton Hears a Who, there really hasn’t been anything major to excite this lucrative audience segment. Last month saw two high profile PG-rated pics, but the dark and violent The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian has attracted half of the crowd of its predecessor while Speed Racer was an all-out disaster. With summer vacations getting closer and closer, children of all ages are pumped for something fun and exciting to go and see.In the DreamWorks stable, Kung Fu Panda should post one of the largest openings for a non-sequel animated entry. It even has the potential to set a new high. Currently, 2004’s Shark Tale and 2005’s Madagascar are tops with $47.6M and $47.2M, respectively. At today’s ticket prices those would be in the low $50M range. Panda has similar features like having a popular comedian in the lead. Dramatic actors add little to the box office strength of an animated film with their voices, even big A listers. But when comedians are at the center and are allowed to improvise and add their own sense of humor, moviegoers cheer. Panda also has the type of comedy that will be loved by adults as well as by kids. Good marks from critics won’t hurt either.The marketing has been solid. The concept is familiar with a young talking animal going after his dreams while the Asian setting adds something new. Big business should be had with kids of single-digit age since recent family offerings have been too risqué for parents to buy tickets for. Plus direct competition is close to zero making for a perfect time to strike. Attacking over 3,600 theaters, Kung Fu Panda may eat up around $52M this weekend.Jack Black as the voice of Po in Kung Fu PandaFor zany humor from characters that are more human ticket buyers have another choice this weekend as Adam Sandler returns with his latest escapade in You Don’t Mess With the Zohan. The PG-13 film reunites the comedy superstar for the fourth time with director Dennis Dugan after Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, and last summer’s I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Zohan finds the former SNL star playing the title character, a first-rate commando in Israel’s armed forces who escapes to New York to pursue his true passion of hairstyling. Sandler hopes this will do for him what Coming to America did for Eddie Murphy two decades ago this very month.No comedian has been more consistent at the box office this decade than Sandler who has scored $100M+ grossers over the last six consecutive years. Aside from Will Smith, no other Hollywood star can claim such a streak. Plus not since the Harold and Kumar sequel has there been a comedy aimed at young males. And after all the media attention that Carrie Bradshaw and pals have gotten in the past week, guys may be ready for some testosterone-fueled fun.However, Sandler fans are not known to be all that into Israeli soldiers or hairdressers so subject matter could be a problem. Last July’s Chuck and Larry bowed at number one with $34.2M, but it was also the funnyman’s lowest opener for a broad comedy since 2000’s Little Nicky. Maybe the combination of a ridiculously long title and a not-so-macho storyline could prevent Sandler from reaching his usual $40M debut mark again this weekend. In addition, the comedian is straying from his natural voice for the first time since Nicky which doesn’t bode well either. Fans like it best when Adam plays Adam, just a regular American dude getting himself into comical situations. Infiltrating over 3,300 theaters, You Don’t Mess With The Zohan could debut with around $35M.Sandler is The ZohanPanda and Zohan kick off an unusually light June release schedule which will see fewer wide releases than normal. In fact across all four of the month’s weekends only two competitors enter wide release each session for a total of eight major players. Looking at the last several years there have always been 10 to 12 wide releases over the same time period. Studios are hoping that each film this June will have some extra breathing room to find its audience and not get stomped on a week later by a barrage of four pictures cramming into multiplexes at the same time.In limited release, Picturehouse will platform its Oscar-nominated historical epic Mongol in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The subtitled story of the rise of Genghis Khan features a cast assembled from across Asia and is directed by the acclaimed Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov. Though it lost out to The Counterfeiters in the foreign language race this year, it still is being aggressively marketed to arthouse moviegoers and fans of world cinema. Mongol expands to major markets on June 20.Sergei Bodrov’s MongolLast weekend, the 179 years of life experience of Parker–Cattrall–Davis–Nixon pulled an upset victory over the 190 years of Ford–Spielberg–Lucas as it was truly no country for old men. But the boys will try to beat out the girls this time around for the title of top holdover in what will certainly be a much closer race.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will face some competition for young men from Zohan while families will be tempted away by Paramount’s own Panda. But adult men will still be focused on the Communist-fighting whip man so a 45% drop could result leaving a $24M frame. That would propel the cume to a stunning $254M after 18 days.Sex and the City shocked the industry with its stellar $56.8M bow last weekend. Also impressive were the sturdy grosses of $5.5M a piece on Monday and Tuesday this week. But the sizable 34% Friday-to-Saturday tumble showed how much demand was absorbed on that first day which was essentially an after-work girls-night-out for fans. Word-of-mouth has been good, but so much of the target audience has already been reached so a big drop is likely even though the new releases are not direct competitors. Panda however will take many thirtysomething and fortysomething mothers out of the picture. A 60% fall could occur giving the New Line-Warner Bros. flick roughly $23M – still a full-figured number. That would give Sex a fabulous $100M in just ten days.Universal’s The Strangers was a surprise hit last weekend posting the best horror movie opening of 2008. But a fast fade is likely so sales could slump by 55% to about $9.5M. That would give the Rogue production a solid $37M in ten days. Iron Man is steadily closing in on that triple-century mark. The super hero smash should dip by 35% to around $9M boosting the cume to $290M.LAST YEAR: The summer of threequels moved forward with Ocean’s Thirteen which bowed at number one with $36.1M for Warner Bros. on its way to $117.2M domestically and $311M worldwide. That put the bad boys behind the $363M of Twelve and the $444M of Eleven. Disney’s Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End dropped to second after two weeks on top with $21.1M breaking the quarter-billion mark in just over 17 days. Universal’s Knocked Up, the first of two pregnancy comedy hits in 2007 to sail past $140M, followed with $19.6M in its sophomore frame. Sony’s animated penguin film Surf’s Up debuted in fourth with a respectable $17.6M leading to a $58.9M final. Rival toon Shrek the Third sat in fifth with $15.3M. The horror sequel Hostel Part II struggled in its opening weekend taking in $8.2M or less than half the bow of its predecessor a year earlier. Lionsgate reached $17.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Women's, green, justice, movies, to, TV, Rey, AMC, Reality, Guide, anthology, singing, Awards, IFC, Fox","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-preview-black-vs-sandler-in-comedy-showdown"},{"id":"47613222718930","title":"Edinburgh 2008: What to Watch","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Edinburgh 2008: What to WatchWe share twenty of the best movies screened.by RT Staff | July 1, 2008 |  CommentsThe Edinburgh International Film Festival is well underway in the Scottish city, screening hundreds of brand new films and cramming A-listers into posh hotel suites. This year, Rotten Tomatoes is proud to be an official media partner of the festival, and we’ll be presenting an award to one of the films in the programme. Click here for more information.The festival has, in the past, played home to the world premiere of Serenity and the European first-show for Clerks II. Its programme is open to the public, and provides a wide variety of home-grown, European, American and international cinema. Last year’s festival saw two of the freshest movies of the year play to UK audiences for the first time – Knocked Up and Ratatouille – and they were joined by the indie likes of Hallam Foe and French warbler Les Chansons d’Amour.In short, there’s something for everyone of every age, gender and nationality, and it’s probably one of the most relaxed and, in turn, exciting festivals on the calendar. It’s also a good place to start or join in that ever-exciting early awards buzz, and with that in mind we thought it’d be a good idea to let you know what we think of the films on display so you can add them to your wish-list.We’ve picked twenty interesting films from the programme so far to tell you all about. If you didn’t make it to the festival, this is your guide to the hot films to look out for in the coming months!Set in London at the beginning of the Second World War, The Edge of Love revolves around charmingly scruffy poet Dylan Thomas (played by Matthew Rhys), famed for his intense, romantic verse, and the two loves of his life – wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and childhood sweetheart Vera (Keira Knightley).The material lets the talented ensemble produce career best work; Knightley, despite an initially jarring Welsh accent, is pitch perfect as the slightly naive but banterous Vera, whilst Miller impresses hugely with her portrayal of an emotionally damaged, promiscuous pleasure-seeker.It’s all fairly depressing, and not entirely convincing, with the spiralling self-destruction on show dredging up all the ‘tortured poet and his muse’ clichï¿½s found in a million bad TV literary adaptations. The result is a well-intentioned but ultimately unsuccessful stab as serious, romantic drama that is not as clever or affecting as it thinks it is. Orlando ParfittRobert Carlyle makes a welcome return to form in Summer, an intelligent and brilliantly-acted family drama. The Scot plays Shaun, an embittered middle aged man who spends much of his time reluctantly caring for his wheelchair bound best friend Daz. The film goes onto examine what bought him to this point in his life, uncovering years of misfortune, bad decisions and an uncaring establishment. Shaun then looks back with rose-tinted glasses at his youth and yearns for the freedom’s of his salad days, before his troubles began. Fairly bleak to-to-be-sure, but intensely moving and powerful too, thanks to the emotionally resonant central performances. OPWith Donkey Punch, you get two great movies for the price of one; a brilliantly set-up, marvellously tense teen thriller, and a barmy, magnificently over-the-top slasher horror. It’s just a shame they’re shoe-horned together in the same film.We begin with a trio of girls from Leeds, Northern England, on holiday in Mallorca and getting ready for a night on the tiles. Eventually they meet up with four good-looking men who persuade them to continue their night on a yacht they’ve ‘borrowed’ from the harbour master.Things suddenly take a turn for the nightmarish however when one of the men delivers the donkey punch of the title (we won’t reveal what it is, but it’s kind of disgusting). She drops dead, and now the lads must try and get rid of the body and calm down the two remaining girls.It’s a brilliant set-up, but suddenly a new film cranks into action, as the girls begin picking off the lads one-by-one in increasingly bizarre, over-the-top and hilarious ways. Those with a strong stomach should still definitely seek out Donkey Punch – a refreshing, if maddeningly schizophrenic antidote Hollywood norm. OPVery rarely does RT get shocked, sickened or appalled at the cinema these days. This little indie horror film at Edinburgh turned out to have one of the highest concentrations of sheer wrongness we’ve ever seen – in a good way.Mum and Dad revolves around airport cleaner and Romanian immigrant Lena who, one night, after a series of misadventures, finds herself unable to get back home. ‘Luckily’ her seemingly-happy-go-lucky colleague Birdie offers her a bed for night with her family. Thinking her troubles are over, at least in the short term, Lena accepts, but the invitation turns out to be a one way ticket to a hellishly violent, sadistic suburban hell.Birdie’s sinister ‘family’ includes ‘Mum’ — a barmy, torture-obsessed housewife whose sadistic deeds are made all the more shocking by her maternal pretentions — and ‘Dad’, a fat, greasy sexual predator who wears a party hat. So begins a nightmarish journey for Lena as she is forced to abandon all humanity to escape this twisted family unit.if you’re a hardcore horror fan and have a strong constitution — and have a healthy disregard for family values – then you should check this out, just don’t say we didn’t warn you! OPA deserved winner of the Golden Bear in Berlin this summer, Elite Squad, Jose Padilha‘s testosterone-fuelled actioner revolves around Nascimento, commanding officer of BOPE, the hard-as-nails paramilitary wing of Rio’s police force entrusted with keeping order in the cities drug-cursed favelas.Macho and ultra-violent, the director defiantly take sides in the drug war through blaming both drug dealers and their rich clients for the violence and social problems their trade creates. However Elite Squad is more even handed than some have suggested, with Padilha not shying from showing the brutality of BOPEs methods and the widespread corruption in the police force. OPAn amusing exercise in ’90s nostalgia, The Wackness is anything but wack…It’s New York in 1994; Cobain has just shot himself, Biggie and Tupac are still friends and Giuliani has only just been elected mayor. Experiencing it all is Luke (played by former child star Josh Peck) a self-confessed loser in his last year at high school – and also a part-time pot dealer.We meet him in the office of one of his clients – and best friend – Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley), a self-medicating psychiatrist. The film then follows the pair through one long, hot, life-changing summer.It’s the often hilarious script that stays in the mind. Kingsley generally gets the best lines (when Luke tells him he feels down, he asks “is it because of Kurt Cobain?”), and despite a wavering New York accent, shows a real flair for comedy. OPStandard Operating Procedure is essential viewing, but often difficult to watch. Master documentary maker Errol Morris (who won an Oscar for his Robert McNamara interview The Fog of War) sits down with (almost) all of the prison guards responsible for the sickening scenes of prisoner humiliation and torture that emerged from Abu Ghraib prison in the aftermath of the Iraq war.You may find Morris’ empathy with his subjects, almost all of whom show little remorse for their heinous acts, hard to bear, but it’s arguable that by simply letting these individuals have their say they damn themselves far more than any liberal commentator could. Documentary at its most powerful and timely. OPImagine the basic conceit of Groundhog Day — a man is forced to relive the same day over-and-over again – re-imagined as an atmospheric, jolly creepy Spanish horror film and you’ll be somewhere near to Timecrimes.This superbly sinister effort follows Hector — an ordinary suburban guy who one night glimpses a naked woman through the trees. He goes outside to investigate, but finds himself attacked by a rather angry and aggressive man with a bandage head.The movie is at its most effective in the opening scenes in the woods, with director Nacho Vigalondo proving adapt at conjuring scares and making guys with bandaged heads look very creepy indeed. Timecrimes, along with the similarly well-produced Spanish-horror-thriller [Rec], proves the Iberian peninsula a fertile breeding ground for brilliantly made frighteners with brains. OPAfter the success of This is England, Shane Meadows returns with Somers Town, a smaller-scale but still hugely affecting film again revolving around adolescents on the margins of society.Thomas Turgoose (spectacular as the young skinhead in England) plays Tomo, a teenager from Nottingham who — for reasons that are never explained — arrives by train in London despite not knowing a soul and having nowhere to go. After he’s mugged and loses all his money, he befriends Marek, a Polish boy living with his builder father. They soon become close friends, and both lust after the hot French waitress who works in their local cafe.It’s a simple, almost plotless story, but one that is made immensely powerful by the characteristically superb and naturalistic performances. The simple shooting style – the film is shot in black and white and features little camera movement – amplifies the bonhomie and natural chemistry of the two young leads as they embark on a series of hilarious scrapes. OPA spectacularly silly, amusing and gory examination of the world’s problems with fossil fuels, Blood Car is set to become a cult favourite.Set in the near future – with cars rendered almost non-existent by the scarcity of oil – this low budget effort centres around Archie; an ultra environmentally conscious vegan kindergarten teacher who has been trying to build a car that runs on vegetable juice.One day, with the car engine refusing to run on the fauna-based liquid, he accidently cuts his hand, a drop of blood dripping into the contraption and immediately starting the motor. The result? Green fingered Archie has inadvertently invented a car that runs on human blood.It’s a hilariously dark stuff that feels like it could have evolved from a Grindhouse fake trailer. A deliciously tasteless scene towards the end of the film, featuring a trigger-happy government agent and Archie’s kindergarten class, is worth the price of admission alone. OPThe Edinburgh Film Festival drew to a close at the weekend with the world premiere of Faintheart, a sweet and sentimental romantic comedy set in the world of Viking re-enactments.Faintheart revolves around Richard (Eddie Marsan), an overgrown kid who is far happier brandishing his broad-sword in battle than he is in facing up to family responsibilities at home. When he misses his father-in-law’s funeral in favour of a Viking brawl, wife Cath (Jessica Hynes) kicks him out, leading our hero on a quest of the heart as he struggles to win her back with the help of his Norse chums.It’s charming stuff, played for laughs by a uniformly excellent cast and the script is chock-full of comic gems, laughing along with its subjects without ever actually poking fun at them. The result is a fine family film that is sure to leave a smile on your face. Chris TillyPhilippe Petit‘s successful 1974 attempt to cross the gap between the Twin Towers on a tightrope is documented in this kinetic film from James Marsh as a fast-paced caper about a charismatic Frenchman’s drive to do something outrageously necessary. From the moment the Man on Wire starts we’re introduced to Petit as a man with passion and belief who is convinced that these two buildings were built for him to cross.What follows is an examination of the method behind the madness, as the sheer endurance trial that was the planning of the event is shared through Petit and his key collaborators. He spent 45 minutes on wire, but rigging it, sneaking the rigging into the building and planning the entire operation took years, stretching right back to a news article he read in a dentist’s office about the Twin Towers’ construction. The film leaves its audience in no doubt that Petit is special and that this act of rebellion – the walk was totally illegal – was his gift to the world. Absolutely gripping stuff. Joe UtichiIt’s hard to know how much to reveal about Let the Right One In. Such is the nature of the film’s delicate plotting that it’ll prove to be a different but equally fulfilling experience should you be aware of its subject matter or not before you watch it. Like Pan’s Labyrinth, the film’s fantastical elements disguise the real human drama of its characters and while it might, on the surface, appear to be a new twist on a familiar genre, at its heart it’s one of the most original coming-of-age stories in years.As Oskar, young actor Kåre Hedebrant’s confident performance is at turns sweetly innocent and surprisingly dark. If your tolerance for foreign-language films is limited, let this film change your mind. If the idea of a coming-of-age story fills you with dread, let it convince you otherwise. In fact, if you only see one film that’s off the beaten path this year, you’d do very well to let the right one in. JUWhen an old man (Brian Cox), fishing by a river, is forced to witness a group of young hoodlums shoot his dog he becomes determined to see justice prevail; pursuing the boys’ fathers (Tom Sizemore and Robert Englund) to encourage them to punish their sons and, when that fails, turning to the law. Red is a heartrending tale of a man who has lost everything trying and who is desperately to hold onto what’s right, Brian Cox is relentless in the lead role, delivering a stunning and strangely disturbing performance as he seeks retribution.The film may go a little too far before the end, but for the most part it’s brilliantly gripping with shades of Stephen King about its thrilling structure. JUWalter is a sad, lonely, embittered Connecticut teacher whose life has been on a downward spiral since the passing of his wife. However, all of that changes when he is sent to New York to present a paper on economics, and arrives to discover an immigrant couple living in his long-forgotten apartment. Understandably perturbed, Walter kicks them to the kerb, but compassion leads him to go after them and invite the strangers into his empty home.The Visitor is stirring, heartbreaking stuff, told at a stately pace perfectly in keeping with the story unfolding. Director Thomas McCarthy truly gives his characters time to breathe, and as their story slowly plays out, it’s impossible not to be swept up in the gut-wrenching emotion of it all. He’s helped out by a grandstanding performance from Richard Jenkins as Walter. It’s brilliantly multi-layered and full of subtlety and nuance.Combined with McCarthy’s economic script – which brilliantly deals with the sensitive topic of immigration without ever feeling preachy or patronising — it makes for a magical movie-going experience that will provoke thought, discussion, sadness and joy in equal measure. Truly outstanding stuff. CTOne of the most powerful documentaries in a long time, Alone in Four Walls introduces us to the inmates of a Russian prison for boys aged 11-14, interspersing their daily activities with tales of their crimes from the boys themselves and from their families and victims. It’s hard to know what to feel about these inmates as they go through the usual struggles of adolescence and the regional struggles of poverty on one hand and then we’re told, in police report detail, what found them in the institution to begin with.Emotionally harrowing, with an incredible attention to cinematography, this, like all documentaries should be, is a window on a world we’ll never come across, but more than that it’s a frighteningly appropriate film for a world in the throes of increasing teenage violent crime. Want to keep kids out of jail? Showing them this would be a good place to start. JUWerner Herzog returns to documentary filmmaking with Encounters at the End of the World, this time travelling to Antarctica to share stories about the people who call the frozen continent home. Starting off, and frequently returning to his base in McMurdo, a desolately grey and dreadfully functional town that most in Antarctica call home.Herzog’s typically editorialised commentary singes the film with humour, as he shares with us his insistence to financiers that he wouldn’t be travelling all that way to make another movie about penguins, though, of course, he finds a researcher to plug with questions about the flightless birds’ sexual proclivities and mental instabilities. There are moments of extreme humour as he interrupts a woman’s tales of her travels by opining that “her story goes on forever,” and wonders how many languages have died in the time he’s been talking to a man who’s explaining, at great length, how often languages die.But, equally, there are scenes that seem extended for no reason other than to keep the running time feature length and while Herzog finds plenty of characters, few of them seem compelling enough to warrant the journey. People who call Antarctica home are bound to be slightly weird by our standards, but are they really as crazy as Herzog seemed to hope on his journey out there, or are they just people doing their job exploring extremes so that we don’t have to? JUNot only is WALL*E one of the freshest films of the year – some critics have even thrown around the word ‘masterpiece’ like they believe it this time – but it’s also one of the loveliest, most charming and most accomplished animated films of all time. Pixar’s tale of a little robot, WALL*E, who dreams of a new companion in the shape of a sleek and shiny probe called EVE is a testament to Pixar’s emphasis on story and emotion.It shouldn’t work – not in an era of big, noisy and exposition-heavy event movies – and yet it really, truly does. Within a few minutes without even a hint of dialogue the film has you totally invested in this little character’s journey and you’re with him right until the end. Combine such a strong core with some of the most beautiful and creative artwork ever seen on screen and WALL*E deserves to be remembered as a proper classic. JUThe Black Balloon is a typically-bright but satisfyingly-dark Australian drama about a teenage boy, Thomas Mollison (Rhys Wakefield), whose autistic brother Charlie (Luke Ford) requires constant attention and whose acting out is starting to put a strain on the friendships Thomas is developing at a new school. When a girl comes along, in the form of a beautiful school friend, Thomas’ relationship with his brother, and parents who’ve largely ignored him to take care of Charlie, will be tested.Toni Collette and Erik Thomson co-star, but it’s really a movie for Wakefield and Ford, with the latter particularly brilliant as the autistic Charlie. It’s a selfish side of caring that’s rarely witnessed but inevitably present; a teenager’s desire for a “normal” brother and a relationship with his parents that’s hampered by the special needs of his sibling and it’s handled delicately and emotionally without delivering and overly-sentimental piece. JUMancora will be compared to Y Tu Mama Tambien, being that it’s about a sexually-charged road trip involving three hot, young things in a Spanish-speaking country, but there’s something decidedly more real about the consequences of these actions. As incest makes way to tribal drug trips, the characters go on hard, real journeys and push themselves to their limits, perhaps in an attempt to find some feeling within them: as the film begins, our lead, Santiago, has lost his father to suicide and finds that he’s disillusioned with his surroundings.But, rather disappointingly, the film quite simply isn’t as entertaining as Alfonso Cuaron‘s predecessor, and the conclusion of the journey feels false and all too convenient. Nevertheless, it’s of a high quality and should make stars of its leads if it’s given the exposure in North America that it deserves. It certainly marks Ricardo de Montreuil as a director to watch.

She was 91.The Academy Award-nominated actress’ career began on Broadway in the early 1940s; Dee’s big-screen breakthrough was in The Jackie Robinson Story, playing opposite the legendary ballplayer himself, in 1950. She gained widespread critical acclaim for her performance in the 1961 film adaptation of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun opposite Sidney Poitier.

But why should we stop there? We’re proud to announce the imminent launch of RTArt — for the first time ever, we’ll be applying the Tomatometer to paintings!Our Tomatometer scores will be based on the aggregated reviews of art critics from hundreds of sources, both contemporary and historic; the list includes reviews from newspapers, websites, magazines, stone tablets, scrolls, and oral histories.We have a lot of great things planned for RTArt, and we plan to expand our coverage and add new features in the coming weeks. Since humans have been making art for more than 40,000 years, we’ve decided to focus on painting for the time being. If all goes well, we will start to assign Tomatometers to works from other artistic disciplines, including sculpture, photography, architecture, textiles, ceramics, graffiti, origami, and performance art.Getting our art section up and running has been a massive undertaking. Each member of the RT staff has had to take extensive art history courses and become fluent in French, Latin, German, Arabic, and Japanese. Given that many older reviews aren’t online, we’ve had to travel around the globe to find original reviews; many were written in arcane languages and were printed on fragile materials. Hazards abounded: While searching for reviews for an Albrecht Dürer triptych in the basement of a medieval church in Fischland, Germany, editor Ryan Fujitani unwittingly awakened the spirit of a malevolent Saxon warrior.Our beta launch is fast approaching, but we’ll be making some adjustments for a while, and we definitely value your feedback. So please take a tour through our virtual museum, and remember — you can’t spell “art” without RT!When you visit the RTArt pages, here’s what you can find:(Click on the image to see a full-size version)","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Marvel, space, classics, Turner, Purge, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"introducing-rtart"},{"id":"47613269790179","title":"Filmmaker to Wear Multiple Hats on Prehistoric \"Erectus\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Filmmaker to Wear Multiple Hats on Prehistoric \"Erectus\"by Scott Weinberg | October 11, 2005 |  CommentsFilmmaker Adam Rifkin will write, direct, and star in the caveman comedy \"Homo Erectus,\" says The Hollywood Reporter.

It’s also your week to catch films you might have missed in theaters, from Jennifer Aniston’s tale of puppy love (Marley &amp; Me) to the latest heart-wrencher from Will Smith (Seven Pounds). Those who dare to go foreign will be justly rewarded with two well-reviewed imports (the French thriller Tell No One and the Spanish sci-fi Timecrimes), while art-house devotees have two remastered Wong Kar-Wai films to choose from (Happy Together and Fallen Angels). Horror fans have an octet of new flicks to check out (After Dark Horror Fest 8 Films to Die For)…and did we mention the sweet new Blu-ray that should be on the top of any philosophical cyberpunk’s wishlist (The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray Digibook)?Slumdog Millionaire — 94%Jai Ho it up this week with the multiple Oscar-winning feel-good hit, Slumdog Millionaire! Danny Boyle‘s Dickensian Best Picture-winner, about an Indian working-class hero who competes on the Hindi version of Who Wants to Be A Millionaire, won over audiences and critics last year thanks to energetic filmmaking, a sweetly romantic story, and its exotic, catchy soundtrack. (That end-sequence Bollywood number, set to composer A.R. Rahman’s Oscar-winning song, “Jai Ho,” didn’t hurt either; even Ellen DeGeneres couldn’t resist recreating the dance on her daytime talk show.) If you missed the Little Film That Could in theaters (it narrowly avoided the ignominy of a direct-to-video release), you can bring it home today and relive all the feel-goodness of our most recent Oscar season.Slumdog Millionaire comes to DVD in single-disc and Blu-ray releases. I know, single-disc; these days getting just one disc in a new release seems a bit skimpy, but Fox Home Entertainment has actually packed a decent host of extras here, including a commentary track by Best Director Boyle and star Dev Patel and a second commentary with writer Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson (both of whom won Oscars for their work). The DVD also includes a dozen deleted scenes. On Blu-ray you’ll get the above, plus additional behind-the-scenes featurettes, a music video, and a short film by newbie Rahi Anil Bharve (Manjha) which was hand-picked by Boyle.Want more of the Bollywood-meets-Hollywood genre? Check out Desperate Housewives hottie Jesse Metcalfe in the cross-global romance The Other End of the Line (27%), in which he romances Bollywood star Shriya Saran.Below, watch an exclusive deleted scene from Slumdog Millionaire.Next: Aniston, Wilson, and Marley &amp; MeMarley &amp; Me — 60%Everyone knows there’s nothing cuter than a puppy, a fact well-exploited by the filmmakers behind Marley &amp; Me. (If you haven’t seen it yet, we recommend you do your best to avoid spoilers.) Based on the non-fiction bestseller by John Grogan, Marley &amp; Me follows a couple (Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson) and their adventures with their beloved-but-rambunctious yellow Labrador, Marley. Though critics called it only sporadically funny, this sentimental flick is a must-see for pet owners and animal-lovers — especially the kind that lets their dogs kiss them on the mouth. (It’s really unsanitary, people.) Pick up the 2-Disc Bad Dog Edition for a ton of extended/deleted scenes, a director commentary, making-of featurettes, a PSA for animal adoption, a gag reel, and more.Next: Will Smith in Seven PoundsSeven Pounds — 28%Superstar Will Smith has got range to rival any working actor in Hollywood (Six Degrees of Separation — drama! Independence Day — action! Ali — boxing!) and part of what’s impressive about him is his ever-varying career path. Unfortunately for Smith, he decided to follow up his blockbuster flicks I Am Legend and Hancock with Seven Pounds, a gimmicky thriller about an auditor on a secret mission involving seven strangers — a twisty, complicated schmaltz fest that critics tore to pieces. Deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes (including one on a particularly deadly species of jellyfish) and a commentary by director Gabriele Muccino (who directed Smith in the superior Pursuit of Happyness) accompany the film.Next: French thrills in Tell No OneTell No One — 93%You may not have heard of this French import thriller, but the fact that it made numerous critics’ Top Ten lists last year should be reason to check it out this week on DVD. Eight years after his wife’s murder, a doctor (Francoise Cluzet) is pulled into a web of intrigue when his dead wife resurfaces, alive and well. Actor-director Guillaume Canet helms this twisty thriller, with a supporting cast led by Kristin Scott Thomas, Francois Berleand (the Transporter trilogy), and Marie-Josée Croze (Munich‘s Dutch assassin).Next: A time-travel movie that actually makes sense!Timecrimes — 86%First time director Nacho Vigalondo (who earned an Oscar nomination for his 2003 short film, 7:35 de la Mañana) makes an impressive feature-length debut with Timecrimes, a Spanish-language science-fiction black comedy about one ordinary man who, thanks to a fateful encounter with a time travel machine, must contend with and battle alternate versions of himself. Critics loved the lo-fi thriller, noting that — against all odds — its sci-fi logic just might make the most sense of any time travel movie ever made. Hollywood liked Timecrimes, too — an English-language remake is already in the works. See the original this week and get a jump on your fellow movie geeks.Next: Don’t even try to pronounce it – CthulhuCthulhu — 58%Based on the H.P. Lovecraft novella The Shadow Over Innsmouth, this indie horror pic follows a history professor (Jason Cottle) to his Pacific Northwest home town, where he becomes embroiled in a local New Age cult who he believes plans a mass human sacrifice. The townsfolk are a weird bunch — Tori Spelling plays one, for example (and sexually assaults our hero to boot, blech) — who worship a fabled sea creature. While more gay panic allegory than straight up science fiction, Cthulhu will find its own cult audience among Lovecraft geeks, who incidentally are the only ones with any clue as to how you pronounce “Cthulhu.”Next: Two classic Vincente Minnelli musicals come to Blu-rayAn American in Paris Blu-ray — 98%, Gigi Blu-ray — 73%It’s hard to say what portion of the Blu-ray audience will overlap with the demographic for these classic musicals, but if you’re a Playstation 3-owning grandma, have we got the new releases for you! Golden Age auteur Vincente Minnelli directed actress Leslie Caron in both films (both also written by the writing team of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe), which have been given the Blu-ray treatment in honor of Warner Bros.’ 85th Anniversary. In An American in Paris (1951), Caron gets wooed by American expatriate Gene Kelly to Gershwin tunes like “I Got Rhythm,” “S’Wonderful,” and “Our Love is Here To Stay.” In Gigi (1958), Caron is a turn-of-the-century Parisian girl being groomed as a courtesan who falls for Louis Jordan (AKA Kamal Khan from Octopussy). Both Blu-ray releases include extras ported over from their previous 2-Disc Special Editions, which are great for fans of Old Hollywood.Next: A Wong Kar-Wai double bill — Happy Together and Fallen AngelsHappy Together — 78%Lyrical filmmaker Wong-Kar Wai made his international breakthrough with this tragic romance about an on-and-off gay Chinese couple living as expatriates in Argentina. Working with the late Hong Kong pop star Leslie Cheung (who had previously starred in Wong’s Days of Being Wild and Ashes of Time) as the promiscuous Po-Wing, and fellow Wong collaborator Tony Leung Chiu-Wai (Ashes of Time, In the Mood For Love, 2046) as his lover, Lai Yiu-Fai, Wong won the Best Director prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The new Kino Special Edition offers a remastered cut of the film, a previously-released making-of documentary, trailers and stills, and a 2008 feature from Wong Kar-Wai’s career retrospective at the Museum of the Moving Image.The director’s 1995 film about a Hong Kong hitman and his agent, Fallen Angels (95%), is also available on a new Special Edition this week.Next: The After Dark HorrorFest III collectionAfter Dark HorrorFest 8 Films to Die For — N/AHorror fans have eight new titles to look forward to, as the third annual After Dark HorrorFest slate comes to DVD. Horrors range from cannibals (Slaughter) to cults (Perkins’ 14), to unnecessary sequels (The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations), and include Korean horror (Voices) and pics with familiar faces (Autopsy, starring Robert Patrick , Michael Bowen, and 90210’s Jessica Lowndes). Rounding out the octet are an Australian outback flick (Dying Breed, starring Saw scribe Leigh Whannell), a suicide thriller (From Within, featuring Rumer Willis and The Sarah Connor Chronicles’ Thomas Dekker), and the Lena Headey vehicle The Broken, which is surprisingly helmed by Brit newcomer Sean Ellis (Cashback).Next: Celebrate the 10th Anniversary of The Matrix!The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray DigiBook — 86%There may be no spoon, but this week, there is a must-have Blu-ray: The Matrix 10th Anniversary Blu-ray Book, which brings the essential existential sci-fi adventure to Blu-ray for the first time as a single-film release. Of course, if you already own either the Matrix Trilogy or Ultimate Matrix Collections on Blu-ray, this will be an unnecessary addition to your library — but if not, take advantage of this title, which comes in digibook packaging that includes a 47-page booklet crammed with Matrix trivia. Special features on the Blu-ray are plentiful and include a digital copy of the film, four expert commentary tracks, a feature-length documentary and much more.Until next week, happy renting!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"CMT, Horror, MSNBC, TV, remakes, blockbuster, Cartoon, ITV, justice, One, and, marvel, spanish","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-Exclusive-Slumdog-Millionaire-Clip-Seven-Pounds-and-The-Matrix-10th-Anniversary-Blu-ray"},{"id":"47613273473509","title":"Spirit Award Nominees Announced","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Spirit Award Nominees AnnouncedI'm Not There leads the pack.by Jeff Giles | November 28, 2007 |  CommentsThe nominations for this year’s Spirit Awards are in — and Todd Haynes might want to clear some room on his mantle.Variety reports that Haynes’ I’m Not There leads the pack with four nominations — earning nods for best film and director, as well as supporting nods for Cate Blanchett and Marcus Carl Franklin — and the festival’s inaugural Robert Altman Award. Also receiving four nominations apiece are Juno, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, and The Savages, while A Mighty Heart, Rocket Science, and Lust, Caution each earned three.I’m Not There, The Diving Bell and The Butterfly, Juno, and A Mighty Heart will compete for best feature with Gus Van Sant‘s Paranoid Park, while Haynes, Van Sant, Tamara Jenkins, Jason Reitman, and Julian Schnabel are the nominees for best director.The lead actresses honored by the nominating committee are Angelina Jolie, Tang Wei, Parker Posey, Sienna Miller, and Ellen Page; the actor’s list consists of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Pedro Castaneda, Don Cheadle, Frank Langella, and Tony Leung.For the complete list of nominees, click on the link below!Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"golden, boxoffice, what","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"spirit-award-nominees-announced"},{"id":"47613301295604","title":"RT on DVD: Call It, Friend-O  — No Country For Old Men Hits DVD","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Call It, Friend-O -- No Country For Old Men Hits DVDBee Movie, Dan in Real Life, August Rush,, Hitman join the Coen thriller in this week's new releases.by Jen Yamato | March 10, 2008 |  CommentsThe critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning No Country For Old Men comes to DVD this week, accompanied by a litany of fellow Fresh films (Lake of Fire, Summer Palace, Dan in Real Life) as well as a gaggle of critical duds (Hitman, Bee Movie, August Rush, and more).No Country For Old MenTomatometer: 94%Joel and Ethan Coen add another celebrated film to their resume with this four-category Oscar-winning thriller about a bag of stolen cash, a man on the run, the killer on his tail, and the old lawman desperately trying to make sense of it all. While we’ll get no commentary track on this initial DVD release (just wait for the inevitable super-sized special editions), three features comprise the bonus menu, but the film itself is its own reward — just ask those Academy voters.Bee MovieTomatometer: 54%Jerry Seinfeld‘s bid for post-Seinfeld success came last year in the form of a honeybee: a neurotic, rather Jerry-esque bee named Barry Bee Benson, to be exact, who leaves corporatized hive life for the great big world of humans in New York City’s Central Park. When Barry discovers that humans have been stealing the hard-earned honey of his buzzing brethren, he takes the most American action there is — he sues the human race. With a supporting voice cast that includes Chris Rock, Renee Zellweger, Patrick Warburton, and Matthew Broderick — and cameos by Sting, Ray Liotta, and Oprah Winfrey — Bee Movie is full of that familiar Seinfeld sardonic humor, although, as the critics say, it’s fairly forgettable.Dan in Real LifeTomatometer: 66%Steve Carell‘s trademark hangdog deadpan finds appropriate anchor in this romantic comedy from Peter Hedges (Pieces of April). Carell stars as Dan, the widowed father of three girls who writes an advice column for a living; when Dan meets his dream girl (Juliette Binoche) during a family get-together, he’s elated — until he learns she’s his brother’s new girlfriend. A soundtrack by Swedish singer-songwriter Sondre Lerch underscores Dan’s comic heartache, though some critics found the script to be occasionally too flat and contrived. A decently packed bonus menu with director commentary, deleted scenes, and outtakes round out the disc.August RushTomatometer: 38%Freddie Highmore, Britain’s omnipresent kid actor, stars as a musically-gifted orphan on a quest to find his birth parents — and exposure any and every person he meets along the way to the magic of music. Sound schmaltzy enough for you? Well, throw in Robin Williams (channeling his doppelganger, U2 front man Bono) as a musical street pimp named Wizard, salvation in the form of a choir, and lines like “The music is all around us. All you have to do is listen,” and you’ve got one heckuva a saccharine smorgasbord.Nancy DrewTomatometer: 48%If, like some of us, you were an avid fan of the Nancy Drew mystery books — over 170 stories published under the pseudonym “Carolyn Keene” since 1930 — then you might have felt some apprehension when a feature-length film about the classic sleuthing teen was announced. Unfortunately for us purists, the reviews confirm those fears. Emma Roberts stars as the titular teen, whose prudish, Type-A manner clashes with the spoiled kids she encounters when she and her dad (Tate Donovan) move to Tinseltown. A Hollywood mystery surfaces, of course, but grown audiences will remain unspooked. I say, bring on the Choose Your Own Adventure movie instead!SleuthTomatometer: 36%The gimmick of casting this cat-and-mouse thriller is intriguing on its own; having starred as a young adulterer opposite Laurence Olivier in 1972’s Sleuth, Michael Caine now plays the older role opposite Jude Law in Kenneth Branagh‘s remake. Unfortunately, the script by Harold Pinter, adapting Anthony Shaffer’s play, fails to serve the two leads well, making for a tedious time — unless you enjoy watching two distinguished British actors out-act one another. Law, Caine, and Branagh make recompense in a jointly recorded commentary track in the special features.&nbsp;HitmanTomatometer: 15%With a title like Hitman, you know what you’re getting into with this video game adaptation from French director Xavier Gens (Frontier(es)). Timothy Olyphant stars as a bar coded professional killer named Number 47 dealing with his sinister bosses, a Russian politico, and a hot prostitute (Olga Kurylenko) on the run. Overwhelmingly derided by the critical set, who might alternately recommend the film to a PS2-obsessed pre-teen boy, Hitman at least serves one purpose: bringing you a closer look at future Bond girl Kurylenko half a year before Quantum of Solace hits theaters.Lake of FireTomatometer: 94%When Nirvana covered the Meat Puppets’ “Lake of Fire” in their Unplugged album session, they sang that the Biblical body of water was “where bad folks go when they die.” In his sprawling documentary on abortion, director Tony Kaye brings us a comprehensive look at the often violent, always vehement hot button debate that has raged for 25 years since Roe vs. Wade. Kaye, who filmed the doc over a period of 17 years, is the same director who earned Hollywood’s praise for directing the 1998 skinhead drama American History X (then disappeared from view following his bitter falling out with New Line and star Edward Norton). Be warned that Lake of Fire contains graphic images; a commentary with Kaye accompanies the DVD.Summer PalaceTomatometer: 70%A young rural woman gets accepted to Peking University and encounters sexual awakening, politics, and discontent against the backdrop of the Tiananmen Square protests in controversial director Lou Ye‘s epic drama. Actress Hao Lei gives a brazen performance as the film’s restless protagonist, who spends over two decades (the late 1980s to the 2000s) struggling to get over the lost love of her life. At over two and a half hours, Ye’s film could be split into two stories — one of the young woman and another of her adult years) — but his film captures the zeitgeist of an entire generation forever marked by Tiananmen-era experiences, at times recalling the verve of Godard and the French New Wave.

Count down the rest of last year’s DVD-rental top 25 below!1. $71.2 Rush Hour 3 ($140.1M box office)2. $69.7 The Bourne Ultimatum ($227.5 box office)3. $66.4 The Kingdom ($47.5 box office)4. $64.3 Superbad ($121.5 box office)5. $57.2 Live Free or Die Hard ($134.5 box office)6. $56.7 The Simpsons Movie ($183.1 box office)7. $55.3 Night at the Museum ($250.86 box office)8. $54.1 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($292 box office)9. $51.8 Shrek the Third ($322.7 box office)10. $51.2 The Heartbreak Kid ($36.8 box office)11. $50.6 The Pursuit of Happyness ($163.57 box office)12. $49.0 The Departed ($132.38 box office)13. $47.5 Borat ($128.51 box office)14. $47.5 Transformers ($319.3 box office)15. $45.0 Blood Diamond ($57.38 box office)16. $43.8 Spider-Man 3 ($336.5 box office)17. $43.7 300 ($210.6 box office)18. $43.0 I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry ($120 box office)19. $42.9 Casino Royale ($167.45 box office)20. $42.7 Disturbia ($80.21 box office)21. $42.6 The Holiday ($63.22 box office)22. $41.8 Knocked Up ($148.8 box office)23. $40.8 Deja Vu ($64.04 box office)24. $40.5 Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer ($131.9 box office)25. $40.5 The Good Shepherd ($59.95 box office)Source: End of Boredom","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"ghosts, PBS, Moore, festivals, facebook","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rush-hour-3-takes-07-dvd-rental-crown"},{"id":"47613304436214","title":"Down but Not Out, HD DVD Soldiers On","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Down but Not Out, HD DVD Soldiers OnAn array of new releases expected for first quarter '08.by Jeff Giles | January 18, 2008 |  CommentsThe clock hasn’t stopped ticking on the format, but HD DVD consumers can look forward to seeing new films on store shelves — for at least the next few months, anyway.According to The Hollywood Reporter, one of Warner Bros.’ final HD DVD titles, a two-disc special edition of Twister, will be released May 27; meanwhile, Paramount “is expected to announce a full slate of HD DVD titles for the first quarter Thursday.”Paramount was supposed to announce those releases at CES, but the news of Warner Bros. abandoning the format led the HD DVD Promotional Group to withdraw from the show and declare a “quiet period.” The Reporter article lists a number of expected titles, however, including Into the Wild, Things We Lost in the Fire, Bee Movie, The Kite Runner, American Gangster, and The Jack Ryan Collection, which bundles The Hunt for Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games, and The Sum of All Fears.Still, it seems like it’s only a matter of time before the last few drops of HD DVD’s market share go swirling down the drain — according to the Reporter, people have pretty much quit buying ’em:Net HD DVD sales, according to Nielsen, constituted only 15% of hi-def disc sales last week. And the top HD DVD seller, “The Kingdom,” sold just 10% as many copies as the top Blu-ray Disc release, “3:10 to Yuma.”Source: The Hollywood Reporter","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Interview, Premiere, Lifetime, free, Travel, Academy, King, dc, richard, Britbox, dark, Logo, hard, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"down-but-not-out-hd-dvd-soldiers-on"},{"id":"47613297279474","title":"Cannes 2009: George Clooney to Play Assassin","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: George Clooney to Play AssassinStar to be directed by Control helmer.by Orlando Parfitt | May 19, 2009 |  CommentsThere’s a double dose of George Clooney news that’s emerged at Cannes yesterday.Firstly, Variety reports that the greying star has signed on to topline A Very Private Gentleman — an adaptation of the Martin Booth novel — which will be directed by Control helmer Anton Corbijn.The Cloon will play an assassin who hides out in a rustic Italian town before carrying out a final, murderous assignment. Against his better judgement, the cold-hearted killer starts to make friends and becomes entangled in a romantic relationship.Secondly, his war movie Men Who Stare at Goats – which stars the actor as an ex-member of a secret US army unit that used paranormal tactics – has found itself a US distributor.

It’s a plane! It’s a Slusho, whatever that is! Cloverfield stomps its way onto DVD as not only the most exciting new release of the week, but the one most chock-full of special features. Charlie Wilson’s War, The Savages, and The Orphanage are also new — but be on the lookout as the year’s worst flick to date, One Missed Call, also shuffles onto shelves.CloverfieldTomatometer:76%The best-kept secret of 2007 (look up viral marketing in the dictionary and see J.J. Abram’s grinning mug) turned out to be the rebirth of the kaiju — a Godzilla-esque creature wreaking havoc in Manhattan, as seen through the eyes of Handicam-wielding twenty-somethings. Online campaigns involving Slusho and the mysterious 1-11-08 teaser title made for a gonzo opening weekend take, but significant drop-off suggests that many of you were waiting for DVD.Bonus Features:Two alternate endings, deleted scenes, commentary by director Matt Reeves and tons of Easter Eggs make Cloverfield a must-own. Now, figure out where to buy it, since no less than four special store-specific editions will be available, ranging from a Steelbook case (FYE and Suncoast), exclusive ringtone (K-Mart and Sears), “T.J. Miller’s Video Diary” bonus DVD (Best Buy) and our recommendation, a “Rob’s Goin’ to Japan Party Mix” CD (Target).&nbsp;Charlie Wilson’s WarTomatometer: 83%If modern, smarmy Tom Hanks doesn’t rub you the wrong way (why, oh why, couldn’t he have stopped at A League of Their Own??) and you’d like to see him charm the pants off of Julia Roberts’ conservative socialite, then perhaps there’s nothing stopping you from watching the true story of Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson and how he run the Soviets out of Afghanistan. But if you’re paying attention, you already know how that situation panned out.Bonus Features:There’s not much here, but a “Who Is Charlie Wilson?” featurette brings us up close and personal with not only Hanks, producer Aaron Sorkin, and director Mike Nichols (The Graduate), but also Wilson himself and his lover/benefactor, Joanne Herring.The SavagesTomatometer: 90%After a nine-year absence, Tamara Jenkins (Slums of Beverly Hills) wins us over again. This time, her angsty protagonists are middle-aged siblings (Best Actress nominee Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose perfectly rancorous relationship is tested when they must deal with their increasingly senile, elderly father (Philip Bosco). One of last year’s critical darlings, The Savages deserves a wider audience for its bittersweet, acute observations — you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll see poop on the walls.Bonus Features:There’s not much to see here: extended scenes, interviews, and a “Behind the Scenes” photo gallery. But don’t let that deter you; give The Savages a try and you’ll likely end up touched. After all, who doesn’t love their parents?The OrphanageTomatometer: 84%Orphaned by the Oscars (it was Spain’s official entry but didn’t make the final cut) and at the box office, here your chance to adopt this overlooked flick! In the Guillermo del Toro-produced stab at familial horror, Laura (Belen Rueda) moves into the orphanage she grew up in, but finds the house already occupied by spirits who seemingly kidnap her son. Come for the thrills, stay for the surprisingly tender story.Bonus Features:The Orphanage largely takes place in one setting, so location, location, location was undoubtedly a vital adage on set. Two DVD features reveal the efforts taken to bring Laura’s nightmarish world to life: the first, “When Laura Grew Up,” shows the filmmakers at work building the orphanage set. The second takes us into “Tomas’ Secret Room,” where the haunting climax of the movie takes place.&nbsp;Starting Out in the EveningTomatometer: 86%I don’t know about you, but nothing gets our blood boiling like a good May-December pairing. Starting Out in the Evening boasts the match-up of sexagenarian Frank Langella and Lauren Ambrose (Six Feet Under) as an aging writer and grad student , respectively, who grow close in Andrew Wagner’s film about relational intimacy and alienation.Bonus Features:Director Wagner offers in-depth commentary in the disc’s only non-trailer offering.Hannah Takes the StairsTomatometer: 67%Is the movie movement known as mumblecore (a certain brand of D.I.Y. flicks with ultra-low budgets and nonprofessional actor) all it’s cracked up to be? Take the first step in making your call with the latest notable mumblecore effort, a wry, intimate story about a flaky girl and her crush on two goofy co-workers.Bonus Features:Those mumblecore kids are majorly hands-on with the filmmaking process and their subsequent DVD releases. Hannah continues the trend with a commentary, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and a short film by director Joe Swanberg, Thanks for the ADD! And speaking of which, check out Swanberg’s MySpace page for even more short films, including the trailer to his next feature, Nights and Weekends.&nbsp;One Missed CallTomatometer: 0%At last, the worst-reviewed movie of 2008 has arrived on DVD! (Okay, it’s only the worst so far, but we’re betting it can go the distance.) It takes something special to go 64 reviews without a single fresh rating, but this remake of Takashi Miike’s J-horror pic — in which people like Shannyn Sossamon get phone calls portending their imminent deaths — manages the feat. Even Uwe Boll’s Dungeon Siege: In the Name of the King notched a five percent Tomatometer. Bravo, One Missed Call. Bravo.Bonus Features:Here’s the kicker: there are no bonus features. Zilch. Zero. Nada. Can you blame Warner Bros. or their no-name filmmakers (not to mention Sossaman and co-star Ed Burns, who both seemed listless while promoting the flick at Comic-Con) for washing their hands of the career-killing box office bomb?Fun fact: One Missed Call‘s Australian title is Don’t Pick Up the Cell Phone! (Note exclamation point.) Rent accordingly.&nbsp;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"drama, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-on-dvd-cloverfield-charlie-wilson-and-2008s-worst-reviewed-film"},{"id":"47613307601399","title":"RT on DVD: Watch an Exclusive Clip from Starship Troopers: Marauder","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT on DVD: Watch an Exclusive Clip from Starship Troopers: MarauderThe bugs are back in town this week!by Jen Yamato | August 4, 2008 |  CommentsSparred by the triumphant onscreen return of a certain Johnny Rico, we turnour DVD-minded focus to a few stars of yesterday popping up in new DVD releasesthis week: Casper van Dien, Christopher Lambert, and Heather Graham. Also, checkout this week’s geek-tastic new releases: a Starship Troopers box set, CodeMonkeys, and Captain James Tiberius Kirk’s restored adventures aboard theStarship Enterprise.Casper Van Dien is back in Starship Troopers: MarauderIf you know the name Johnny Rico, then you know Casper van Dien. Back in 1997,Van Dien turned in a career-defining performance as the brash “roughneck”recruit Rico inPaul Verhoeven‘sStarship Troopers; since that breakout role, heappeared in no less than 28 (mostly made-for-TV or direct-to DVD) films. Thisweek Van Dien returns, eleven years later, to the franchise that kicked off hiscareer. (Read Casper van Dien’s Five Favorite Films here and hear what Rico’s upagainst in Starship Troopers 3.)Exclusive: Watch two exclusive behind-the-scenes featurettes about the new weaponry and the Marauder powersuit from Starship Troopers 3!Unnecessary DVD re-release of the week: Christopher Lambert’s FortressIn the world of home video, it seems everything old can become new again whenre-masterings, retrospective commentaries, or new footage come into play. Butwhat if no new changes are made whatsoever? Don’t check out Lionsgate’s newre-release of Stuart Gordon‘sFortress, the horror veteran’s schlocky-but-entertainingsci-fi flick from 1993 starring direct-to-video kingChristopher Lambert. In it,Lambert stars as an Army officer imprisoned when he and his wife decide toconceive more than the allotted one child per couple; highlights include whathappens when unruly prisoners get “intestined.” But anyone looking for furtherinsights from Gordon or even Lambert will be duly disappointed; the new release,out this week, is merely a repackaged version of Artisan’s 2001 release. As forLambert, he’s since returned to his bread-and-butter — direct-to-video andforeign language films – though we are excited at the thought of himresurrecting Lord Rayden for a 2010 Mortal Kombat sequel.The Where-Has-Heather-Graham-Gone Update of the WeekSpeaking of celebrities who’ve fallen off the face of Planet Hollywood, thisweek we stumble acrossHeather Graham. Once an in-demand Hollywood Roller Girl,Graham has taken to appearing in tiny indie and DVD flicks in the past fewyears: a travel writer in the romantic-comedy Cake; a hot lesbian in theromantic comedy Gray Matters; a hot lesbian in the dark dramaBroken. (Anyonesee a trend here?) This week Graham’s back with another quirky indie: MissConception, the comic tale of one woman’s quest to conceive a child at any costsbefore her “baby making days” are over.Click for this week’s new releases!Nim’s IslandTomatometer: 49%Abigail Breslin continues to steal the title of America’s Sweetheart from DakotaFanning with her starring role as Nim Rusoe, the precocious, self-sufficientdaughter of a scientist (Gerard Butler) who has lived her whole life on – youguessed it! – an island. Critics were mixed on the fantasy-adventure, but gavekudos to the flick (and to producer/co-starJodie Foster as a neurotic writer)for offering wholesome, well-intentioned counterprogramming for the Bratz crowd.Bonus Features:Amusing animated CGI sequences could look great on Blu-ray; deleted scenes,featurettes, and commentaries by both husband and wife directors Mark Levin andJennifer Flackett and stars Jodie Foster and Abigail Breslin flesh out thebehind-the-scenes adventure.Code Monkeys: Season 1Tomatometer: N/AStill upset about the video game crash of 1983?

Cheer up bywatching Code Monkeys, G4’s original animated series chronicling the employeesof the fictitious GameaVision video game company during the 1980s.

Based on thereal-life memoirs of Adolph Burger, the critically-acclaimed drama follows theharrowing experiences of Holocaust victims forced to work for Nazis in exchangefor their lives.Bonus Features:Delve deeper into the film and the events that inspired it with commentaries andinterviews with director Stefan Ruzowitzky, star Karl Markovics, and Holocaustsurvivor/memoirist Burger himself.RogueTomatometer:100%Breaking news: we’ve got a film this week about a giant killer crocodile, andit’s got a fresh Tomatometer!! Suspend your disbelief long enough to rent thiscreature feature, starringRadha Mitchell andMichael Vartan, about a tour groupterrorized in the outback by Australia’s native predator. (Where’s Paul Hoganwhen you need him?)Bonus Features:Check out commentary by writer/director Greg McLean (Wolf Creek), a making-ofdocumentary shot by the director himself, and a few additional features.Starship Troopers 1-3 Box SetTomatometer:N/AHow should you prepare for the debut of Starship Troopers: Marauder, writer Ed Neumeier’s directorial debut and the long-awaited return of Johnny Rico?

Other war-themed films include White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, The Rape of Europa, and Nanking.Michael Moore‘s Sicko, arguably the year’s highest-profile documentary, is also being submitted for consideration. Notable omissions from the shortlist are In the Shadow of the Moon, The King of Kong, and Terror’s Advocate. The last batch of submissions, from the article:Rounding out the list are Sean Fine and Andrea Nix‘s “War/Dance,” Tony Kaye‘s “Lake of Fire,” Weijun Chen’s “Please Vote for Me,” Daniel G.

Few who’ve seen Sally Potter‘s adaptation of Orlando, with Swinton in the title role, will forget the power of her performance, a power she brings to every role she tackles, from Constantine to Burn After Reading. Her supporting role in Michael Clayton earned her an Oscar, but her performance in Julia, out now on DVD, went largely unnoticed despite its impact on those who saw it. Out now on DVD, Swinton sits down with RT to talk about the film.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211574[/tomatometer]What was it about Julia as a character that made you want to play her?Tilda Swinton: She reminds me of so many of the great drunks I have known and loved in my life, who have always felt so unlike the kind of loser character often put forward in cinema portrayals.Is there a particular appeal to exploring characters as unglamorous and as unrelentingly real as Julia?TS: It certainly does one good to notice how extreme ‘unrelenting realness’ very often is; how far from any concept of good taste or subtlety. When we were developing this film, we went out of our way to be clear with ourselves just how far we needed to go. People like Kate del Castillo‘s character really are that unhinged, desperate people with guns and insanely ferocious dogs do shout that loud, people like Julia do drink that much and that often, the effort to appear sober the morning after drinking as much as she does does involve that much overacting, look that forced and feel that wierd to be around.Tilda Swinton in JuliaWhat are the real challenges and areas of consideration when you’re taking on a character afflicted by something like alcoholism?TS:The responsibility of going far enough. The resistence to stopping short of the mark for the sake of modesty.What was the experience of working with Erick Zonca like?TS: Exhilarating. Multilingual. Random. Addictive. He has to be the least cerebral filmmaker I have ever worked with; he directs outside of any formal or literary concerns whatsoever. He directs energy – nothing less – and is not interested in anything except the authentic. His constant request is for ‘something of different’, ‘something of fantasy’ and, of me in particular, ‘more ugly, Tilda, make more ugly faces’. His allergy to generica and his passion are truly infectious and a tonic to be around. I’d work with him again in a heartbeat.Continue onto the next page as Tilda Swinton talks about working with children and on location and tells us more about her upcoming reteaming with Jim Jarmusch.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1211574[/tomatometer]Aidan Gould is remarkable as Tom, what are the joys and challenges of working with children?TS: I can only think of joys. That they know the proper value of play. That they are up for the practical artifice of pretend; I’ve yet to meet a child of nine burdened with any concept of a method, or the pressure of taking their character home with them or all that displacement stuff. That they are in touch with the fun of making things up. That they are in no screwed-up battle with their dignity all the while. Altogether, in combination with the need for children to work restricted hours, it’s grace.There’s an incredible amount of location work involved here and some striking locations — do you prefer working on location?TS: Possibly. It makes for a completely different texture to what you actually shoot, let’s face it, and in the land of realness, or semi-realness, as in Julia, there is a kind of ease that comes with walking into real places surrounded by energies other than that of the film. Real walls, real pavement, real sky all help hold down the make believe and pin it into place.Tilda Swinton in JuliaWe’re soon to see you in another Jim Jarmusch film, could you tell us a little about your character and the film itself?TS: Pretty much nothing, I’m afraid. Isaach de Bankole wears sensational shiny suits. I wear a white wig and cowboy hat. Paz de la Huerta wears – mainly – not a stitch. We are all in Spain. Isaach meets us there, on an unexplained mission, as he does Bill Murray, Gael Garcia Bernal, John Hurt, Youki Kudoh and others. We hand him cryptic messages in matchboxes and expound on art, music, science, hallucinogenics and sex. My subject is cinema. Isaach keeps moving. It’s a mystery story with a protagonist so calm, so opaque, that we can rest in his company – go along for the ride in blissful ignorance, perhaps even give up on impatience in the beauty of this landscape, under the umberella of this soundtrack. Credit crunch, eco-friendly, existential travel for the price of a cinema seat and minimal carbon footprint.Julia is on DVD now.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Fresh","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-interview-tilda-swinton-on-julia"},{"id":"47613335047684","title":"Trailer Bulletin: The Kid & I","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trailer Bulletin: The Kid &amp; Iby Scott Weinberg | November 16, 2005 |  CommentsAlthough \"The Kid &amp; I\" is only opening in \"select markets\" on December 2nd, we thought you’d like to check out the trailer, mainly because you don’t normally get a to see a movie with this kind of ensemble cast … and a screenplay by Tom Arnold.\"Bill Williams (Tom Arnold) is a down-and-out actor who is unexpectedly hired to write a sequel a la \"True Lies,\" the action film that made him famous more than a decade ago. When Bill learns that his co-star is Aaron Roman (Eric Gores), a rich kid with no acting experience, what appeared to be the chance for a major comeback turns into a series of outlandish complications.

When it came time for his move across the country, things fell right into place: By the time he got the call for an interview, he could already tell them his new address in the city.“You can be a film critic anywhere,” he told Rotten Tomatoes, “but there really is something about being in New York and being at the Film Forum, seeing a recently restored version or our print of Army of Shadows that you really just kind of feel like,&nbsp;Oh, I’m in Film Nerd Heaven.”David Fear is now a Senior Editor and critic at Rolling Stone, and the former Film Editor of Time Out New York.What’s your personal record for most movies seen in a day?When I was younger and much, much more full of piss and vinegar, I think I did a six-film day at Sundance once. It might have been my first or second Sundance back in 2004, 2005. I don’t recommend it.If you ate six meals in a day, they could be the greatest meals in the world. They could be five-star chef meals. But you’ve stopped tasting it after a while and it just becomes shoveling food into your mouth and going, “Oh my God, when is this going to end?”I found that when I would start doing more than three, maybe four movies a day at a festival, I would stop tasting the food.Do you prefer 3-D or non–3-D screenings?Do you even have to ask that? I’ve actually gone out of my way to see to 2-D screenings because, here’s the thing, with very rare exceptions, there’s only really three movies that you absolutely, positively need to see in 3-D.There’s really no point to seeing Avatar unless you’re seeing it in 3-D. It’s a bad movie, but how he uses 3-D to really immerse you in a bad movie that he’s made is remarkably impressive.Are you pro– or anti–note-taking?I don’t understand how you can do this gig and not take notes. If you’re really serious about potentially wanting to do this, practice writing stuff in a notebook without looking at your notebook. I’m very, very pro-note taking – so long as it’s not with one of those light pens. Man, f–k those light pens.You’re sitting down to write. Would you prefer a shot of espresso or alcohol? What’s your spirit of choice?Espresso for writing and then bourbon for transcribing. It makes the activity of transcribing so much less painful.(Photo by Paramount Vantage)What’s the hardest review you’ve ever written?If I still had a chance to work on and revise my There Will Be Blood review, I would still be doing it. Not only because it’s just one of my favorite films ever, but there’s so much going on and it’s such a slippery film for me to try and really grasp and write about in a way that feels articulate and as close to complete as possible.I still have nightmares about writing that review and really feeling like I hadn’t quite gotten it yet. Not that I hadn’t got the movie – I knew exactly how I felt about the movie – but to try and translate that into a piece, and explain why I think it’s one of the great artworks of the 21st century to date was… I still have nightmares about it.Someone that everyone should follow on Twitter?I’m biased because I know him, but Justin Chang [of the Los Angeles Times]. To my money, there’s just not a better film critic working today than Justin. You should follow him on Twitter for the puns – not just the fact that he’s one of the smartest, funniest film writers today, but he is like a God-level pun maker. His punny games, his punny business is just absolutely insane.Up-and-coming critic that you think people should read?There are two young critics that I hope people are paying attention to.I hope people are reading Kameron Austin Collins, he’s one of the film critics for Vanity Fair. I ended up meeting him and found out he was only in late 20s. I was just like, “Oh my God. If you’re writing at this level in your late 20s, you’re going to be a f–king monster in the next 10 years.”I would say the same about Monica Castillo. She’s all over the place byline-wise, but she’s one of those people I feel she’s maturing really beautifully as a writer.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Do you have a favorite classic film?I could watch&nbsp;The Lady Eve&nbsp;every single day for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. There are a handful of films that I feel are as close to perfect as humanly possible, and&nbsp;The Lady Eve&nbsp;is one of them.It’s such a cliché answer, but I’ve probably seen&nbsp;The Godfather&nbsp;close to a hundred times and that’s barely an exaggeration. Between that and the&nbsp;second&nbsp;Godfather&nbsp;film, I almost feel like I can quote most of them off the top of my head.Is that the movie you’ve watched more than any other?Yeah, that would have to be it. There’s a couple of movies that I’ve definitely gotten into the double digits with. I’ve seen&nbsp;Dazed and Confused&nbsp;a lot because it’s a comfort movie. I can sink into that movie.Is there an actor, director, or screenwriter whose work you always love?The closest thing I would say I have to a favorite filmmaker – and take that phrase with a huge grain of salt – would be Yasujirō Ozu. I feel the movies he makes were reverse-engineered for me.(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Do you have a favorite movie from your childhood?I remember seeing Monty Python and the Holy Grail on PBS one night… I watched that constantly as a kid. You know when you found something that’s your sense of humor?And then, because I’m a child of the ‘70s, Star Wars. My parents actually took me out of school to go see a matinee of it the first week that it was open. I had no idea what I was going into and as a six-year-old kid and then walked out of it a changed human being.Is there anything that you consider “required viewing”?Yeah. Actually, I think it’s out of print now… Visions of Light. It’s a documentary about cinematography and covers the gamut, talks a lot about cinematographers in the ’30s and ’40s, talks a lot about the new Hollywood guys, talks a lot about British cinematographers. It really is this incredible primer that not only is just a beautiful film, obviously, because it’s talking about people who’ve shot movies beautifully. It’s an extraordinary gateway drug.(Photo by Universal Pictures)You recently wrote a piece on the 20-year resonance of Fight Club. I’m wondering if there’s a movie released this decade that you think in 10 or 20 years we’re going to look back and think, “That was the 2010s.”If I had to be honest, I think the movie would be Get Out. It feels like it’s very much a movie for the end of the Obama era and very, very much a movie for the beginning of the Trump era. Never mind that it’s also a really great move and it’s a movie that keeps giving the more you see it, and it’s so beautifully constructed. It works well as a horror film, works well as a satire, works well as social commentary, and worked well as a personal expression of the sensibility of the person who made it.What’s the biggest misconception you hear about critics?That we hate movies. It’s really the opposite. I think a lot of us love the art form enough that when we see it used badly, we feel we need to call it out. I don’t trust the critic that doesn’t live, breathe, eat, and s–t movies.What are you most proud of in your career so far?As an editor, I’m not a religious person but, I think blessed is really the only word I can think of… When I get something from a good writer and think like, “Oh, this is good but there’s a great piece in here. Let’s find this great piece.”In a way, it’s like you’re not the mother, you’re the midwife – being able to help a really beautiful baby be born into the world by trying to be a good editor. Getting back a second, or a third, or sometimes a fourth draft and finally having the moment where you’re like, “Yes! Holy s–t! You found it.”David Fear is a Senior Editor and critic at&nbsp;Rolling Stone.

With the holiday season in full swing, we’ll be sharing some of our personal favorites from Disney that have been released on Blu-ray. If you’re searching for some family friendly high definition goodness, see if some of our personal Disney favorites can help jump start your gift giving![tomatometer]MuzeID=1184018[/tomatometer]EnchantedTake the hottest Disney Princess since Beauty and the Beast‘s Belle in Enchanted‘s Giselle, add a generous helping of Amy Adams’ charm, a dash of Dr. McDreamy himself (Patrick Dempsey) at his Grey’s Anatomy peak, and weave in some characters and themes from Disney classics, and you have yourself one of Disney’s most enjoyable movies in recent memory. Taken from her animated fairy tale world of Andalasia, where her days consist of the tasks of being pretty, singing with her animal friends, and waiting for Prince Charming (or Prince Edward, played by James Marsden), Giselle is tricked by an evil queen into falling down a well/portal that lands her in modern day New York City. While trying to find her way home to Andalasia, Giselle has to learn what it’s like to not be an animated character and also discover the real life meaning of true love, which begins to understand through, of all people, an emotionally detached divorce lawyer. Nearly all of Enchanted’s special features are presented in 1080P, with the exception of Carrie Underwood’s (another plus!) music video for “Ever Ever After.” The Blu-ray includes making-of clips, deleted scenes, a pop up story, and trailers for National Treasure: Book of Secrets and Sleeping Beauty on Blu-ray.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1109769[/tomatometer]Monsters, Inc.Monster’s Inc: the other black sheep of the Pixar canon? It’s their least discussed movie outside of A Bug’s Life, but not for lack of quality; this tale of monsters employed by a mega-corporation to scare children in the human world to harness the energy of their screams is a compltely solid, clever tale but somehow lacks a certain je ne sais quoi that keeps it from classic status. The characterizations may not run too deep and the universe of the monsters too overwhelming for most audiences, but it builds up to a stunning emotional finale and the climatic chase sequence is arguably the best action sequence Pixar has ever put out. The Blu-ray features a lengthy commentary feature from the filmmakers, an overview of the Monsters ride in Tokyo, two original shorts, “interviews” with the characters, deleted scenes, and is definitely packed with enough fun stuff for the kids.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1164826[/tomatometer]RatatouilleIt’s old hat at this point to praise Pixar for its innovation, for its attention to detail, for its emotionally satisfying storytelling. So let’s take slightly a different tack with Certified Fresh Ratatouille: has there ever been a more tactile, sensorial animated feature than this one? Nearly everything in Ratatouille seems tangible, from the pots and pans in the Parisian kitchens to the fur on its protagonist’s little rat body. And the tasty concoctions that our hero Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt) cooks up are so vividly realized that you can practically smell them. How real does this movie feel in high-definition? You’ll have to find out for yourself, but to entice you, the Ratatouille Blu-ray has a 14-minute documentary on the intersection between cinema and cuisine, along with deleted scenes and two Pixar shorts: Lifted and Your Friend the Rat.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048889[/tomatometer]The Nightmare Before ChristmasContrary to what many have come to believe, The Nightmare Before Christmas was not, in fact, directed by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish); the stop-motion animated film was helmed by Henry Selick, who went on to bring us the similarly animated films James and the Giant Peach and this year’s Coraline. Burton did, however, produce Nightmare and come up with its story, and his fingerprints are all over the film, from its dark yet playful themes right down to the character design. The story focuses on Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, who happens upon a mysterious door in the middle of the forest that leads him to discover Christmastown. Enchanted by the charms of Christmas, Jack returns to Halloweentown and attempts to recreate the holiday for his own townsfolk, with disastrous results. In Blu-Ray, each character bursts with life onscreen in never-before-seen clarity, and Danny Elfman’s musical numbers pop in HD audio. There are also tons of special features, including featurettes, commentaries, an original poem narrated by Christopher Lee, Burton’s short film Vincent, and a lot more. The film is quickly becoming a holiday classic, and with the amount of stuff you get with the disc, this is definitely a Blu-Ray to pick up and store in your collection.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1187275[/tomatometer]WALL-EForget the supposed eco-message about our dying Earth — “I just wanted to cover the world in trash,” said director Andrew Stanton, and never has an entire planet piled high with refuse looked so beautiful. From the opening seconds of WALL-E — as we zoom into a vacated world, the sound of a long-gone show tune collapsing into Thomas Newman’s eerie score — Pixar’s lonely robot movie casts an unforgettable spell, taking us at once back to the glory days of ’70s sci-fi and into the shiny future of CG storytelling. The movie’s bleep-and-clank first half (a sound design marvel from Ben Burtt) is as bold a piece of filmmaking as anything this decade, and if WALL-E resorts to more conventional storytelling for its denouement, it’s never less than superb. As you’d expect the film scrubs up fresher than an oil bath on Blu-ray, where you can really see the intricacy of Stanton’s compositions and his animators work on the robots’ expressions. Features include a picture-in-picture commentary, audio tracks with Stanton and Burtt and a load of making-of featurettes. Essential stuff.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"History, and, Film, One, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"what-were-watching-on-bluray-from-disney"},{"id":"47613339500038","title":"Cannes 2009: The Tomato Report – Critics Pick Their Awards Favourites","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Cannes 2009: The Tomato Report - Critics Pick Their Awards FavouritesThe Palme d'Or gets awarded tonight - what are critics tipping?by Chris Tilly | May 24, 2009 |  CommentsWith the Cannes Film Festival winding down this weekend, talk is now turning to who will win the Palme d’Or this evening. We tracked down several journalists covering the fest to gauge their opinion, and it seems there are two very definite front-runners at present – Michael Haneke‘s The White Ribbon, a taut period drama about a German village pre-WWI, and Jacques Audiard‘s A Prophet, a prison film about a young man’s efforts to survive incarceration in a French jail.“I am rooting for A Prophet to win,” says Heat’s Charles Gant. “It’s the Gomorrah of this year’s festival, but thanks to its linear storyline it’s arguably more accessible and satisfying than last year’s Mafia drama. But maybe its genre conventionality will count against it with the jury, earning it a lesser prize, possibly Best Actor for young Tahar Rahim, making his big-screen debut.“One school of thought says it would be controversial for the jury to give the Palme D’Or to another French film after The Class won in 2008, but I don’t think juries think like that.“The favourite at this stage is probably Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon. He’s never won before and it’s a very solid Euro arthouse offering: a slow-build film that commands engagement through Haneke’s usual trick of withholding information.“The third film in strong contention is Jane Campion‘s Bright Star. I’m not excited by that idea, although I did considerably like the film. In style and subject (poet John Keats’ chaste love affair with his neighbour), it seems slightly conventional, especially when compared with recent winners such as The Class and Romanian abortion drama 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.”Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet.The Times’ Wendy Ide concurs with Gant. “In my opinion, the two strongest contenders are A Prophet and The White Ribbon. The latter might just swing it because of its uncompromising and distinctive style, intellectual rigor, and because jury president Isabelle Huppert has collaborated with him before. But then again, the jury could just go nuts and give it to Antichrist.”The latter is Lars von Trier‘s controversial horror film, which stars Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a grieving couple trying to mend their relationship in an isolated cabin in the woods. It has certainly divided opinion out here, but The Independent’s Kaleem Aftab is most definitely a fan. “I genuinely hope it wins,” he said. “Love it or hate it, von Trier’s visually stunning film provokes debate and makes you question life.”We also caught up with Leslie Felperin, who had just finished lunch with her fellow Variety critics, where talk had also apparently turned to the Palme. “The collective consensus is that first and foremost you can never tell what a jury’s going to plump for,” she said. “So often serious horse-trading goes on and something worthy but dull takes the prize because the jurors are too divided about the more obvious candidates.“We were all joking at lunch that we can just imagine juror Asia Argento championing Lars von Trier’s Antichrist to the horror of the others. Having said that, I would bet that the Michael Haneke movie, The White Ribbon, is a strong contender for the Palme just because he’s never won the Palme itself (although he’s won best director and, I think, grand jury prizes), and one of his leading ladies, Isabelle Huppert, is head of the jury this year. I hasten to add that I haven’t even seen the film, but apparently it’s very good.“Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet ought to and probably will win something because it’s brilliantly made, although it could be described as a ‘genre’ movie, and juries often fail to honour such films. Which is dumb, but there you go.”The White RibbonBut what of Inglourious Basterds, Quentin Tarantino‘s eagerly anticipated WWII flick that ticks all the genre boxes? According to Empire’s Damon Wise, the film’s popularity will count against it. “It would enable QT to join the double-Palme club, but I think the film’s entertainment factor might count against it,” he says.It may also not help that jury president Huppert had originally been set to star in the film, before Tarantino replaced her for being too “divistic.”“I think it’s wide open at the minute,” he continues, “But with Isabelle Huppert as head of the jury, with the likes of Asia Argento and Hanif Kureishi backing her up, I don’t think the Palme will go to anything ‘meh’. I’ve been told it’s 50-50 between A Prophet and, er, something else, and I think Audiard’s film will appeal to [jury member] James Gray, certainly. A French film won last year, which might hold it back though. The jury’s five actresses, however, may suggest that women will be especially favoured this year, so Jane Campion and Andrea Arnold could be looking at a win, although perhaps not the Palme itself.“So I’ll stick my neck out. I think the Palme will go to Antichrist or The White Ribbon. If Haneke wins, Lars gets best director, and vice versa.”Finally, Total Film’s Jonathan Dean is championing a film about a drug dealer’s tripped out experience in Tokyo that has been causing quite a stir at the tail-end of the festival. “In a world where awards are handed out to films that don’t so much push the envelope as blow it up, Enter The Void would win the Palme d’Or for the next five years. Visually extraordinary and the most mind-warping film I’ve ever seen, [director] Gaspar Noe is a master of invention. Credit would be deserved.“But clearly, seeing as it’s a bit mad and really tails off in the last hour, Enter The Void won’t win. No chance. Instead I reckon – like everyone else, that A Prophet is the one to beat, even if personally I’d be satisfied with the other favourite The White Ribbon. Keep an eye out for Fish Tank too. A brilliant film sure to push jury members Huppert and Argento’s buttons.”The winner of the Palme D’Or will be announced this evening.

Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, and thought it sounded interesting, but never found out, on account of how you’re too lazy to read. Well, good news: now you never have to, because it’s being made into a movie.At first glance, the idea of a Freakonomics movie might sound as nutty as, say, a Monopoly movie; the book is, after all, about using statistics to prove or disprove a number of theories. Here, let’s have Variety explain:“Freakonomics” has sold more than 3 million copies by using economic theories to analyze issues ranging from whether Adam Vinatieri could realistically be called football’s most clutch field goal kicker to more serious claims that teachers and sumo wrestlers cheat, that swimming pools are more dangerous to children than guns and that the drop in crime can be attributed to Roe v. Wade.Not the most obvious choice for a film adaptation, in other words — but producers Chad Troutwine and Seth Gordon have lined up a list of highly regarded documentarians, including Morgan Spurlock (Super Size Me), Alex Gibney (Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room), and Eugene Jarecki (Why We Fight), to film 15-minute segments covering chapters from the book. Filming is scheduled to begin in January and end by summer. As Troutwine tells Variety:“I stalked the authors for a year because I saw cinematic appeal to the book as soon as I read it…It showed that conventional wisdom should always be tested and never trusted, and that is what documentaries are all about.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"renewed, stoner, Biopics, Christmas, crossover, french, lee, RT21, Chernobyl, screenings, Extras, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"freakonomics-headed-to-a-theater-near-you"},{"id":"47613348844043","title":"George Miller Vows to End Crappy Film-to-Game Ports","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})George Miller Vows to End Crappy Film-to-Game PortsDirector focusing on Mad Max 4: The Game.by Jeff Giles | March 18, 2008 |  CommentsFor almost as long as videogames have existed, filmmakers have been trying to bring them successfully to theaters — and failing. George Miller, however, aims to change all that.In a recent chat with Newsweek, the Happy Feet director divulged his console-related plans; perhaps unsurprisingly, they dovetail with one of his screen projects — and no, it isn’t Justice League of America:Well, the first one will be a “Mad Max” game. Because what happened was, we were all ready to go, within eleven weeks of shooting the next “Mad Max” movie, “Fury Road.” This was way back when the war in Iraq started, and that really threw this out for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which was that the American dollar crashed against the Australian dollar. And apart from that, just insurances, getting vehicles and stuff there on container ships — all that slowed down around the world. So we had to move on to “Happy Feet,” because that was going to take a long time.We were all ready to go on “Fury Road,” but instead of going off and shooting “Fury Road” straight away, I said “Okay, now that we’ve got that whole world prepared, let’s work together with somebody, if there’s someone out there.” And that started off on the path of trying to get together with Corey. Not handing it off to some third party game developer as we did on “Happy Feet,” but to try to do it all as a piece, in the hope that we overcome that problem of making bad films from good games or vice versa.“In other words,” he continued, “I’m delaying the movie in order to do a really good game.” According to Miller, the fourth Mad Max was in “a very highly advanced stage of preproduction” when he hit the pause button — and Mel Gibson had “all but signed to play the lead.” Five years makes a big difference, though; the director says Gibson’s days of playing the character are “long gone now.”Conspicuously absent from the interview was any talk of the JLA movie — writer N’Gai Croal refers to it as “on hold” at one point, and Miller lets it pass without comment. The bulk of their conversation is focused on Miller’s vision for a future in which stories jump much more seamlessly between platforms. As the director puts it:If you’re much more interested in games than movies, then you might enter the story through the game. Or you might enter the story through the film and move towards the game. It’s still the same story. It’s still the same characters. It’s still the same world. It’s just that you can approach the characters and the world from different angles.Source: Newsweek","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"george-miller-vows-to-end-crappy-filmtogame-ports"},{"id":"47613353698830","title":"More Wolverine News Than You Can Shake a Claw At!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})More Wolverine News Than You Can Shake a Claw At!Wizard digs its claws into the prequel.by Jeff Giles | August 7, 2007 |  CommentsIn the mood for a little dish on the forthcoming Wolverine movie? How about a lot? Today’s your lucky day — Wizard has posted a fat pantsload of information, speculation, and other assorted -ations, and we’re here to break it down and point you in the right direction for all the Wolvie news that’s fit to print.As previously announced, David Benioff — who also wrote Troy and this fall’s The Kite Runner — has written a script that everyone seems to love, and Gavin Hood (of last year’s Oscar-winning Tsotsi and the upcoming Rendition) will direct. Also, as previously confirmed, there’s no room at the inn for most of the familiar faces from the X-Men films. The bulk of the lengthy article, however, deals with the movie’s finer points, including plot details. To wit:Based on info from insiders who say they’ve read Benioff’s script, get ready for all kinds of prequel action as Wolverine’s first ties to Weapon X, his first run-in with Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth), his bonding with adamantium and his feral origins are explored. When asked if the film would touch on Wolvie’s early-year comic book connections to Japan, [Hugh] Jackman curbed the rumor in favor of others.“[The Japan connection] is still something we really want to do,” admitted the actor-producer. “What we need to do is establish who he is and find out how he became Wolverine. And by the end of the movie, I want it to be that you definitely knew who this guy was, like Mad Max and Dirty Harry. He’s a good guy, but he’s not a nice guy. He’s just the guy you want on your side.” Sources also mentioned scenes featuring Wolverine in Vietnam, a pre-X-Men love interest for the furry mutant and character names familiar to comic fans such as the teleporter John Wraith, who served with Wolverine on special ops missions as part of Team X, along with Fred J. Dukes (aka the Blob).Wolverine‘s release date is still being listed as “sometime in 2008,” but for pretty much everything else there is to know right now, check out the article below!Source: Wizard","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Syfy, comics, Walt, Awards, Lifetime, Walt","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"more-wolverine-news-than-you-can-shake-a-claw-at"},{"id":"47613345166857","title":"RT’s Best of the Decade!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT's Best of the Decade!We look at some of the top Tomatometers of the past ten yearsby RT Staff | December 23, 2009 |  CommentsJust ten years ago, we were unearthing our analog phones and covering our heads with tin foil hats while listening to Matchbox Twenty and Creed to prepare for Y2K – the day electronics would turn against us. It’s true, the new decade will arrive with considerably less dangerous fanfare and hoarding of canned goods, but it should not and does not take away from all of the films that impressed not only audiences, but the Tomatometer as well over the past ten years. With our annual Golden Tomato Awards just around the corner, RT braved the mothball-scented digital cobwebs in our archives to find some of the very best the Tomatometer had to offer this decade.Best Reboot/Remake[tomatometer]MuzeID=1186973[/tomatometer]In a decade filled with the return of iconic franchises, Star Trek wentfrom Impulse Drive to Warp 9 (too easy?) with both critics and audiences withits reboot this year. When J.J. Abrams signed on to take the helm of the StarTrek franchise with a group of new faces taking on the roles of thetimeless Enterprise crew, little did we know that the blockbuster film would goon to be one of the best reviewed movies of the year.While film after film hastaken us forward with the voyagers of the Starship Enterprise, Star Trek was atrue origins story that wasn’t geared towards Trekkies, too simple for fans ofthe show, or too complex for newbies. Star Trek delivered a visuallystunning brand of mainstream entertainment that propelled the series back notonly back into theaters, but the public consciousness. However, the movie had some stiffcompetition, going up against the son of Mr. and Mrs. Bond and a man in a bat suit, amongst a number of others but its broadappeal and ability to recruit a whole new generation of Star Trek fansmake it the Best Reboot of the Decade.More Top Reboots/RemakesCasino Royale94%The Departed92%3:10 to Yuma88%Batman Begins85%Best Superhero Movie[tomatometer]MuzeID=1138441[/tomatometer]Why so serious? In an era where superhero movies have become defined by grimangst, somber origin stories and dark nights of the soul, it might come as asurprise to discover that a psychotic clown versus a bat-man didn’t top thisbest-of-the-decade list. And yet, there it is — Pixar’s decidedly exuberant andsatirical superhero romp is the 2000s’ spandex-clad champ with movie critics,edging out the list’s highest-grossing film at the box office, The DarkKnight.We shouldn’t be surprised at all. Written and directed by Brad Bird — who showedwhat he was capable of with the superb Iron Giant — The Incredibles isa classic that succeeds in that rarest of ways; poking fun at the genre while atthe same time celebrating it and bringing something new and exciting to theform. It’s almost like Bird read Watchmen and distilled the novel’spremise to a pure comedic element. Fallen strongman Mr. Incredible and his wife,Elastigirl, have been forced into a suburban life since superheroes have beenoutlawed; only to return to action when crazed villain Syndrome — who’s the ultimatefanboy — sets out to wreak revenge on those that created him.With Bird’s impeccable sense of retro design writ colorfully in Pixar’s CGworld, The Incredibles is an artistic triumph as well as being adynamic action film and a seriously smart comedy — in any genre, really. It’san “unprecedented film that is not just a grand feature-length cartoon,” wrotethe Los Angeles Times, “but a grand feature.”More Top Superhero MoviesThe Dark Knight94%Spider-Man 294%Iron Man93%Spider-Man90%Best Directorial Debut[tomatometer]MuzeID=1212604[/tomatometer]The best documentaries help us to see the world in new ways, and on that AfghanStar is an unqualified success. It gives us a look at an Afghanistan thatwe rarely see on the news, and presents a nuanced portrait of a war-ravagednation that is looking for some measure of camaraderie and escapism. It alsoproves that, no matter where you are, American Idol-style singingcompletions make for compelling television.Directing her first feature, longtime TV producer Havana Marking deserves creditfor shining a light on a cast of characters that don’t often have a voice in theWest. It’s a powerful, thought-provoking debut that’s tense, insightful,inspiring, heart-wrenching…and true.More Top Directorial DebutsAnvil! The Story of Anvil98%Food, Inc.98%Finding Nemo98%Chicken Run98%Best R-Rated Comedy[tomatometer]MuzeID=1137344[/tomatometer]R-Rated comedies made a strong comeback this decade, receiving a particularlyeffective boost from films starring members of what has affectionately come tobe called the “Frat Pack” — people like Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn,and Owen Wilson — and Judd Apatow’s crew of jokesters (Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd,Jason Segel). Having said all that, the highest rated of these starred none ofthe aforementioned actors and featured far less bathroom humor than your averageman-child raunchfest.A little less than halfway through the decade, indie director Alexander Paynebrought us a thoughtful and melancholy yet often hilarious road trip movie abouta failed writer (Paul Giamatti) and his soon-to-be-married college pal (ThomasHaden Church). Miles Raymond (Giamatti) is the former of the two, a wineenthusiast and divorcé pining for his ex-wife who decides to take his buddy Jack(Church) on a weeklong trip through California wine country as a last hurrahbefore Jack is married. The pair end up meeting a couple of women (VirginiaMadsen and Sandra Oh) along the way, and their short vacation quickly becomestransformative for both of them. Praised for its outstanding performances andintelligent script, Sideways was a sleeper hit, winning several awardsand helping to launch the mainstream careers of its stars.More Top R-Rated ComediesHigh Fidelity92%Shaun of the Dead91%Borat91%Knocked Up90%Best Failed Franchise[tomatometer]MuzeID=1127359[/tomatometer]Look at those posters right below. Daredevil. Golden Compass. One of two Punishers released this decade.They’re like gravestones marking the result of Hollywood folly, misguided andfrequently cynical efforts to open cash cow franchises. But rising above thislot is 2003’s Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, and not just byvirtue of it having a fresh Tomatometer.A lot of things turned audiences en masse away from Master and Commander when itwas theatrically released (where it didn’t even cross $100 million): its awfultitle, its fondness for dialogue, and its lack of pirates. Naval officers on thehigh seas? They don’t sell! Master and Commander is a lumbering character piece,a literate blockbuster that preferred you get to know the characters before itgot into any sequel talk. It’s a movie that’s as much Russell Crowe’s as it is ashowcase for co-star Paul Bettany (who plays the temperate surgeon to Crowe’sblustery captain), further dividing audiences who wanted simply a mindlessstar-driven action flick.More Top Failed FranchisesThe Spiderwick Chronicles79%Daredevil44%The Golden Compass42%The Punisher29%Best Martial Arts Flick[tomatometer]MuzeID=1102698[/tomatometer]Unfortunately, any Tomatometer-based list of martial arts movies is going to besomewhat incomplete, as there are only so many such films that are madeavailable to a broader, international audience. Stars like Jackie Chan and JetLi are household names now, but before they made their US debuts in the mid-late90s, both had already built sizable filmographies in Chinese cinema.Additionally, crowning the “best” martial arts film of the decade is tough alsobecause most in the genre are purely about the action sequences, oftensacrificing compelling storylines and solid acting in favor of wildlybreathtaking fight choreography.But in late 2000, director Ang Lee introduced the rest of the mainstream worldto the Chinese period epic with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, andsuffice it to say that the world was immediately smitten. Truly only a “martialarts” movie insofar as The Lord of the Rings is merely an “actionmovie,” Crouching Tiger artfully blended its share of action withgorgeous cinematography, heartfelt drama, and an epic historical setting tocraft a fully immersive tale that resonated even with those unfamiliar with thegenre. It went on to win multiple awards, including the Best Foreign LanguageFilm Oscar, and became the highest grossing foreign language film in Americanhistory. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the martial arts movie forpeople who don’t watch martial arts movies, and it paved the way for other filmsof a similar nature, such as 2004’s Hero and this year’s RedCliff.More Top Martial Arts FlicksHero94%Shaolin Soccer92%Iron Monkey90%Kung Fu Hustle89%Best Disaster Movie[tomatometer]MuzeID=1144003[/tomatometer]TIME magazine titled its end-of-the-aughts issue “The Decade from Hell,” andalthough it wasn’t a decade without its jolly moments, Steven Spielberg’s Warof the Worlds is as good a representation as any of just how dark thingssometimes felt. Spielberg, after all, was the director who did more than justabout anyone else to turn Hollywood space aliens from creepy crawlies intobenevolent visitors — and here he was doing an about face, crafting abig-budget adaptation of the classic H.G. Wells novel about terrifyinginterstellar conquerors rising from deep within the earth. The 9/11 parallelswere hard to miss, but Spielberg being Spielberg, War was still apopcorn-gobbling good time; as Ken Tucker noted in New York Magazine, “StevenSpielberg’s War of the Worlds is huge and scary, moving andfunny-another capper to a career that seems like an unending succession ofcaptivations.”Worlds faced its toughest competition from The Road, whereCormac McCarthy discovered you can wring Pulitzer-winning drama from thepost-apocalyptic aftermath — even without Kevin Costner or Mel Gibson around topump up the action. The Day After Tomorrow proved that nobody destroysthings with quite as much panache as Roland Emmerich. The Core combinedthe dramatic might of Hilary Swank, Stanley Tucci, and DJ Qualls in a good oldfashioned blockbuster epic featuring a team of scientists, an early cameoappearance by “unobtanium” and a daring plan to detonate nuclear bombs at thecenter of the earth. And this year, Emmerich was back dreaming up new ways todestroy the planet, turning the Mayan calendar for inspiration to use $200million worth of state-of-the-art CGI to create its own brand of apocalypticcharm.More Top Disaster MoviesThe Road72%The Day After Tomorrow45%The Core42%201239%Best Children’s Book Adaptation[tomatometer]MuzeID=1197696[/tomatometer]Seems like it was a good decade to be an author of children’s books or YA lit.Harry Potter raised a whole new generation of kids to come out of the livingroom and into the theaters. Meanwhile, it was virtually guaranteed that at leastone of the books you read (or had read to you) as a tot was brought to themultiplex. The one that’s found the most critical success this decade is alsothe most recent: Fantastic Mr. Fox, the Roald Dahl classic work as adapted byWes Anderson, creator of new wave precious cinema.While many elements of the story’s plot was altered or removed completely, andthe movie itself not necessarily geared towards children, critics responded tothe movie’s joie de vivre and surprisingly thoughtful meditation on how to growup and how to do it with style. Fantastic Mr. Fox hasn’t found its audience intheaters, but expect a cult audience in coming years when it hits the homemarket.

Not only was the story recognized, but the Juno roleultimately catapulted Ellen Page to star status.

Why are celebrated auteurs David Lynch and Terry Gilliam having a hard time getting their films into theaters?David Lynch has never been a conventional filmmaker, but his latest project, \"Inland Empire,\" may mark an even stranger turn in the director’s career. The three-hour film, starring Laura Dern and Jeremy Irons, has gotten a mixed reception in its festival runs at Venice and New York; it currently stands at 67 percent on the Tomatometer.The story is, of course, enigmatic: As an actress cast in a doomed film project, Nikki (Dern) becomes confused with her character, lost within the tale of a Polish couple and a trio of giant rabbits (voiced by Naomi Watts, Scott Coffey, and Laura Harring). Her descent into madness is punctuated — in classic Lynch style — by musical dance numbers.More intriguing, however, may be Lynch’s plan to self-release the film, thereby getting it into theaters and retaining the rights to his work.David LynchTerry Gilliam won’t have to worry about distribution for his latest, \"Tideland\"; it was recently given a limited release. The story follows a young girl, Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland), as she is left to survive on an isolated farm when her parents OD on heroin within days of each other.The film’s exploration of childhood fantasy hinges on exhaustive (or, as many critics have said, exhausting) scenes of Jeliza-Rose playing with her dolls.At 26 percent, \"Tideland\" is the worst reviewed film of Gilliam’s career.His lack of recent commercial success may hinder his ability to make films in the future. Gilliam is famous for feuding with studios (the most famous example is \"Brazil\" although 2005’s \"The Brothers Grimm\" found him in something of a squabble with the Weinsteins), and he’s also had a few runs of bad luck (see \"Lost in La Mancha\").And although Gilliam met with Warner Bros. about directing \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,\" he believes he was never a serious candidate, given the mainstream constraints of the job. He’s also unsure if he’ll secure funding for \"Good Omens,\" which he hopes will be his next project.Terry Gilliam (left) in \"Lost in La Mancha\"While iconoclasts like Lynch and Gilliam may seem like extreme examples, a recent feature in the New York Times points out that a number of established indie directors must find other avenues to make ends meet when they can’t get a green light for their work. Some, like humanist John Sayles, take uncredited script-doctoring gigs, punching up the dialogue on blockbusters. Others, like documentarian Errol Morris, direct commercials. Still others, like Mary Harron and Rose Troche, have found television, particularly HBO series like \"Six Feet Under,\" to be more hospitable to their talents.In an era that might be described as post-indie, some of the genre’s most successful directors face a surprising return to their roots: Struggling to get their movies produced and distributed without compromising their artistic vision. When marketability still looms as one of the biggest factors in movie making, you have to wonder what impact the independent film boom of the last decade really made on the industry.This Week’s Indie Openings:Opening last week in limited release: \"51 Birch Street,\" a documentary exploring the hidden lives of the filmmaker Doug Block’s parents, is at 100 percent on the Tomatometer (with 13 reviews); \"Sweet Land,\" a sweeping tale of the American immigrant experience, is at 95 percent (21 reviews); \"Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple,\" a documentary about cult leader Jim Jones and his flock, is at 90 percent (20 reviews); \"Requiem,\" a German tale of epilepsy/demonic possession, is at 88 percent (16 reviews); \"Hair High,\" a perverse animated comedy about a strange high school, is at 67 percent (nine reviews); \"Sleeping Dogs Lie,\" Bobcat Goldthwait‘s sweet, taboo-busting rom-com, is at 54 percent (28 reviews); and \"Running with Scissors,\" a tale of therapy and growing pains starring Annette Bening and Gwyneth Paltrow, is at 25 percent (44 reviews).In \"Sweet Land,\" we learn about portable music in the days before the iPod.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Disney, psychological","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rtindie-david-lynch-terry-gilliam-living-on-the-edge-of-hollywood"},{"id":"47613358694929","title":"RTIndie: \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Half Nelson\" Lead Indie Spirit Award Noms","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RTIndie: \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Half Nelson\" Lead Indie Spirit Award Nomsby Tim Ryan | November 28, 2006 |  CommentsIt’s time again to celebrate the best that indie-land has to offer.

Looks like I was wrong.According to one very reliable source, it looks like Maria Bello will be stepping in to play the character made famous by Rachel Weisz: Evelyn O’Connell, wife to Rick O’Connell, as played by Brendan Fraser.Universal and director Rob Cohen must be really in love with the screenplay by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Usually in a case like this they’d hire a new actress for a new role and explain Evie’s absence with some off-hand remark in the film’s opening scenes.Nothing against Ms. Bello, of course, who was awesome in \"A History of Violence,\" but it always feels a little weird when a new actor steps into an established character. Ah well, guess we’ll see how it all turns out. (You also know Ms. Bello from movies like \"World Trade Center,\" \"Assault on Precinct 13,\" and \"Thank You for Smoking.\")Here’s an updated plot synopsis, by the way: \"The film brings the O’Connells and their full-grown son (Luke Ford) to the forbidden tombs of China and the Himalayas, where they battle a shape-shifting mummy, a former Chinese emperor (Jet Li) cursed by a wizard (Michelle Yeoh).

From promising releases from new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week in Fresh&nbsp;Indie Finds.&nbsp;This week at the specialty box office, we find three thought-provoking documentaries examining an iconic sports star, an infamous political figure, and the perilous journey of Afghan filmmakers to find safety after a bounty is placed on their heads by the Taliban.&nbsp;Where’s my Roy Cohn&nbsp;offers an unflinching presentation of one of the most influential and controversial fixers in 20th-century politics. Meanwhile,&nbsp;Diego Maradona&nbsp;chronicles the life and legend of one of the most famous (or infamous) soccer players to ever play the game, and in&nbsp;Midnight Traveler&nbsp;we follow a husband and wife filmmaking team as they traverse countless obstacles to escape a literal death sentence. In our Indie Trailers section, we have new horror trailers featuring Imogen Poots, Lupita Nyong’o, and Patrick Wilson.Opening This WeekendWhere's My Roy Cohn? (2019)  87%An advisor to countless politicians from Joseph McCarthy to Donald Trump, Roy Cohn built a reputation as a feared operative who would become the architect of our modern-day adversarial politics. Always attack, never apologize, manipulate the media, lie shamelessly, weaponize lawsuits, evade taxes and bills, and play on prejudices by scapegoating defenseless people — sound familiar? This is the Roy Cohn playbook. Though he operated in the shadows, Cohn became a semi-celebrity as he was praised by those that employed him and was simultaneously parodied and lampooned in media — even fictionalized by Tony Kushner in his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Angels in America. “A biographical portrait that doubles as an origin story for today’s amoral political landscape, its marriage of incisiveness and timeliness should make it an indie hit this fall,” says&nbsp;Nick Schager of Variety.Playing Los Angeles and New York this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to Texas, Chicago, Washington DC, and more cities in California on September 27.&nbsp;Diego Maradona (2019)  90%Diego Maradona will be remembered&nbsp;as an electrifying sports star but also as a cautionary tale of the consequences of unbridled adoration and fame. The Argentinian soccer star was beloved by Italian fans when he played for&nbsp;SSC Napoli (the formerly elite Soccer club Maradona’s outstanding play returned to glory) but was unceremoniously reviled when he had the audacity to play for his home country Argentina and win against Italy in the 1986 World Cup. Bolstered by never before seen behind-the-scenes footage, the film encapsulates the storm that Maradona weathered following the World Cup and the slew of personal failings that were made public. “Director Asif Kapadia has put together an extraordinarily intimate account of [Diego Maradona’s] rise and fall, enriched by grainy but graphic footage recording every phase of his life,” says&nbsp;Sandra Hall of the Sydney Morning Herald.Playing New York this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to more screens&nbsp;on September 27.&nbsp;Midnight Traveler (2019)  100%Shot entirely with phones in the most terrifying of situations,&nbsp;Midnight Traveler documents a family’s journey to escape a political death sentence. After Hassan Fazili made a documentary about&nbsp;the dire circumstances in Afghanistan,&nbsp;he was soon forced to flee the country&nbsp;due to a bounty that was placed on his head by the Taliban. Transporting his wife and daughters from one place of refuge to the next, Fazili captured their journey to safety through the Afghan mountains and their uncertain path to seek asylum,&nbsp;with only their love as the consistent fuel to propel them forward.&nbsp;Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com&nbsp;praised the film, still&nbsp;Fresh at&nbsp;100% on the Tomatometer, saying, “It achieves its mission of putting an intimate, human face on a seemingly overwhelming, faraway subject.”Playing New York this weekend;&nbsp;expanding to Los Angeles and San Fransisco on September 27.Fresh and Still in TheatersMonos (2019)  92%Monos&nbsp;is a Grimms’ fairy tale updated to highlight Colombia’s constant state of political unrest. Set in the remote mountains of the South American nation and filled with surprising acts of violence and mayhem, the story centers on a group of young teens who are removed from their families and left to govern themselves and train as&nbsp;agents in a mysterious civil war. “With an arresting young cast and a gritty, jarring cinematic style,” writes&nbsp;Alissa Wilkinson of&nbsp;Vox,&nbsp;“Monos&nbsp;is less likable than admirable, an achievement with a clear, apocalyptic vision.”Expanding to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, &amp; Washington DC on September 20.&nbsp;Along with… The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019) , a drama about a&nbsp;man with Down syndrome who befriends a drifter and flees his assisted living facility to pursue his dreams of professional wrestling stardom. Depraved (2019) ,&nbsp;a fresh, stylish take on the legend of Frankenstein. Brittany Runs a Marathon (2019) , a comedy about a hard-partying, underemployed woman who finds direction and meaning by training to compete in the New York City Marathon.

Night Shyamalan‘s latest creations. That’s why the producers of the Saw sequels are starting there and working backwards.“We just basically locked down the ending about a month ago so it’s working off of what happens from there,” said Oren Koules. “There’s nothing guaranteed. It’s really Mark [Burg] and I looking at each other and saying, ‘Okay, this story works, let’s go.’ When it doesn’t, we won’t go. We’ll miss a year, we’ll miss two years. It’s two things: If we have a story that works and the fans want to see it. It’s such a simple equation. Right now we’re working on some things on V. There’s nothing definitive.”Burg may even have plans to make Saw V and VI at the same time, though coming up with two shocking, surprising scripts for one epic shoot may not be possible (especially now with the WGA in full effect). This plan also hinted at which characters from Saw IV might become the focus of a Saw V.“It was an idea of ours to try and keep the cast together because it’s really difficult with Scott [Patterson] doing a TV series and other people doing other shows that we’re going to try to. I’d say it’s not out of the question but it’s going to be really hard for us to get the screenplay to Saw VI where we want it to be to be able to do it.”If Saw V does go ahead, it looks like Jigsaw will remain a factor. Despite having his head on a morgue scale on the posters for Saw IV, Koules wants actor Tobin Bell back for “as many as he wants.”The boys know that they won’t always be making a Saw movie a year. They’re prepared to accept their fate when the grosses go down. “I think we’ll all know,” said Koules. “As of the tracking, as of today and as of everything else right now, we’re still rolling. Listen, we’re surprised. There’s going to be a day we wake up, we don’t have a $25 million weekend, we have a $4 million weekend. We’re fine. We own the films. We’re okay.”","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"renewed, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"ending-already-written-for-saw-v"},{"id":"47613389653537","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Museum\" Opens at #1 on Christmas Weekend","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Museum\" Opens at #1 on Christmas Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | December 26, 2006 |  CommentsBen Stiller ruled Christmas weekend for the second time in two years with his new effects-driven comedy \"Night at the Museum\" which opened at number one with an estimated $30.8M, according to figures released by Fox.The PG-rated pic averaged a muscular $8,358 from an ultrawide release in 3,685 theaters including Imax venues. Two years ago, Stiller topped this same holiday weekend with \"Meet the Fockers\" which bowed to $46.1M in three days and $70.5M over five days.Fox did not report a four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday gross for \"Museum,\" but the comedy should be able to collect more than $40M over that period. According to official studio figures, Friday bowed to $12.4M, Saturday saw a slight 3% increase to $12.8M, and Sunday is projected to tumble 56% to $5.6M. The overall box office always falls sharply on Christmas Eve, but enjoys a vibrant rebound on Christmas Day when moviegoers have more time to visit their local multiplex.Most studios reported three-day estimates and many will also report four-day estimates on Monday, Christmas Day.Sony saw its Will Smith drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" fall one notch to second place with an estimated $15M over three days. The true-life tale dropped 44% from its opening weekend and raised its ten-day cume to $53.3M.Opening in third place was Sylvester Stallone‘s \"Rocky Balboa\" with an estimated $12.5M in three days and $22.2M over the five days since its Wednesday debut. The MGM pic averaged a respectable $4,143 over the Friday-to-Sunday period from 3,017 locations.Oscar winners Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie saw their new CIA thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" bow in fourth place with an estimated $10M from 2,215 theaters for a good $4,505 average over three days. Directed by Robert De Niro, the frame’s only new R-rated pic played to an adult audience with studio data showing that the audience was 73% over the age of 30 and 53% male. Universal projected that the four-day tally will reach $13.9M.In fifth place was Paramount’s family film \"Charlotte’s Web\" with an estimated $8M over three days, off 30%, for a cume of $26.8M after ten days. Fox’s fantasy adventure \"Eragon\" followed stumbling 69% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.2M. The dragon tale has taken in $37.6M in ten days.The football drama \"We Are Marshall\" opened in seventh place with an estimated $6.6M from 2,606 venues for a lukewarm $2,548 average for Warner Bros. The studio’s penguin film \"Happy Feet\" followed in eighth with an estimated $5.1M, down 39%, for a $159.1M sum.Sony’s \"The Holiday\" dropped 38% to an estimated $5M giving the Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet film $35.1M to date. New Line rounded out the top ten with \"The Nativity Story\" which climbed up 1% to an estimated $4.7M raising its total to $31.4M.In limited release, Warner Independent opened \"The Painted Veil\" in four theaters and grossed an estimated $47,000 in three days for a strong $11,750 average. Since its Wednesday launch, the Edward Norton period pic has collected $68,000 and on Friday the distributor will expand to 37 locations.Miramax’s Peter O’Toole pic \"Venus\" bowed to an estimated $36,000 from three venues for a promising $12,079 average.

His 2005 picture Mary — which gets its first UK screenings, at the NFT in London as part of a Juliette Binoche season, on the 2nd and 3rd of October — not only casts the 1995 Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner (The English Patient), but finds room for 2007 Best Actor Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) and 2008 Best Actress Marion Cotillard (La Vie en Rose), plus Matthew Modine (returning as a Ferrara alter ego after The Blackout) and Euro-favourite Stefania Rocca (best known for The Talented Mr Ripley).In the past, Ferrara has managed (against the odds) to get solid work from hit-or-miss talents like Madonna (reasonably credible in Snake Eyes aka Dangerous Game), Asia Argento (outstanding in New Rose Hotel) and Ice-T (good in R’Xmas), and guided powerhouses like Christopher Walken and Laurence Fishburne (The King of New York), Harvey Keitel (Bad Lieutenant) and Lili Taylor (The Addiction) through method performances which would fill shelves with statuettes if folks in Beverly Hills paid attention to films as rough, challenging and strange as the Ferrara oeuvre.Made partially as a response to Mel Gibson‘s The Passion of the Christ, Mary is a hard-to-categorise exercise in street theology — which touches on Da Vinci Code-ish speculations about the gospels, and wrestles with the age-old problems of faith and uncertainty in a mix of subtle character interplay and outright silent movie-style melodramatics. Tony Childress (Modine) has just finished directing and starring in a film called This is My Blood (not to be confused with There Will Be Blood), which is attracting Last Temptation of Christ-style organised protests for supposed blasphemy and anti-semitism. Marie Palesi (Binoche), the actress cast as Mary Magdalene, has been so overwhelmed by the experience of playing the role that she has opted to abandon her career and go to Jerusalem (‘what are you doing,’ Tony asks, ‘healing lepers?’) to explore spiritual pursuits and dispense enigmatic wisdom via cell-phone.It seems that she has come to believe that the depiction of Mary as a prostitute in the gospels and as Jesus’s wife in modern fiction are both male-perpetrated myths designed to cover up the fact that the messiah chose her, not Saint Peter, as his chief disciple — this is an interesting ‘what if’ in itself, and the scenes from This is My Blood in which Mary resists being shut out of the disciples’ boys’ club have a Pasolinian vigour that bests Gibson’s Christian torture porn and at least competes with Scorsese’s It’s a Wonderful Life heresies.A year later, with the film edited and due for release, Tony has shaved off his Jesus beard and retreated behind dark glasses while embarking on an embattled publicity tour for the film, responding to the protests with desperate aggression and hurt-little boy pride (Ferrara has been playing autobiographical games on the theme of artist as childish monster ever since The Driller Killer, and Modine enthusiastically plays up to the director’s out-of-the-room image). Ted Younger (Whitaker), a New York-based talk show host, conducts nightly interviews with theologians and Biblical historians (what channel could this possibly air on?) and Tony agrees to appear on the program (hinting that Marie might show up to solve the mystery of her disappearance) if Ted covers the scheduled premiere, which is expected to feature a possibly-violent clash with protestors (in a jarring shock scene, what seems to be a mix of hasidic Jews and a street gang attack the limo Tony and Ted are riding in).Ted is being unfaithful to his pregnant wife Elizabeth (Heather Graham) with actress Gretchen (Cotillard), and this ‘sin’ is punished when Elizabeth gives premature birth to a baby who struggles to live (it’s probably a mercy that Ferrara uses a plainly healthy baby, though this undercuts the desperation of the hospital scenes). Just as Harvey Keitel’s Bad Lieutentant bared his soul to Jesus, so Whitaker’s straying commentator stops the show with an angst-driven prayer — very few actors can get away with praying on screen, especially if they have to talk out loud to God and the audience, but Whitaker is as good here as in any given Idi Amin scene.With his spirituality completely turned around by this travail, Ted doesn’t give Tony the easy ride he expects on his show — and brings in the distant voice of Marie, who remains certain and centered as the men around her descend into mania. Like many a Ferrara film, the home stretch is deliberately chaotic and hard to follow, but a bomb threat disrupts the This is My Blood premiere and Marie takes to a fishing boat in Israel as she blends even more with Mary Magdalene. As cued by a debate in which characters (and the audience) are enjoined to ‘really think’ about the crucifixion, everyone gets a ‘big suffering scene’: Modine’s turn comes when Tony goes crazy as he works a projector, screening his film to the cops searching the auditorium for a bomb and gloating that there are ‘lines around the block in Chicago’. Only Binoche remains serene, though Marie’s abandonment of the life of a movie star for that of a saint might prompt audiences to muse that when Ferrara gives her great iconic close-ups he is turning saintliness back to old-fashioned stardom.Ferrara has always had one foot in the grindhouse and the other in the arthouse. He even made (and starred in) a porn movie (9 Lives of a Wet Pussy), which is unusual for someone as inclined as fellow New York Italian-American Martin Scorsese to make bizarre religious films. Then again, ‘really think’ about the crucifixion, as Mel Gibson did, and you find the horror movie bleeding heart of Roman Catholicism — previously strongest in the Ferrara filmography in the revisionist vampire movie The Addiction.Perhaps to put further distance between Mary and Gibson’s film, it inclines towards the respectable end of Ferrara’s output, which means even fans who cherish the likes of Ms .45 and Body Snatchers (on which he first worked with Whittaker) haven’t completely embraced it. Like Ferrara’s New Rose Hotel, R’Xmas, Go Go Tales and the documentary Chelsea on the Rocks, Mary has mostly screened at film festivals. Since The Blackout in 1997, even independent distributors haven’t got behind his films in the UK: they don’t even go direct to DVD, where you could find a Driller Killer 2 if any schlockmeister got the rights to it. This is the penalty for making films at a volume of eleven.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"hidden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"further-reading-marion-cotillard-and-forest-whittaker-in-abel-ferraras-mary"},{"id":"47613396492837","title":"James McAvoy on Atonement: The RT Interview","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James McAvoy on Atonement: The RT InterviewThe Scottish actor chats with RT about his latest role.by Rachel Sandor | December 6, 2007 |  CommentsScottish actor James McAvoy has shot several films in the last few years (Becoming Jane, The Last King of Scotland, and the eagerly anticipated Wanted) but so far remains most associated with Mr. Tumnus, his hairy role as the faun in The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. But if early Oscar buzz can be trusted, his name may also be synonymous with Oscar nominee.In his latest film, Atonement, McAvoy plays Robbie Turner, a groundskeeper whose entire life is irrevocably changed when he is falsely accused of a crime. Based on the novel by Ian McEwan, McAvoy joins a talented crew including Brenda Blethyn, Vanessa Redgrave, and the Pride and Prejudice team of director Joe Wright and actress Keira Knightley. Atonement opens this Friday in limited release. RT met up with McAvoy in San Francisco to chat about the challenges of playing a “perfect” character, the cost of training for Wanted, and why he might be taking a break from acting.In Atonement, there is an incredible very long tracking shot on the beach, involving lots of extras. How did you rehearse for that?James McAvoy: We wanted to be very particular, so we spent a whole day rehearsing. I think with something as daunting as that, most directors would say, “F–k it, we’ve got so many extras, we’ll just shoot all day and get 20 takes and one of them might work. And if they don’t all work, we’ll edit.” But Joe just decided that we would rehearse all day and get it perfect. And then when the light was just right, and we only had half an hour, we did three takes. Two of the takes didn’t work, so we were on the third take and it felt really good. So we went back to view it on the monitors and, of course, the monitors decided to f–king blow up, so we didn’t know if we had it. But we found out two days later when we got the footage back that it worked and it was all good.How many extras were involved in that scene?JM: There were 1500 people. Any one of them could have royally screwed up at any point, so it was a miracle that it worked. I always think that particular scene is a microcosm of what making a film is. It really is a miracle of people collaborating and it was interesting because it’s very rare that something is that free, and that the actor is the person that helps make the shot. Usually you’re told to stand somewhere and the cameras move all around you. It this scene, it was much more along the lines that the camera may be anywhere. It would never be in the same place twice because a horse would walk past me, so I would be like, “F–k, the camera’s over there!” The actors were creating the shots as much as they could, which was so enjoyable but also high pressure.What is it about Joe Wright’s directorial style that brings out such praised performances?JM: He grew up in the theater. His mother and father were both puppeteers and owned a puppet theater. His mother still owns one called The Angel. I think he loves actors, and that’s a big thing because not every director likes actors. A lot of directors feel like actors just f–k up their films. But Joe loves actors. He cares about them and tries to make them better. Having a director that is confident in you and cares about you makes you suddenly feel free. You feel safe to take risks and that alone is big. He understands every job on a film set, which I don’t think a lot of directors do. He appreciates everybody on set. He’s a proper f–king amazing über-director.You mentioned that Joe Wright has a theater background. Since the cast lived together while filming Atonement was this a theater-like experience?JM: I didn’t live together, I stayed separate. Partly because I went to college and couldn’t be asked about s–t anymore, and partly because my character is separate from all of them. It kind of helped that all of the actors that lived in the house with Joe and the crew were all quite posh. They were all quite upper class. Lovely people, and some of them are now really good friends of mine, but they were all quite posh and I’m not really. I’m not from that background. It was useful for me as my character to kind of stay away.So when I’d go up there for my dinner or something like that, I’d go once or twice a week. I could have gone up any night I wanted, and I was always welcome, but in my head and my imagination, I was only going up when I was invited. It was also kind of just me doing a little bit of make believe. I’m not a method actor, but I just kept myself a wee bit separate.Your character goes through many stages throughout the film — including age and going from being quite naïve to very jaded. How did you take on that challenge?JM: I like playing a variety of characters. I feel like I’ve been able to play different kinds of characters — I’ve done a lot of period pieces — but I’ve never had to play the same type of character too much. Getting to play two different types of characters in one film was quite interesting.I found him quite difficult to play and believe in to begin with, because he’s quite a perfect type of person and I found that strange. I didn’t know if I could play it convincingly because I wasn’t sure if I believed that people like that exist. And then it got easier as we went along because I started to believe that he could. People like that might not exist for real, but it’s what we should be. The type of person that he became halfway through the film after something bad happens to him is somebody that I’m much more used to playing. He’s somebody who is very conflicted and suicidal, and strangely because of that, much more human.He doesn’t really know who he is anymore. I don’t think he can quite remember who he was, because he is so different. The only person who knows who is his and can make him feel like he can even remember the person he used to be is [Keira Knightley’s character] Cecilia Tallis. If it wasn’t for the fact that she still cared for him, still loved him, or that she’s even alive, I think he’d kill himself because who he was would be completely lost. I think that’s just such an amazing place to start of playing a character.It’s hard to make a nice character seem interesting. How did you approach that for the first half of Atonement?JM: Badly, I think. I kept trying to make him interesting — conflicted, tainted, restless, passionate, and angry — and I had to stop doing that because it was not working in rehearsals. It was just bad. I just had to trust that the most boring person in the world is interesting, because we’re all interesting. We’re all miracles as well, that we’re even here.I don’t know why we’re not interested in seeing good people. I think we like seeing good people, but only if bad things happen to them. Which is weird, isn’t it? It’s like the whole thing with Jesus Christ. F–king hell, it’s an amazing story. Whether you’re Christian or not, it’s an incredible story because he’s the best person that ever existed on the planet, and we crucify him. So there’s something in our nature that enjoys stories where good people get royally f–ked up.In the novel, there are many different descriptions of Robbie. Although there is a lot of dialogue, much of his character is internal. How did you take that from the novel and apply in to your portrayal of Robbie?JM: I did it as faithfully as possible. I think it was clear to me that Joe was trying to make a very faithful adaptation of the film. Whereas when I did The Last King of Scotland, the adaptation of the film was very different. With that, it almost became a burden and a barrier to be too attached to the book, because the character was so different. But with Atonement, it was so faithful [because] the book was just an amazing source. If you wanted to know something about Robbie’s history, you didn’t just have to make it up. Which I’ve done before, where I think, “F–k, I want to know what his relationship with his dad is like.” So then you spend five minutes inventing a history with his dad. But with this film, you don’t have to do that because it’s written for you. There’s something about the fact that it’s already been done that means your imagination and ego can’t taint the character’s history. There are hard facts that you may not like about the character, but you have to deal with it and there’s something quite nice about that, because it means you can’t have it all your own way as an actor.You’ve done Band of Brothers and Atonement. Is there something that draws you to the World War II period?JM: No, I don’t think so. To be honest with you, none of the films that I have done in the last two years I have chosen to do. I’ve auditioned for them all. I could have been drawn to doing them, but it didn’t mean I was going to get them. The jobs that I got were the jobs they decided to cast me in. I don’t know why I get cast in a lot of period pieces. Stephen Fry told me that I had a face for period, that I look like someone from 1920. But I definitely do like that period of the two World Wars. They were such defining moments for British history and world history. They really helped shape the modern world — the bravery, the loss, the waste.Doing the action scenes for Wanted must have been a completely different experience for you.JM: Totally different than anything I’ve ever experienced in my life. The 16-year-old boy in me was like, “Woo-hoo!” But after about three weeks, the 16-year-old boy just wanted to stay in bed, and the adult’s going, “Oh, my back hurts so much. I don’t want to go to the gym.” The trainer who you used to really like is like, “C’mon, we’ve got to do some more weights.” And you’re just like, “May you burn in hell, you bastard!” [Laughs.]But I’m really lucky. I’ve never really been pigeonholed as an actor and I’ve been able to play many different roles, so it was a chance to explore a different avenue. There’s also a lot of comedy in it, and I love doing comedy. It was really quite a departure, and I think the thing that elevated it was the director, Timur Bekmambetov. [He’s] mad as a box of snakes! He’s just crazy, in a good way, in the best possible way, and and I’m really interested to see what he’s done with it because I think he’s really special.Is it true that you’re going to take a break from acting?JM: I think I am. I’ve been saying that for a long time. But things are shaping up for next year, and maybe I’ll be working again in March.You’ve done a lot of films recently.JM: Yeah, you’ve got to. And that’s good because I’m young and that’s the time for work, isn’t it? You chill out when you get older. That’s apart from the fact that I think people get sick of the sight of your face. It’s probably a good idea to chill out. Also, if you’re an actor, your job is to pretend to be a real person, to recreate reality. You’ve got to have a bit of a life from which to draw upon. If you don’t live in the real world because all you do is spend all day on film sets, you become such a weirdo. Film sets are a strange place, but an exciting place. I do love my work, I really enjoy going to work. But if you just spend all your time on film sets or even on stage, you can become a Michael Jackson figure, living in your own little universe.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"X-Men, tv, The, Summer, trailers, miniseries, archives, drama, Ellie, BBC, cars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"james-mcavoy-on-atonement-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613384063518","title":"The 25 Scariest Movie Scenes of All Time","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 25 Scariest Movie Scenes of All TimeFrom terrifying classics like The Thing, Alien, and The Exorcist, to recent chillers like The Babadook and Hereditary, these are the scenes that scared us halfway (maybe a little more) to death.by RT Staff | October 31, 2019 |  CommentsThere’s all manner of method to the madness in our selections of the scariest movie scenes ever. Some use high amounts of gore. Others deliver unnerving calm and quiet before shattering the senses. A few feature amazing monster makeup and effects. The one common thread between them all: They work. And work not just at producing a moment of fear, but sustaining that fear, sometimes for minutes on end, to drill deep into our psyche and staying there for decades. These are the stuff of nightmares, what we see when we close our eyes at night. These are the 25 scariest movie scenes of all time. Warning: spoilers abound!What’s the scariest movie scene you’ve ever seen? Tell us in the comments.&nbsp;Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. All rights reserved. Courtesy: Everett Collection.)The scene: The chest burstOne of the things that sets Ridley Scott’s sci-fi nightmare apart from the other horror fare of its era is its relatively slow burn, playing on the claustrophobia of space and the fear of the unknown. So it comes as a shock to the system when a “facehugger” hurtles out of an egg and attaches itself to John Hurt’s Kane, puncturing the atmospheric dread with a visceral jump scare. But the moment that became indelibly stamped in pop culture history comes just a few scenes later, after the facehugger has detached itself and Kane is recovering from the incident. As the crew enjoys a meal together, Kane suddenly begins to choke and convulse on the table, and a small, lizard-like creature bursts through his chest and scrambles away, effectively birthing a horror villain that would terrorize space crews for decades to come.The Babadook (2014)  98%(Photo by IFC Midnight/Courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;Baba breaches bedroomA lot has been written about&nbsp;The Babadook: It’s a story about grief, and it’s a story about feminism; it’s less a horror film than a domestic drama; and somehow through it all its central bogeyman has emerged a wonderfully camp gay icon. We’re all for it. But in the midst of the think pieces and the movie’s surprising afterlife, one thing often goes overlooked:&nbsp;The Babadook&nbsp;is just a really, really scary horror traditional horror flick, too. Take the scene in which the Babadook (dook, dook) taunts Amelia (Essie Davis) in her bedroom. On paper, it’s nothing we haven’t seen in any&nbsp;Conjuring&nbsp;or&nbsp;Insidious&nbsp;flick, but as executed by director Jennifer Kent and acted by Davis (robbed of an Oscar nom, and yes we’re still sore) it’s almost unwatchably tense. Sound and darkness work overtime to drum up the suspense before the Babadook himself appears, jerkily terrorizing the woman on the edge of a breakdown.The Blair Witch Project (1999)  86%(Photo by Artisan Entertainment/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;Putting babies in the cornerAnyone who tells you this super-low-budget 1999 phenom isn’t actually scary just hasn’t watched it all the way to the end. Because if you can sit through the moment Heather discovers Mike standing in the corner of that abandoned house and&nbsp;not&nbsp;tear the leather off your La-Z-Boy’s arms then you’re a much tougher horror-watcher than we are. The traumatizing screams and image of Mike standing ultra-still in the corner are scary enough – add in the fact that none of it is explained and this is a fright-filled finale for the ages.The Conjuring 2 (2016)  80%(Photo by New Line Cinema / courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;The nun comes to lifeTaken on its own merits, The Conjuring 2 was a solid movie, even if it didn’t quite reach the heights of its predecessor. But it’s somewhat telling that its most memorable scare came courtesy of an entity who spends much of the film on the fringes of the primary story and whose presence was so immediately chilling that it spawned its own spin-off movie. The scene in question takes place inside the Warrens’ (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) own home, when Lorraine experiences a vision in which she is trapped and attacked by the demon nun Valak. Director James Wan milks the tension for all its worth, as a dark shadow moves across the walls and positions itself behind the painting of the nun’s face before it lunges at Lorraine with a shriek. We all checked our pants after that.The Descent (2006)  86%(Photo by Lions Gate/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;Monsters revealedNeil Marshall’s&nbsp;The Descent&nbsp;is considered by some the scariest movie of the past 20 years, and for good reason. The movie hooks us in with its claustrophobic setting –&nbsp;a tiny and very unstable cave system somewhere in Appalachia –&nbsp;and its dynamic group of women with their complicated pasts and relationships. Then, when it has us right where it wants us…&nbsp;MONSTERS. And f—king scary ones at that. The movie’s most intense scene is also the first time we see these humanoid beasties, and Marshall masterfully mixes slow-building dread, dramatic distraction, and a helluva jump scare for the big reveal. We’re so caught up in the drama over Juno getting the group lost that we almost don’t notice that&nbsp;thing&nbsp;standing RIGHT THERE.Don't Look Now (1973)  95%(Photo by British Lion Films)The scene:&nbsp;The endingUp until the very end, you don’t know what the exact nature of the threat is in Don’t Look Now. You’re only aware that something sinister creeps on the fringes, vaguely menacing Donald Sutherland’s character as he wanders Venice with his wife after the accidental drowning of their young daughter in America. It’s the uncomfortable way people talk to him. Or is that just how it always feels in a foreign country? It’s in the way light reflects onto the camera. Or isn’t that how light always bounces around? It’s in Sutherland’s unsettling visions of his wife and daughter. Or is he just processing grief? But it all snaps into place for Don’t Look Now‘s vein-icing final sequence, giving terrible logic and clarity to the preceding 100 minutes.The Exorcist (1973)  83%(Photo by Warner Bros./ Courtesy: Everett Collection.)The scene:&nbsp;Spinning headsWilliam Friedkin’s controversial film, based on a novel that fictionalized purportedly true events, is famous for the raucous reactions it inspired from terrified audiences who nevertheless flocked to see it in droves. It managed to entertain just as effectively as it scared the pants off of everyone, and perhaps no scene captures that special magic as well as the moment when Linda Blair’s possessed Regan – after having performed a rather sacrilegious act with a crucifix – spins her head 180 degrees to face her frightened mother (Ellen Burstyn). Regan does spin her head again later, during the climax of the film, but this first scene is so vulgar, violent, utterly shocking, and ultimately horrifying that it’s impossible to pull your gaze away from the screen.Eyes Without a Face (1962)  98%(Photo by Lux Compagnie Cinématographique de France)The scene:&nbsp;Face/offDirector Georges Franju started his career as a documentary filmmaker, an invaluable skill set for his second narrative feature Eyes Without a Face. It’s the story of a desperate father who, after disfiguring his daughter in a car accident, spends his night killing women, slicing off their faces, and attempting to attach them to his daughter’s. The concept is gross enough, but the way Franju uses his calm and deliberate camera (indeed, like shooting a documentary) during the film’s infamous central surgery scene gives the fictional proceedings the sheen of reality.Hereditary (2018)  89%(Photo by A24 /Courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;An allergic reactionLike Alex Wolff’s Peter in the movie, we were left completely speechless and frozen the first time we saw THAT MOMENT in&nbsp;Hereditary. We’re being vague for now, because it’s such a recent film and the moment is such a spoiler, so if you haven’t seen the movie stop reading now…. OK, if you’re still with us, you know what we’re talking about: Charlie (Milly Shapiro), struggling for breath in the back seat, pushes her head out of the car window and connects with a passing telegraph pole. The whole sequence, from the chocolate cake at the party to the wheezing in the car to the moment of impact, is brilliantly choreographed, but this is one of those scares that was also heavily aided by the film’s publicity. Charlie was at the center of the marketing campaign, leaving viewers to think she would be a central figure right through to the end; when she gets it about a third of the way in, we suddenly know that&nbsp;anything&nbsp;can happen in&nbsp;Hereditary. If&nbsp;Psycho&nbsp;broke the “don’t kill your main character” rule, and&nbsp;Scream&nbsp;stepped all over the “don’t kill your biggest star” rule,&nbsp;Hereditary&nbsp;went one further: Don’t kill the kid.Jaws (1975)  98%(Photo by Universal)The scene:&nbsp;The opening sceneMuch has been made of Spielberg’s expert use of the unknown and unseen in&nbsp;Jaws, and nowhere is it more apparent than in the movie’s opening scene in which a woman is jerked to and fro by something moving beneath her in the black abyss. (Stuntwoman Susan Blacklinie had hooks attached to her Levi’s and was being pulled by divers.) The scene is also the first time the world got to hear that iconic John Williams score, its pulsing slow-build instantly becoming a mood-building classic. We eventually went back in the water after seeing&nbsp;Jaws, but never at night.Martyrs (2008)  64%(Photo by Weinstein Company/Courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;A transcendental&nbsp;experienceMartyrs was part of the New French Extremity movement, where a wave of filmmakers put out horror films hit harder than ever before. Part home invasion, part torture porn, all blood and gristle, Martyrs details a cult-like group who torture young, beautiful women to the brink of death to uncover insights into the afterlife. It all comes to a head with the final sequence, where one of the main characters is flayed alive. Worse: She survives. Even worser: The experiment actually works, as the character enters a transcendental state. The knowledge she gleans about the afterlife and passes on, however, proves too much for the living.Misery (1990)  90%(Photo by Columbia/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;Annie breaks Paul’s legsWhen it comes to visceral gross-out scares, the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;films may win for degree of difficulty and&nbsp;Hostel&nbsp;(remember that one?) may be the king of holy-f—k gore. But for impact, nothing beats Rob Reiner’s&nbsp;Misery, in which barely a drop of blood is spilled and not a single eyeball plucked. We’re cringing just remembering the moment Kathy Bates’ Annie Wilkes’ places a block of wood between a tied-down Paul Sheldon’s (James Caan) feet and breaks his ankles with the swoop of a giant sledgehammer. The crunch! The unnatural bend of the ankle! The slow and methodical description of “hobbling” that Wilkes gives before she takes her epic swing! Jigsaw ain’t got nothing.Paranormal Activity (2009)  83%(Photo by Paramount Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;The 21st nightOren Peli’s game-changing found-footage film did for the bedroom what&nbsp;Blair Witch&nbsp;did for the woods. The fast-forwarded footage of Katie (Katie Featherstone) standing by her bed and watching Micah sleep was the reason some of us got separate bedrooms – with locks – from our loved ones for months after the hit film’s release. But the movie saved its best shock for last: On night 21, a now fully possessed Katie leaves the bedroom, lures Micah out with a torrent of screams, and then –&nbsp;after a seemingly endless silence –&nbsp;throws him at the screen and proceeds to eat him. Well, at least we&nbsp;think&nbsp;that’s what might happen. Like&nbsp;Blair Witch’s unexplained finale, this one leaves us with lots of theories to chew on.Psycho (1960)  96%(Photo by Universal Pictures)The scene: The&nbsp;shower killHitchcock didn’t invent the slasher, but we’ll be damned if he didn’t perfect it with&nbsp;Psycho&nbsp;and its seminal scene: Marion Crane’s iconic shower death. Even after you analyze the hell out of it –&nbsp;the Hershey’s chocolate syrup in place of blood; the edits that never once show knife penetrating skin – the moment loses none of its ability to shock. The key is the build-up, that wonderful shadow of Norman behind the curtain, and then the brutality: those quick-cut thrusts matched by that iconic burst of Bernard Herrmann’s score.[Rec] (2007)  89%(Photo by Filmax/Courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: Dragged into darknessThis is a found footage nightmare set in a quarantined building in Barcelona where a zombie virus infection is breaking out. Our protaganist Angela is a newscaster who at first merely wants to report on the mysterious closure of the building, and then becomes the news herself when she ges swept into the quarantine. [REC] is a roller coaster of a film, culminating in its final scene, presented in eerie quiet and night vision, as Angela, seeming like she just might make it out, is dragged into the darkness while the dropped camera rolls on. It’s such an effective moment, it was of course spoiled on the theatrical for the American remake Quarantine.The Ring (2002)  71%(Photo by DreamWorks/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: The&nbsp;cursed videoIt took us far longer than seven days to wipe the images from this bizarro piece of video art from our minds. Gore Verbinski’s U.S. remake of&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;is full of excellent creepouts – Samara emerging from the TV; the distorted victims’ faces –&nbsp;but the ace up its sleeve is the video at its center. This unnerving mish-mash of static, random ominous imagery (a tree aflame, a woman brushing her hair), and insistent screeching is truly dread-inducing. Even after it’s been aped by the opening sequence of nearly every season of&nbsp;American Horror Story, the&nbsp;Ring&nbsp;video still makes an impact.Rosemary's Baby (1968)  96%(Photo by Paramount)The scene:&nbsp;Mother and childThe tension rises and falls throughout Rosemary’s Baby, never allowing the viewer to quite settle in and fully process what’s happening. A demonic rape her, some weird juice there, just to keep the viewer discombobulated. It all reaches a boiling point in the dream-like coda, when Rosemary wakes up after giving birth, in her empty apartment. She finds a hidden room where her husband and neighobrs have gathered, all in on the conspiracy for her to deliver Satan’s child, and welcome her in. You never see the baby, but Rosemary’s line says it all: “What have you done to him? What have you done to his eyes?!”Scream (1996)  79%(Photo by Dimension Films)The scene: ‘Do you like scary movies?’Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson’s genre-reinvigorating classic kicks off with what many consider the greatest opening scene in horror history. Plot-wise, it’s basically&nbsp;When A Stranger Calls, ’90s-style – girl is alone in the house, receives stalk-y phone call, happens to have encyclopedia knowledge of the film genre in which she suddenly finds herself – but Craven brings so much smart and bravura skill to the direction of it that it kicks complete ass even decades later, after we’ve seen the countless imitators that followed and the shock of having a big-star snuffed out in the first 10 minutes has worn off. Credit too to Ghostface voice Roger L. Jackson, that perfectly placed pan of Jiffy Pop, and to Williamson’s script, a step-by-step screenwriting masterclass in how to ratchet up tension. “The question who am I, the question is where am I?”: Chills to this day.The Shining (1980)  84%(Photo by Warner Bros)The scene:&nbsp;Jack on the attackKubrick stuffed his adaptation of Stephen King’s novel with so many scary moments and images, trying to pick just one could drive you to Jack Torrance levels of craziness. But we’re doing it anyway. While the Grady twins in the hallway are spooky as hell, and we still can’t erase the image of the bathtub woman from our minds, we had to go with the movie’s most iconic moment: Wendy trapped in a bathroom as Jack hammers at the door. Kubrick’s swinging camera, Jack Nicholson’s mania, and Shelley Duvall’s totally convincing fear combine to make this the most terrifying scene in one of cinema’s most terrifying movies.Sleepaway Camp (1983)  77%(Photo by United Film Distribution Company /courtesy Everett Collection)The scene: The&nbsp;big revealFor much of its runtime, Sleepaway Camp plays like any other teen slasher of the 1980s, with a bunch of kids who are summarily executed one-by-one by a mysterious killer. If some of the kills are overly creative — death by a thousand bee stings? a curling iron in the hoo-ha? — none of them compares to the twist at the end of the film, which comes from way out of left field. The quiet, young, bullied girl at the center of the movie, Felissa Rose’s Angela, is not only revealed to be the killer, she’s also outed as a man,&nbsp;dressed up as the opposite gender by his demented aunt.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%(Photo by Bryanston Distributing Company)The scene:&nbsp;Leatherface appearsThe Texas Chain Saw Massacare is considered one of the most punishing, sickly transformative experiences in horror. And it’s not even 90 minutes long. And nothing happens for like the first 30 minutes. But once Leatherface appears, the movie never lets up afterwards. His grand debut happens inside his house, when a stupidly intrepid young adult enters looking for fuel for his car. Leathface pops out from a hallway and hits the dude in the hammer, the body crumpling and then twitching on the ground. Leatherface drags the body into the butcher room, and slams the door. There’s plenty of more scares to come, but this opening salvo is as disturbing as they come.The Thing (1982)  86%(Photo by Universal/courtesy Everett Collection)The scene:&nbsp;Getting something off your chestJohn Carpenter was well into his groove by the time he made The Thing, and he put all of his talents on display to contribute one of the most influential entries in the “body horror” genre not directed by David Cronenberg. We get our first glimpse of the “thing” fairly early in the movie when it absorbs a pack of huskies, and we see it again when it attempts to assimilate Peter Maloney’s Bennings. But the big scare comes when Charles Hallahan’s Norris appears to have a heart attack, and Dr. Copper (Richard Dysart) attempts to revive him with a defibrillator. Norris’ chest opens up like a giant mouth, complete with teeth, and rips Copper’s arms off before Kurt Russell’s MacReady blasts it with a flamethrower. Thanks to some top-notch practical effects and the judicious use of a jump-scare, the scene remains the most memorable and viscerally disturbing in the movie.The Vanishing (Spoorloos) (1988)  98%(Photo by Argos Films)The scene: The&nbsp;truthForget everything you know about The Vanishing. Oh, that was fast — as if you’ve never seen the Jeff Bridges/Sandra Bullock kidnap thriller before. It was a lousy movie with the distinction of being a remake…with the same director. George Sluzier was brought to Hollywood to direct the remake, and it’s easy to see why: the 1988 Dutch original is a chilling, methodical examination about the mundane face of pure evil. Naturally, the American version has none of that. It also doesn’t have the original’s ending: When the hero finally confronts his girlfriend’s kidnapper, who offers him the opportunity to find out what happened to her. The answer is one of the most terrifying scenes in movie history.When a Stranger Calls (1979)  41%(Photo by Columbia Pictures)The scene: The&nbsp;phone callsPop in When a Stranger Calls and for the first 20 minutes, you’ll think you’re watching the scariest movie ever made. Carol Kane plays the babysitter, and she keeps on getting increasingly menacing calls to check on the kids upstairs. When she gets the call traced, naturally it’s coming from inside the house! Think this scene won’t work anymore because it’s been parodied and referenced to death since? Think again. It remains a masterclass in editing and suspense. The rest of the movie is pretty lousy, but that opening act can still dial up the tension decades later.The Wicker Man (1973)  89%(Photo by British Lion Films)The scene: The&nbsp;burningNot quite a masterpiece these days but definitely a classic, The Wicker Man follows a prudish police officer as he investigates the disappearance of a young girl on a remote English island populated by pagans. As he follows the clues and contradicting statements of the village people, he edges ever closer to the titular wicker man, a sacrificial vessel to be burned at dusk. Even if you can get who gets put inside it, the sheer intensity and terror of the scene is still something to be witnessed.Like this?

A few of these festival flicks will probably even make it to theaters near you!\"Padre Nuestro\"Diego (Jesus Ochoa) opens his door to find a long-lost son in \"Padre Nuestro\"Director and screenwriter Christopher Zalla makes an impressive debut with \"Padre Nuestro,\" a tale of stolen identity and desperation that unfolds as a taut thriller and excels with tragically drawn performances by a multi-generational cast.Seventeen-year-old Pedro is making an illegal border crossing from Mexico to New York City when he meets fellow youngster Juan, an orphaned hustler. When Pedro arrives, he discovers his belongings and identity have been stolen by his new friend, who himself sets out to find Pedro’s restaurateur father Diego, pose as his never-before-seen son, and steal his supposed riches.But Diego (Jesús Ochoa) isn’t a restaurant owner, and he’s not rich. The working-class dishwasher begrudgingly takes in Juan (Armando Hernandez) — who secretly hunts for hidden money in Diego’s house and steals wallets by day — and despite himself, finds a fatherly love for the kid beginning to seep into his rough, lonely life. Meanwhile, the Spanish-only speaking Pedro (Jorge Adrián Espíndola) is lost and penniless on the streets of New York, his only friend the coke-addicted street girl Magda (Paola Mendoza) who initially steals from him, then helps him track down his father. Even their friendship is only a tenuous partnership for survival, challenged by the hard fact that, living on the street, the only thing that matters — not health, not love, not ethics — is cold, hard cash.Zalla’s script is a rich thread pulling his characters ever closer, with a constant feeling of dread lurking around the corner, a hint of love, and a redeeming suggestion of hope. All four of his actors are heart-rending and excellent, playing each turn of fate — loss, deception, discovery — with tragic, lived-in understanding.\"Padre Nuestro\" currently has one Sundance review in. As of Saturday, the film has won the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic film of the 2007 Sundance Film Festival.\"Blame it on Fidel\"Nina Kervel as the 9-year-old Anna in \"Blame it on Fidel\"The only thing cuter than the 1970s-set French comedy-drama \"Blame it on Fidel\" is the film’s young star (first-time actress Nina Kervel), who plays 9-year-old Parisian girl Anna de la Mesa, a perfectly-mannered young parochial school girl whose civil, ordered life is thrown into chaos when her bourgeois parents decide to become super-liberal political activists.Young Anna likes her cushy existence just fine — learning Genesis from nuns, living in a big house with a garden, eating her fruit the civilized way with fork and knife. But when her writer mother (Julie Depardieu) and lawyer father (Stefano Accorsi) decide to abandon their complacent lifestyle to participate in social change, Anna must learn a new way of life, whether she likes it or not.It’s the \"or not\" part that comprises \"Fidel,\" the clever and funny tale of Anna’s dogged resistance to change. Though her parents seem almost neglectful as they turn their attentions from caring for Anna and her brother to organizing Allende supporters in Chile and fighting for women’s rights, it’s Anna’s transformation from doctrine-taught conservative (repeating the anti-Communist venom of her grandmother, demanding to stay in Catholic school) to open-minded citizen that is the focus of our attentions.There are plenty of cute moments in director/writer Julie Gavras‘ script, including the titular conclusion that Anna draws when her family’s new socio-economic status necessitates moving from the house with a garden to a cramped apartment, eating \"strange\" food cooked by a lineup of multi-national nannies, and hosting Marxist meetings at night in her living room. Most remarkable is that the young Kervel pulls off her character’s complicated trajectory from prissy and conventional to accepting and worldly, all the while conveying the familiar logic of childhood reasoning that we all may remember from our youth.\"Waitress\"Keri Russell as Jenna, a pregnant woman desperate to escapeSmall town women with dead end lives are given a sweetly comic treatment in \"Waitress,\" starring Keri Russell as a pie-shop server stuck in a miserable marriage who discovers (to her horror) that she’s pregnant.Adrienne Shelly’s script paints characters with a Southern twang and a wicked sense of humor, women who know their lot and have learned to commiserate and deal with disappointment — decrepit old husbands, nerdy suitors, loveless marriages. There’s Becky (Cheryl Hines), a trophy wife looking for excitement; Dawn (writer/director Shelly herself), a nerdy dreamer with low self-esteem; and Jenna (Russell), who’s gotten used to unhappiness, hates her husband Earl (a slimy Jeremy Sisto), and dreams of running away.Jenna’s only solace is creating wonderful pies for the diner (like the hilariously titled \"I Don’t Want Earl’s Baby Pie\") until a new OB-GYN comes to town in the form of the handsome, awkward Dr. Pomatter (Nathan Fillion, alternately impassioned and amusingly uncomfortable). Their attraction brings Jenna a newfound contentedness, but the good doctor is married, and Jenna’s about to have a baby she neither wants nor is prepared to love.Shelly’s posthumously released film is a charmer, though its simplistic characterizations take a minute to absorb and accept. At least the story’s central character, Jenna, is written with texture and depth; all others are just supporting caricatures (the perky, naïve friend; the oversexed, older gal pal; the skuzzy, needy husband) that don’t have, but don’t really need, the same degree of development.\"Waitress\" utilizes a visual wit to great effect, and benefits from two very surprising, scene-stealing supporting roles to look for: Andy Griffith as Old Joe, the crotchety pie-shop owner, and Eddie Jemison as a love struck, bad poetry-spouting bumpkin.\"Waitress\" currently has five Sundance reviews in, winning over the hearts of critics like Comingsoon.net’s Ed Douglas, Film Threat’s Jeremy Mathews, and Moviehole’s Paul Fischer. The quirky Southern comedy sold last week to Fox Searchlight for $4 million and will be released later this year.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"game-of-thrones, live, comic, motion, One, franchise, Musicals, in, casting, books, Month","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"sundance-reviews-padre-nuestro-blame-it-on-fidel-and-waitress-all-superb"},{"id":"47613395176996","title":"Wanted‘s James McAvoy: His Best-Reviewed Films","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Wanted's James McAvoy: His Best-Reviewed FilmsWe run through the finest work -- so far -- of this rising star.by Tim Ryan | June 25, 2008 |  CommentsThe action-thriller Wanted hits theaters this week, and though it’s toplined by one of the biggest stars in the world (Angelina Jolie), it also features a young Scotsman who’s making a name for himself as well: James McAvoy.On these shores, McAvoy first earned notice for his work in HBO’s Band of Brothers and the Sci-Fi Channel’s Children of Dune. Since then, his star has risen, and it’s not hard to see why; McAvoy plays characters of fundamental decency and charm, and has become something of a heartthrob with bookish ladies. Here’s a rundown of McAvoy’s best-reviewed work to date.Bright Young Things (2004, 65 percent)After years of acclaimed theatrical and television performances in the UK, McAvoy crossed the pond to US cinemas — albeit joined by a formidable collection of Brit acting talent — in Bright Young Things. Stephen Fry‘s directorial debut wryly follows the social goings-on of young upper-crust Britons in the 1930s, complete with scandal, romantic triangles, and generational conflict. It would seem difficult to stand out in a cast that features Richard E. Grant, Emily Mortimer, Simon Callow, Jim Broadbent, and Peter O’Toole, but McAvoy holds his own, playing a needy, manipulative scandal-sheet writer who still inspires empathy. “Newcomer James McAvoy [is] very good,” wrote Derek Elley of Variety.The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (2005, 75 percent)It’s not easy for an actor to establish a memorable screen persona when surrounded by acting heavyweights in the midst of a fantasy world while wearing a funny costume. But as Mr. Tumnus, a faun who acts as the welcome wagon for the Pevensie children in Narnia, McAvoy still managed to create an indelible impression — again playing a morally-conflicted character who ultimately does the right thing. “Mr. Tumnus is simply one of the most jaw-dropping cinematic creatures invented yet, a stunning mix of filmmaking wizardry and McAvoy’s soulful and physical thesping,” wrote Laura Clifford of Reeling.Atonement (2007, 83 percent)Though he’d turned in some outstanding performances before, it was Atonement that provided McAvoy with his first big break. In a Golden Globe-nominated performance, McAvoy plays Robbie, the decent, hard-working son of a housekeeper on a posh estate with dreams of becoming a doctor. He’s carried a torch for Cecilia (Keira Knightly), the eldest daughter of the upper-class Tallis clan. After tip-toeing around each other for years, the pair finally acknowledge a mutual attraction — but their nascent romance is thwarted when Cecelia’s younger sister (perhaps intentionally) misinterprets the nature of a late-night meeting — and lands Robbie in the slammer. The rest of Atonement deals with the ramifications of that night, and it’s a devastating portrait of star-crossed love. “Most people will recognize Knightley, but it’s McAvoy who will have you talking after the credits roll,” wrote Willie Waffle of WaffleMovies.com.The Last King of Scotland (2006, 87 percent)It’s no insult to McAvoy to say he doesn’t give the best performance in The Last King of Scotland. He’s merely excellent, while Forest Whittaker, playing Ugandan strongman Idi Amin, is borderline possessed. But McAvoy’s role is just as important; playing Garrigan, Amin’s (fictional) personal doctor, he helps the audience understand the magnetic pull of evil, especially when it’s veiled (initially, at least) in magnanimity. Garrigan begins his journey to Uganda as a naïve liberal, gets in Amin’s good graces after a chance meeting, rationalizes the leader’s methods even as evidence mounts of genocide, and ultimately finds himself in over his head. It’s a tricky balancing act, but McAvoy pulls it off. “Whitaker and McAvoy inhabit their roles so fully that the film around them transforms into a major document of 1970s cultural myopia,” wrote Gabriel Shanks of Modern Fabulosity.Starter for 10 (2007, 89 percent)McAvoy excelled as an awkward, trivia-obsessed working-class collegian in this coming-of-age romantic comedy. McAvoy won high praise for his performance as Brian Jackson, an ambitious student who dreams of impressing the lads in his hometown by participating on a televised quiz show — and overcoming his ineptitude with the ladies. Set in the 1980s, Starter for 10 examines the era’s class politics without shorting on laughs, and McAvoy — portraying a flawed but earnest character — helped to elevate it above mere formula. “James McAvoy may be the most likable British newcomer since Ewan McGregor,” wrote Desson Thomson of the Washington Post. “His glistening eyes can seduce audiences with their ability to show conflicting emotions.”And, finally, here’s a musical interlude from the 2005 made-for-TV movie ShakespeaRe-Told:","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"kids, Ellie, CBS, shows, 2018, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"wanteds-james-mcavoy-his-bestreviewed-films"},{"id":"47613414734382","title":"Toronto Wrapup: Senh, Jen And Tim’s Raves And Rants From The Festival","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Toronto Wrapup: Senh, Jen And Tim's Raves And Rants From The Festivalby RT Staff | September 25, 2006 |  CommentsWe saw some great movies, some of them big (\"Babel\") and some tiny (\"The Patterns Trilogy\"). We saw some interesting failures (\"The Banquet\") and some outright bombs (\"All The King’s Men\"). We caught glimpses of big stars (Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Reese Witherspoon, and Sean Penn, among others) and important directors (Brian De Palma, Paul Verhoeven, Darren Aronofsky, and John Waters). (Check the photo gallery for more.)It’s been eight days since we returned from the Toronto International Film Festival, but the films we saw are still fresh in our minds. North America’s biggest film fest definitely lived up to its reputation, and we thought we’d cap our coverage with the movies that kept us talking.Here are the movies that struck a chord with us, both positively and negatively. (Click on the highlighted quotes for full reviews.)Senh’s Top Five:1. \"Still Life\" – Set around the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges Dam in China, this is the most beautiful film I’ve seen this year. It’s also realistically acted and filmed and charmingly edited.2. \"Exiled\" – Johnny To‘s film about a group of hitmen is well written, hip, cool, and just plain fun.3. \"Election\" – Thrills with efficient plotting and pacing. One of the better Triad films in recent years from Hong Kong. It’s also directed by Johnny To. I’m a fan now.4. \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" – I’ve never seen a more gory film starring a kid. The character designs are very unique.5. \"The Fall\" – Tarsem‘s (\"The Cell\") film has narrative problems, but it probably has the most realistic and best acting by a little girl (Catinca Untaru) ever.Senh’s Least Favorite:1. \"Dong\" – This is a companion piece to Jia Zhang-Ke‘s \"Still Life,\" but it’s probably the most boring and pointless documentary I’ve ever seen.2. \"Election 2\" – What the original would have been if everything went wrong. I’m still a fan of Johnny To, but let’s hope he doesn’t make \"Exiled 2.\"3. \"The Fountain\" – Don’t listen to Tim.Jen’s Top 5 From Toronto (overall somewhat disappointing):1. \"Deliver Us From Evil:\" Gripping, emotional and devastating; a documentary on clergy abuse, with intimate access to victims and the offender himself.2. \"The Patterns Trilogy:\" It’s visually rich, impeccably cute, and wholly mesmerizing. Jamie Travis’ stop motion-musical duet-pop meditation on obsessive love is surreal and stylish and wonderful.3. \"Catch A Fire:\" Derek Luke is amazing, Tim Robbins is a little less psycho than he was in \"War of the Worlds\"…overall a great anti-Apartheid, anti-government paranoia story.4. \"The Dog Problem:\" Scott Caan’s second directorial effort is a comic gem about social estrangement and loneliness and pets.5. \"This Filthy World:\" Any John Waters fan must see this feature-length stand-up style show, if not for his hilarious anectodes, then for his insights into sex, politics, and filmmaking.Screened elsewhere, but enjoyed more than the above: \"Volver,\" \"Borat,\" \"Shortbus,\" \"Paris, Je T’Aime\"Biggest Disappointments:\"Bobby\" — A monumental divide between my hopes and the (admittedly unfinished) product, excepting the last 10 minutes. But you can’t fix too many thinly drawn characters and virtually no attempt at period detail in post.\"For Your Consideration\" — Considering the cast and their past films, this should have/could have been so much better. The Fred Willard–Jane Lynch infotainment send-up is by far the best part, most everything else is composed of easy insider jokes.Best Toronto Film Festival Party — The \"Shortbus\" Queer Lounge 11pm-4am live music extravaganza!! Burlesque dancers? Great. Awesome bands like Kids on TV and The Hidden Cameras? Great. JCM singing \"Hedwig\" songs? Priceless.Tim’s Top Five:1. \"Babel:\" A work of remarkable craft, a masterpiece of sensorial and emotional intensity.2. \"Pan’s Labyrinth:\" This awe-inspiring mix of fantasy, horror and drama achieves something rare: it’s equally resonant visually and emotionally.3. \"Rescue Dawn:\" A thrilling movie, an old-fashioned tale of survival that may be the closest Werner Herzog has come to fashioning his obsession with the struggle between man and nature into a mainstream film.4. \"Little Children:\" An adult film in the best sense; it creates three-dimensional characters, sets them loose to do what they will, and trusts that we will understand.5. \"The Page Turner:\" A remarkable tale of shattered dreams and revenge, this French thriller in a minor key is tense and absorbing all the way through.Screened elsewhere, and still awesome: \"Borat,\" \"Red Road,\" \"Lights in the Dusk,\" \"American Hardcore\"Biggest Disappointment: \"All The King’s Men:\" It’s is handsomely mounted. It features a stellar cast. And it’s a misfire from the opening frames.A movie that I really wanted to like but just couldn’t: \"Bobby\"Movies I liked better than my colleagues: \"The Fountain,\" \"For Your Consideration\"Best Avant Garde/Black Comedy/Romance/Musical/Short: \"The Patterns Trilogy\"Movies I saw in the hotel room: \"Executive Decision,\" \"My Voyage to Italy,\" \"Out of Sight,\" \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\"We’d like to extend greetings to some of the folks with whom we partied, conversed, and screened films: James Berardinelli, Erik Childress, James Rocchi, Kim Voynar, Scott Weinberg, and Paul Zimmerman.

Brown / Getty Images)&nbsp;Wes Craven, the influential horror director behind such genre classics as A Nightmare on Elm Street&nbsp;and Scream, died Sunday, Aug. 30 after a battle with brain cancer. He was 76.Craven’s films are among&nbsp;horror cinema’s most indelible and iconic. Freddy Krueger, whose blade-fingered reign of terror began in Craven’s 1984 classic A Nightmare on Elm Street, is arguably the definitive big-screen boogeyman of the 1980s, and his Scream films showed that Craven could juggle self-referential laughs with bone chilling scares.Born in Cleveland in 1939, Craven worked as a professor at several colleges before getting a job as a sound engineer at a post-production company in New York City (he also worked on adult productions using a pseudonym). Craven’s first film was a&nbsp;major success; the low-budget proto-slasher movie The Last House on the Left was a brutal tale of murder and revenge that sparked controversy and threats of censorship as well as admiration for its uncommon intelligence (its story borrowed heavily from Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring). Craven went on to direct The Hills Have Eyes (1977), about a family of cannibals, and Swamp Thing (1982), based on the DC comics character, before hitting the jackpot with A Nightmare on Elm Street (featuring Johnny Depp in his big-screen debut).In addition to his work in horror films, Craven also directed the 1999 drama Music of the Heart starring Meryl Streep as a violin teacher; and the Hitchcockian thriller Red Eye, starring Rachel McAdams as an airplane passenger trying to outwit a terrorist played by Cillian Murphy. Craven’s last directorial credit was Scream 4, though he was an executive producer on the 2015 Scream TV series. He is survived by his wife, Iya Labunka, and two children from a previous marriage.Craven shared his Five Favorite Films with RT in 2009.

In celebration of Thelma and Louise‘s latest milestone, we’ve compiled a list of audience-tested and critic-approved road trip movies that’ll keep you going for hours.The Blues Brothers (1980)  73%The Journey:&nbsp;A mission from God, of course — and a pretty righteous one at that: Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd) and his recently paroled brother, “Joliet” Jake (John Belushi) set out to reassemble one of the mightiest blues bands ever to get their mojo working, all in the name of raising $5,000 to save the orphanage where they were raised.The Roadblocks:&nbsp;Unfortunately, the brothers embark on their journey with a suspended license, and they aren’t about to slow down for a little inconvenience like the police (or mall pedestrians). Meanwhile, one of Jake’s spurned girlfriends (a bazooka-toting Carrie Fisher) is hot on their tail, and has no intention of letting the Blues Brothers reunite — or, for that matter, letting Jake live. Confined to the highways and byways of Illinois, The Blues Brothers&nbsp;doesn’t cover as much ground as most road movies, but it’s a high-speed trip — and it culminates in one of the most righteous car crashes ever filmed.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Constantly hilarious, with a comic supporting cast to die for.” — Jeffrey M. Anderson, San Francisco ExaminerWatch TrailerBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)  91%The Journey:&nbsp;A Kazakh celebrity (Sacha Baron Cohen) travels to the United States to make a documentary for the folks back home; soon after arriving, he becomes captivated by the sight of Pamela Anderson and heads across the country to make her his wife. Sexytime! Highfives!The Roadblocks:&nbsp;Borat is essentially his own roadblock — if he isn’t shocking and/or offending middle Americans with his witless comments about women and minorities, he’s picking an epic, distressingly naked fight with his best friend and producer (Ken Davitian). It will not surprise you to learn that things don’t go according to plan.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Although I knew it was dishonest, cynical, and the ultimate in cheap-shot humor, I laughed more at Borat&nbsp;than at any other film this year. So I guess the joke is on me.” — Peter Keough, Boston PhoenixWatch TrailerEasy Rider (1969)  83%The Journey:&nbsp;Flush with the proceeds after selling a bunch of cocaine to their connection (Phil Spector), freewheeling Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) head east from Los Angeles on their motorcycles, hoping to make it to New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras.The Roadblocks:&nbsp;It’s the establishment, man. Okay, so they might be biking across the country with drug money stuffed in a tube, but Wyatt and Billy aren’t bad guys. Problem is, their scruffy appearance and relaxed attitude toward local customs have a way of attracting untoward attention from The Man.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“This is a glorious widescreen vision of a hot and bothered America, at once beautiful and lost.” — Ian Nathan, EmpireWatch TrailerGrandma (2015)  91%The Journey:&nbsp;A teenager (Julia Garner) and her grandmother (Lily Tomlin) hit the road together, the former seeking money to pay for an abortion and the latter grieving the recent death of her longterm partner.The Roadblocks: They’re both broke and the girl needs $850, for starters — and then there’s the complicated tangle of personal relationships that forces its way into their path at seemingly every turn, initiating&nbsp;a series of uncomfortable reckonings along the way.Notes from the Road: “Grandma is a small film, but one with huge things to say about the meaning of family and the value of living on one’s own terms.” — Calvin Wilson, St. Louis Post-DispatchWatch TrailerIt Happened One Night (1934)  99%The Journey: If you’ve ever watched a romantic comedy where the main characters start off hating each other, only to slowly realize that they’re falling in love, you’ve seen the far-reaching effects of the hugely influential It Happened One Night, in which Frank Capra brings his lightest touch to the story of an impetuous heiress (Claudette Colbert) whose botched wedding sends her on the road with a down-on-his-luck reporter (Clark Gable).The Roadblocks:&nbsp;Screenwriter Robert Riskin pulled out all the stops for Colbert and Gable’s journey, including a series of screwball misunderstandings, the most famous hitchhiking scene in movie history, and an added dash of last-minute wedding excitement in the final act. If its ingredients all seem overly familiar now, it’s because they worked so brilliantly here.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“It Happened One Night &nbsp;is a true classic in every sense of the word, one that withstands the test of time and indeed defies it completely.” — Scott Nash, Three Movie BuffsWatch TrailerLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)  91%The Journey:&nbsp;They’re as hilariously dysfunctional as any family in an American indie film, but say this much for the Hoovers of Albuquerque: When young Olive (Abigail Breslin) finds out she’s a late qualifier for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in Los Angeles, parents Sheryl (Toni Collette) and Richard (Greg Kinnear) pack the whole gang in their aging VW Microbus and head west together.The Roadblocks:&nbsp;The Hoovers are on a tight 48-hour timetable, for starters; making matters more difficult is their lack of funds, as well as the gloomy presence of Sheryl’s brother (Steve Carell), who recently tried to commit suicide, and Richard’s father (Alan Arkin), whose heroin habit just got him kicked out of a retirement home. And then there’s the matter of that ancient yellow Microbus…Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“This inspirational, hilariously sad dysfunctional-family-road-trip dramedy offers absolutely everything — except pretension.” — Brian Marder, Hollywood.comWatch TrailerMidnight Run (1988)  94%The Journey: They were far from the first mismatched couple to find adventure on the road, but bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) and Mafia-crossing accountant Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) are among the most entertaining to watch. Promised $100,000 and given a strict deadline to get there, Walsh has to get Mardukas from New York to Los Angeles so he can be returned to police custody — but the mobster Mardukas swindled (Dennis Farina) has other ideas.The Roadblocks:&nbsp;Once Mardukas loudly feigns fear of flying and gets them kicked off their flight to L.A., he and Walsh are forced to embark on a hellish cross-country journey that finds them dodging interference from the mob, a competing bounty hunter (John Ashton), and their own loathing for one another. A sequel is reportedly in the works; here’s hoping the decades in between haven’t softened their mutual disdain/begrudging respect.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“When it comes to odd-couple action comedies, this is pretty much the epitome of how to do it.” — Luke Y. Thompson, New TimesWatch TrailerThe Motorcycle Diaries (2004)  83%The Journey: Feckless young Ernesto Guevara (Gael García Bernal) and his skirt-chasing buddy Alberto (Rodrigo de la Serna) set out across South America by motorcycle, seeking to experience the open road (and, in Alberto’s case, its women) before starting work at a leper colony in Peru.The Roadblocks:&nbsp;As pretty much everyone who watched it already knew, Ernesto grew up to be the revolutionary Che Guevara — and The Motorcycle Diaries&nbsp;dramatizes his political awakening on the trip, sparked by firsthand experience with systemic corruption and a poverty-stricken populace.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“You get so caught up in the beauty of the images, and lost in the weathered faces found along the way, you quite forget that you’re traveling with Che Guevara — which is, of course, exactly what the original experience would be.” — Moira MacDonald, Seattle TimesWatch TrailerThe Muppet Movie (1979)  88%The Journey: After being discovered by an agent (Dom DeLuise) while singing “The Rainbow Connection” in his Florida swamp, Kermit the Frog decides to head for Hollywood — and along the way, he meets all the old-school Muppets we know and love.The Roadblocks: Unfortunately, Kermit also attracts the attention of Doc Hopper (Charles Durning) and his mealy-mouthed sidekick Max (Austin Pendleton), whose frog legs restaurant franchise needs a new spokesman — and who doesn’t take kindly to being spurned by a banjo-playing frog.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Still one of many great reasons to be a movie buff.” — Rory L. Aronsky, Film ThreatWatch TrailerNational Lampoon's Vacation (1983)  93%The Journey: Just like in real life, any time a fictional character announces “we’re going to spend some time as a family” to his or her wife and kids, you know trouble lurks just around the corner, and National Lampoon’s Vacation is a perfect example. Desperate to take an old-fashioned family vacation, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) plans a trip from Chicago to L.A., where they can enjoy Walley World, a.k.a. “America’s Favorite Family Fun Park.”The Roadblocks: Things go wrong early and often, from the eight-headlighted lemon Clark buys from an unscrupulous car salesman (Eugene Levy) to an ill-advised pit stop at the depressing Kansas homestead of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid) and his off-putting clan. It doesn’t help that beneath Clark’s family values exterior lurks the heart of a drooling lech; his panting pursuit of an unnamed beauty (Christie Brinkley) causes almost as many problems as his refusal to ask for directions.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Constantly hilarious, with a comic supporting cast to die for.” — Jeffrey M. Anderson, San Francisco ExaminerWatch TrailerPee-wee's Big Adventure (1985)  87%The Journey: After refusing to sell his beloved bike to his neighbor Francis (Mark Holton), Pee-Wee (Paul Reubens) discovers that it’s been mysteriously stolen — and sets off on a long, perilous journey after receiving a tip that it’s being held in the basement of the Alamo.The Roadblocks: Well, for starters, the Alamo doesn’t have a basement. And then there’s the biker gang, and the fire at a pet store, and the former child star in possession of the bicycle… what doesn’t&nbsp;stand between poor Pee-Wee and his bike?Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“It’s a true original — a comedy maverick that looks and feels like no other movie I know.” — David Steritt, Christian Science MonitorWatch TrailerRain Man (1988)  89%The Journey: A mildly sleazy huckster (Tom Cruise) is shocked to discover, after his father’s death, that he has an older brother (Dustin Hoffman) who inherited almost everything — and who’s autistic. Seeing an opportunity, he heads back to L.A. with his long-lost sibling in an attempt to gain custody.The Roadblocks: Cruise’s efforts to get back to Los Angeles by plane are thwarted by his brother’s phobia, forcing the two to travel by car (and make regular stops for viewings of The People’s Court). Naturally, the slow journey in close quarters brings the two closer together — and brings up long-buried family secrets.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“A fascinating, often very moving, frequently funny film.” — Jay Boyar, Orlando SentinelWatch TrailerSideways (2004)  97%The Journey: Seeking a respite from his bleak existence — and a way to reconnect with his longtime friend — divorced middle-school English teacher Miles (Paul Giamatti) plans a weeklong excursion through the Santa Barbara wine country with soon-to-be-married Jack (Thomas Haden Church). Miles means for them to play golf and indulge in their shared love of wine, but as in all road trip movies, things don’t exactly turn out the way they’re supposed to.The Roadblocks: Sideways is full of messy detours and unfortunate events, including a broken nose for Jack, a car crash, and a howling early-morning pursuit by a naked giant (memorably played by Lost’s M.C. Gainey) — but they can all be traced back to one thing: Jack’s fear of commitment and unquenchable thirst for sexual conquest.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“From its first minutes, maybe even from the credits, you know you are seeing something very special.” –Terry Lawson, Detroit Free PressWatch TrailerThelma &amp; Louise (1991)  85%The Journey: Looking for a little break from their workaday existences, best pals Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) get in Louise’s ’66 convertible T-bird and hit the open road for what’s supposed to be a simple two-day vacation.The Roadblocks: Men, mostly. After Louise fatally intervenes in an attempted rape on Thelma, the duo turn fugitive — and their journey is further complicated when a run-in with a hunky young thief (Brad Pitt) leaves them caught for cash and stuck in an increasingly desperate spot.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Their adventures, while tinged with the fatalism that attends any crime spree, have the thrilling, life-affirming energy for which the best road movies are remembered.” — Janet Maslin, New York TimesWatch TrailerY Tu Mama Tambien (2001)  92%The Journey: A pair of friends (Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna) share a coming-of-age adventure in late 1990s Mexico with a cousin’s estranged wife (Maribel Verdú) after their girlfriends leave town.The Roadblocks: To begin with, the idyllic secluded beach they’ve promised their female companion doesn’t exist — which actually isn’t as big a problem as the hornet’s nest of secrets and repressed desires that’s knocked over after they all start fooling around. It’s the end of an era for Mexican politics, and for our protagonist’s relationships.Notes from the Road:&nbsp;“Easily one of the sexiest and funniest films about class struggle ever made.” –Manohla Dargis, L.A.

This week’s Leatherheads does just that; a 1920s period piece about the early days of football, the sports comedy — produced by, directed by, and starring Clooney himself — also strives to recall the golden age of the feisty, fast-talking screwball comedy.Clooney’s debt to the likes of Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks is both apparent and considerable, as he acknowledged recently at a press day in Los Angeles. What he jokingly admits to as “stealing” is quite obviously homage, as the central romance in Leatherheads — actually, a love triangle between Clooney’s huckster footballer, Renee Zellweger‘s sassy reporter, and John Krasinski‘s star athlete — often gives way to lively Tommy gun patter resembling classics like His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby.Read on for more with George Clooney on being on both sides of the camera in Leatherheads, the limitations of the screwball comedy in modern movies, paying homage to the classics, and completing his trifecta of idiots in the next Coen brothers film.Leatherheads pays tribute to the classic screwball comedy in a big way. Were you going for a Hawks-Sturges kind of tempo?George Clooney: I stole from Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges in a big way. I stole a scene. Wait, homage. I homaged the s— out of Howard Hawkes and Preston Sturges and early George Stevens. There’s a film called The More the Merrier that we were trying to rip off a lot.How does George Clooney the director work with George Clooney the actor?GC: Of the three films I directed, the other two (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and Good Night, and Good Luck) I had parts in but I wasn’t the lead. It’s tricky, because there is an enormous amount of narcissism that comes into play. You’re breaking the trust between two actors, particularly if you’re in the lead. If you and I are doing a scene together, I’m not supposed to be judging you as an actor — now, a lot of actors do, and they’ll tell you what to do, but in general you’re not supposed to break the trust; the director is. As an actor, it’s easy, because I know specifically, precisely what I need in the scene, so I cut out one step. But it’s embarrassing when…you’re sitting across from Renee [Zellweger] and she’s doing a tremendous job in a scene, and you can feel the camera is in too close, too soon, and you just go, “OK, cut. Let’s try that again.” It’s a weird, awkward thing but you just acknowledge it off the bat and get over it.Is the sort of rapid-fire dialogue and timing in Leatherheads unnatural for a modern actor?GC: We called it front-foot acting. The tendency, probably since Montgomery Clift came on the scene, is to internalize. That’s great, and it has made for some of the most amazing work ever, but what gets lost in that is that ability to…almost answer just as if you couldn’t have heard the question. It has to be that quick. The difference is, you can’t do it exactly like Rosalind Russell. She was brilliant, but if you took that performance and put that into a modern film…it would just be like an impersonation. So with someone like John, or someone like Renee — they’re actors who don’t feel contemporary, which is important. There are a lot of actors who just feel like it’s 2008 no matter what you do.We had the same problem with Good Night, and Good Luck. You had to have actors that didn’t fill everything with, “You know,” and both [Krasinsky and Zellweger] are very crisp, clean actors. We’d rehearse the scene as if we’d heard it all. And I’d go, “Ok now, faster, faster, faster,” to the point where it’s too fast then we’d slow it down. You have to understand that it’s a rollercoaster and it’ll go really quick and slow down. That finds itself when you rehearse it a few times on the set.The Coen brothers did something similar with The Hudsucker Proxy. Did you talk to them about that?GC: No, but I certainly watched Hudsucker Proxy…because, you know, I’ve stolen — homaged – the hell out of those guys over the years. And certainly there were things on this film that I was using that were from other films they’ve done. But Hudsucker I loved; I know people love to smash that film, but I really love that movie. But you have to be careful that it doesn’t leak into an impersonation of any kind.Why make Leatherheads right after your Oscar-nominated role in Michael Clayton?GC: Right after Good Night, and Good Luck and Syriana, everything that was coming to me was an issue film. They were happy to let me direct, but they were going to be the Richard Clark book — “We’re gonna do the big Valerie Plame story” — whatever it was, it was going to be something political. And I had a great fear of being the “issues” director. Because the issues change. And I have a much bigger interest in being a director. So I thought, “I want to do something that’s completely away from this,” and I like screwing with different genres. This is a world I knew a little bit of. So I spent a summer stealing — homaging — from Philadelphia Story, those films. The thing I came up with, it’s horrible, really, was the whole John Kerry-swiftboat thing; the idea that he’s holding a secret. Not that I thought that John Kerry wasn’t [a war hero]! It’s just that I thought, well what if he wasn’t really a war hero, and if there was an innocent way to do it where you didn’t make him a bad guy?Renee’s character seems to be a throwback to the old heroines of screwball comedies, like Rosalind Russell and Katherine Hepburn…GC: In the original draft of the film, John’s character and Lexie were boyfriend and girlfriend in college, and they came out together. She wasn’t active, she had nothing to do. And, I was now too old to be stealing the college girl [laughs]. So it felt as if it needed to be changed and she needed to have something to do. Really, it was more about…there weren’t women sportswriters in 1925; they’re fighting to do it now, even. So it felt like that was a great ballsy thing to be. But it wasn’t a comment on the press, I was just having fun.What kind of idiot are you playing in the next Coen Brothers film?GC: Well, first of all, I’m playing this character, Harry Pfarrer in Burn After Reading. I’ve now leaped heads and shoulders over the other idiots I’ve played; this is my trilogy of idiots with the Coen brothers. That one’s gonna be fun. I had to go and do an extra shot yesterday, I grew a beard back for half a day’s work, and they showed me little bits of it and I was like, “Turn it off, I don’t want to see it!” It’s so…big. The only thing that makes me feel good is that Brad [Pitt] is an even bigger idiot than I am in it, so that makes me feel safe.Leatherheads is in theaters this week and currently has a Tomatometer of 45 percent.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Comic-Con, TV, Showtime, festival, TruTV, Central, CW","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"george-clooney-on-combining-football-and-screwball-in-leatherheads"},{"id":"47613420072497","title":"George A.

Romero on Diary of the Dead: The RT InterviewThe zombie master on bringing his franchise into the age of information.by Fred Topel | February 15, 2008 |  CommentsGeorge Romero has found a way to reinvent his zombie movies for every age. The original Night of the Living Dead was a simple story of survivors holed up in a house. Dawn of the Dead gave them a bigger space, an entire mall. In Day of the Dead, scientists began studying and trying to train the undead. In Land of the Dead, the zombie society began to overpower the humans.Now Romero has gone back to the beginning. Diary of the Dead stars a cast of unknowns as film students shooting footage the night of the first outbreak. Their chronicle paints a portrait of how different factions of our culture handle a disaster of supernatural proportions.Despite his graying beard and pony tail, Romero still knows how to do zombies in the modern world. He’s still quite the showman too. His answers to each question have a beginning, middle and end, classic story structure, and he peppers in casual profanity to “keep it real.” Most importantly, he puts on his spooky voice for key words like “blogosphere” and “production value.”You used to do one of these films every decade. How did you end up doing two within two years?George A. Romero: I loved the idea that I could wait for something to happen out in the world and then talk about it. It seemed to need to be years apart in order for the culture to change a little bit, for it to look a little different and all that. But, when we were shooting Land, I suddenly was taken with the idea that God, this is so big and I don’t know where to go. I don’t know if I want to follow that line. There were those four films that were sort of going in a certain direction. I said, “Where do you go next? Beyond Thunderdome?” I didn’t want to do that.At the same time, before we even shot Land of the Dead, I had this idea that I wanted to do something about the blogosphere, about this new media. I thought I’ve got to do this quick. I also wanted to leave. After Land, I said, “Outta here, I want to go back to my roots. I want to do something small and see if I have the chops or the stamina to do it.” I had this idea and I had it actually sketched out in a rough draft of the script. The moment we finished Land, I sort of refined the script a little bit. I was going to run away, literally run away. I wanted to do it at a film school where I taught a couple of classes way under the radar for a couple hundred grand. Do it with students. The guys at Artfire saw the script and said, “No, no, let’s go theatrical with it. How little can you do it for?” Peter and I sat down and did the lowest budget that we could conceive. In order to do it union and legitimately, all of a sudden it’s not 200 anymore, it’s two million because of all of that. So we came in under four and the guys at Artfire said okay, and they gave me the controls, so I said sure. That’s where it came from. I also felt that I needed to do it quickly because somebody was sure going to do something about it soon. God damn, who knew that Brian [De Palma] was shooting Redacted and Cloverfield was happening? We didn’t know. We thought we were going to be the first guys. Didn’t work out that way.Is it good to know that Cloverfield made it cool to do the first person perspective, handheld camera sort of document style?GR: I don’t know. I can’t think of it that way. Is it good to know? I don’t know if it’s good or not. I don’t know. I think there’s a collective subconscious and I think that that’s where these films are coming from. All the world’s a camera now and it seems like it’s a reasonable way to do things. Maybe reality TV has turned into reality movies. I don’t know. It seems an obvious way to go now, even though I thought when we first started to work on this and I first did the script, I thought it was a clever way to go, never seeing that there’s probably going to be a lot of people thinking the same way. It happens so often. There is a collective subconscious out there. So I’m happy with my film. I haven’t seen Cloverfield. I know what it’s about of course but I almost don’t care. I’m happy with what we did.George A. Romero’s Diary of the DeadThe big difference is that the characters in your film are filmmakers, so it’s a filmmaker’s aesthetic. The point of Cloverfield was it was untrained people doing the best they could.GR: Well, there is [a filmmaker’s aesthetic] and we were sort of aware of that. We left the film alone. We said, “We’ll shoot the principal action and then we can finish it later. Then we can throw anything in there, because these kids are going to finish this film and do a presentation, the best presentation that they can.” So we said we can do the same thing and we did. We left all the narration, all the newscaster voices, all that shit came later in post. That was the great thing about having control over it because we could just sit around and bulls**t and try things on for size, until we finally came up with what we thought was a good, appropriate set of tracks for it. It was great to just have the freedom and not have somebody breathing over your shoulder.How did you get Jason’s reflection in the monitors?GR: He had to shoot it. Obviously he had to shoot it himself, but it was like a Madden football play. The DP was shooting it up to a point and right before Joshua Close went in front of the mirror, sort of handed off the camera and Joshua took it and shot that shot.How did you find the cast of unknowns?GR: Auditions. Completely auditions. One of them I knew from Stratford, a Shakespeare company in Ontario. One of them was actually in a film that we had done. Shawn Roberts is in Land of the Dead in a very small role, the first guy that dies in Land. I just loved him, he was great to work with and we said, “Let’s go with Shawn.” We talked about giving him the same name but then we thought, “Well, maybe that’s too much of a connection.” He’s there. Other than that, it was all auditions. Lots of auditions.Now that you’ve done these quickly, can we expect another one quickly? Will we have to wait 20 years?GR: It beats the s**t out of me. 20 years, I won’t be around, so you don’t have to worry about that. Maybe I’ll come back. No, man, I don’t know. There’s a hell of a lot of talk about a sequel and shooting quickly, maybe this coming summer even. You just never know. Maybe that’ll be a reality. If it happens, it’ll be the first time I’ve ever done a direct sequel: take the same characters, take the same situation and move it on from there, move it to the next square. There’s a lot more that I’d like to say about this emerging media. We’ll see.Do you think they might run into the mall or the science lab?GR: No, I don’t think so. No. It’s simultaneous, so they could, but that’s not the way I would want to go with it. The biggest thing that we didn’t touch on was the idea that somebody, anybody, any lunatic could throw up a blog and all of a sudden he’s got 50 people following him. We didn’t really touch on that so much and that’s a direction that I’d like to go with, the idea of people developing tribes just by preaching to the converted. People that tune into Rush Limbaugh know what he’s going to say and already agree. That’s what happens I think with these columnists.It’s interesting, the blogs and videos they find in Diary are actually helpful. People who have fought zombies share the information about how to destroy their brains.GR: Not so much the blogs. They get that information from police radio broadcasts. That’s really where that info comes from. Mainstream media is sort of denying it, and then when it comes down to the blogs, that’s what I mean. We haven’t gone into that because they’re the ones who are sending it out without a lot of information. There’s also something there. All they know is what happened to them and yet they’re trying to put out this film and the main character, Jason, is so obsessed with doing it that he loses sight of reality, loses sight of his own survival and winds up perishing because of that. I don’t think they get a lot of accurate information, certainly not off the net.George A. Romero’s Diary of the DeadWas the scene where electrocuting the zombie doesn’t work an answer to the Return of the Living Dead spinoff franchise, that claimed electricity would kill them for good?GR: No. Not at all. It was an idea that came to me in the shower. Wouldn’t that be cool if she tries this and it oughta’ fry her but it doesn’t, so she comes back.You start to explore how other cultures are responding to this. We see video from Japan and they even go through Amish country. What other cultures would you like to explore in this scenario?GR: I don’t know but it’s a good idea. I really haven’t thought much about that. We were just trying to show that it’s worldwide. That’s all.Since each film takes a different approach, what are the must-have elements in one of your zombie movies?GR: Zombies! No, in fact, I could do away with the zombies. I don’t give a s**t. The stories have nothing to do with the zombies. The zombies might be a hurricane. They might be any disaster that comes along, but zombies are my ticket to ride in a certain way.But all the films have scenes where they barricade, where they gather supplies, where they start in-fighting.GR: That recurs because it’s human argument, right? It’s people not knowing exactly what to do and just getting caught up in arguing about ridiculous stuff instead of trying to really directly address the problem. I don’t think it’s so much that. The zombies are the ticket to ride. These are zombie movies so you have to have zombies. You have to figure out a cool way to get rid of the zombies, to kill them off, lose the brain somehow. That’s really the only element. The rest of it is they’re stories. They’re stories about people.George A. Romero’s Diary of the DeadDoes Diary even focus more on the human story and less on the zombie element than the other films?GR: I don’t know that it necessarily does. Probably certainly not less than Night, but the story’s more obvious and the zombie sequences, particularly the gore sequences, go by very quickly because they’re shot subjectively by these people that are sort of standing back a little bit. Whereas the tendency when you’re doing it objectively is to go in for close up and do product shots on the gore. That just tends to stretch it out. I think pound for pound, it’s equal at least to, maybe not all of the films. Maybe Dawn and Day went a little further but it’s just that it goes by so quickly I think, because we’re just looking at it from over here. We’re not going in and studying it and taking five minutes to kill that zombie off.How do you come up with new ways to dispose of the brain?GR: You take a shower. I don’t know, man, it just comes to you.You don’t sing. You think of zombie kills.GR: I do. Of course I do. I’m already just faced with the idea of possibly having to do another sequel, and knowing that someday I probably will do another zombie movie, already the first thing you start to do is figure out new ways to dispose of these guys. It’s tough to come up with stuff.It’s always been interesting to me that the first film was Night of the LIVING Dead, but then it was always â€¦of the Dead. Aren’t they still living dead?GR: Yes, they are. It’s not my fault. Don’t ask me. I don’t make up the titles. The funny thing is, my partner at the time when I made Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead didn’t want to get involved with any sort of litigation, so he shortened it to “of the dead.” Now anybody that wants to hire me to make a movie, it has to be “of the dead,” Something of the Dead.You said you didn’t know where to go with the Land of the Dead thread, but Land suggested there might be uncontaminated areas he was heading off to. Wouldn’t that be a place to explore?GR: That’s actually the way I’m sort of going. You want to just get somewhere where there’s at least less turmoil, someplace a little less civilized where at least if there is a conflict, it’s going to be smaller and maybe more controlled. But yeah, that’s obviously the way I was going and that’s what I was doing with Land because there was a hell of a lot of talk while we were shooting Land that we’ll do a sequel to this right away too. It’s the obvious thing to do. If I was one of those guys, I’d say, “Let’s go to the Yukon, man.”Would you eventually revisit that timeline?GR: I don’t think so. I don’t know where to go with it. I don’t know what to do with the zombies. I don’t want to do Beyond the Planet of the Apes. I don’t want a zombie society. I don’t want to go that far. I’ve had ideas in that direction but it’s not really what I want to do. I’m now happy that I’ve started over and I have a whole other thing that I can probably milk until I die and I never have to get to that point. I never have to end it because I don’t know exactly how to end it.Could they maybe intersect at some point?GR: Maybe, they could, and I’ve thought about that too but I doubt it. I think I just want to have this new line now and I’ll stick with that and not worry about what happens at the end. It’s so hard to end. What happens? Either the zombies take over or the humans win. I don’t like either of those and I don’t like some kind of d’etant. The end of Land is that sort of “let ’em be.” So I came close enough I guess to that idea of live and let live.Would you ever explain the cause of this phenomenon, or always leave it a mystery?GR: I hope not. I don’t care what the cause is. I’ve forever been trying to live down, in Night of the Living Dead, we shot actually three explanations. We wound up having to cut six minutes out of the film in order for the distributor to want to distribute it. We cut out a radio thing and a TV thing because we thought it’s just boring, we’re sitting in the house, same old thing. We left in the one that we shot in Washington, D.C. because we thought, “Production value, man. We actually went to D.C. and shot it with the capitol in the background.” So we left that in. Next thing you know, even every TV Guide blurb said, “A returning Venus probe causes the dead to come back to life.” Starting with the second film, I went with that sort of voodoo explanation, “When there’s no more room in hellâ€¦” I don’t care. I don’t give a f**k why it happened. That’s part of the whole thing to me is that there’s this change. The world has changed. Somebody has changed some kind of a rule and it’s different. The stories are about how people respond to it, don’t respond, respond incorrectly, stupidly, whatever. That’s really all that matters to me.George A. Romero’s Diary of the DeadWhat zombie films from other filmmakers do you enjoy?GR: I love Shaun. Love it. I like a movie called Fido. Great, Billy Connolly, great. I just thought it was gas.Have you seen Flight of the Living Dead?GR: I haven’t, no. I haven’t seen it.Those are all still recent. Are there any classic zombie movies besides yours?GR: Oh, classic? Different zombies, man. That’s the Caribbean boys. Classic films, I don’t know. Carnival of Souls. Is that a zombie movie? I don’t know if it is.How about the Italian ones?GR: I love a couple of Fulci things. I just had a gas watching them. It’s not what I would do but I loved watching them. They were fun. And the oldies, man, I Walk With a Zombie, White Zombie and that stuff. Different zombies. They’re not the neighborhood zombies.Which of your non-zombie films would you love for fans to rediscover?GR: My two favorite films of mine are sort of semi-vampire; it’s not a vampire, it’s called Martin. And a film I made called Knightriders which is probably my most personal or autobiographical film in a way. So those two.George A. Romero’s Diary of the Dead is out in limited release today.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"kong, Winners, America, FirstLook, Annual, Pet, marvel, Awards, Unbreakable, Watching, YouTube","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"george-a-romero-on-diary-of-the-dead-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47613450452544","title":"“Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong” About… Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith","content":"RT Podcastvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong\" About...

All rights reserved/Courtesy Everett Collection)When Star Wars: Episode III –&nbsp;Revenge of the Sith arrived in theaters in 2005, it did so on a wave of mixed expectations. On the one hand, fans were frothing to finally witness Vader’s full turn to the Dark Side, something they had been fantasizing about – in some cases –&nbsp;for decades. It had to be awesome, right? On the other hand, those same fans had seen the two previous films in the saga and, well, learned that sometimes it was helpful to hope for the best –&nbsp;but expect a poorly acted CGI-stuffed snooze-fest instead.Listen Now: Spotify | Apple Podcasts | Stitcher | TuneIn | Google Podcasts | Radio Public | Deezer | iHeart | Art19According to the critics, though, George Lucas delivered, and their praise has pushed the movie’s Tomatometer score to a Certified Fresh 80%, making it not just the best-reviewed film in the Prequel Trilogy, but among the best-reviewed Star Wars movies ever.So,&nbsp;Revenge of the Sith has the high ground –&nbsp;but does it deserve it?That’s what we’re asking in the latest episode of our podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong, the final in a series of three special episodes in which hosts Jacqueline Coley and Mark Ellis revisited the Star Wars Prequels to ask –&nbsp;two decades and a divisive set of sequels later –&nbsp;do Episodes I-III actually hold up?

Ryan Sommers | November 7, 2007 |  CommentsLast month, Sony Pictures invited Rotten Tomatoes down toLos Angeles for a little taste of Cox. Walk Hard: The Dewey CoxStory, starringJohn C. Reillyas a musician that goes through every affliction known to threaten artists,looks to complete a 2007 triple-hitter (along with Knocked Up and Superbad) forproducer JuddApatow. Read on for our press conference recap and impressions of theDecember comedy.We arrived at the Walk Hard event to find areception room filled with the props that populated Walk Hard: guitars,teen magazines, and some the albums that spanned the career of the great DeweyCox: It’s A Dewey Cox Teenager Party, Hey Neat!, Sir Ringe theMarshmallow Elephant, Strawberry Foxglove!, These Are My Issues,and Rox Out Cox Out. It’s a miniature sample from a movie whose only goalis to be as comprehensively irreverent as possible.First to be introduced was co-writer/director Jake Kasdanand co-writer/producer Apatow, with Reilly joining later. The two showed fourclips from the film. The first clip was the opening sequence: Dewey as a childplaying with his younger bother in the countryside. The absurdly idyllicplaytime is broken when his brother meets his untimely demise during anill-advised machete fight. Dewey takes the devastation of this tragedy and honesit into a musical talent. Sound familiar?Fast forward several years for the next clip. After aperformance opening for Elvis (JackWhite), Dewey finds his way backstage where there a crowd encourages him topartake in smoking marijuana. After Dewey’s drummer (TimMeadows) character goes into a lengthy spiel artfully naming all of thereasons why one shouldn’t smoke marijuana, Dewey is convinced to try it.Throughout the movie, Dewey will apparently not only do every drug known tomankind, but he will subsequently kick the habit of every drug.Jenna Fischerwas featured in the next clip as Darlene, singing onstage with Dewey. Thescene’s comedy derives from the sexual innuendo between the two as they singtheir hit, \"Let’s Duet\" (properly pronounced \"Let’s Do It\"). Let yourimagination run free. I guarantee what you come up with is nowhere near as funnyas what they managed, and it’s a perfect representation of Walk Hard‘sbrand of comedy.The final clip showed Dewey’s exploration of Hinduism withthe Beatles. The Fab Four (JackBlack, JustinLong, Paul Rudd,and JasonSchwartzman) bicker amongst themselves whilst trying to open Dewey up toacid. With a little help from his friend, he takes the drug, and goes down awildly bad acid trip.After the clips, the floor opened up to Kasdan, Apatow, andReilly. The highlight: while Walk Hard‘s MPAA rating is still unknown,Apatow warned the crowd about something that might not past muster within PG-13territory — an extended scene involving a penis, which Apatow jokingly revealedwas his. Kasdan and Apatow acknowledged that TheRutles and Spinal Tapwere both major influences, but made it a point that the movie is less a spoofon musical artists than a satire on the biopic genre.Throughout the conference, the trio pushed the quality ofthe music. Thirty-five songs (thirty of them originals) were recorded during thefour months leading up to the Walk Hard shoot. Reilly noted that thestyle of the movie and his character was discovered during these sessions.\"[They] acted as a sort of tone-all blueprint for when westarted the movie with all the music we already had,\" Reilly said.&nbsp;Despite Walk Hard‘s farcical attitude, Kasdanand company were aware the music had to work as legitimately compelling stuff.They assembled a small collective of musical talents to pen the thirty originalsongs, including New Wave popsterMarshallCrenshaw (who wrote the title track),MichaelAndrews (he orchestrated popular \"Mad World\" cover for the DonnieDarko soundtrack), cult singer/songwriters Dan Bern and Charlie Wadhams,and Mike Viola (who voiced the catchy title ditty fromTom Hanks‘s That Thing You Do!).After unleashing his inner musician in Chicago, Reillyjumped at the chance to get back in a recording studio. The other actors took asimilarly enthusiastic approach: not only did everyone in Dewey’s backup bandhave to learn how to play the songs, in some cases, they had to first learntheir instruments. Tim Meadows, for example, didn’t know how to play the drumsbefore shooting and had to quickly pick them up.Reilly enthuses that \"[the] music alone stands as a greatachievement,\" which will be anthologized in the cheekily-titled soundtrack, The Box of Cox. It’s going to be an extended double-disc collection, andwill hit stores sometime beforeWalk Hard: The Dewey CoxStory‘s scheduled release on December 21.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Star, Amazon, Max, Television, dogs","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-checks-out-walk-hard-the-dewey-cox-story"},{"id":"47613442014779","title":"\"Penguins,\" \"Murderball,\" and 13 Other Docs Vie for Oscar Eligibility","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Penguins,\" \"Murderball,\" and 13 Other Docs Vie for Oscar Eligibilityby Scott Weinberg | November 16, 2005 |  CommentsVariety‘s Award Central brings news on the 15 documentary films that have been \"shortlisted\" for Academy Award consideration.

We did, however, decide to collect a sampling list, making room for some of the best, worst, and most puzzlingly misguided examples from the genre. Let’s get started, shall we?The Amityville Horror (2005)  23%Like many of the movies on this week’s list, the latter-day Amityville Horror was produced by Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes — and like more than a few of them, it suffered in comparison to the original. Which is a shame, because Amityville‘s central story — about a young family moving into a horrifically haunted house — is both devilishly simple and allegedly fact-based, which has helped the franchise retain its aura even through a series of sometimes-silly sequels and spinoffs. Unfortunately, despite a talented cast that included Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, and a young(er) Chloe Grace Moretz, this Horror was mainly scary for the studio execs who had to account for its $64 million domestic gross, which sentenced the franchise to years of direct-to-DVD purgatory.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Blob (1988)  62%Inspired by the way David Cronenberg used modern special effects and less-campy storytelling to amp up the horror in The Fly, Hollywood spent a portion of the late 1980s rushing to the vaults and searching for other long-dormant properties that might benefit from the remake treatment. Hence 1988’s The Blob, in which an alien goo plops down in a small town and starts gorging on its unsuspecting residents. It was just as fantastically cheesy a premise as it had been in 1958, when Steve McQueen starred in the original — but thanks to a solid screenplay from future Shawshank Redemption director/adapter Frank Darabont, as well as a (slightly) more believable Blob, it managed to just about reach the rather low bar set by its predecessor, which is about all one can hope for when making a film about hungry interstellar plasma.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Cat People (1982)  61%The original Cat People, produced on the cheap by Val Lewton in 1942, emphasized suggestion over explicit horror; four decades later, director Paul Schrader used the movie’s central idea — about people whose sexual desires trigger a sometimes-deadly feline transformation — as the basis for a steamy softcore flick that made up for its lack of genuine scares with an abundance of Natassja Kinski and a cool soundtrack featuring David Bowie and Giorgio Moroder. While it may not be the most terrifying movie on this list, it’s probably one of the hardest to turn away from if you happen across it on the cable dial during a bout of late-night viewing.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Crazies (2010)  70%“WHY ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE DYING?” screamed the poster for George A. Romero’s paranoid The Crazies about the side effects of a military accident that resulted in a small American town being poisoned with a biological weapon that turns people into violent lunatics. Sadly, the tagline for Romero’s 1973 effort might as well have been “WHY WON’T MOST THEATERS SHOW THE CRAZIES?,” because the picture died with a whimper at the box office — but a good idea always turns up again in the horror genre, and in 2010, director Breck Eisner repurposed Romero’s original to create a sleek, gleefully nasty update that managed a surprisingly robust 71 percent on the Tomatometer. Alas, while Eisner’s Crazies at least made it to wide release, they didn’t fare a whole lot better at the box office, managing to slash together ony $54 million worldwide. The result of a military-industrial conspiracy, perhaps?Watch Trailer&nbsp;Dawn of the Dead (2004)  76%Did George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead really need a remake? Perhaps not. But if we were going to get one, it might as well have been one that blended the the visual wizardry of director Zack Snyder with a screenplay from future Guardians of the Galaxy mastermind James Gunn, and that’s just what we got with this 2004 “re-envisioning” of the zombie classic. Using the original’s basic framework as an effective delivery mechanism for a fresh round of gruesome gore and heart-pumping action, the new Dawn proved surprisingly bright for most critics, including Aisle Seat’s Mike McGranaghan, who wrote, “Dawn of the Dead is ultra-violent, excessively bloody, and extremely gory — all in a good way. I left the theater feeling pumped full of adrenaline.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark (2011)  60%It might seem a little odd to base a horror remake on a TV movie from the 1970s, but the original Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark — starring Kim Darby as a housewife whose new home comes with some nasty little tenants lurking in the basement — is a cult classic for aficionados of the genre, so a theatrical version was probably inevitable. Given that the 2011 edition was co-written and produced by Guillermo del Toro, fans had reason to be hopeful that the remade Dark would be even scarier than the first; alas, after being trapped in studio limbo for months due to Miramax’s shuttering, director Troy Nixey’s update on the story — which focused on an eight-year-old (Bailee Madison) and her father’s girlfriend (Katie Holmes) — was greeted with lukewarm indifference by audiences and critics alike. Perhaps some things are just more frightening on the boob tube.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Evil Dead (2013)  63%How in the world do you put together a remake of one of the most beloved horror-comedy cult classics of the last 40 years? If you’re director Fede Alvarez, you film a new version of Evil Dead with production input from creator Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell, a much bigger budget, and a far more serious take on the story of young campers who unwittingly unleash a demon plague while goofing around with the Book of the Dead. The amped-up gore in Alvarez’s Evil Dead certainly wasn’t for everyone, but it arguably made more sense, given the film’s narrative outline — and the resultant uptick in attention to the franchise helped lead to the subsequent TV series Ash vs. Evil Dead.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Fly (1986)  92%The original version of The Fly, released in 1958, was a Vincent Price classic that didn’t really need to be remade, but that didn’t stop producer Stuart Cornfield (working with an uncredited Mel Brooks) from getting the ball rolling on a new version. After several years in development, plenty of studio struggle, and some turnover at the screenwriter and director positions, Cornfield had his movie: David Cronenberg’s gorier, more suspenseful take on The Fly, which went back to George Langelaan’s 1957 short story and emerged with one of the more delightfully suspenseful horror/sci-fi movies of the 1980s. Unfortunately, Cronenberg’s Fly — starring Jeff Goldblum as the ill-fated scientist whose experiments leave his DNA accidentally intertwined with the titular pest, and Geena Davis as the woman who loves him — was too successful to prevent a sequel: 1989’s rather uninspired The Fly II. Rumors of another remake (and a quasi-sequel penned by Cronenberg) have popped up over the years, but it’s all been for naught. So far, anyway.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Friday the 13th (2009)  26%Featuring a “star” hidden behind a hockey mask and a brilliantly low-budget conceit that needed nothing more than anonymous young actors capable of screaming in various states of undress, the Friday the 13th series was one of the most reliably profitable horror franchises of the 1980s — and ripe for the reboot treatment in the 21st century. Platinum Dunes did the honors in 2009, reimagining the murderous Jason Voorhees as more of a lethal maniac and less of a lumbering dolt, with cooler special effects and plenty of T&amp;A; once again, the formula worked, producing plenty of pure profit for the studio and signaling that perhaps a new slew of sequels was on the horizon. Alas, Jason slumbered for the next several years, although he’s currently set to terrorize a fresh batch of Crystal Lake campers on May 13, 2016.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Fright Night (2011)  72%If director Craig Gillespie had polled horror fans in 2011 and asked them if he really needed to remake 1985’s Fright Night, the answer probably would have been a resounding “no”; after all, the original was not only a surprise hit, it had matured into a solid favorite among scary movie lovers, and little seemed to be gained by updating the story of a horror-loving teen (William Ragsdale) who makes the awful discovery that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is secretly a vampire. While it may not have been strictly necessary, the new Fright Night — starring Anton Yelchin as young Charley Brewster and Colin Farrell as the undead addition to the neighborhood — proved surprisingly potent, with Farrell’s charismatic performance matching Gillespie’s confident lens. While box office returns were fairly weak, the remake brought the Fright Night franchise back to life, with a direct-to-video sequel arriving in 2013.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Halloween (2007)  27%By the 2000s, producer Moustapha Akkad’s once-proud Halloween franchise had fallen on hard times, with deathless serial killer Michael Myers resurfacing in a series of low-budget sequels that bore little resemblance to John Carpenter’s classic 1978 original. All that was left was to start over from the beginning — and that’s what director Rob Zombie did with 2007’s Halloween, which retold Myers’ gruesome origin story and returned him to poor, unfortunate Haddonfield, Illinois for a gorier version of his first grown-up killing spree. While Zombie had previously flirted with critical respectability with 2005’s The Devil’s Rejects, his Halloween mustered a mere 25 percent on the Tomatometer — not as high as 1982’s much-maligned Halloween III: Season of the Witch, but still better than the sixth installment in the series, 1995’s The Curse of Michael Myers, and good enough to greenlight a sequel (dubbed H2) in 2009. A planned 3D follow-up eventually fell off the schedule, but the next sequel, reportedly titled Halloween Returns, is currently in development.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)  92%If Gus Van Sant’s Psycho serves as an argument against remakes, then the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers offers an equally persuasive rebuttal. While the 1956 original is one of the most highly regarded sci-fi/horror movies of its era, director Philip Kaufman’s update matched it with a thrillingly gritty, ensemble-driven look at what might happen if alien spores landed on Earth and started sprouting eerily emotionless replicas of our friends and loved ones. Sharpening up the special effects without overly relying on them, the new-look Body Snatchers featured solid performances from a stellar cast that included Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum — and although it definitely made its share of money at the box office in 1978, if anything it’s even more highly regarded today. Here’s hoping Kaufman’s Snatchers continues to stand as the most recent version of the movie for many more years to come.Watch Trailer&nbsp;My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009)  61%If you’re looking for fright value, bad guys don’t come much more elegantly brutal than a bloodthirsty lunatic with a pickaxe, which might be why the low-budget 1981 Canadian slasher flick My Bloody Valentine — about a miner who survives a collapse by dining on his fellow crew members, goes crazy before being rescued, and wages murderous revenge — proved even more potent when its 3D remake surfaced in 2009. And although it may not have generated blockbuster numbers at the box office, it fared surprisingly well with critics; it can’t be long before we’re treated to yet another Bloody Valentine.Watch Trailer&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010)  15%Given how much money the Nightmare on Elm Street movies made for New Line during the 1980s and early 1990s, remakes and/or reboots were probably always a matter of course; problem was, the series was just as memorable for Robert Englund’s outstanding performance in the role of series killer Freddy Krueger as it was for its scores of inventive on-screen murders. Faced with the unsolvable problem of replacing Englund, the folks at Platinum Dunes hired Jackie Earle Haley to take over the part for their 2010 reboot — and although Haley is certainly a talented actor, and more than capable of exuding a sinister aura, he isn’t as physically imposing as Englund. Add that to a story that hit many of the same beats as the original, and the end result was a movie that, while certainly profitable, failed to land with as much impact as it had the first (eight) time(s) around.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (Nosferatu the Vampyre) (1979)  95%Werner Herzog’s filmography offers more than a few case studies in audaciousness, not the least of which is 1979’s Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht. Occasionally referred to by its less cool English title, Nosferatu the Vampyre, this remake of F.W. Murnau’s classic 1922 silent film finds Klaus Kinski stepping into the bloodsucking role so memorably inhabited by Max Schreck, with all parties involved acquitting themselves admirably. No less a cinematic authority than Roger Ebert agreed, writing that “To say of someone that they were born to play a vampire is a strange compliment, but if you will compare the two versions of Nosferatu you might agree with me that only Kinski could have equaled or rivaled Max Schreck’s performance.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Psycho (1998)  39%Of all the remakes on our list, Gus Van Sant’s Psycho embraces the concept more eagerly than most, delivering a somewhat bafflingly precise update on the 1960 Hitchcock classic with a shot-for-shot replication that, while assembled and acted by talented creative types, exhibited no real creativity of its own. But while Van Sant’s Psycho wound up bottoming out at a rather miserable 37 percent on the Tomatometer, he dodged a few bullets in at least one sense — unlike a lot of remakes of classic films, his attempt to re-Hitchcock Hitchcock inspired more critical bafflement than anger or derision. Ultimately, the 1998 Psycho serves as a perfectly persuasive (albeit most likely unintentional) argument against remakes in general.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)  37%A man, a plan, a chainsaw. Oh, and a facemask made out of human skin. It may not sound like much, but from the moment 1974’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre terrified its first audiences, it’s served as the basis for one of the horror genre’s more surprisingly durable franchises — in spite of the mostly miserable track record suffered by its spate of periodic prequels, sequels, and spinoffs. The horror remake enthusiasts at Platinum Dunes tried to take things back to the beginning (again) with their 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and although most critics claimed time had dulled Leatherface’s blade, audiences still turned out to the tune of more than $100 million in box office grosses. Yet another prequel followed in 2006,&nbsp; followed by a 3D sequel to the original in 2013, and the origin story Leatherface is currently scheduled for 2016. Confused? Don’t think too hard; in the end, it all goes back to those first simple ingredients.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Wicker Man (2006)  15%There are worse (and far, far better) horror remakes than Neil LaBute’s update on The Wicker Man, but we absolutely had to include it here, because no other film provides its particular brand of sheer, cackling lunacy. While it’s misguided on just about every level, the 2006 Wicker is chiefly noteworthy thanks to Nicolas Cage’s presence as police detective Edward Malus, whose journey to a secluded island in search of his abducted daughter ends very badly for all concerned — including any audience members not prepared for the unforgettable sight of Cage punching a woman in the face while wearing a bear suit, or the equally memorable sound of Cage screaming “Oh God! Not the bees!” Avoid it if you’re looking for truly scary viewing, but it still needs to be seen in order to be believed.Watch TrailerEn español: Read this article in Spanish at Tomatazos.com.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Turner, crime, Mary, FirstLook, Ice, Adventures, cats, Pacific, RT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"18-memorable-horror-remakes"},{"id":"47613465912904","title":"The 21 Most Memorable Movie Lines of the Last 21 Years","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 21 Most Memorable Movie Lines of the Last 21 YearsFetch may never have caught on, but these incredible movie lines did.by RT Staff | March 8, 2019 |  CommentsIn 2019, Rotten Tomatoes turns 21, and to mark the occasion we’re&nbsp;celebrating with a series of features that look back at the brightest moments on screen of the past two decades – and one year – and the things that have us excited for the future.&nbsp;They’re the lines you’ve worn on T-shirts and Photoshopped into memes. They’re the lines you’re maybe a little sick of, but can’t stop loving.&nbsp;Before they were famous, though – before they were parodied on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;and printed onto ironic mugs – they were words on a page and then words in a movie you were hearing for the first time, and they stuck. Maybe they were hilarious (poor Gretchen, “fetch” never happened), or maybe they were chilling (“I see dead people”). Maybe they were delivered just&nbsp;right (“Why… so… serious?”). Here, we’re looking back at the 21 most memorable lines from the movies since August 1998, the year that Rotten Tomatoes came into this world. If we missed a favorite of yours, let us know in the comments. The Sixth Sense (1999)Neither M. Night Shyamalan nor Haley Joel Osment knew that the intensely whispered “I see dead people” would become the center of Disney’s marketing push for The Sixth Sense – and the subject of parodies for decades. Talking recently to Rotten Tomatoes, Osment said he was just thankful Twitter hadn’t been invented at the time the film came out, when he was 11. Notting Hill (1999)When you pair America’s sweetheart with Britain’s reigning rom-com king, you have to bring your A-game, and writer Richard Curtis did just that for Notting Hill. With this heartbreaking line, he manages to somehow get us rooting for one of the world’s richest and most glamorous movie stars, and screaming with frustration at the regular “fairly level-headed bloke” whose love she’s asking for. American Pie (1999)Paul and Chris Weitz’s surprisingly sweet teen sex comedy gave us one of the late ’90s most indelible movie images (the pie!), and chased that up with one of the decade’s most memorable movie lines. And one that’s got a sex-positive ring: “What?” asks Alyson Hannigan’s Michelle flatly after revealing where she sometimes puts her flute. “You don’t think I know how to get myself off?” Fight Club (1999)From Chuck Pahalniuk’s pen to Brad Pitt’s mouth and into the minds of college students all over the country… Galaxy Quest (1999)It was only appropriate that this cult spoof of Star Trek and its legion of Trekkie fans would have its own live-long-and-prosper–style catchphrase. It is delivered with Shatnerian levels of cheese and determination by Tim Allen, playing Jason Nesmith, who’s playing Commander Quincy Peter Taggart. Office Space (1999)We could run through an entire stack of Post-Its writing down our favorite lines from Mike Judge’s cult favorite, but this chipper, grating, morning greeting wins out – an encapsulation of the deep, smiley rage suppression that gives Office Space its kick. Erin Brockovich (2000)When Ed (Albert Finney) asks Julia Roberts’ Erin Brockovich, “What makes you think you can just walk in there and find what we need?”, she fires off this line and a look that says, Seriously, you need to ask? The resourceful real-life Erin Brockovich has said she did use the line with the real-life Ed – probably more than once. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)Some consider it blasphemy that Peter Jackson added this line as a climax to Gandalf’s defiant verbal smackdown of the fiery Balrog; in the original Tolkien book, Gandalf only says “you cannot pass” (which he also says, though less iconically, as he starts his speech in the film). Jackson’s addition became one of the best “f—k yeah!” moments in the original movie trilogy and went on to spawn thousands of memes. Training Day (2001)Denzel Washington won an Oscar for playing corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo in Atonine Fuqua’s Training Day, and it might have been his delivery this line – puffed-up and chest-pounding as he realizes power is slipping away – that got any hesitant Academy voters across the line. The Incredibles (2004)It’s unfair to say that Edna Mode (voiced by Incredibles writer-director Brad Bird) steals Pixar’s superhero smash – there are too many awesome elements and characters for one to dominate – but she comes very, very close. She’s full of one-liners and shady zingers, but it’s her golden rule (“No capes!”), and the various anecdotes that led to it (R.I.P. Thunderhead), that people remember most fondly. Mean Girls (2004)Mean Girls’ Regina George (Rachel McAdams) is the queen bee of her group, and this was perhaps her sharpest stinger. Irony is, while “fetch” didn’t happen, this line caught on in a big way. 300 (2007)On paper, there’s nothing particularly special about this line – it’s kinda just a statement of fact (it is Sparta, after all –&nbsp;not Athens or Thermopylae, and definitely not madness, nor blasphemy). But coming out of Peak Gerard Butler’s mouth as a kind of gravelly scream for the ages, and accompanied by that iconic slow-mo kick, it’s gone down in film history. Watching this moment, we are all Sparta (even those of us without six packs). Black Panther (2018)This greeting of the Wakandan people, and the accompanying gesture, infiltrated popular culture following the release of mega-hit Black Panther in February 2018. (The film’s stars were asked to do the gesture so frequently on red carpets and during interviews, memes began to circulate showing a bored-looking Chadwick Boseman –&nbsp;who plays the titular hero –&nbsp;giving a perfunctory version of the cross-armed symbol.) Interestingly, the most memorable use of the phrase might come in Infinity War, and not Black Panther, when T’Challa shouts the phrase as he leads his Wakandans into battle against Thanos’s forces. Brokeback Mountain (2005)When Jake Gyllenhaal said these words to Heath Ledger while shooting Brokeback Mountain, he probably had no idea what a life they would go on to have: first as a wrenching moment between their characters, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar; then as a source of parody and a meme (mostly among those too immature to cope with the film); finally, and most recently, as a shorthand for the film itself, and what it meant to the LGBTQ community to see a gay couple portrayed authentically and without judgment in a major release. The Hunger Games (2012)There are plenty of action-packed, effects-enhanced, and completely thrilling moments throughout the Hunger Games franchise, but few are as simultaneously inspiring and terrifying as the quiet scene in which Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) steps forward to take her young sister’s place in the Games. The line is lifted directly from the same scene in first book of Susanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy. Snakes on a Plane (2006)You may not recall the insane hype around Snakes on a Plane in the lead up to its release – an irony-fueled internet buzz-wave that stemmed, essentially, from the absurdity of its premise-capturing title. You may not even remember much of the film itself. But there is no way you forgot this line, spoken by profanity wizard Samuel L. Jackson in one of those legendary B-movie inspiration speeches he’s so masterful at delivering. (Fun fact: The&nbsp;line has aired on FX as the more-safe-for-work “monkey-flying snakes on this Monday-to-Friday plane.”) Taken (2009)It was in 2009, while in his mid 50s, that Liam Neeson discovered a very particular set of skills – gravelly line-readings, a death-stare for the ages, and a capacity for rapid-fire action – that would launch a whole new chapter of his career: Liam Neeson, Action Star! And while the past decade has been littered with Neeson action programmers (right up to 2019’s&nbsp;Cold Pursuit), none have matched&nbsp;Taken&nbsp;for its intensity, impact, and the power of that oft-quoted bedroom scene. The Dark Knight (2008)Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s second Batman film might well&nbsp;have given us the best&nbsp;comic-book movie villain ever. The character’s most famous line – “Why so serious?” – became iconic even before the film’s release, centering one of the most effective marketing campaigns of recent decades. There Will Be Blood (2007)Speaking of Oscar winners… This rather surprising analogy for oil drainage, spoken by Daniel Day-Lewis as Daniel Plainview, was inspired by real-life words&nbsp;to congress from then Secretary of the Interior, Albert Fall,&nbsp;spoken during a 1920s Congressional investigation. Or so Paul Thomas Anderson has said – the original quote has not been found. Zoolander (2001)The best stupid movie of the past 21 years? Maybe. (Step Brothers would give it a definite run for its money.) But&nbsp;Zoolander&nbsp;is probably the most quotable, thanks to brilliant bites of silliness like this. The Fast and the Furious (2001)The&nbsp;Furious&nbsp;franchise has evolved greatly over the years, shifting gears (sorry!) from smallish-scale&nbsp;Point Break-alike to&nbsp;globe-trotting stunt spectacular, each entry one-upping the other in terms of scale and ludicrousness. What keeps the whole thing grounded, and provides the through-line from 2001 right through to this year’s&nbsp;Hobbs and Shaw? Family, of course, but also the dedication to awesome cheese perfectly encapsulated by this line/mantra/religion.

His byline can most recently be found at the New York Times and at his podcast, The Last Thing I Saw, where his guests include Justin Chang, Soraya Nadia MacDonald, and Richard Brody, among many others. In this&nbsp;month’s edition of&nbsp;Know Your Critic, Rapold shares not just his classic and childhood favorites,&nbsp;but charts the trajectory of his career as a writer and editor, including 15 years at Film Comment where he worked his way up to editor-in-chief.“My personal journey kind of started with Reverse Shot, The L Magazine, and then also The New York Sun,” he told Rotten Tomatoes in an interview. “Two of these publications don’t even exist anymore.”“The 2000s were something of a bloodbath when it comes to the transition, and there were, of course, many new places for people to write – and that’s a good thing,” Rapold said.His work&nbsp;has included new media, print, editorial hybrids (such as Film Comment, where he edited online, magazine, and podcast coverage), and programming. He favors seeing as many films as possible over rescreening old favorites ­– hence why his most-seen movie is Gremlins, his childhood favorite: “Because what kid doesn’t like total mayhem?”Do you have a favorite classic film?Duck Soup, just because it’s such a bonkers movie. Because there’s a point where really nutty comedy just is also poetry, and you realize, maybe they’re also just brilliant because nothing makes sense. … You can always just watch that, and it’ll take your brain apart for you.You&nbsp;have worked in both programming and editorial, especially with Film Comment’s connection to the Film Society at Lincoln Center. Do you have a favorite guest that you’ve invited, or perhaps a favorite screening that you’ve hosted?It’s tremendously rewarding when you’re working at Film Comment – you are living the dream of working right above a movie theater. You have your theory and practice right there. At the end of the day or during the day, you’d be able to go down and watch something. And it’s even more special when it’s something where you’re presenting a filmmaker.I had a series called “Overdue” that was itinerant with another critic, Nick Pinkerton. We did a screening of, I think, Midnight Run and Clifford, where we had Charles Grodin come, and that was a lot of fun. We were kind of showing a combination of movies that weren’t necessarily canonical or “great art,” but were great movies, and also just lesser-known directors.Can you talk about some of the most exciting or maybe surprising people whose work you’ve edited while working at Film Comment?Andrew Sarris, Mr. American Cinema himself. We had this feature called “Critics Choice,” and that was kind of an aggregator of star ratings from a wide variety of movies. Ordinarily, people would email what their ratings were. In Andrew’s case, it was my job to call him up and transcribe his star ratings. … He’d be like, “Wendy and Lucy…&nbsp;four stars.” And then it’d be like, “Mr. and Mrs. Smith…&nbsp;one star.”What are you proudest&nbsp;of in your career so far?I don’t know if it’s any one particular thing. I mean, I’ve certainly been honored to do a number of things. Edit Film Comment, write for The Times and The Village Voice.I’m proud of being able to do different types of work at these different publications, because I always admire when publications have particular voices. And that doesn’t mean a house style, I don’t think, but it just means being able to speak to readers, and maybe different groups of readers as well in different ways.I’m also very proud of establishing Film Comment‘s website as a regular editorial voice. The website used to be an addendum, but I made it daily, expanded the timely coverage, and also established the weekly Film Comment Podcast (appointing Violet [Lucca] as host), plus instituting its many columns (“Feeling Seen,” “Present Tense,” “Classified” on genre) and bringing in new voices.(Photo by Elevated Films)What’s a Rotten thing you love?It was the last movie directed by Dee Rees, The Last Thing He Wanted – which was a world premiere, I think, at Sundance, a Netflix release. … It’s not a movie I love; I can’t say that. It’s a movie that I kind of admired, and I just felt it got completely ravaged, and I just thought it was a little over the top, because I thought there were definitely interesting things in there. …I can’t handle this kind of rating, to be honest, and so I come across examples by happenstance – recently, it was Belly (1998). I really don’t know why anyone looking at the eye-popping images in this movie could dismiss it. Happily co-presented a screening of it in the “Overdue” series about a decade ago.What is the hardest review that you’ve ever written?I don’t want this to sound like a cop-out, but I think every review is a bit of a challenge just in that you want to do the best that you can, and be true to your voice, and also be reading the movie as a movie, and being… I don’t want to say “true to the movie,” because I don’t think it’s an obligation to basically channel what the filmmaker’s intent was – just give a kind of faithful and faithfully nuanced critique of a film. But that doesn’t mean you have to agree with what it’s doing.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?Some people think critics go in with a negative mindset, or even the way that we use the word “critical” to mean “negative.” And I think that is probably in the dictionary, but a critic is not inherently there to tear something apart.This is a little silly to admit, but when I’m watching a new movie, I’m&nbsp;sometimes thinking, “please be good,” or “please stay good,” or “please turn good.” I’m not looking for the movie to be bad so I can go sharpen my knives and just filet it afterwards. Although, the frustrating thing is, the things you get the most attention for – and this is tough feedback – are often the reviews where you’re kind of taking something apart.Before becoming a writer and editor, what did you study in grad school?It was an unholy mix of comparative literature and movies, and ultimately, it just became more of an administrative challenge than anything else. I was very fortunate to have a scholarship stipend, so that kind of freed me up with a little teaching, and just gives you the time to read and watch widely. So it was good for that as well.Teaching is really wonderful just because… one of my favorite things is talking to anyone about what they think about movies, or what they’ve liked recently, not just other critics. And when you’re in a class setting, you have 15 opinions right there. And then you get to just kind of re-experience things as well when you’re moving through your syllabus.On that note, is there something you consider required viewing?I would say required viewing is just a lot of viewing – seeing loads of movies from all eras of film history, and all different directors. Because to pin everything on one or two classics or something like that, I think doesn’t work. … It’s almost like for every new movie you see, you should also just pick something from the ’30s, or the ’40s, or the ’50s.Is there someone in your life who is not a critic whose opinion you admire and you regularly seek regarding movies?What I really enjoy is just the elevator conversation, or the plane conversation. I mean, anyone would say that’s the worst thing you can do: ask the person sitting next to you just as the transatlantic flight is starting, “What did you think about Crash?” Or something.But I actually love it, and I think that really takes you out of your comfort zone in a sense, because what I do for a living is watch and write movies, and not everyone does that, and I love to hear their opinions.(Photo by Warner Bros.)What is the movie that you’ve watched more times than any other?I’ve probably watched Gremlins a lot. I’m sure I watched it a lot, because what kid doesn’t like total mayhem?What is your favorite film from your childhood?I guess it might well be that! This is the funny thing. I hear from friends who are parents&nbsp;– it’s kind of whatever’s there and they’re watching 100 times. So I mean, maybe it is Gremlins.I grew up in the ’80s, so I think the touchstones were just, yeah, blockbusters like that, and that also were immediately convertible into these video rentals that then you’d get again and again.Do you prefer to re-watch something that you’ve already seen perhaps multiple times already to pick up on new elements? Or do you prefer to watch new things, rather than re-watch?I guess I tend towards watching new things, just because there’s so much still out there to see that I haven’t seen. I mean, I love when I can watch something again. That’s usually in connection with writing about it, or doing a podcast about it or something. It’s also just the way it is, because you don’t always get the ability to see something twice if you’re reviewing, so I guess I’m sort of in the habit of only seeing things once.That’s why, although no one will ever believe you, it is pretty draining to watch something, if you’re watching it with your full attention as if you’re never going to be able to see it again, and just absorb all you can about it. It takes a little out of you, just because you’re trying to be fully present.Do you take notes while you watch?It varies. Criticism is a form of journalism, so I do take notes in that respect. You never know whether you’re going to quote something, so it’s better if you jot it down, the dialogue that struck you, unless you have total recall, which… more power to you.(Photo by Frederick Wiseman)What have you been watching while sheltering in place throughout this pandemic?That’s kind of been the premise of the podcast that I’ve been doing, which is just talking about the last things I’ve been watching. And I mean, again, I keep this ridiculous document that doesn’t even load quickly anymore because it’s so long. But I watched a couple of Janicza Bravo shorts that are on Criterion Channel, which were just remarkable.I watched Nathan for You, all of it – that was a needed laugh there. I watched I May Destroy You, which is also incredible, because I was just reading – not just, but earlier this year, I had read – Girl, Woman, Other, and those seemed to be in the same universe.I watched City Hall, which is the new Frederick Wiseman movie. He’s hands down one of my favorite filmmakers. It’s a four-hour movie about the Boston city government, and there are passages in there that are just, you get a lump in your throat about civic government and American history. It’s really remarkable.When you are reviewing something, do you read other peoples’ reviews before watching the thing or writing your own piece about it?I know some people can be a little dogmatic about that. I don’t read other reviews before I write my own generally. I think that’s something I remember learning kind of early on from critics that I admired, just to kind of keep your head clear.An interesting wrinkle in all this is festival reviews. You might write about something on its theatrical release, and you already have reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, however many it might be – 10 to 20 reviews that were filed right at the moment of birth, wherever it was. So that’s tricky.When sitting down to write, do you prefer a shot of espresso or a shot of alcohol?I’m thinking more about the aftermath of the writing. I think that’s when maybe you want to crack open a beer or something. I think beforehand, same kind of deal: I want to keep my head clear, so usually I’m just having some extremely radical chamomile tea or something like that, or water. If I add espresso to the mix, my head will just be buzzing.What is your personal record for the most movies you’ve watched in a day?Oh wow. I might not even remember, because I think there’s a point where you dissociate to a certain extent. I mean, I know I’ve seen five movies in a day at a festival, and also five movies even just for fun going around town to different repertory houses. So I think that’s probably my limit that I remember.Who are three people that you think everyone should follow on Twitter?Michael Koresky / Reverse Shot (@reverse_shot). Two for one: Michael is an essential read among film critics and so is Reverse Shot, the publication he co-edits and whose Twitter account he runs. Original, uncompromising, eloquent, deeply knowledgeable.Soraya Nadia McDonald (@SorayaMcDonald). Brilliance and clarity, on multiple fronts across a dazzling array of arts and culture. I don’t know how she writes beautiful and incisive essays week in and week out while also keeping an up-to-the-minute commentary on the world that’s sharp, engaging, and empowering.Bodega Cats (@Bodegacats_). Sometimes it’s important not to think about movies.Is there someone who’s under the radar as a director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?For me, the easy answer, and it’s not going to win me any awards for, just because of people’s preconceptions, but it would be Frederick Wiseman. He’s made, I want to say, 45 films over the past 50 years, and he could be under the radar for people just because although his movies are shown at Film Forum, and used to show on PBS, it’s not the sort of documentary that’s become most common viewing for people.I just think they’re beautiful, and just full of life, and all about America, and just also about art. A lot of his movies are about art. It feels funny to be recommending it because it’s so out there in the sense that he’s been doing it for 50 years, but I still think that there’s more to discover and learn in there, in his movies.Do you have any advice for critics who are still kind of finding their voice?Voice is a lot of what makes some of our greatest critics who they are. I mean, writing and reading and watching movies would be the kind of combined answer. Some of the greatest writers start off by imitating other writers, and then deviating from that. Sometimes it’s good to read past critics just to see what you can give yourself permission to do in a way.And also just reading non film writers. Melissa Anderson is another great critic that talks about, just keep your eyes open. And just the more you can have coming in, that’ll help you in developing your voice.Nicolas Rapold&nbsp;is a writer and editor based in New York City.

Alex Tse is writing the script of the long-gestating project, which is being produced by Larry Gordon and Lloyd Levin. \"Watchmen\" has a development history almost as epic as the story the comic tells. The project has seen such studios as Fox, Universal and Paramount come and go and has seduced and vexed such filmmakers as Terry Gilliam, Darren Aronofsky, Paul Greengrass and screenwriter David Hayter. Sources say Snyder has impressed Warners with \"300,\" an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel that he directed and co-wrote.

Especially when you’re talking about the \"Harry Potter\" movies.Prior to 2007, Michael Goldenberg‘s three screenwriting credits were \"Bed of Roses\" (1996), \"Contact\" (1997), and \"Peter Pan\" (2003). So imagine how he must have felt stepping into \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" after seeing how well Steven Kloves did with his adaptations of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone\" (2001), \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" (2002), \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" (2004), and \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2005). PLUS it looks to be only a temporary gig; Mr. Kloves is set to return for \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\" (There, I got all the Harry Potter titles into one paragraph. Someone should go write a book called \"Harry Potter and Scott’s Aching Fingers.\")Anyway, one of the better HP fansites scored an exclusive, expansive, and very thorough interview with Mr. Goldenberg, and (of course) they stick almost exclusively to \"Harry Potter 5\" chit-chat. (Seems that Mr. Kloves simply needed a break from the series, and Goldenberg was the scribe who got lucky. Cool for him.) The article covers a variety of material, most notably some erroneous reports that Potter creator JK Rowling was unhappy with the fifth film. The writer also bends over backwards trying to explain why you HAVE to excise some material from a book as huge as \"Phoenix\" — but he’s pretty happy with what he and director David Yates has put together.\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" opens on July 13th. Heck, I don’t even read the books and I wanna see the darn movie already.Source: The Leaky Cauldron","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"joker","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"order-of-the-phoenix-screenwriter-sits-down-for-a-chat"},{"id":"47613490790996","title":"The 8 Best Ways to Turn a Movie into an Amazing TV Series","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 8 Best Ways to Turn a Movie into an Amazing TV SeriesWhether it's a faithful companion series like What We Do in the Shadows, a complete reinterpretation like Fargo, or a corrective do-over like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, here are the best ways to adapt a movie for TV.by Brian Tallerico | May 15, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by TNT)On May 17, Bong Joon-ho’s Snowpiercer will become a TNT television series starring Jennifer Connelly and Daveed Diggs. It’s not the first property to jump from the big screen to the small one (it was technically a French graphic novel first), and it certainly won’t be the last. For decades now, television producers have been going to the movies and asking themselves if they could make what they’re watching work in an episodic format. Who needs writers to come up with ideas when the movies can do it for you?The resulting series have been all over the map critically, from projects that were canceled&nbsp;early to ones that ran for years, nearly obliterating the original film from viewers’ minds. It got us thinking about the variety of approaches that creative voices have taken when they try to sing a cinematic song on TV. The jury is still out on whether or not the futuristic vision of Snowpiercer will translate into a multi-season hit, but here are the eight approaches that have worked in the past with an example from the top tier of the film-to-TV canon for each.Make It Your Own: Fargo(Photo by ©FX)When Noah Hawley entered the world of Joel and Ethan Coen’s 1995 masterpiece, he knew a literal approach wouldn’t work (and not just because it had already been attempted&nbsp;in 2003 with Edie Falco as Marge Gunderson in a failed TV pilot). He decided to use the atmosphere and language of the Coen-verse to tell his own stories, and the result became an award-winning critical darling. The best singers don’t just cover a song, they make it their own, reworking it in a way that redefines it. Fargo wouldn’t exist without the work of the Coen brothers, but no one would argue that it’s a direct interpretation of their creativity either. As much as Bryan Fuller’s Hannibal stands alongside both the Thomas Harris books and films, these shows use their cinematic sources as inspirations instead of a template waiting to be copied.Make It&nbsp;a Prequel: Bates Motel(Photo by Sergei Bachlakov/©A&amp;E)Sometimes the best way to adapt a cinematic property is to go back to the beginning. On paper, a young adult version of Norman Bates in contemporary times sounded like a horrible idea; it could have ended up just another teen drama like Gossip Girl, but with a little more murder. But the creators of Bates Motel deftly balanced nods to the Robert Bloch book and influential Alfred Hitchcock film throughout, culminating in a stellar final season that really tied it all together in unexpectedly moving ways. By going the prequel route, the creators had the freedom to tell a new story, even if it ultimately led to a familiar set of stairs.Make It&nbsp;a Corrective: Buffy the Vampire Slayer(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)It may have a cult following now, but writer Joss Whedon notoriously disliked the way his 1992 film Buffy the Vampire Slayer was altered from his original intention. And so he convinced a fledgling network called The WB to give him a second shot at the character in weekly form, and the rest is TV history. It’s funny to watch the film now and see echoes of it in the series, which is darker, denser and more nuanced in ways that Whedon wasn’t allowed to be on the big screen. It’s a case in which the film probably should have been a TV series from the very beginning.Make It&nbsp;Fun: Ash vs. Evil Dead(Photo by Matt Klitscher/©Starz)Twenty-three years after Army of Darkness, no one expected to return to the world of Ash and the Deadites, but along came Starz’s gloriously gory Ash vs. Evil Dead,&nbsp;which carries in every frame an air of “can you believe we’re doing this?” Much like the Netflix reboot of Wet Hot American Summer, this show recognizes the fact that most people involved never thought they’d get the chance to make it, and so they’re going to have as much fun as possible while they can. And that fun can be infectious. Not everything needs to be “Prestige TV;” sometimes fans of a film just want to rekindle that fun sensibility that made movies like Evil Dead 2 and Wet Hot into cult hits in the first place.Make It&nbsp;Feel New: Westworld(Photo by John P. Johnson/HBO)One wonders how many people trying to decipher the current season of Westworld have any idea it’s even based on a movie. While some adaptations exist to call back to their cinematic fan bases (see previous entry), others barely acknowledge the existence of the original property. The back story of a show like Teen Wolf doesn’t depend on knowing the Michael J. Fox original, and you don’t need to have seen the 1973 Yul Brynner film (or its truly dire 1976 sequel, Futureworld) to be invested in the saga of Dolores Abernathy and the Man in Black. And that’s just the way HBO likes it.Make It&nbsp;Unexpected: The Girlfriend Experience(Photo by Kerry Hayes/©Starz)Sometimes the best shows are developed from films that no one involved ever thought would become a TV show (Snowpiercer might fall into this category). Steven Soderbergh’s drama about a high-priced escort didn’t exactly scream weekly drama, but the Starz adaptation found new stories to tell within this concept. Sometimes TV shows can even build on their source in ways that make them feel more creatively accomplished, such as Netflix’s Dear White People, which unexpectedly turned a good film into a great series. Going the blockbuster-to-show route can often lead to mediocre product, but shows like The Girlfriend Experience prove that there’s no specific “type” of movie that will succeed as a series.Make It&nbsp;the Same: What We Do in the ShadowsRyan FujitaniThe most common creative tenet of film-to-TV adaptations seems to be “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” After all, if people liked it on the big screen, they’re bound to like it on the small screen, right? While this often produces faded carbon copies of creative ideas, it also just works sometimes. The dynamic between Oscar and Felix in The Odd Couple that went from stage to screen to TV didn’t need to change. The movie Fame practically played like a pilot for the show. And the Taika Waititi hit that blended reality TV filmmaking with vampire lore was a perfect fit for the series, now on FX, without much alteration to the formula other than dividing the storytelling into bloody chunks and a change in location from New Zealand to Staten Island.Make It&nbsp;Emotional: Friday Night Lights(Photo by ©NBC)The main thing the best TV adaptations do is provide a recurring emotional connection that usually naturally dissipates after the&nbsp;credits have rolled&nbsp;on a film. Millions of people spent years with the families on shows like Friday Night Lights and Parenthood, two programs that are arguably on the Mt. Rushmore of film-to-TV because they treated the source material as something not just to copy but to emotionally enrich. The format allowed the creators of these shows to go deeper and make these characters a part of viewers’ families for multiple seasons. People may have first checked out FNL because of the movie, but they hung around because of their emotional connection to the show. If only more film-to-TV adaptations were this good.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Awards, movies, Country, Women's, Fox, Ellie, Channel, ABC, TCA, Kimmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-8-best-ways-to-turn-a-movie-into-an-amazing-tv-series"},{"id":"47613494544982","title":"Hurt To Play Costner’s Evil Twin In \"Mr. Brooks\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hurt To Play Costner's Evil Twin In \"Mr. Brooks\"by RT Staff | March 16, 2006 |  CommentsWilliam Hurt, whose role as a crime boss in David Cronenberg‘s \"A History of Violence\" nabbed him an Oscar nomination, joins the cast of MGM’s psychological thriller \"Mr. Brooks\" as the evil alter ego of Kevin Costner‘s character.Bruce A.

Plus, Mark Duplass plays a real creep in the series, but is intimidated by the veteran actor in real life.by Fred Topel | June 15, 2018 |  CommentsBilly Bob Thornton is a master at playing antiheroes. His murderer in Sling Blade, racist executioner in Monster’s Ball, and his foul mouthed womanizing degenerate in Bad Santa all found some form of redemption. Even when he’s a villain who gets his comeuppance like on Fargo season 1, Thornton makes them endearing until the bitter end.Goliath’s Billy McBride may be the perfect role for Thornton, and his most personal.&nbsp;A disgraced trial lawyer who got vindication against his old law firm in the first season, McBride in&nbsp;season 2&nbsp;helps his friend’s (Lou Diamond Phillips) son who’s being framed for murder.(Photo by Amazon)Victory may be harder for McBride than being disgraced. He won $50 million from the case in season&nbsp;1 and doesn’t quite know what to do with himself as season 2 begins.“I think it’s hard for Billy to reconcile this kind of success, just like me in real life,” Thornton told Rotten Tomatoes. “I still don’t know how to act. Being somebody that got successful in this stuff, I’m not far away from the character in a lot of ways. In other words, it’s easy for me to go there every day and put those clothes on, because they’re the same clothes I wear in my regular life.”Even a giant win like this might not last McBride long. He’s being overly generous with his winnings, giving away cars and cash.“I’ve done that too,” Thornton admitted. “I’m a Leo so Leos tend to do that. ‘Oh, everybody get a drink. It’s on me.’ Maybe in a way it’s like yeah, I want the money, but then once he’s got it, it’s just here to spend and [he] doesn’t particularly pay that much attention. Fortunately he’s got a daughter who keeps him in check a little bit.”(Photo by Amazon)McBride bought a fancy beach house for his daughter’s visits, but he still calls the Chez Jay motel home.“He certainly doesn’t want to move into the fancy house he bought,” McBride said. “He feels weird there. He likes the motel. He likes Chez Jay. Why would he change that? That’s his mind.”You’ll still find McBride on the beach drinking out of a bottle, a cigarette in the other hand. Thornton relates to sitting out the media circus too.“At the end of the day I’m a little bit agoraphobic,” Thornton said. “I don’t get out much. You don’t normally see me on the red carpet and Star Tracks in the magazine and all that. I’m not out there too much. I’m kind of uncomfortable around rich people, kind of uncomfortable around social scenes, so it’s easy to play a guy who likes to just walk down to Venice Beach by himself and sit there and have a smoke.”(Photo by Amazon)Thanks to Goliath, Thornton doesn’t have to go out much. He still does a movie in between seasons, but he wouldn’t even have to.“Really, that’s all I have to do every year although I’m predominantly a film actor, so I want to keep doing movies,” Thornton said. “After the first season, I was kinda like yeah, maybe one more and I’m good. After we’ve filmed a second season, it’s like yeah, I’d like to do a couple more of these. I’m now into this guy where I can’t imagine not playing him.”Season 2 finds Billy McBride in uncharted territory with a murder case, not his normal area of practice. In order to get Julio Suarez (Diego Josef) free, McBride will have to do more field work to get some dirt on the corrupt mayoral candidate (Ana de la Reguera) and real estate tycoon Tom Wyatt (Mark Duplass).“This one has less in the courtroom and more out snooping around,” Thornton said. “Billy’s more lawyer-detective in this one. He has to get out there and get involved more this time. It’s not just going out and interviewing a witness at the house this time and then going back to court. He gets up to some shenanigans in this one.”(Photo by Amazon)Tom Wyatt and his cronies are no match for Billy McBride, but they may not know it at first.“I don’t think Tom Wyatt is intimidated by Billy McBride,” Duplass said. “Tom Wyatt is very, very powerful. He hasn’t had any obstacles in his life that he hasn’t been able to overcome. I think there’s a level of sociopathy there that allows him to shape shift and get done what he needs to get done. I don’t think he identifies Billy as somebody who’s going to be a problem for him.”These smug rich guys in suits think they own everyone. They’ve never met someone like Billy McBride, who has a countermove for all of their moves.“Billy’s good at smelling a rat,” Thornton said. “I think that’s one of his main strengths.”(Photo by Amazon)The audience can look forward to seeing Billy McBride make Tom Wyatt and his henchmen sweat.“When you’ve got a person who thinks that they are above the law and that they can do things that will harm people or negatively affect people and there won’t be any consequences, I think you want to see them get taken down,” Duplass said. “That’s part of the joy of watching a show like Goliath. Billy Bob Thornton as a person is a real seeker of truth and honesty. I think that’s very evident in the character of Billy McBride too.”Tom Wyatt and Billy McBride&nbsp;will come face to face in Goliath, and Duplass may have had more butterflies&nbsp;from&nbsp;that encounter than Tom Wyatt does.“Billy Bob Thornton is just as intimidating as Billy McBride,” Duplass said. “He’s got so much emotional power to him. When he walks in the room, you just feel it, but he does a really good job of making everyone feel comfortable. He’s super open and conversational, very easy to be around. Within five minutes we were talking about our kids. He’s still intimidating as sh-t once the cameras start rolling.”For an actor as vulnerable as Thornton has admitted to being, to hear that someone is intimidated by him is shocking.“I look at acting as a very natural thing,” Thornton said. “Once we get into it, Mark and I only had like one or two scenes together and they’re very natural. He doesn’t have to worry about keeping up with me. Nobody does. If you’re in a scene and both of you are being honest, you got it made. He seemed at ease to me. I didn’t think I ever had to put him at ease. He seemed perfectly fine.”(Photo by Amazon)You will see Thornton on the big screen again in the film adaptation of A Million Little Pieces. Thornton plays Leonard in the adaptation of James Frey’s memoir, which drew controversy when it was discovered that Frey invented some of his memoir.“I look at it this way,” Thornton said. “Let’s say it’s not based on reality. It’s still an interesting, amazing book to read so it’s worthy of a movie. Then they took it a step further from the book. A lot of stuff is the same but there’s a lot of stuff they took liberties with. They’re just trying to make a good movie, not something that’s true to a book which wasn’t even true to itself.”Saying goodbye to a beloved character may be the hardest part for Thornton. He got to play Willie Soke one more time in Bad Santa 2, 13 years after the original. He wouldn’t rule out a Bad Santa 3 either, but most of his favorite characters were one and done.“There are characters that I never wanted to stop playing,” Thornton said. “The character in A Simple Plan, Jacob, never wanted to stop. I wished that movie went on for five years. The Man Who Wasn’t There, Sling Blade, Monster’s Ball, Bad Santa, The Alamo, Bandits&nbsp;— all those movies. I just loved playing the characters. I didn’t want any of them to end. All those movies have varying degrees of success with box office or public or critics, but the experience of them was always great.”So Billy McBride is certainly a keeper.“Yes, I’m used to it now,” Thornton said. “I’d like to do it as long as they’ll let me.”Goliath season 2&nbsp;is available now on Amazon Prime.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"PlayStation, Walking, romance, Black, Acorn","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"billy-bob-thornton-passed-some-bad-habits-on-to-goliath-character"},{"id":"47613517972064","title":"Know Your Critic: Leonard Maltin, Film Critic and Historian","content":"Know Your Criticvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Know Your Critic: Leonard Maltin, Film Critic and HistorianMaltin talks favorite films, reflects on his celebrated career, and teases his new film review-centric game, “King of Movies.”by Sophie-Marie Prime | July 23, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, and Newmarket Film Group)“Know Your Critic” is a column in which we interview Tomatometer-approved critics about their screening and reviewing habits, pet peeves, and personal favorites.Before Leonard Maltin became known as the iconic critic and historian that he is, he was a movie-loving teenager, putting together a fanzine called Film Fan Monthly. He wrote for Variety, TV Guide, and other major publications, eventually becoming Entertainment Tonight’s broadcast movie critic – a position he held for 30 years. Starting in 1969, he&nbsp;compiled&nbsp;lists of every year’s must-see movies – Leonard Maltin’s Movie Guide&nbsp;published annually or biannually until 2014. He’s written a dozen books, been the president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and taught at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts.&nbsp;And now he’s a game… really.Maltin’s most devoted fans and fellow cinephiles have put together a game in his honor: “King of Movies.” The objective? To be&nbsp;Leonard Maltin in the most convincing fashion.&nbsp;Players pull a movie title from a deck of cards, along with a genuine Maltin review of the title, then must review the film in Maltin’s signature style, attempting to trick a player&nbsp;into thinking Maltin wrote it himself. It’s basically “pick the real Maltin review,” and will be available to purchase from Mondo.“The idea is to fool the other players that you’ve written an authentic writeup for a movie they’ve never heard of,” Maltin told Rotten Tomatoes in an interview.In his storied and celebrated career, Maltin is most proud of “surviving,” he says – “and that’s not a flippant answer.”Leonard Maltin is a film critic and historian. He currently publishes at leonardmaltin.com.What do you consider required viewing?Charlie Chaplin. No further explanation. To me, so much begins with Charlie Chaplin.Citizen Kane, Singin’ in the Rain, Seven Samurai, La Strada, I could go on and on and on.What is the hardest review that you’ve ever written?The Mel Gibson movie, The Passion of the Christ. Because I went to a screening, and directly from that screening to our studio, and had to write and deliver a review without having more than a half hour to digest the film and organize my thoughts.Is there something that’s Rotten on the Tomatometer, but you’d defend it to the ends of the Earth?I actually wrote about this one in the book, Rotten Movies We Love. It’s called Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla. And by any objective standards, it’s indefensible, but I love it.What are you most proud of in your career so far?I feel very fortunate that I came along when I did – which is to say long before the Internet – when you could still make a name or stake yourself a spot on the landscape through old-fashioned means, self-publishing the fanzine as I did, being generously plugged or promoted by other publications and building a reputation, and then publishing books that were actually distributed widely in stores around the country and not just limited to specialty presses.My first couple of books – I met a lot of people who say that mine was the first movie book they ever bought when they were in their teens, because they only cost a dollar-and-a-half, and they were on sale at the local drug store or Woolworth’s or card and gift shop in the days before the malling of America and rise of the bookstore chains.Timing in life is crucial – and luck. The challenge for anyone starting today is cutting through all the clutter.Can you give us the rundown on your new King of Movies game?Well, there are people who were devotees and remain devotees of my annual movie guide for years, in some cases for decades. One of them is Tim League, the co-founder of Alamo Drafthouse. He and one of his cohorts, Ant Timpson, used to play this game where they would try to devise phony write-ups of movies, because especially when writing about older, more formulaic Hollywood movies, there was identifiable rhythm and style to the writing. So they started to challenge each other and friends of theirs.They’ve now institutionalized this as a game. I played it with them a couple of times, and I’ve done a couple of test runs of the final game. Some people really get it. Some people fall into the rhythm of those write-ups, and they can be very persuasive.What makes a Leonard Maltin review a Leonard Maltin review?Well, none of the better qualities are part of this game. Rapier wit and incisive storytelling in capsule form are not the hallmarks of these reviews. It’s the formula – the formulaic descriptions of films that really come out on top in the game.Is there anyone that you think could “beat” you at your own game?Well, yes, theoretically. But I did it for so long, I have an unfair advantage.(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)What is your favorite classic film?Casablanca.Is there a movie that you’ve watched more than any other?Casablanca.Can you guesstimate how many times you’ve seen it?No, I really can’t. Certainly 20 to 25 times.What do you think is the biggest misconception about critics?We’re lucky to get paid for what we do. And that is also a truism.Yeah, we are lucky. We’re not digging ditches, we’re not doing manual labor, but we get paid to watch bad movies. I found out particularly when I started getting recognized from being on television and people would stop me and say, “You got the best job in the world.” I said, “Well, it’s a great job, but you know, some days it feels like a job.” Then people’s eyes glaze over. When you get paid to watch movies, no one wants to hear complaints, and I get that.What do you think makes a good movie?They say a smart person can hold two opposing thoughts in their mind at the same time. On the one hand, I’m tempted to say originality and freshness, and yet there’s some movies I like a lot, very good movies, that follow a ritual for a genre and wind up being really good.What is your preferred seat in a movie theater?Aisle seat, midway down the aisle.What is your favorite screening snack?Popcorn. No butter.When reviewing, do you go in cold?The only way I go. I actually studiously avoid reading or seeing anything about a movie. I don’t even watch the trailers. The less I know about a movie going in, the better experience I have.Are you pro- or anti- note-taking?Neither. There are times when note-taking is crucial. I don’t write lengthy reviews, so I find as long as I log-in either that night or the next morning when I get home, that does it for me.What is your personal record for most movies watched in a day?Seven. May I add with an asterisk: That was the day I discovered definitively that it’s not the eyes that go first, it’s the tush.What’s your favorite film from your childhood?Oh gosh, so many. No one has ever asked me that.At age seven, my parents took me to see a film called&nbsp;The Golden Age of Comedy, which was a compilation of great moments from silent film comedies with Laurel and Hardy and Charlie Chaplin and others. I even remembered the theater where I saw it in Manhattan, and it literally changed my life.(Photo by Twentieth Century Fox)Who is an actor or director or a screenwriter whose work you always love?Alexander Payne. He is an original – he and his frequent writing partner, Jim Taylor. Their films aren’t like anybody else’s. They deal in social satire, which very few people even approach, because it’s such a difficult genre.Who are some under-the-radar directors or a screenwriters that you think more people should know about?Well, yes. I guess it depends on how you define that radar. Kelly Reichardt, her latest film, First Cow, is the best movie I’ve seen this year. Nicole Holofcener, huge fan; Jeff Nichols, an underappreciated talent; Debra Granik, so many. They’re not exactly newcomers, but they ought to be more celebrated than they are.Is there someone in your life who isn’t a critic, whose opinion you admire?Well, my wife and daughter, who are critics, only they don’t get paid for it. I respect their opinions, both of them.Can you think of a recent movie where you may have disagreed with either of them?Oh gosh. My daughter and her husband weren’t engaged by Spike Lee‘s Da 5 Bloods. My wife and I just thought it was terrific.Who are some up-and-coming critics that you want people to check out?I deal so much with classic and vintage films. I’ve been very impressed with two young-ish writers and essayists on the scene. One is Imogen Sara Smith, the other is Farran Smith Nehme.They’re both freelancers, and they’re employed quite a bit by the Criterion Collection. I’ve seen them both on camera and doing commentary tracks and writing wonderfully eloquent essays for Criterion booklets as well. They’re whip smart, and I’m very impressed with both of them.Do you have advice for critics who are still finding their voice?Keep at it. Experience is the best teacher, and getting feedback is hugely important too.Leonard Maltin&nbsp;is a film critic and historian.

Ten years on, we’re celebrating a remarkable twelve months of movies with new features around some of the year’s best and most important releases.The big science fiction blockbuster of 1999 was going to be Star Wars, Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, but by comparison to The Matrix, which took audiences by surprise on its release exactly ten years ago today, it turned out to be the most eagerly-awaited sci-fi film of 1978. The Matrix was the phenomenon which made George Lucas‘ serial-style adventure seem as quaint as tie-dye loon pants. It did the proper sci-fi job of surfing the zeitgeist exactly in every single aspect: The long leather coats and cool shades (influenced by the look of Chow-Yun Fat in John Woo movies). The pounding techno music which would have given John Williams a headache. The frenzy of paranoia about computers whipped up by the millennium bug (remember that?). The notion that a computer geek could be an outlaw rebel hero. The end-of-century sensation that an apocalypse was coming even if all our Windows 98 platform PCs kept on working. And, of course, the notion that Keanu Reeves was potentially the wisest dude on the planet.The Matrix didn’t come from nowhere, and indeed arrived in the midst of a batch of similar projects it left standing commercially. Like Star Wars in 1977, it was the film of its moment — it even dared to set its artificial city in the late 20th Century as if aware of a sell-by date — and has seeped into subsequent movies which have either blatantly or subtly drawn from aspects of The Matrix — ranging from its action-friendly fashion sense to franchise-building business plan. Join RT as we explore ten movies released in the ten years since The Matrix came out that owe a little something to one of 1999’s most exciting releases.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1097780[/tomatometer]X-Men (2000)Marvel’s main mutants had been stalled in development limbo for decades, handicapped as potential screen icons by their frankly naff, gaudy comic book costumes. From The Matrix, the X-Men movies took a sturdy, black-leather-based look which became the default fashion statement for angsty 2000 superheroes just as red-white-and-blue tights (or, in Wolverine’s case, yellow spandex) had been in earlier eras. The influence might have been two-way — like Star Trek‘s Holodeck and Doctor Who‘s (um) Matrix, the X-Men‘s Danger Room (a virtual reality training ground as seen in X-Men: The Last Stand) was an important precursor of The Matrix‘s Matrix.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1105582[/tomatometer]Memento (2000)Like Keanu Reeves’ Neo, Guy Pearce‘s amnesiac keeps having the rug pulled out from under his reality, and learns not to trust Joe Pantoliano while getting mixed up with Carrie-Anne Moss. It wasn’t only the casting director of Christopher Nolan‘s breakthrough movie who took cues from the Wachowskis. While it uses a tricky, backwards Chinese box structure and a mental aberration rather than a computer-generated reality, Memento is able to tell its complicated story confidently because of the precedent. If audiences understood The Matrix enough to make it a big hit, then they could be trusted to follow and enjoy Memento.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1126021[/tomatometer]Avalon (2002)The Matrix owes much to Japanese anime and s-f cinema in general, and would not have been possible without an audience who were literate in computer games — this live-action picture from anime god Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell) replays the compliment, going The Matrix one better by pulling back from a virtual post-apocalypse world which is the arena of a combat game to the players’ reality, which turns out to be equally pixel-based with no end in sight. It also surrounds its protagonist with enigmatic guru figures who nag her on through her quest — the heirs of Morpheus tend to be a lot more prone to explaining things than the likes of Yoda or Gandalf.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1147405[/tomatometer]Cypher (2002)This smart, underrated paranoia movie from Vincenzo Natali (Cube) even takes its name from one of the characters in The Matrix — the Joe Pantoliano traitor, which hints at its trickiness. Like The Matrix, it’s influenced by author Philip K. Dick as ordinary suburbanite Jeremy Northam takes another identity to infiltrate a rival corportation as a cyber-spy, only to wonder which if either of his personalities is real. With Lucy Liu in the Trinity role and the sexiest helicopters ever, this is as endearing a knockoff as the style pilot fish movies Roger Corman used to get on the market following big hits in earlier decades.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1118792[/tomatometer]Equilibrium (2002)One of the breakthroughs of The Matrix was ‘bullet-time’, a photo-process designed entirely to show off John Woo-style gunplay (and swirling coats). This dystopian vision from Kurt Wimmer, which cops its plot from 1984 or Fahrenheit 451, elevates ‘bullet-time’ into a whole martial art called ‘gun-kata’, as mastered by futuristic killer goon turned rebel Christian Bale in a Neo-look outfit. This is a movie which literally rides on the coattails of The Matrix. The film would be po-faced were it not for the elegant, if ludicrous gun-kata scenes.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1123873[/tomatometer]Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)Though worlds away from The Matrix in subject matter (if equally fond of gravity-defying duels), this franchise copped the Matrix business model (itself influenced by Back to the Future) — an unexpected, runaway success made on a moderate budget within tight restrictions, followed by two much more expensive, self-indulgent and lengthy sequels shot back to back and released six months apart with a ‘to be continued’ at the end of part two. The only thing Pirates missed was getting a bunch of cartoon visionaries to turn out The Anipirates.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1130889[/tomatometer]Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)Like Memento, this could be seen as The Artimatrix — an adoption of the Matrix narrative devices by an indie-type, contemporary-based puzzle movie. Before The Matrix, it would have been difficult to sell a story told from the viewpoint of a character whose subjective perceptions (here, his memories) are being overwritten by external forces during the course of the plot — and expected the audience to follow all the threads. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet may be less cool-looking than Keanu and Carrie-Anne, and their interior worlds may be smaller, but they are in the same business of wiping and rewriting reality.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1142336[/tomatometer]Constantine (2005)Keanu Reeves’ place on the cool-o-meter has never been secure — for every Bill &amp; Ted or Point Break or Speed, there’s a Bram Stoker’s Dracula or Little Buddha or Johnny Mnemonic. The Matrix may have been the major spike of his career, giving him a use for his signature bewildered-but-determined look and kitting him out in an iconic coat. The comics’ John Constantine, originally drawn to look like Sting (unkind people said Freddie Starr), was another trenchcoat-wearing defier of dark forces — demons, rather than rogue robots — and Keanu took a lot of his Neo look and mannerisms over into this film version of the DC title.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1146422[/tomatometer]The Island (2005)Remember the one Michael Bay film critics and audiences had trouble with because it was too clever? It’s another film which is only loosely in the same genre as The Matrix (futuristic, Earthbound sci-fi) but borrows a lot from the Wachowskis’ plot-book: a long first act set in a strange, but calm enclosed world peopled by pretty folks who don’t understand its nature — then a violent ‘awakening’ that reveals shocking truths about the way the characters are being exploited and a series of action-movie chases (with a motorway chase specifically influenced by The Matrix Reloaded) until a big conceptual crisis changes the whole world again. We’re still wating for The Island Reloaded and The Island Revolutions, though…[tomatometer]MuzeID=1187275[/tomatometer]WALL-E (2008)If, as some fruit-loops have suggested, the Wachowskis have discovered the true nature of the universe and The Matrix is actually true, then our computer masters could create no more insidious and effective a propaganda movie than WALL-E. The Pixar triumph is The Matrix told from the point of view of the machines — with the human race depicted as fat, consumerist dolts who deserve to be plugged into their hover-chairs because they’re useless for anything else, and a dauntless, sensitive, intrepid robot hero who looks after the blasted remains of a planet which has been abandoned by people who used it all up and ran away.The Matrix is available on DVD and Blu-ray.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"kong, of, Walt, Universal, action, travel, parents, Emmy, Extras, films, OneApp, versus, criterion, VOD, twilight","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-legacy-of-the-matrix"},{"id":"47613507200606","title":"Exclusive: Lesbian Vampire Killers – RT on Set","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Exclusive: Lesbian Vampire Killers - RT on SetWe visit with the scantily-clad ladies and chat to Horne and Corden.by Joe Utichi | February 25, 2009 |  Comments“There are a few things that you want to do in life,” says James Corden. “Work with Mathew Horne, kiss Harry Potter, and make films about lesbian vampires.”Mat Horne, James Corden, Paul McGann and MyAnna Buring.His work with Horne is well documented in the critically-acclaimed comedy series Gavin &amp; Stacey, and his encounter with Potter star Daniel Radcliffe on stage at last year’s Whatsonstage Theatre Awards is all over the web. RT has travelled to 3 Mills Studio in the east end of London to watch him, and Horne, get to grips with that third ambition on the set of Lesbian Vampire Killers. On a soundstage at the back of the lot we’re in an overgrown forest locale, replete with vines choking stone sarcophagi, which are strewn about the site like they’ve grown wild. With us, amongst the workmen and technicians that usually populate a film set, are 12-15 women dressed so scantily in semi-transparent silk that they may as well be naked.“It’s all about being surrounded by women,” Corden laughs. “That’s the idea for life, isn’t it? I imagine most people that work at Rotten Tomatoes are doing it to get women. Every man’s quest is doing stuff to get women…”Silvia Colloca, as Queen Vampire Carmilla – gets to grips with Corden and Buring.In the true spirit of fantasy horror, we witness shooting on a scene in which Horne and Corden, with co-stars Paul McGann and MyAnna Buring, are literally fighting off the advances of a Vampire Queen and her troupe of similarly-sexy vamp vixens. Horne is pointing a crossbow and Corden is swinging condoms filled with holy water — or, at least, he is until one bursts all over him, prompting a retake and a decision to be less vigorous next time.It’d be easy to assume a film like this doesn’t need much of a plot providing it’s at turns funny and titillating, but there most definitely is one, they insist. “I play a character called Jimmy, who’s been dumped by his girlfriend,” Horne tells us. “And James plays this character called Fletch, who’s lost his job. We’d like to get away from it all, but neither of us has any money, so we end up on a hiking holiday in this cursed village, where we encounter lesbian vampires.”Horne and Corden charge into battle. Big sword jokes abound.“Do you like Mike Leigh‘s films?” asks Corden, with a glint in his eye. “It’s very similar. It’ll definitely be a front-runner come awards season!”With giant lights beaming down on the set, it’s just about the warmest forest RT has ever visited, but it’s far from the stuffy environment we expect from rushed indie film productions — more for the atmosphere amongst the crew than the temperature on the soundstage. Horne and Corden chat jovially in-between takes, and director Phil Claydon seems keen to ensure the mood on set is as light as the material. Everyone seems to be having a great time working on a piece of light-hearted entertainment.Buring behind the scenes.But there is more to the film than just ludicrousness of the premise and the first two thirds of the title, its stars say. “I think it offers a lot more than the title implies,” says Corden. “And it’s predominantly about two friends on a weekend and what happens for them.” Agrees Horne, “It’s part road-movie, part buddy-movie and there’s some horror in it as well, so it’s a great balance. It was the script, first and foremost, that made us want to do it.”As the pair’s first attempt to lead a big-screen comedy – though Corden, of course, has spent time as part of ensembles in the likes of The History Boys or as supporting characters – it may well mark an important step in their careers, too. The tremendous success of Shaun of the Dead led Simon Pegg from Brit TV comedy roots into big-budget Hollywood movies, and it’s hard not to make comparisons between the two. Both feature stars of British TV comedy series’ making their big-screen debuts as the leads in comedy horror films.Colloca gets mad and apparently electrical.For them, though, the project was simply an opportunity to work with interesting material. “We’ve done work either side of Gavin &amp; Stacey that stands up,” says Corden. “It was never a case of ‘Ooh, here’s a chance to show what we can do.’ We thought of it as a chance to be involved with something that’s really good.“It’s odd because on no level was this written for us. The script was written before we were involved, but if we had approached [the writers] Paul &amp; Stuart and said, ‘write a film for us,’ I don’t think it would have been vastly different. Certainly in the characters – it felt really perfect, and the perfect time to do it.”Corden, Horne and Buring.The truth is that the film probably will have to pitch somewhere close to perfect to really work with wider audiences in the way that Shaun did. The novelty of the title has worn off quickly, and the project has even attracted attention from anti-defamation leagues who are failing to see the humour. Shaun-esque success lies in one direction, but another Brit comedy double-act, Mitchell &amp; Webb, saw their big-screen debut, Magicians, sink without a trace — unless the film can attract word-of-mouth support for its quality and comedy there’s a real risk it’ll head in the same direction.Fortunately, a few months after our visit, RT previews 10 minutes of the film in front of an engaged FrightFest crowd. It’s a showreel for the film that hasn’t really been done justice in the trailers that have emerged publicly to date, and it has the audience in fits of laughter throughout. That familiar Horne/Corden sense of humour is there, and the fish-out-of-water fumblings of the pair trying to get to grips with their situation are genuinely funny. If the finished product can maintain this level of belly-laughs for all of its ninety minutes, we may well be in for a treat.Lesbian Vampire Killers releases in the UK on 20th March following a premiere screening at SXSW festival in Austin, Texas.

After varied roles in the likes of London to Brighton and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, RT continues our Fresh Talent series by exploring her ever-evolving career.She was 13 when she made her big screen debut in Paul Andrew Williams‘ affecting drama London to Brighton, and drew stellar notices from critics as a young victim of child prostitution. A few years later, and with a string of roles under her belt, Georgia Groome, who celebrated her 17th birthday last week, is preparing to take to the London stage and return to the medium that launched her career. “I started out in theatre and there’s no better feeling than the adrenaline of being on stage,” she enthuses to RT, “I start rehearsals in the next 2 weeks.”The play is Tusk Tusk, from writer Polly Stenham (That Face). “Tusk Tusk is about a family of kids who are alone, the audience don’t know why,” Groome explains. “I play Cassie, the oldest boy’s girlfriend. She comes in and notices things are wrong. She’s a different part, not a street urchin or an eccentric; she’s just a really caring person that finds herself in a situation she can’t ever understand.”No wonder Groome is earning the right to such well-pedigreed material. Not long after London to Brighton she was cast in Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, the big-screen adaptation of Louise Rennison‘s hugely successful books from Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha. With its bright production design and sweet comedy, it couldn’t be further removed from her debut in tone, and sent a powerful message about her ability to tackle a wide variety of roles.“Playing Joanne in London to Brighton was my first taste of film and I loved every second of it,” she says. “Angus, Thongs was very, very different! Georgia Nicholson is larger than life and eccentric — the complete opposite of London to Brighton.”As Joanne in Paul Andrew Williams’ London to Brighton at age 13.The tonal shift was matched by her mentors on each set, directors Paul Andrew Williams and Gurinder Chadha. “Paul’s main note was to never act, everything was real and raw, he would just make us do it, and if it wasn’t working we would do it again — differently. He also swore a lot and demanded 20p whenever I got something right! Gurinder is the picture of all woman – she’s strong and fun and ruled the whole studio when we were working.”Both directors have cemented Groome’s passion for acting, and she’s determined to continue to seek contrast in future work. “I want to try everything I can, I want to push my boundaries and experiment with characters and genres that I have yet to try.”She’ll next be seen on the big screen in The Disappeared, alongside fellow young stars Harry Treadaway and Harry Potter star Tom Felton. “It’s about child abductions,” she explains. “It’s deep and physiologically disturbing.”Struggling with the conundrum of boys in Gurinder Chadha’s Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.For Groome, working with younger casts on the likes of The Disappeared and Angus, Thongs makes the process all the more enjoyable. “I think I’m even luckier that I can call these people my friends,” she tells RT. “We had a wicked time filming Angus Thongs, we all got on and it was like a playground. Aaron Johnson was a lot of fun to be around – I’m lucky to have worked with some of the best young males about, and I think my school friends agree, although I don’t think they are rating the acting skills!”Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging and London to Brighton are on DVD now. The Disappeared is due for release this year. Tusk Tusk opens at the Royal Court in London on 28th March. On the next page you catch our full Q&amp;A with Georgia and don’t forget to check out our previous Fresh Talent feature with Carey Mulligan.From London to Brighton to Angus, Thongs, you’ve had the opportunity to play a variety of characters and it’s been a busy few years, how does it feel to be playing roles like these?Georgia Groome: I have honestly had the best few years and I feel so lucky. Playing Joanne in London to Brighton was my first taste of film and I loved every second of it. It was cold and long and hard – being forced herbal cigarettes – what wasn’t to love? It was a great character, and an even better cast, I am so proud to say I am part of that little film that caused a bit of a stir!Angus Thongs was very, very different! Georgia Nicholson is larger than life and eccentric – the complete opposite of London to Brighton. I thought after London to Brighton that I only wanted to do serious films, and that’s what my next few projects were, and then I met Gurinder and after a bit of persuasion took the part. Again, I had the best time, doing something completely different, I learn so much on each job, that’s my favourite part.The Disappeared has yet to come out, what can you tell us about that film and who you play?GG: The Disappeared is about child abductions. Matthew’s (Harry Treadaway) brother has been abducted and he has visions of his brother, then I get abducted and Matthew has to work out who is behind it. It’s deep and physiologically disturbing. I had a great time working with Harry, he is a fantastic actor, and one I would love to work with again. My part was quite small, but we filmed in Chislehurst Caves which was an experience in itself. The director gave us a lot of freedom and let us try new things. I hope it does manage to get somebody behind it because Harry does such a good job; it’s a shame when small budget masterpieces don’t get widely seen!London to BrightonYou work with yet another talented young cast on that film, is it good to be on set with younger actors?GG: Yes, definitely! I think I’m even luckier that I can call these people my friends, we had a wicked time filming Angus, Thongs, we all got on and it was like a playground. The worst culprit being Gurinder, she liked to spread rumours and have a good time! Aaron Johnson was a lot of fun to be around, I learnt so much from him, and how he handles things and his approach towards a scene! I’m lucky to have worked with some of the best young males about, and I think my school friends agree, although I don’t think they are rating the acting skills!Being on a young set means that I don’t miss home, I have friends and we can have a laugh, but at the same time, I loved being the only child. Paul Andrew Williams treated me as an adult, he let me make important decisions and listened to what I thought, sharing at least 2 of the scenes, not many directors would listen to a 13 year old inexperienced child but he did and it was a huge lesson for me.Their films are vastly different, but can you share some memories of working with Paul Andrew Williams and Gurinder Chadha? How do they compare/differ in their approaches?GG: They are completely different! Paul’s main note was to never act – everything was real and raw, he would just make us do it, and if it wasn’t working we would do it again differently. He also swears a lot and demanded 20p whenever I got something right! Paul is so supportive of me, he told me the other day on the phone that I’m not getting any younger and to try everything I can before it’s too late. He’s a great man, a best friend. To be honest I owe most of what has happened to him – he gave me my first chance. London to Brighton was a great project to be part of it; we are all so proud so what we achieved on so little time and money. Paul let me more than once decide how I would do it, he let me do it my way, how I thought it would work and in 2 cases this is how it is in the film. Paul is so cool, I can’t think of another word to describe him really!Gurinder works a very organised, happy set, and I’ve generally found a happy set is good set! Everybody loves Gurinder, she radiates warmth, she’s open to talking things through and she would be very clear about how a scene would run and where the beats were meant to be. I learnt a lot working on a big budget film, money is time and we got to try lots of different things and cover lots of different areas. Gurinder is the picture of all woman! She’s strong and fun and ruled the whole studio when we were working. She kept herself on our level. Once, we were struggling to get a scene due to weather and Dick Pope — who’s an absolutely legend by the way – was getting agitated by the light as all DoPs do, and everyone started to get a bit stressed, as did me and Aaron who began to feel the pressure. So we went for another take, and all I heard was Gurinder, sat in a fluro-orange coat laughing so hard, because Aaron couldn’t get the fake hair out of my head (It really wasn’t budging!) Gurinder later told us she wet herself!Do you have anything new on the horizon?GG: Next for me is Polly Stenham’s [writer of That Face] new play. It’s called Tusk Tusk and we are putting it on Upstairs at the Royal Court. I’m very excited! I started out in theatre – unwillingly at first – but it’s when I started to get into performing. I’m scared to go back into it, but I know there’s no better feeling than the adrenaline of being on stage. I’m even more excited to be at the Royal Court – my drama teacher told me to look up the Court and see the list of people who have come through it, and wow! Also, Polly is such a talented writer, Tusk Tusk is about a family of kids who are alone, the audience don’t know why. I play Cassie, the oldest boy’s girlfriend. She comes in and notices things are wrong. She’s a different part, not a street urchin or an eccentric; she’s just a really caring person that finds herself in a situation she can’t ever understand. I start rehearsals in the next 2 weeks and the play starts on the 28th March.Angus, Thongs and Perfect SnoggingIs there anything you haven’t done that you’d really love to do? Perhaps a genre of film or a type of character you’ve yet to experience?GG: I want to try everything I can, I want to push my boundaries and experiment with characters and genres that I have yet to try. I would quite like to try a period drama, I like the idea of corsets and dresses and the period look of the films. I would love to do an action film and learnt to do combat and fighting, I’ve never worked with a green screen so that would be a good experience too.What do you love most about acting?GG: What I love about acting is being able to be different people and to live and experience things through someone else. It’s a great feeling and I learn so much. For me that’s important, to learn whilst I’m doing it. I’m like a sponge – On Angus, Thongs, I would spend long periods of time studying how Eillen (Kastner Delago) would do my makeup and even longer watching Dick Pope set up the cameras and work his magic. It’s nice that these people are willing to share with me what they know.Dick Pope is so amazing, he is Mike Leigh’s DoP and I know I am so lucky to have worked and to have a relationship with him. I think that learning more about the art makes me a better actress, because I have an understanding of what’s going on around me. You appreciate what everyone else does and understand what is needed from you as an actress to make the scene work. Now I watch films and notice angles and lighting and special effects. I absorb the film rather than watch it. I love that I can do that.Who would you most like to work with in the future?GG: I would chop off both my arms to work with Mike Leigh – I love his films and the process of making and rehearsing his films. I’m a big fan of his usual actors, too. Vera Drake and Happy-Go-Lucky are two of my favourite films. I’ve met him on a few occasions – once after a screening of Happy-Go-Lucky – a meeting set up by about eight different people including Dick Pope – and again at an awards ceremony. I would love to make a film with him; his films are true and interesting and look amazing. I would also like to work with James McAvoy and Jodie Foster. I guess that’s only part of my wish list too… I could go on forever!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Con, Box, twilight, Society, elm, Food, 2018, President, Photos, movie, Mirror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"georgia-groome-fresh-talent-on-rt"},{"id":"47613542595182","title":"Comic-Con 2006 Wrap-Up: \"Spider-Man 3,\" \"300,\" and \"Grind House\" Led The Pack","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Comic-Con 2006 Wrap-Up: \"Spider-Man 3,\" \"300,\" and \"Grind House\" Led The Packby Jen Yamato | July 27, 2006 |  CommentsThe best part about attending Comic-Con in the flesh?

In The Edge of Love, Knightley stars alongside Sienna Miller, Cillian Murphy and Matthew Rhys in a film about the fiery relationship between Dylan Thomas (Rhys) and three of his friends. Already attracting talk of another Oscar nomination, Knightley’s performance is being described as one of her best. The script has been penned by Sharman MacDonald, Knightley’s mother.You’re an actor who enjoys a challenge; what was the challenge of this film for you?Keira Knightley: You know, it’s really funny, it’s actually really lovely to work on something that was so intimate, and small. And I think that it’s very rare to get a film script that has such good dialogue. So it was a real joy, because a lot of the time you spend on film sets, you spend it really fighting to find out how to say the words. With this one we were already at another level, because it just flowed so easily.Did it help to have friendships with the cast before you started?KK: It really helped. I don’t think that you can fake warmth. You can fake lust, jealousy, anger; those are all quite easy. But actual, genuine warmth? I don’t think you can fake it. And it was really great that we did all get on. We had a great time all living in the same house, and we felt like a proper unit. So it means that when you’re doing something that’s incredibly intimate, you’re safe to try things out and you don’t feel like a complete dickhead!How did you wrap your tongue around the Welsh accent?KK: We had a really good voice coach. Half my mum’s family is Welsh, and I remember when I was a kid, she used to read to me, and wizards and characters like that always had a Welsh accent.Did it feel strange working on her script for this film, as well?KK: It actually felt very natural. If you live with a writer, you do grow up with their words and with their fantasies. And I’ve pretty -much seen every single one of her plays, so I’ve been in a lot of rehearsal rooms, and all the rest of it. It felt very natural and very easy, and lovely to do that professionally, as well.Were you looking for something of hers that you’d be able to collaborate on?KK: Not at all, it was a complete fluke and accident. It was literally just that she said, “will you give me some notes,” and I thought it was beautiful and an amazing story, and just really interesting. So I was working on The Jacket, and I just gave it to one of the producers, thinking he may be able to give notes on it, or something. He said, “is this something you’re thinking about?” And I only really said yes cause he’d read it, I didn’t think anything would come of it at all. So yes, it was fantastically accidental.Dylan Thomas is not that likeable in the movie, is he?KK: Some people really just go, “Oh, he’s mischievous,” and other people go, “wow, he’s quite demonic, and dark.” So I think it’s wonderful that it says a lot about the people that are going to see the film. I don’t feel we should dictate about him, I think if that’s your view of him, then that’s wonderful. It’s good to know that other people think differently, and that’s what makes the characters interesting.Do you think it’s actually even about Thomas directly?KK: Again, I think that’s open to interpretation. But it’s not a regular biopic, where you’re doing a beginning, middle and end of Thomas’ life. A lot of time I have a problem with biopics that try to do too much in an hour and a half. So I thought the really fascinating thing about this was that it was looking at a very specific time, and some very specific people, and really exploring those relationships, and meeting up with those characters, as opposed to just one central character.Was it nice to do this after coming back from making the Pirates films?KK: Yeah, it was great, it was really great. It’s fantastic to have the opportunity to work abroad, and do all that, but there is a certain point where you’re just like, “Oh, I’d love to work at home.” I think once you get a certain profile you can help to make films, and we have a tiny industry in this country so I think it’s really important for the people that can, to get into it. So it was great to do something that was entirely British-financed, British cast, crew. I thought that these were genuinely fascinating stories; the British emotional mentality is a very interesting one. It’s my culture, so obviously it’s what I’m interested in. It’s great to do films here.You’ve been cutting a swathe through various times passed in your films recently; do you have a favourite era, one that you perhaps identify with?KK: I don’t have a favourite era, no. I’m very glad that I haven’t lived through the Blitz but I love films from that era and I find it fascinating when you’re actually looking at the reality of the era, versus what we think of as the 1940s.Thinking about young people grabbing onto life with absolutely everything in them, when death is literally falling from the sky, it’s fascinating to think, “Well, how do you behave?” You try and live for every single moment, and every single thing and sometimes, you’ll make mistakes, but I find that fascinating.As a time period I like to think about, and as far as relationships and emotions go, I find it a very interesting period.Do you get sent more period stuff than contemporary stuff?KK: I do get a lot of contemporary stuff; I just find it’s very difficult to find good female roles in contemporary pieces. I don’t know why that is. I find more interesting roles for women in period pieces. I do personally like watching period films; I think you can really get lost in the fantasy of them. You’re not judging it on a day to day, “I know this,” basis. You’re in your own role, and I like the fusion that that creates. But really, it’s about the characters, and I’ve found it’s just not as good for women in contemporary pieces.At your height of Pirates it was fairly crazy with paparazzi. Has that all calmed down a bit now?KK: Yeah it has a bit. I think I’m older and boring! I think it was particularly crazy when I was 18 and they were thinking, “she must fall out of clubs any minute now…” But I didn’t, and that’s really crappy, I think. It has calmed down, and now I’m doing a lot of very different roles, in a lot of smaller films.What got you through that period then?KK: I don’t know, to tell you the truth. I just didn’t stop working. I mean, I didn’t stop working until this year, so I was in the very protective bubble of film sets. So in a funny kind of way, I was never back for long enough to really notice what had happened. Any time I did pop up though, I thought, “Fuck, this is terrifying!”So now you’ve got a bit of time off, are you going to travel?KK: I just want to live life in general, really.Check out our interview with Knightley’s co-star, Sienna Miller, right here.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Film, obituary, comics, lee, psychological, Acorn, The, Trophy, Oscars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-interview-keira-knightley-on-welsh-accents-and-life-after-pirates"},{"id":"47613550672498","title":"Southland Tales Stills, Trailer Info","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Southland Tales Stills, Trailer InfoWho says there's no originality left in Hollywood?by Jeff Giles | August 24, 2007 |  CommentsIt’s got what might be the largest cast and most difficult-to-describe storyline of any major motion picture this year, so of course, Richard Kelly‘s Southland Tales is being observed closely by many film lovers as it gets closer to its November release date. FirstShowing has been down in the trenches all along, and is now offering some new details about Southland‘s trailer — and a pile of stills from the movie.First, some background on Southland Tales, for anyone who hasn’t been following along. The film’s synopsis describes it like so:Director Richard Kelly follows up cult favorite DONNIE DARKO with this sprawling epic about a futuristic version of Los Angeles that harnesses the power of the ocean to produce energy. The eclectic cast includes The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake, Mandy Moore, and Janeane Garofalo.Sounds a little strange — and it doesn’t even get into the appearances of Seann William Scott as twin brothers, Wallace Shawn as a villain named Baron Von Westphalen, a blond Jon Lovitz, and Kevin Smith as a legless vet. Oh, and a musical performance by Timberlake.Clearly, this is one of 2007’s must-see films, and if you’re one of the people who have been anxiously awaiting the trailer, FirstShowing has good news — according to Richard Kelly himself, it will be surfacing on television and the Web during the first week of September.

Be very afraid.Top Horror/Suspense Films by Tomatometer, #20-1620) Open Water (2004) 72%It might as well be space because in the Caribbean Sea no one can hear you scream. Well, save for the circling sharks below. In the slow-paced psychological thriller \"Open Water,\" married couple Susan and Daniel embark upon a deep sea adventure to rest, relax and reconnect. Unfortunately for the twosome, they are accidentally left behind by their diving team, smack dab in the middle of the deep blue. The pair struggle to survive amid tumultuous elements and inhospitable oceanic critters. Oh, and get this, it’s based on a true story, so you may want to rethink that next seaside getaway.Starring: Blanchard Ryan, Daniel TravisDirected by: Chris Kentis19) Joy Ride (2001) 73%Breaker, breaker 1-9. If there’s a lesson to be learned from the horror meets the highway jaunt \"Joy Ride,\" it’s that one should never mess with a guy who goes by the name \"Rusty Nail.\" Tetanus, people. Tetanus. Of course, on-screen bros Paul Walker and Steve Zahn didn’t get the memo and end up messing with a mentally unstable truck driver via CB radio. Essentially, a mean-spirited joke goes awry and the two brothers, along with potential love interest Leelee Sobieski, find themselves in the path of a madman’s quest for revenge.Starring: Steve Zahn, Paul Walker, Leelee SobieskiDirected by: John Dahl18) George A. Romero’s Land of the Dead (2005) 74%After a lengthy hiatus, horror master George A. Romero returned in 2005 with yet another unsettling tale of life among zombies in \"Land of the Dead.\" This time around, the living dead and humans co-exist, but not without a structured caste system in place. Romero’s societal commentary tackles the issue of the \"haves\" and \"have-nots,\" where the wealthy live in luxury, safe behind walls of protection while the not-so fortunate are relegated to life in streets. Regardless, no amount of money can keep the ever-evolving lineage of zombies at bay for too long.Starring: Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Asia ArgentoDirected by: George A. Romero17) Signs (2002) 75%Honestly, which is scarier: the little girl that asks for a glass of water or the bobble-headed aliens lurking about in M. Night Shyamalan‘s \"Signs?\" Beyond the suspense of who, or perhaps what, is behind the crop circles in the cornfield, \"Signs\" digs a little deeper and brings up issues of faith and religion. The tale of the Hess family and the series of peculiar events that have lately befallen them is a perfectly chilling romp for the whole family to enjoy.Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory CulkinDirected by: M. Night Shyamalan16) Audition (1999) 76%The first half of \"Audition\" is slow-moving, like a glob of peanut butter lodged in the back of your throat. But by the latter half, chances are you’d prefer that things had kept at their leisurely pace. Not for the faint of heart, Takashi Miike‘s disturbing tale of courtship is a perfect example that it’s never wise to mislead a woman.

A new Star Wars was coming out, ditching handmade green puppets in favor of shellacking a movie in CG. The internet was still a sparse superhighway, stretching empty in-between frontier cities of anonymity and information gardens. A new millennium nested beyond the horizon, yet persistent trembling hinted that something awful would befall humanity when the clock struck midnight on December 31st: Y2K. The news cycle warned connected online systems would fail, banking accounts were to shatter, airlines would have to ground all planes as modern life as we knew it screeched to a halt.No movie captured this zeitgeist of exhilaration and paranoia more than The Matrix, which opened in U.S. theaters on March 31, 1999.&nbsp;Like peak-James Cameron, the Wachowskis used state-of-the-art filmmaking techniques to pit man against the sleek, technological hell of our own creation. Perhaps we were slaves to our own comfort and science. And perhaps there would be a way to escape it. Enter Neo – the pale, withdrawn hacker played by Keanu Reeves – who discovers the true nature of our world: A shared simulation we processed in our minds as we slumbered in oozing pods, generating energy for the sentient machines that had turned our race into cattle. It would take a red pill, some kung fu, and guns, lots of guns, to wake up and win this war.The Matrix combined existentialist philosophy with anime-inspired visual wizardry, wrapped with the perfect mix of CG and practical effects to make this wild world feel grimy, tactile, and lived-in. Chad Stahelski was among the chief operators in selling this new reality as Reeves’ stunt double, with first-hand experience in witnessing how the Wachowskis crafted this remarkable film. His working relationship with Reeves started here and has never ended, with the duo upholding The Matrix‘s legacy of high-impact filmmaking with the Stahelski-directed&nbsp;John Wick movies. Stahleski here recalls the enlightening, bone-crunching trip.(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)“Holy s–t, this is something pretty different.”“I wasn’t hired initially at the beginning. I came on right after they started principal photography. At the time it was a script that read pretty crazy and didn’t make a lot of sense on paper. It filmed in Sydney, Australia. I get there, I get off the plane, I meet Yuen Woo-ping and his fight team, and within about four hours of being there it’s like, ‘Holy s–t, this is something pretty different.'”“The Wachowskis somehow, through force of sheer will and creative genius, got those shots.”“If you had seen the storyboards we’d been given before we shot even a frame of the movie, and see how close they were to the final edited product, [you’d see] the genius of the Wachowskis. No matter what the adversities were on The Matrix, the Wachowskis somehow, through force of sheer will and creative genius, got those shots. Got exactly what they wanted. Got the framing they wanted, and molded each and every one of us, both performers and department heads, to get their vision. It was one of the most precise, arduous things I’ve ever done in my life. [They had] attention to detail, complete nuance of every scene. In between takes they’d watch the fashion channel, they would do research in martial arts films. I’ve never seen two directors that had such an all-encompassing knowledge of every single department and aspect of the film.”The Wachowskis. (Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)“They actually made breakdowns of other kung fu movies.”“[The Wachowskis would] take an old Jet Li or Jackie Chan movie, download it on their computers, and re-edit it just to understand why those edits worked, or understand the moves.&nbsp;They actually made breakdowns of other kung fu movies.&nbsp;They&nbsp;weren’t martial art or stunt people, but they went in and actually learned, through experience and exposure, different martial arts or different styles of kung fu so they could put them in.”The Moment:&nbsp;The Government LobbyIn a movie that drips with coolness like cascading lines of green code, you’d think it’d be tough to pull out the&nbsp;moment. But there was little debate that it wouldn’t be the lobby scene, where leather-clad Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) stage a full assault to rescue resistance leader Morpheus from capture. The set literally explodes in&nbsp;a hail of bullets, shot with signature slo-mo and kinetic gunplay and combat, all to a pulsating techno soundtrack. In 1999, it was the apex of style.“There’s about 4,000 squibs in the walls, so when we yell action, you’re probably not going to be able to see anything.”“It was literally walking in off the plane, drop bags off at the hotel, go stretch at gym, [and then] going into the government lobby choreography pieces. The Wachowskis — very quiet, very soft-spoken directors — had come in and said, ‘We’re gonna do this, we wanna do this, and there’s about 4,000 squibs in the walls so when we yell action, you’re probably not going to be able to see anything.’ Nowadays, we do it all digitally so it’s pretty quick resets, but it was pretty impressive at the time [what] went into it.The first time when Keanu runs down the hallway and the guns are going off and everybody’s shooting at him – that was a week of prep just for the special-effects guys laying in all the squibs. So every time you do a take, it’s a half-day. So you get one go at it and if you miss, everybody goes home and they spend another day resetting the new panels in to blow it up again.”(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)“Keanu&nbsp;nailed it first take.”&nbsp;“So Keanu and I both had to back up to our number one marks and pretty much try to do all the choreography and the one-handed cartwheel and all the shooting with your eyes closed. Because once the squibs started going off, you couldn’t see anything. You had to count your steps and kinda go into it. And I remember looking at him and going ‘Uh, OK, this could be a little tricky.’And he’s like ‘Eh, OK.’ And he nailed it first take. So that was pretty cool.The government lobby was a difficult sequence stunt-wise, but it probably wasn’t the hardest thing we did there. I mean, figuring out bullet time. The dojo fight was probably physically the toughest for Keanu. Logistically, the subway probably had a lot more stunt work and wirework than the government lobby. But then again you had Carrie-Anne walking on a wall, which was probably her most difficult wire move in the whole film. And Keanu doing an aerial cartwheel over an M16, picking it up, and shooting three guys.”(Photo by Warner Bros./courtesy Everett Collection)“You can copy it, but it’s not the same as putting all those little pieces together.”“A lot of guys can try and copy The Matrix, meaning you do a low angle thing here and you cover this kick in a wide. You can copy it, but it’s not the same as putting all those little pieces together. What the Wachowskis taught us the most was [how] you build a world. I’ll relate this to John Wick so maybe it’s a little bit easier to understand. The color, the wardrobe, the suit, the house, the pajama bottoms, the way the gun style works. The emotional hook with the dog and the puppy. All that comes from working with the Wachowskis. Every little thing builds the world. You never blink. You never let the audience think, ‘Oh they’re just kinda doing a cool move, they’re just kinda doing a cool color.’ Every little thing goes into building the world. Every little aspect, on camera, off camera, how you train the cast, what the dialogue rhythm is, know your editing style, just really, really immersing people.”The Impact:&nbsp;A New Standard in ActionThe Matrix broadened the tastes of audiences, and what they expected out of action movies. It officially signaled the end of the burly macho stars of the ’80s, who had hung on for dear life past the mid-’90s, and into more fluid fights, elaborate maneuvers, and lighter-than-air wirework. Fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping’s name was literally used in marketing future movies he worked on, the highlight being the Best Picture-nominated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.The Matrix had a fetishistic obsession with its own action sequences, something you’ll see later in Wanted, Kick-Ass, or Zack Snyder movies. Meanwhile, spoofing The Matrix became its own kind of cultural cred, as seen in movies and shows like Scary Movie, Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, The Simpsons, Spaced, Shrek, and&nbsp;Kung Pow, or the Nintendo 64 game&nbsp;Conker’s Bad Fur Day,&nbsp;and beyond.But for the people who made the movie, it’s the camaraderie that endures, and the gift of knowing that they got to participate in one of the most beloved, influential movies of the last 21 years.“To work on it, to be part of it, it is by far my favorite film.”“We use Laurence Fishburne [in the John Wick series], and I bumped into Carrie-Anne, and I bumped into Hugo Weaving the last couple of years and they still… Every single person, including department heads and cast that worked on that movie, still f–king cheer when it comes on. Everyone’s very proud of it. They can actually step outside their own performances and go ‘That’s f–king cool.’ For people in the business, that’s not a normal thing you can do. We all count ourselves as incredibly fortunate to have worked on that. Keanu and I see each other about every day,&nbsp;so we watched [The Matrix] again and had a nice talk about it yesterday. I don’t necessarily want to speak for Keanu, but it’s, like, still one of his favorite films of all time. To work on it, to be part of it, it is by far my favorite film.”Reeves and Stahelski. (Photo by Christopher Jue/Getty Images)“I’m both proud and somewhat ashamed to say it, but without the Wachowskis we couldn’t have done&nbsp;John Wick.”“The Wachowskis wanted to immerse us in a world that was both real and extreme. And when you sit and watch The Matrix, you are wrapped up in that movie. You are wrapped up in the real-world part of it, you’re wrapped up in the matrix part of it. You buy it all. They thought it down to&nbsp; a molecular level of detail. I’m both proud and somewhat ashamed to say it, but without the Wachowskis we couldn’t have done John Wick. We took a lot of lessons from them and hopefully tried to honor what they taught us by doing what we could with that.”“How cool is it that I get to watch The Matrix with Keanu Reeves?”“Because of my relationship with Keanu, because we still work together and all that stuff…I mean how cool is it that I get to watch The Matrix with Keanu Reeves? And we still laugh, and we still cheer! And to see Keanu Reeves, the actual Neo sitting in a chair, where we’re both having a scotch watching The Matrix like that, or just to pull up a scene to fucking relive old times or something, or to get an idea, and to see Keanu Reeves jump up and go ‘F–k yeah! That’s awesome!’ I mean, I’m not gonna lie to you, that’s pretty cool!”The Matrix&nbsp;was released on March 31, 1999.

We decided to look at the most compelling antagonists in all of superhero cinema.by Erik Amaya | April 27, 2018 |  CommentsTo go by&nbsp;his words and deeds, Avengers: Infinity War’s Thanos (Josh Brolin) may be the most consummate and powerful foe the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet unleashed. To hear him tell it, his attempt to give the universe balance by obtaining the Infinity Stones is a merciful and humane action. Perhaps more than any other Marvel villain, he is a hero in his own mind with goals he perceives as altruistic.But will his Infinity War appearance make him one of the great film supervillains of all time?&nbsp;And what makes for greatness when it comes to villainy? Is it a grand plan executed with aplomb? An iconic look or an immediately quotable motto? Or is it a knack for banter with the hero? As more and more people see Infinity War, Thanos’s merits as one of the great villains will be debated, but let’s take a look at 20 of the big screen’s greatest superhero foes he will have to contend with to get that honor.20. The Joker (Cesar Romero)(Photo by 20th Century Fox)The big screen’s first Joker was also television’s original Crown Prince of Crime. Romero memorably gave the character his psychotic laugh and off-kilter sense of humor. In the film, he also succeeds at being a cabin boy to a senile admiral. Armed with his repertoire and a “dehydration” gun, the Joker — along with the Penguin (Burgess Meredith), Catwoman (Lee Meriwether) and the Riddler (Frank Gorshin) — creates plenty of trouble for the Dynamic Duo.Film Appearances: Batman: The Movie (1966), though he previously appeared in the&nbsp;Batman TV series.Tomatometer: 80%North American Box Office: $1.7 millionDestruction Factor: Turns the “United World” Security Council to a fine powder.Memorable Line: “I’m afraid they’ll find our humor very, very dry!”Powers: Puns and gag weapons.Cosplay Cred: Few are ever willing to grow a Romero mustache for the perfect Joker ’66 look.19. Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton)(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)As a deep-cover spy, Neville Sinclair was the toast of Hollywood with the ability to&nbsp;bed any woman and earn the trust of any man. But his attempt to secure Howard Hughes’s (Terry O’Quinn) experimental rocket pack fills him with a particular mania&nbsp;that serves to be his undoing. Also: his sophisticated movie star image is the perfect counterpoint to the unkempt style of the Rocketeer (Billy Campbell).Film Appearances:&nbsp;The Rocketeer (1991)Tomatometer: 62%US Box Office: $46.7 millionDestruction Factor: Assists in the destruction of a dirigible, the rocket pack itself, and a portion of the “Hollywoodland” sign.Memorable Line: “It wasn’t lies, Jenny. It vas acting.”Powers: A strong resemblance to Errol Flynn and Timothy Dalton.Cosplay Cred: Sadly, none.18. The Phantasm (Dana Delany)(Photo by Warner Bros.)The Phantasm is one of the most personal villains the animated Batman (Kevin Conroy) ever faced. In costume, the Phantasm speaks with the voice of Stacy Keach and strikes terror into Gotham’s organized crime families. But in reality, she is Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany), the only woman who could ever pull Bruce Wayne away from his life as a vigilante. Sadly, the dissolution of their relationship leads them both to don masks and face the City’s worst criminals.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Batman: Mask of the Phantasm&nbsp;(1993)Tomatometer: 82%US Box Office: $5.6 millionDestruction Factor: Batman’s heart.Memorable Line: “Your Angel of Death awaits.”Powers: Combat training and smoke bombs.Cosplay Cred: Rare, but it’s memorable when you spot a Phantasm cosplay in the wild.17. Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson)Though he seems to be a mentor, Elijah Price is really the architect of all of David Dunn’s (Bruce Willis) problems. (Sorry: Spoiler.) Though he is the only person to recognize the presence of superpowers in&nbsp;the world, years of abuse and neglect — to say nothing of his brittle bones — lead him to one conclusion: be the supervillain the world needs&nbsp;to find the hero it requires.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Unbreakable&nbsp;(2000), thought M. Night Shyamalan is currently working on a follow-up for 2019 called, appropriately,&nbsp;Glass.Tomatometer: 68%Worldwide Box Office: $248.1 millionDestruction Factor: Derails a train to prove David is indestructible, among other acts of terrorism.Memorable Line: “They called me Mr. Glass!”Powers: A terrifying intellect.Cosplay Cred: A surprisingly rare occurrence at comic cons.16. Mystique (Rebecca Romijn)(Photo by 20th Century Fox)As both spy and confidant to Magneto (Ian McKellen), Mystique&nbsp;relies on her top martial arts skills and mutant ability to blend into any environment. But she is also the most visible example of Magneto’s crusade. Though she can choose to appear as anyone she wishes, Mystique’s natural blue serpentine appearance inspires fear in the world. The character was so memorable in the initial X-Men film series that the current cycle revolves around her, now played by Jennifer Lawrence.Film Appearances: The X-Men franchise.Tomatometer: X-Men: 81% (Certified Fresh), X2: X-Men United: 85% (Certified Fresh), X-Men: The Last Stand: 58%Worldwide Box Office: X-Men: $296.3 million, X2: X-Men United: $407.7 million, X-Men: The Last Stand: $459.3 millionDestruction Factor:&nbsp;Though she has been known to&nbsp;blow stuff up now and again, that isn’t really her style. Instead she sows confusion and wreaks havoc by manipulating her foes.Memorable Line: “You know, people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child.”Powers: Shape-shifting.Cosplay Cred: An extremely tough look to pull off at comic cons.15. “Bad” Superman (Christopher Reeve)(Photo by Warner Bros.)When Superman is overcome by the toxic effects of Gus Gorman’s (Richard Pryor) counterfeit Kryptonite, he turns into a self-centered jerk who would rather make time with a pretty lady than save a bunch of bus passengers on a disintegrating bridge. Reeve’s attempt to channel an all-id Superman does feel more “bad” than evil, but it provides a fun opportunity for Reeve to play against himself and&nbsp;presents the first on-screen exploration of an idea — “What if&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;were evil?” — that would become a major theme driving the narrative behind movies like&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and&nbsp;Suicide Squad.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Superman III&nbsp;(1983)Tomatometer: 26%US Box Office: $60 millionDestruction Factor: Straightening the Leaning Tower of Pisa ruined the Italian economy.Memorable Line: “You always wanted to fly, Kent!”Powers: All the powers of a Superman, but he’d rather drink Johnny Walker Red.Cosplay Cred: Not nearly as common as it should be.14. Joker (Jack Nicholson)The merger of Nicholson’s persona with the Joker is one of Batman’s great strengths, but the performance is more nuanced than many gave it credit for at the time. Once he falls into the Axis Chemicals acid and adopts his clown persona, Nicholson loses some of his iconic cool to dig into the louder, broader aspects of Gotham’s #1 villain (e.g. the Smilex commercial). A consummate foe for the Batman of the late 1980s.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;(1989)Tomatometer: 72%Worldwide Box Office: $411.3 millionDestruction Factor: Kills his boss, fries a business rival, and poisons Gotham City.Memorable Line: “Ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?”Powers: Knowledge of chemistry and a flair for the theatrical.Cosplay Cred: A fairly rare sight as other takes on the Joker became more popular.13. Syndrome (Jason Lee)(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)The ultimate sycophant, Syndrome (née Buddy Pine) was a precursor of the sort of fan culture&nbsp;that eats itself for some perceived lack of purity. His jealousy of the supers leads to a lot of strife for the Parr Family and an America burnt out on superheroes. Nonetheless, his actions also lead to a possible return of heroes, despite an attempt to even the playing field.Film Appearances:&nbsp;The Incredibles&nbsp;(2004)Tomatometer: 97% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $633 millionDestruction Factor: His robots leave a path of destruction through the metro area the Parrs call home.Memorable Line: “And when everyone’s super, no one will be.”Powers: Zero point energy manipulation via technology.Cosplay Cred: Virtually nonexistent, though memorably spotted on occasion.12. Ultron (James Spader)(Photo by Marvel Studios)As the personification of Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr.) id, Ultron’s attempts to secure the planet make clear Tony’s greatest failing: he cannot see the human cost in any of his endeavors. Powered by the Mind Stone, Ultron makes a final, ugly calculation in regards to humanity and sets out to destroy it. Also, since he’s based on Tony’s brain patterns, he quips. A lot.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;(2015)Tomatometer: 75% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $1.41 billionDestruction Factor: Raises – and razes – the entire nation of Sokovia; the ramifications of which are still being felt throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Memorable Line: “When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.”Powers: All the powers of an Iron Man, multiplied by the ability to self-replicate infinitely.Cosplay Cred: Extremely rare, though a few Ultrons appeared at cons after the film’s release.11. Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer)(Photo by Warner Bros.)While DC Comics’ favorite cat burglar skirts the line between villain and ne’er-do-well, Catwoman’s initial involvement in a plot to disgrace Batman (Michael Keaton) earns her a spot on the list. Pfeiffer’s performance defined the character for a long time – even if she was partly inspired by the TV Catwomen of the 1960s – as she fought Batman and her own turmoil. In the end, her Catwoman chose her own way and never appeared in a film again. Not that anyone has ever been able to forget her.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Batman Returns&nbsp;(1992)Tomatometer: 81% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $266.8 millionDestruction Factor: She blows up Schreck’s Department Store in an early show of strength.Memorable Line: “Meow.”Powers: Nine lives and a filing system that is unstoppable.Cosplay Cred: Though the film is over 25 years old, this Catwoman costume is still popular.10. The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan)(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios)Yes, yes,&nbsp;he isn’t a villain by choice, as he’s very much a weapon of Hydra in the film, but Bucky Barnes is very&nbsp;effective&nbsp;at playing the part. His Soviet brainwashing is so&nbsp;effective that,&nbsp;when activated, almost no emotional appeal will work on him. Well, at least until his old friend Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans), finally breaks through. And, really, Bucky’s relationship with Steve is part of what makes him so compelling.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&nbsp;(2014) and&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016), though Sebastian Stan first played Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The First Avenger&nbsp;(2011).Tomatometer:&nbsp;Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 89% (Certified Fresh), Captain America: Civil War: 91% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: Captain America: The Winter Soldier:&nbsp;$714.3 million,&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War: $1.15 billionDestruction Factor: Assists in bringing down S.H.I.E.L.D. and its helicarrier fleet.Memorable Line: “Who the hell is Bucky?”Powers: Heightened strength and agility, a cybernetic vibranium arm.Cosplay Cred: A beloved fixture of con-going cosplayers.9.&nbsp;Vulture&nbsp;(Michael Keaton)(Photo by Sony Pictures)Despite a strong work ethic and good management skills, Adrian Toomes turned to crime when Tony Stark and government officials bulldozed over his contract to clean up Manhattan following the Battle of New York. Granted, the swiftness with which he became a black market weapons manufacturer suggests all he ever needed was a gentle shove to embrace villainy. But the opening scene of&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;made him immediately understandable and compelling as a villain; and even sympathetic once his relationship to Spider-Man’s (Tom Holland) world is revealed.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;(2017)Tomatometer: 92% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $880.1 millionDestruction Factor: Rips a ferry in half, crashes a Stark Industries jet, and blasts&nbsp;Logan Marshall-Green out of the MCU.Memorable Line: “The rich, the powerful, like Stark, they don’t care about us! The world’s changed boys. Time we change too!”Powers:&nbsp;A flying rig based on crashed Chitauri tech.Cosplay Cred: Surprisingly rare costume in spite of a great adaptation of the comic book Vulture’s look.8. Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman)Excusing some of the camp value to Hackman’s Luthor – particularly in the sequel – he exudes the key quality of Superman’s archfoe: egotism. Luthor, a real estate swindler in these films, only decides to fight Superman because his ego dictates it. Consequently, Superman cannot really appeal to his emotions; none are present as he plans to remake the West Coast in his image.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;(1978),&nbsp;Superman II (1981)Tomatometer:&nbsp;Superman: 93%,&nbsp;Superman II: 87%Worldwide Box Office:&nbsp;Superman: $300 million,&nbsp;Superman II: $156.9 millionDestruction Factor: Nearly sank California into the Pacific.Memorable Line: “There’s a strong streak of good in you, Superman. But then, nobody’s perfect… almost nobody.”Powers: He is the greatest criminal mind of his time. He also owns a hefty Kryptonite necklace that he uses to weaken Superman.Cosplay Cred: Between Hackman’s refusal to go bald and the appalling 1970s fashions, he is a truly rare cosplay sight.7. Zemo (Daniel Bruhl)(Photo by Marvel Studios)Currently, the Avengers’ greatest foe is not a flamboyant god or a maniacal robot, but a sad, quiet man with a detailed plan and working knowledge of governmental procedures. Zemo destabilizes the world for a very personal and, ultimately, small goal: hurt the Avengers the way they hurt him. He also succeeds, leaving Captain America a fugitive and Tony Stark so isolated that he has to pal around with a spider-themed teenager hero.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;(2016)Tomatometer: 91% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $1.15 billionDestruction Factor: With some smoke, a few explosions, and a very inconvenient truth, he&nbsp;brings down the Avengers. He also murders a few people along the way.Memorable Line: “An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again, but one which crumbles from within? That’s dead… forever.”Powers: Determination.Cosplay Cred: Despite his comic book counterpart’s incredible fashion sense, the Marvel Cinematic Universe version inspires few to dress up.6. Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina)(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)One of the most sympathetic villains on the list, Molina’s Doc Ock was as much a victim of his passions as he was a willing accomplice in a plan to destroy Spider-Man. The cruelty that emerges in him came from his cybernetic implants; a crucial detail that becomes clear when he finally reasserts control and realizes he was trying to kill his friend Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Also, the warmth with which he welcomes Peter — a guy in desperate need of a positive male role model — makes his turn all the more tragic.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Spider-Man 2&nbsp;(2004)Tomatometer: 93% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office: $783.8 millionDestruction Factor: His lab is completely destroyed during an experiment. He also leaves his mark on New York skyscrapers and the subway lines.Memorable Line: “I will not die a monster.”Powers:&nbsp;Super-tough robotic appendages.Cosplay Cred: Popular in the wake of the film’s release, but has since faded.5. General Zod (Terence Stamp)(Photo by Warner Bros.)Thanks to Stamp, Zod is as much a staple in Superman’s rogues gallery as Lex Luthor. Seemingly reserved, Zod can lash out without hesitation. Despite the air of refinement Stamp gives the character, he is just another petty dictator — a point underscored&nbsp;when he takes control of the White House (and, by implication, the world) only to suffer from conqueror’s boredom. Superman’s return late in the film comes as a relief to Zod, as debasing the son of Jor-El gives him something to do.Film Appearances: Superman&nbsp;(1978),&nbsp;Superman II&nbsp;(1981)Tomatometer: 87%Worldwide Box Office:&nbsp;Superman: $300 million,&nbsp;Superman II: $156.9 millionDestruction Factor: He and his cohorts reshape Mount Rushmore and pummel the West Wing. They also make insurance premiums rise in Metropolis again.Memorable Line: “Come to me, son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!”Powers: All the powers of a Superman plus advanced military training.Cosplay Cred: Zod’s look is just a little too disco for most cosplayers.4. Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan)(Photo by © Marvel and © Walt Disney Pictures)The secret shame of Wakanda, Erik “Killmonger” Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) presents a legitimate concern to King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman)&nbsp;and his subjects, even if his methods are woefully misguided: Should Wakanda reveal itself to the outside world and help those who live with the legacy of the African slave trade? The character’s heady subtext is backed by Jordan’s gifted abilities as a performer.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;(2018)Tomatometer: 96% (Certified Fresh)Worldwide Box Office (To Date): $1.34 billionDestruction Factor: Destroys all but one of the heart-shaped herbs, which is far more devastating than any property damage he caused in the film.Memorable Line: “Nah, just bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped from ships. ‘Cause they knew death was better than bondage.”Powers: Thanks to the heart-shaped herb, all the powers of Black Panther; Navy SEAL training.Cosplay Cred: Few could wait for a comic convention to dress in Killmonger’s now-iconic London look. Cosplayers dressed in his subsequent battle suit, which looks suspiciously like Vegeta’s from Dragonball Z,&nbsp;shortly after.3. Magneto (Ian McKellen)(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Erik Magnus Lehnsherr is one of the most compelling antagonists in comics and film for one simple reason: he’s pretty much right. His methods may be unquestionably cruel to conventional humans, but he recognizes two sapient species cannot share the planet. Violence, subjugation, and pain are inevitable. And when his point of view is given McKellen’s voice, it becomes incredibly persuasive. The more optimistic philosophy of the X-Men looks naïve and childish in comparison.Film Appearances:&nbsp;The X-Men FranchiseTomatometer: X-Men: 81% (Certified Fresh), X2: X-Men United: 85% (Certified Fresh), X-Men: The Last Stand: 58%, X-Men: Days of Future Past: 90%Worldwide Box Office: X-Men: $296.3 million, X2: X-Men United: $407.7 million, X-Men: The Last Stand: $459.4 million, X-Men: Days of Future Past: $747.9 millionDestruction Factor: He moves the Golden Gate Bridge to Alcatraz, turns Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) into a water creature, and renders a sick burn unto Rogue (Anna Paquin) about the white stripe in her hair.Memorable Line: “Let’s just say God works too slowly.”Powers: The ability to manipulate all metal.Cosplay Cred: His initial low-key look is rarely imitated these days.2. Loki (Tom Hiddleston)(Photo by Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Studios)The power of persuasion is also a major weapon in the arsenal of the God of Lies. Loki is charismatic, witty, exciting, and a sharp dresser. He’s that bad boy who looks redeemable even as he opens a wormhole to let the Chitauri invade Earth. But then he has a good explanation for his bad choices: he was raised by the god who kidnapped him from his real family. And he means to do good, so shouldn’t that be enough? It’s no wonder Loki returns to the MCU time and again; his brand of villainy looks like it can be reasoned with. Even if he betrays Thor again, again, and again.Film Appearances:&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;(2011), The Avengers (2012),&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World (2013), and&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok (2017), though he’s less a villain than a trickster — and even a bit of a hero — in the latter two.Tomatometer: Thor: 77%, The Avengers: 92%, Thor: The Dark World: 66%, Thor: Ragnarok: 92%Worldwide Box Office: Thor: $449.3 million, The Avengers: 1.52 million, Thor: The Dark World: $644.6 million, Thor: Ragnarok: $853.5 millionDestruction Factor: He seizes the throne of Asgard and almost murders Thor, then later precipitates the Battle of New York, which alerts the world to the presence of superpowered beings.Memorable Line: “You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.”Powers: God-level abilities and a snake-oil salesman’s tongue.Cosplay Cred: A perennial favorite, though his formal tux from Avengers was more popular in the wake of the film’s release.1. Joker (Heath Ledger)Ryan FujitaniIn an age when origins are required, Ledger’s Joker arrived on the scene without a name, place of birth, or a particular ambition. As Alfred (Michael Caine) put it, he just wants to see the world burn, and he even tells Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) as much late in the film. His complete lack of backstory and motivation makes him the most unpredictable, dangerous supervillain on this list, and the purity of his cruelty&nbsp;makes him the most fascinating.Film Appearances:&nbsp;The Dark Knight&nbsp;(2008)Tomatometer: 94%Worldwide Box Office: $1 billionDestruction Factor: Took out most of Gotham’s entrenched mafia, destroyed Harvey Dent, and made the Batman Gotham’s Number One criminal.Memorable Line: “Why so serious?”Powers: NoneCosplay Cred: Thanks to the alterations to the classic Joker look,&nbsp;Ledger’s Joker costume remains popular at cons and at Halloween.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Ovation, streaming, Christmas, teaser, hispanic, Trailer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-20-best-superhero-movie-villains"},{"id":"47613632648860","title":"Production Wraps on Roth’s \"Freedomland\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Production Wraps on Roth's \"Freedomland\"by Scott Weinberg | June 23, 2005 |  CommentsRevolution Studios issued a press release that ComingSoon.net was kind enough to publicize, and here’s the scoop: The Joe Roth mystery thriller \"Freedlomland,\" which is based on the novel by screenwriter/author Richard Price (\"Sea of Love,\" \"The Color of Money,\" \"Clockers,\" and several others), has finished production and inched one step closer to your multiplex lobby.Described as \"a highly-charged and gritty mystery of a car hijacking, a missing child and a neighborhood torn asunder,\" the film stars Samuel L.

In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all.&nbsp;In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series,&nbsp;director Danny Boyle recalls shooting London’s loneliest landmarks and resurrecting zombies for a new century.VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLThe Movie:&nbsp;28 Days Later (2003)  87%28 Days Later, directed by Danny Boyle from an Alex Garland script&nbsp;about humans mutated into speedy zombies by virus infection, was an inflection point for horror movies. The underground hit made&nbsp;over $80 million&nbsp;worldwide, and signaled a shift away from post-Scream teen slashers of the late ’90s and earl 2000s, and showed studios that audiences all over have were seeking horror flicks that bit harder. The film&nbsp;was shot with digital cameras, just above consumer-level grade, giving survivor Jim (Cillian Murphy) and his journey across&nbsp;a newly deserted England a rush of post-apocalyptic immediacy. This was when shooting on film was still the norm, so grimy, tethered footage felt like a glimpse into a new world. And it was a horrific, and horrifically effective world that Boyle created.Danny Boyle on the set of 28 Days Later. (Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox)“We made this film about social rage.”“We had this idea that the film is shot by somebody finding a camera in the debris that’s littered, because everybody’s gone. The s–t that’s left behind would be these consumer cameras, which were everywhere at the time. They’ve been replaced by phones now. We made this film about what we called, at the time, social rage. A big thing was road rage, this kind of intolerance, particularly in cities, of each other. People attacking people in other cars because somebody had cut them off in traffic. And the social intolerances of your fellow citizen, felt like it was almost in crisis proportions. And then 9/11 happened.”“People changed the film and made it about how vulnerable cities were.”“I think what happened is that because we were one of the first films to come out after 9/11, people changed the film and made it about how vulnerable cities were. Previously, cities felt massive and growing and powerful and invincible and answerable to no one. It was prosperous, and people were confident. Suddenly, cities felt incredibly vulnerable. [That’s why 28 Days Later‘s] emptiness of London, of the London streets, caught on as an image. Like New York or San Francisco or Tokyo, famous sites, emptied of people. They felt delicate, like they’d lost.”Murphy as Jim, waking to a new empty world. (Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox)The Moment: “Hello?!”After a brutal opening&nbsp;that sees environmental extremists letting loose rage-virus–infected chimps on the populace, Boyle allows the film to simmer as hero Jim awakens in the hospital after a road accident. In his teal medical gown, Jim wanders the smashed corridors left in disarray, wired telephones swaying against the walls, and then out into the startlingly de-populated London metropolis. The first empty landmark Jim traverses is the Westminster Bridge, which has become&nbsp;28 Days Later‘s&nbsp;signature shot, probably also due to the fact you get Parliament palace clearly in the background.&nbsp;Then Jim&nbsp;yells into the air that simple and powerful word which connects people across different languages, now rendered deaf and empty: “Hello?!”&nbsp;&nbsp;Students stopped traffic so that Boyle could capture Murphy in an empty-looking London. (Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. )“We hired a lot of students, because they’re cheap, to be our traffic marshals.”“We were going to call this film at one point, Hello. But it sends the complete wrong signal. [Laughing.]&nbsp;One of the technical advantages of using these smaller cameras is that you could shoot a location, not multiple times, but you could shoot it from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Cillian was in no rush, he could just walk across. But you don’t get much time at these locations free of people even at four o’clock in the morning when we shot. So what happened was we hired a lot of students, because they’re cheap, to be our traffic marshals.”“It tends to be quite angry men driving around London at four&nbsp;in the morning.”“My daughter – who was 18 I think – came along and she brought some of her friends and they’re quite glamorous girls. The sun was up and it was mid-summer and they’re all wearing short skirts or shorts. And it worked in our favor because – it’s very sexist to say it – but it tends to be quite angry men driving around London at four o’clock in the morning. So they were stopped. And it wasn’t me stopping them, to whom they would say ‘F–k you!’ and drive straight through. It was these lot of lovely girls, students who were saying, ‘Hey, hello. Good morning. We’re making a movie here. Do you mind waiting for two minutes?’ ‘No problem, darling. I’ll wait here. What’s your name?’ And so every day we hired more and more of these girls to block the traffic. And there’s not a moment of CG in it, where we took out vehicles or anything like that.”The shot became the defining image of the film. (Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox)“It’s become a poetic or artistic response to the 9/11 apocalypse.”“[In the sequence, Jim visits Horse Guards Palace and the Duke of York steps, eventually arriving at Piccadilly Circus, a typically bustling commercial square.] The reason we went to Piccadilly Circus was there’s a statue there of Eros firing the arrow of love. There was scaffolding all around it. They were fixing it. We wanted all the monuments, all of the famous places to look perfect. It was just the fact that there were no people around that was wrong. So we came up with this idea. We had this lovely woman&nbsp;spend months making all these notices on these boards. ‘Have you seen this person?’ ‘I will wait here for you.’ We went there on the day, clipped the boards onto the scaffolding. Jim walks up there and realizes the older people have gone and before they’d gone, they’ve tried to find each other and they’ve gone too. They’ve all gone. And then, of course, 9/11 happened. People put notices trying to get hold of people, and it’s very moving. It’s actually a very moving thing that we do in a time of crisis. [Our Piccadilly solution] was a response to something that wasn’t ideal for, but became something that fueled our story more and more. In a way, it’s become a poetic or artistic response to the 9/11 apocalypse.”The Impact:&nbsp;Zombies Ate My Movies!28 Days Later&nbsp;demonstrated that not only was there going to be a future for digital, it was going to be&nbsp;the&nbsp;future.&nbsp;28 Days Later‘s most famous sequence was cobbled together from different and hasty angles, something that would’ve been impossible with set-up heavy film cameras. This led the way for found footage horror to go mainstream (think&nbsp;Paranormal Activity,&nbsp;[rec],&nbsp;Chronicle), a necessary response to voyeurism in the age of internet and YouTube. How fitting a roundabout tribute to&nbsp;28 Days Later&nbsp;then, that we describe popular videos like an unstoppable infection, as viral.Within the world of horror, by the end of the ’80s, slashers and sequelitis had dragged the genre down into the creative doldrums. (The Sixth Sense, Scream, and The Blair Witch Project gave some late-decade sparks of life.) Zombies at the movies in particular had turned into a shuffling, shambling joke. But they lived on in another medium: Video games, especially the far-reaching Resident Evil series, which had inspired writer Garland.&nbsp;The success of&nbsp;28 Days Later&nbsp;made zombies a hot monster ticket in film, with the&nbsp;Resident Evil&nbsp;movies,&nbsp;Shaun of the Dead, the&nbsp;Dawn of the Dead&nbsp;remake, and the return of genre grandmaster George A. Romero’s&nbsp;Land of the Dead&nbsp;following immediately.Boyle’s movie rejuvenated the zombie genre. (Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox)“Alex instinctively sensed that the genre was ready for a kind of reboot.”“I didn’t do any research into zombie movies. I mean, I knew a few, like anybody who loves movies. Alex [Garland] was a real zombie fan…[and] rightly, instinctively sensed that the genre was ready for a kind of reboot. And I thought, ‘That’ll be good for me,’ and Alex to come at it from different perspectives like that. I didn’t feel I was making a genre film. So I came at it like that. He came at it like that. And that was a great combination… It’s been amazing since then, the way that&nbsp;The Walking Dead&nbsp;and other other movies have obviously taken advantage of that re-interest in the genre.”28 Days Later…&nbsp;was released on June 27, 2003.

He was 57 years old. The Italian-American actor with droopy eyes who stood over 6’5\" tall was best known for playing ghoulish-looking characters, most recently appearing in films like \"Baadasssss!,\" \"Tomorrow Never Dies,\" and \"Death to Smoochy.\" He is known for acting in numerous Milos Forman films, including \"Man on the Moon,\" \"The People vs. Larry Flynt,\" \"Valmont,\" \"Amadeus,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,\" and \"Taking Off.\" In recent years, Schiavelli focused his career on Italian film and theater projects and lived in Polizzi Generosa, Sicily.In addition to making an indelible mark on film and television audiences with his memorably macabre visage, Schiavelli was chosen in 1997 by Vanity Fair as one of America’s best character actors. The New York-born thespian attended acting school at NYU, was fluent in Sicilian, and was awarded the James Beard Journalism Award in 2001 for his work as a food writer, with articles published in magazines and newspapers.Schiavelli’s other notable film appearances include \"Ghost,\" \"Batman Returns,\" \"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,\" and \"Fast Times At Ridgemont High.\" His over 50 television credits include roles on \"Starsky and Hutch,\" \"Taxi,\" \"Cagney &amp; Lacey,\" and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"CW, Kaling, Mirror, transformers, News, Spring, video, movies, Universal, TIFF, 2021","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"vincent-schiavelli-passes-at-57"},{"id":"47613600079500","title":"What To Watch During TCM’s Trailblazing Women","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})What To Watch During TCM's Trailblazing Womenby Marya E. Gates | September 30, 2015 |  CommentsThis October,&nbsp;&nbsp;in partnership with Women in Film Los Angeles, Turner Classic Movies will be showcasing&nbsp;films directed by women in their primetime slots on Tuesdays and Thursdays as part of a three-year programming initiative to raise awareness of&nbsp;the history of women in film working behind the camera. We’ve picked one film from each programming block that we think is essential viewing.Lois Weber – The Blot (1921)  100%Lois Weber directed over 100 shorts and feature films in a career that stretched over three decades and is credited with pioneering many techniques, including using&nbsp;split screen to show simultaneous action. Her 1921 film The Blot tells the story of the impoverished Griggs family, whose patriarch — a law professor — can barely support his family while teaching spoiled rich kids.Airing on:&nbsp;October&nbsp;1 at 7:15 p.m. PT / 10:15 p.m. ETDorothy Arzner – Dance, Girl, Dance (1940)  83%Dorothy Arzner worked in the film industry for over thirty years, moving&nbsp;from a script typist to film editor before&nbsp;making her directorial debut in 1927 with The Wild Party&nbsp;(during which she invented the earlier version of the boom mic). Her penultimate feature film, Dance, Girl Dance, features one of Lucille Ball’s most acclaimed performances. Ball places a dancer named Bubbles who rises to fame as a burlesque dancer, while her friend Judy (Maureen O’Hara) struggles to become a ballerina. Notable for its frank discussion of gender politics (a theme throughout Arzner’s directorial filmography), the film was not a financial success in its initial release, but was reassessed in the 1970s for its feminist subject matter.Airing on:&nbsp;October 6 at 5 p.m. PT / 8:00 p.m. ETBarbara Loden&nbsp;– Wanda (1971)  92%The only film of writer, director, and actress Barbara Loden, Wanda was an independent feature. Shot with a crew of just four people, including Loden,&nbsp;Wanda&nbsp;opened in limited release in 1971, and although it did well in Europe, it languished in relative obscurity&nbsp;until it was released in France in 2003. A semi-autobiographical film inspired by an article Loden read about a woman who thanked a&nbsp;judge for sentencing her to prison, Wanda follows its titular heroine as her husband takes custody of their kids and she becomes involved with a bank robber. There’s a great interview with the director on the Mike Douglas Show where she&nbsp;discusses what drove her to tell this story and why she insisted on directing it herself. Loden, unfortunately, died before she completed another film.Airing on:&nbsp;October 8 at 5 p.m. PT / 8:00 p.m. ETEuzhan Palcy&nbsp;– A Dry White Season (1989)  81%Marlon Brando hadn’t made a film in nearly a decade before appearing in A Dry White Season, director Euzhan Palcy’s second feature film. Notable for being the first feature film directed by a black woman and produced by a major Hollywood studio (MGM), the film is set in South Africa in 1976 during apartheid. Although it&nbsp;received mixed reviews, Brando earned&nbsp;an Oscar nomination for his performance.Airing on:&nbsp;October 13 at 8:45 p.m. PT / 11:45 p.m. ETShirley Clarke&nbsp;– Portrait of Jason (1967)  100%Shot in 12 straight hours by avant-garde filmmaker Shirley Clarke, Portrait of Jason focuses on hustler and aspiring cabaret entertainer&nbsp;Jason Holliday. One of several films Clarke shot in the Chelsea Hotel, the film uses&nbsp;cinéma vérité techniques, prodding and provoking Holliday to tell his troubled life story. Recently restored by Milestone Films, it remains a unique and fascinating piece of documentary cinema.Airing on:&nbsp;October 15 at 9:45 p.m. PT / 12:45 a.m. ETPenny Marshall&nbsp;– A League of Their Own (1992)  79%Fresh off the success of her Best Picture-nominated film Awakenings, Penny Marshall amassed an extraordinary ensemble cast of women, including Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Anne Ramsay, Megan Cavanagh, Rosie O’Donnell and Madonna, to star as the ballplayers in this fictionalized account of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.&nbsp;A League of Their Own focuses on sisters Dottie (Davis) and Kit (Petty), who are recruited to play for the Rockford Peaches as part of the newly-established AAGPBL, which was established during WWII when it seemed&nbsp;Major League Baseball&nbsp;might shut down for good.&nbsp;Throw in Tom Hanks as the coach —&nbsp;who had previously worked with Marshall in Big — and “There’s no crying in baseball!,” and the result is an iconic film that still resonates with viewers two decades later.Airing on: October 20 at 5 p.m. PT / 8:00 p.m. ETLeslie Harris – Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. (1993)  67%Like Barbara Loden, Leslie Harris only made one feature film (so far), but also like Loden, that one film is about a young woman whose story Harris was in a unique position to tell. Just Another Girl On The I.R.T. follows&nbsp;Chantel Mitchell (Ariyan A. Johnson), an A-student living in Brooklyn whose plans for her future start to crumble when she discovers she’s pregnant. While the story may seem familiar, Chantel is the kind of heroine we don’t often see in mainstream films and one whose voice is still struggling to be heard today.Airing on:&nbsp;October 22 8:45 p.m. PT / 11:45 p.m. ETMira Nair – Salaam Bombay! (1988)  93%Indian-born Mira Nair discovered her love for filmmaking while studying at Harvard University, where she began to make documentaries on Indian culture. Nair collaborated with her friend&nbsp;Sooni Taraporevala&nbsp;on the screenplay for Salaam Bombay!, which features actual street children from Bombay. The story focuses on Krishna (Shafiq Syed), who is put out of his home by his mother after he sets fire to his brother’s bicycle and is told he cannot return until he earns enough money to replace it.Airing on:&nbsp;October 27 at 8:15 p.m. PT / 11:15 p.m. ETJulie Taymor&nbsp;– Frida (2002)  75%After a twenty-year struggle, producers&nbsp;Nancy Hardin (who optioned the rights in 1983) and Salma Hayek (who signed on in 1997) finally saw their film vision of the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo become a reality under the helm of Julie Taymor. Taymor, who worked mostly in theater, had only directed one film previous to Frida, the 1999 Shakespearean adaptation&nbsp;Titus.&nbsp;Hayek’s performance in the film, which traces Kahlo’s turbulent life from age 18 until her death, received rave reviews and and earned her a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars.Airing on:&nbsp;October 29 at 12:45 a.m. PT / 3:45 a.m. ETTrailblazing Women airs every Tuesday and Thursday in October.

Raymond (Chris Tashima), a middle-aged Asian American Studies professor, finds a soulmate in Aurora (Allison Sie), the daughter of Irish and Japanese parents, but can’t make peace with the incongruities she so easily abides, such as her father’s prejudices or the injustices her ancestors endured during the Japanese American internment.Byler doesn’t shrink from the complexities of the issues he raises and elicits genuine humor and emotion from his accomplished cast. It’s clear, as someone of mixed heritage, he’s had experience navigating feelings of alienation and belonging. To his credit, he draws his characters in measured tones and manages to craft a narrative rich in human frailties and strengths.\"Americanese\" was honored twice at South by Southwest, receiving both a Special Jury Prize for Outstanding Ensemble Cast as well as the Audience Award for Narrative Feature.\"Jam,\" the feature length documentary directed by Mark Woollen, plunges headlong into the world of roller derby, a sport that achieved notoriety and a recent revival in the Bay Area. Filmed over seven years, Woolen follows the efforts of colorful athletes and league organizers who put their money and bodies on the line in a go-for-broke attempt to reestablish the American Roller Derby League.Unimaginable drama unfolds as sinister figures, aftershocks of the AIDS epidemic, and dotcom mania propels the story forward. Woollen skillfully rides the peaks and valleys, crafting a film that feels at times like a mockumentary filled with actors who easily slide into character.

Fifteen years after its release on October 3, 2003, it remains a cherished early ’00s comedy: it’s a fixture on cable TV, has inspired hordes of kids to pick up instruments, and is currently blowing down doors with its stage musical adaptation across the U.K., the U.S., and Australia.Why do people keep going back to School of Rock for an encore? Here are five reasons we think Linklater’s most family-friendly flick has endured.1. IT TAPPED INTO JACK BLACK’S STAR POWERThroughout the ’90s and ’00s, Jack Black was a rising star known for his bit parts as exuberant stoners in the likes of X-Files, Saving Silverman, and Tenacious D: The Complete Master Works, the HBO series about his two-man rock band. (Deep cut: he was also the highlight of the not-great horror sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.) Black gained big notice with High Fidelity, then stumbled with his first big lead role in the problematic Shallow Hal, but it wasn’t until his role in School of Rock that he carved his place out as a movie star.Black, a rocker himself and wildly passionate metal head, was Dewey Finn, a down-and-out wannabe rocker who brought his desperation and love of music to a class of sheltered, classically trained private-school fourth graders. Passion and drive made his character’s journey from “schmo conning his way to a quick buck” to a genuinely valued teacher and mentor feel authentic and sincere. As Robert Ebert wrote in his review, “[Black] make’s Dewey’s personality not a plot gimmick, but a way of life.”Soon after School of Rock, Black scored a major role in King Kong, top billing for Nacho Libre, and would lead the voice cast of the juggernaut Kung Fu Panda series. Nearly all of his best roles capture his –&nbsp;and Dewey’s –&nbsp;unique brand: a passionate lover of the arts and an outsider determined to break in, no matter what.2. THERE’S A GREAT TRUE STORY BEHIND IT (OR MAYBE THERE ISN’T)School of Rock isn’t credited as based on a true story, but reports at the time revealed that VH-1 (owned by Viacom, which owns Paramount, which produced the movie) once filmed the Paul Green School of Rock for a reality series that would never make air. Green, a manic and charismatic music instructor, teaches kids aged 12 to 18 to play ’60s and ’70s era rock. Although School of Rock screenwriter Mike White says he had never seen the reality series Rock School, or heard of the school, Green and his students noticed quite a few similarities between his own persona and Black’s Dewey Finn. There may have been some grumblings at the time, but Green acknowledged that with School of Rock‘s release, his real-life school saw a spike in enrollees.Whether the movie is based on Paul Green’s School of Rock or not, the same principles of that school –harnessing the power of creativity, engaging kids through music, and teaching them to dream in ways they never knew they could –&nbsp;are the same sweet chords that make School of Rock a toe-tappin’, and heart-tugging, showstopper.3. JOAN CUSACK IS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN – WHICH MEANS WE DO, TOOAfter a stream of scene-stealing successes with Grosse Pointe Blank, Runaway Bride, Toy Story 2, and High Fidelity, Joan Cusack gave arguably her quirkiest and most enjoyable performance yet in School of Rock as Principal Rosalie Mullins, the very definition of anal retentiveness. Every aspect of her performance highlights her stress and anxiety – the hand-wringing, the facial twitches, the rigid posture, and the super deliberate speaking style. When she shakes all that off, it’s a great moment. In one of the movie’s defining scenes, Dewey unearths Mullins’ love of Stevie Nicks, and gets her to drunkenly dance to “Edge of Seventeen” – something she clearly hasn’t done in ages –&nbsp;and embrace the sweet, sweet sound of rock.Cusack’s run of successes continued with a storied voice-acting career in the Toy Story series, Arthur Christmas, and a great role in Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping.4. IT GAVE MANY THEIR FIRST BIG TASTE OF SARAH SILVERMAN(Photo by © Paramount)Silverman was already a stand-up star by the early ’00s, but most mainstream moviegoers had to wait until Evolution and School of Rock to discover her sizzling brand of funny on the big screen. Her Patty Di Marco is the movie’s voice of hilarious practicality –&nbsp;you’ll never succeed in the world of rock, abandon your dreams for the easy and attainable, etc. etc. If Dewey Finn’s credo is to “stick it to the Man,” Patty is the very manifestation of “the Man.”5. THOSE RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED KIDS (WHO ARE&nbsp;SO&nbsp;FREAKING GROWN UP NOW)It wouldn’t be much of a school without students to rock, and School of Rock‘s young cast was electric, each imbuing their characters with as much depth and heart as talent (which was real by the way – they all sang and played their own instruments).And those child actors have gone far since graduation. Bossy Summer Hathaway – a.k.a Miranda Cosgrove –&nbsp;played Carly on the iCarly TV show, has released her own music, and is the voice of Margo in the Despicable Me series. Joey Gaydos Jr. (Zack) went on to become a guitarist for a Michigan-based rock band. Kevin Clark (Freddy) plays for the band Robbie Gold. Rebecca Brown (Katie) is a YouTube star and sings for her band, the Brothers Star Race. Robert Tsai (Lawrence) sings, dances, plays piano, and teaches.School of Rock was released on October 3, 2003.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Stephen, Fall, Warner, romance, Bros., jurassic, One, Go, show, Toys, Infographic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"fifteen-years-later-school-of-rock-still-earns-a-big-rocking-a"},{"id":"47613584727685","title":"Lions Gate Digs Into \"The Descent\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Lions Gate Digs Into \"The Descent\"by Scott Weinberg | June 24, 2005 |  CommentsNeil Marshall, director of the resoundingly popular cult flick \"Dog Soldiers,\" has struck a deal with Lions Gate to distribute his next movie in North America, says Variety.

More to the point, the president of National Geographic Feature Films is looking to acquire films that he feels would be a good fit for the company.\"I’m here to see the filmmakers, meet people, and acquire a movie that might be right for us,\" he said.National Geographic scored a major coup when, at the 2005 Sundance fest, it partnered with Warner Independent Pictures to acquire \"March of the Penguins,\" a commercial and critical hit last year, grossing $77 million in the U.S.Lepzig said he attends a few festivals each year, including Sundance, Toronto and Berlin. But when he goes to a festival, he’s there for business first and foremost.\"I’m very judicious about what I choose to go to,\" he said. \"I don’t do the party thing. I’m here to work.\"There are three Sundances,\" he said. There are the cinephiles, the dealmakers, and the partygoers. It’s hard to do all three at the same time.\"It’s not uncommon to leave a festival without buying a film, Lepzig said. But some of the company’s acquisitions at festivals have paid off handsomely.At the 2003 Toronto Film Festival National Geographic partnered with ThinkFilm to distribute \"The Story of the Weeping Camel,\" a tale of nomadic shepherds who enlist the help of a musician to mend familial relations between one of their camels and her newborn calf.Lepzig said he was very pleased with the performance of \"Weeping Camel,\" a Mongolian language film that grossed $1.7 million at the U.S. box office.However, what \"March of the Penguins\" achieved was beyond all expectations. National Geographic hoped it would do as well as \"Winged Migration,\" another excellent French bird doc that grossed $11 million.\"We believed it could reach a wide audience,\" he said. \"But we were all stunned.

He’s also contributed to the writing of Toy Story, A Bug’s Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and WALL-E. He’ll next be involved in an adaptation of John Carter of Mars which will mix live action with animation.Andrew Stanton:I had to trick the guys here to get the project going. After we finished Finding Nemo and I came back from vacation – you’re basically under-the-radar and no-one’s paying attention to you here at that point – with three storyboard artists I secretly boarded the first act of WALL-E, because I felt that if I even tried to talk about it with people here, or how it should work, I wouldn’t be able to do get it across. I felt I had to prove it to them and they’ll either say, “Yes you can do it,” or “No you can’t,” and we won’t waste any time. And that’s how this movie got the green light.Derek Thompson joined Pixar in January 2005 to work on WALL-E. Prior to his involvement with the company he spent 14 years working in comic books, illustration, video games and live action features.Derek Thompson:For WALL-E we faced a number of distinct challenges separate from other projects here. One of the biggest ones was the fact that most of the movie had no dialogue. As storyboarding artists a lot of the burden fell on us to try and convey a lot of character and emotion and nuts-and-bolts storytelling without the benefit of lots of dialogue.David DeVan is an animator at Pixar and has been with the company since A Bug’s Life, working on Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille before WALL-E.David DeVan:We looked a lot at Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin – old silent film. It was treated more like we were making a semi-silent film for much of the movie. We all watched The General one day at lunch, they screened it for us. It’s really amazingly affective – piece by piece it works, but when you see it all together you really feel those references.Andrew Stanton:We also looked at lots of movies that did that so well – 2001, The Black Stallion, Never Cry Wolf – and those are movies where a large portion of them are dialogue-free or not dialogue-dependent. But we found that most great movies have elements like that so it’s not that foreign a moviemaking technique, it’s just one of those things that if you talk about it, people can convince themselves that it won’t work, or they won’t go and see something like that.David DeVan:Talking is so prevalent in all animated movies, as it is in ours as well, and it was a big challenge to complete abandon that device. WALL-E has to be so charming that you fall in love with him without dialogue.Lindsay Collins is a co-producer on WALL-E and has worked at Pixar, in various capacities, since 1997. Prior to joining the company she worked on Disney features including Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules.Lindsay Collins:So much of the emotion and the feeling and the connection from the audience is going to be individual to a degree – and that was the point. How do you get the audience to be emotionally invested in the journey? Maybe some of it is by not being told what’s happening all the time.Andrew Stanton:To me the best movies and the best movie moments draw you in. People want to work for the meal, they just don’t want to know that they’re doing it. So your job as a filmmaker is to seduce them and entertain them so much that they don’t realise that they’re working so hard with their brains saying, “Well, this plus this equals this.”Rodrigo Blaas has been animating for Pixar since 2002, having previously worked with Blue Sky Studios on their hit Ice Age. He started with Finding Nemo and has since worked on The Incredibles, Cars and Ratatouille.Rodrigo Blaas:The other challenge with WALL-E and EVE is that they don’t have faces that you can move around a bunch. Their design is so simplified – with EVE you have two blue dots that you need to use to explore the full range of emotions that a human face can give you. But that’s why detail is really important, because all of it works together. It’s also about trying to keep the integral part of the character and not taking the easy way out of trying to mimic human expressions and all that. You build from that but you try to keep it in character for WALL-E and EVE. WALL-E is a robot who’s been on the planet for a long time and he’s rusty and all that. EVE is this new machine. You have to be true to those characters in the animation.Angus MacLane has been working at Pixar since 1997. A directing animator on WALL-E, MacLane won an Annie for his work on The Incredibles and supervised the animation on Oscar-nominated short One Man Band.Angus MacLane:The design sensibilities are that everything about WALL-E is on the outside and he’s kind-of like this old bulldozer or something. He has this kind-of steel with yellow enamel paint that’s been chipped away. There’s a very relatable, tactile, construction machinery sense about him. EVE, by contrast, has all of her moving parts on the inside, and you see indications of that in the shoulders and the armpits. When you see the arm unfold you get a glimpse of the mechanism, of how she works, and that gives relatability to her. She could easily look too computery-soft. We tried to make that aspect work.Derek Thompson:WALL-E was doubly interesting because it was probably closest to a bridge between live action film and animated film that Pixar has ever attempted. Live action footage has been integrated into the film and that had ripple effects throughout the production. Those choices created a texture for the world that had to be much more anchored in reality because when the live action came it in had to make sense with world. Hopefully that stuff works OK and doesn’t feel too jarring. But it was definitely exciting to involve in that.Jim Morris moved over from ILM in 2005 to help make WALL-E. In the past he’s worked on films such as Men in Black, Schindler’s List and Terminator 2 at ILM.Jim Morris:One thing that was exciting for me and was a nice fit for me was that Andrew had such a photographic idea in mind for approaching this. He wanted to, as he put it, get out of Andy’s back yard and bring a photographic convention so that it had a feeling it was filmed rather than recorded on a computer. That was a nice connectivity for me since I’d obviously spent a lot of time trying to fit computer graphics into live action movies. It was nice to be able to be involved in that.Rodrigo Blaas:WALL-E is the character who’s going to take you through the journey of the story and that world so you really need to relate to that character for him to take you over and get you hooked into seeing what’s happening next. That’s what Andrew really wanted to achieve – seeing how far he could go with one character and trying to discover a world through his eyes without reverting to the normal devices of delivering exposition or talking to another character. His friendship with the cockroach too, all of those are little details that makes that first part of the movie a special one.Derek Thompson:To give you an idea of the way the film evolved during the process, the gel guys in Lifted – the short that opened with Ratatouille – I think there was a little cross-purpose there with WALL-E, because originally the humans in the film were actually aliens that spoke an alien language and there were all these other things happening. It wasn’t until midway through that we realised that things needed to change and it needed to be us in the future. The notion of us being stranded on a cruise ship and everything else snapped into place and it felt that it had to be that way. In drawing terms, every six or seven months we would have a new version of the boards for evaluation. A tremendous amount of drawing went into making that revision. It actually began as more of a Spartacus movie, with WALL-E helping the robots stage an uprising against alien enslavement. It’s changed quite a bit since then!Andrew Stanton:We arrived at the romance much later than the original concept. The sad, lonely robot was there from the conception. The character sat around for ten years and then, as I was writing on Nemo, especially during rewrites, I would beg for time at my office, throw pencils at the ceiling and procrastinate and I suddenly thought of this character.Angus MacLane:They’re designed to be opposites – she’s a circle and he’s a square. They are very much of the worlds that they’re from. She’s from this streamlined future and he’s from this dirty past. Everything is encapsulated between those two worlds. They spent some time in each world and eventually they meet and their worlds meet at the same time, and that’s broad enough that it could be read to be a symbol of their union or that those worlds collide.Andrew Stanton:I listen to a lot of soundtrack music and I remember I had Goldsmith’s Star Trek: The Motion Picture score going. It just made sense to me – what’s the opposite of loneliness? It’s love. It’s the point of living. Suddenly the only way to tell the story was to make it a love story.Ben Burtt is an award winning Sound Designer whose iconic work on the likes of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and ET has been celebrated by audiences for years. WALL-E marks his first collaboration with Pixar.Ben Burtt:For me the challenges with WALL-E go back to R2-D2 and problems I faced a long time ago – How do you get the human element into it without making it too human? How do you get the machine element into it without being too cold and impersonal? It’s a sort-of 50/50 blend.Andrew Stanton:I knew I needed Ben Burtt immediately, as soon as I got serious about it. I knew I needed to get a sound guy in right at the beginning of the production and I kept saying, “Like Ben Burtt, like Ben Burtt, like Ben Burtt, like R2, like R2, like R2.” Fortunately Jim Morris, my producer, had just come over from ILM and he’s got the golden rolodex and he just said, “Why don’t we just get Ben Burtt to come over?” I’d never thought of it! He’s sort-of like that about anyone I talk about…Ben Burtt:The fun of being a sound designer is always to create a world of sound and, especially if it’s a science-fiction movie, you get the challenge of really creating a whole world because most of the sounds you hear in the movie – from the ambiences, to the motors of the robots, to, in this film, the characters themselves – have to be created. You get to invent something that hasn’t been heard before to some extent, it seems original, yet it has to be familiar enough that people know what it means. There’s almost that contradiction in the challenge for sound.Andrew Stanton:When Ben came over I pitched him what was probably a half-assed version of the movie at that point, and I said to him, “I really need you to be 80% of the cast.” I wouldn’t blame him if he’d said, “I’ve spent twenty years of my life making robots, I’m not into it anymore.” Fortunately I think he was seduced by the idea and the challenge of coming up with so many R2s and how to differentiate them. It really was a long process of discovery.Ben Burtt:Andrew, in the very beginning, wanted to convince the audience that the characters of EVE and WALL-E were machines, so they had to sound like machines. It’s not so difficult to, say, create a talking machine, but usually they’re lifeless – there’s no soul to it. It’s a matter of coming up with a way of doing voices and collecting an array of sounds – of motors and other things – such that you give a character a sense of being alive; a soul, so to speak.Rodrigo Blaas:The clarity of ideas is the most important thing. When you have the challenge of animating a character that doesn’t talk and is just expressing through sound effects, every move he does you really hammer into it and try to make the audience understand exactly what he’s trying to do. All those little gestures and the moves with the head and the arms was so important because everything had to be really clear.Andrew Stanton:The end result is that it’s exactly the film I wanted to make. I just closed my eyes and took a gamble and hoped that the rest of the world would want to see it as well, because I was just getting sick of everything and I just wanted something different. I think there’s something underestimated about wonder. It’s a hard thing to quantify, but to me that’s the ingredient. If I look back at all of these movies that run an incredible gamut of genres and ratings, the ones that stick with me are the ones that tap into the wondrous response that I had either as a kid or a young adult. I think a lot of us here at Pixar are junkies for that – we want to recapture it for ourselves as much as our audience.WALL-E Week on RT and IGNRT – Pixar’s and Stars’ Favourite WALL-E MomentsSigourney Weaver, Angus MacLane, Ben Burtt, Jim Morris and Andrew Stanton share their most memorable moments from the film.IGN – WALL-E ExplainedGet an insight into the animation process as WALL-E Directing Animator Angus MacLane.RT – Inside Pixar – A Photo TourRotten Tomatoes’ cameras are given a look inside animation mecca as Pixar opens the doors of its Emeryville, CA campus to us.IGN – The Pixar PhilosophyKey WALL-E staff including Andrew Stanton, David DeVan and Derek Thompson tell IGN what it’s like to work at Pixar.RT – The World of WALL-ETo celebrate RT’s freshest film of the year, we bring together eight WALL-E crew to talk about the film’s journey from concept to completion.IGN – At the Heart of WALL-EDirector Andrew Stanton explains, in his own words, why the WALL-E experience has been a special one and how he crafted the film.RT – The Storyboards of WALL-EStory Artist Derek Thompson gives RT readers an exclusive look at the storyboarding process on the film and shares some boards.IGN – WALL-E UK ReviewCritic Anna Smith delivers her verdict on Pixar’s latest and adds to the film’s fresh Tomatometer…RT – Ben Burtt’s WALL-E Sound MasterclassThe world’s most renowned Sound Designer exclusively teaches RT readers the basics of building WALL-E‘s world of sound.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"elm, FX","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"exclusive-the-world-of-walle"},{"id":"47613621095062","title":"Video Exclusive: Jamie Bell talks Hallam Foe, accents and Equus with RT","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Video Exclusive: Jamie Bell talks Hallam Foe, accents and Equus with RTRotten Tomatoes sits down with one of Britain's finest young talents to find out about his latest turn.by Joe Utichi | August 27, 2007 |  CommentsJamie Bell nabbed a BAFTA and a string of other awards for his debut performance, aged fourteen, in Billy Elliot.

We’re in a suite at New York’s Crosby hotel, presumably to do a press interview for Her, Jonze’s near-future romance between a man and his computer’s operating system. I hadn’t expected to find myself lying down, being examined by its director.Jonze produces a small bottle from the hotel bathroom, while I lay, arms folded, eyes closed. “This is a calming mist,” he says, spritzing and fanning its lavender contents around the bed. “How’s that feel?”Then, leaning in, with an almost subliminal whisper: “What’s your first question?”“My first question is… ” I pretend to snore, loudly. Jonze laughs.This isn’t a regular interview. But then, Spike Jonze isn’t exactly a regular guy. Scampering around the hotel suite in a tailored suit, button-up shirt and his signature skater sneakers, he’s more like an excitable 12-year-old eager to show off his latest project than the 44-year-old director of Being John Malkovich, Adaptation and Where the Wild Things Are. It’s one of the keys to Her‘s success: as sincere and serious as the emotions threaten to get, the movie’s also infused with the sensibility of the guy who co-created Jackass and directed music videos for the Beastie Boys.Jonze doesn’t like to do video interviews. It’s a relief to us both.I’m glad you hate video interviews. They’re the worst.Jonze: [Laughs.] You don’t get to lay down on a bed in a video interview.You get to look paralyzed as a bright light burns out your eyes. And it’s like, “Hey, boxers or briefs, Spike Jonze?! Can you give me a high five?!”Jonze: I did it on Being John Malkovich and I don’t think I said anything. I don’t think I said anything at all. I don’t know; I was too self-conscious.Jonze takes out his iPhone and snaps a picture. I’m still lying on the bed, the diffuse light of New York fall mingling with the traces of lavender mist. I’m reminded immediately of a scene in Her.One of my favorite shots in the film is when Joaquin Phoenix is lying on the bed staring into the swirling dust particles, and “Samantha” is talking about disappearing into the spaces between. It’s a such a perfect synthesis of sound and image. What inspires something like that moment?Jonze: Thanks. I don’t know, I can’t because it’s hard… I’m hesitant to wanna explain that much stuff. But I can say, one of the things that I think is worth talking about — or maybe it’s not even worth talking about — but at least for me seemed important to talk about, in terms of the movie, is I think that, you know, something you said earlier in terms of our attachment to our devices; I think that the movie is, to me at least, like our relationship with technology is kind of the setting for the movie, as opposed to what the movie is necessarily about.I think that the movie, to me, is more about our relationship to each other, and our need for intimacy and connection, and the difficulties within ourselves that make that challenging — and the limitations within ourselves that prevent intimacy or connection; when it’s that thing we need, maybe the most. And I think those are timeless things. That kind of loneliness and longing and need for connection, and what connection means and what intimacy means to us. So I think that the parts that are about technology and the parts that are about the way we’re living in this modern world are sort of just the modern set of complications.Her is different in that, in many near-future films, technology has run amok or is dystopian in some form, and here technology is benign and user-friendly — even though it can cultivate loneliness. What’s your relationship to technology? Do you see it as a good thing as it progresses?Jonze: I don’t have a good answer for that ’cause I think it’s a complicated question, and I feel like those are the sort of questions the movie’s asking. I don’t feel like I have a good sound bite for that. [Laughs.] I made a movie about it. I spent three years making a movie about that.Let me ask you this then: Do you think high-waisted trousers for men are really gonna catch on?Jonze: [Laughs.] I tried them on, they were comfortable! I tried them on when we were doing fittings. I guess that, I don’t know… [A publicist’s phone rings; Jonze laughs, distracted.] I’m thinking about 20 different things now; that phone ringing, that building… yeah, I don’t have a good answer on the future. In terms of making a movie we were not trying to make a predictive movie about the future, we more let ourselves be free to create the future that we wanted to set the story in, and the future that felt right for this story.&nbsp;Something that struck me watching Her — and I don’t know if it’s a wild comparison or everyone’s already mentioned it — was its sense of alignment with Blade Runner; the near-future, faux-Eastern Los Angeles, the man in a relationship with an artificial lifeform, and one of the very first things the OS says to him: “Tell me, in a few words, everything about your mother.” They would make a great double-feature.Jonze: Do they ask about his mother in Blade Runner?In the very first interview in Blade Runner, the guy says to the replicant, “Tell me about your mother.”Jonze: Oh, wow! That’s interesting.Were there other movies on your mind making this, like other A.I. movies?Jonze: I mean there are definitely movies… I don’t know, as far as A.I. it wasn’t like, “Oh, I’m gonna make an A.I. movie,” it was more, again, those were ideas I was thinking about and am interested in.Did you ever see Electric Dreams?Jonze: No, but people have referenced it. It was in the last few months that I keep hearing about it because people have referenced that. Is Electric Dreams where the guy has a relationship with an artificial being?Not really. It’s more of an early generation desktop computer… I don’t remember what model.Jonze: So it’s a love story?It’s a love story between a guy and a girl but his computer becomes obsessed with the girl, too. It’s very sad, actually. And has a good Giorgio Moroder theme.Jonze: Oh cool. It sounds good.A friend of mine — upon seeing only the trailer to Her, mind you — said, “So, basically Spike Jonze has ripped off Electric Dreams.”Jonze: [Laughs.] That wasn’t very nice of your friend.That’s what I said: “You’ve only seen the trailer.”Jonze: Wow, harsh. Let’s call her right now. [Laughs.] What’s her name?Her name’s Phoebe.Jonze hits dial on my iPhone and switches it to speaker. A robotic female voice-mail service implores him to leave a message.Jonze: Hey Phoebe, this is Spike Jonze. We were just talking about your critique of the trailer to Her. I didn’t even see Electric Dreams, okay! It sounds like an interesting movie, though, but — come on! — cut me some slack. Gimme a chance. Anyway, hope all is good. Give us a call back. Luke, do you want to say anything?He’s not happy. The interview was going really well and you upset him.Jonze: I started crying.He flipped a table over.Jonze: I was inconsolable for five minutes!&nbsp;A beeping indicates a call is coming through.Jonze: Oh, this is her. Let’s get it. [He answers.] Hey, Phoebe?Phoebe: Hey, what’s up.Jonze: Ah, nothing. This is Spike Jonze. I’m sitting here with Luke and we’re doing an interview for a movie. [Beat of silence.] This is Spike. I’m here with your friend.Phoebe: [Laughs.] Hi… how are you!Jonze: We’re calling you to give you a hard time because you compared my movie to Electric Dreams.Phoebe: [Laughs.] I can’t believe you’re doing this!Jonze: I know! Luke threw you under the bus.Phoebe: I was giving you a really big compliment, because that’s one of my favorite movies.Jonze: Oh, he left that part out. Conveniently. I haven’t seen that movie, but Luke just described it to me and it sounds great. I just had to defend myself.Jonze proceeds to carry on a conversation for four or five minutes, inquiring about her work and how things are in the office. He’s genuinely curious; more at ease exploring a stranger’s life than discussing his own movie. They finally emerge from their chatter.Phoebe: And how’s your interview with Luke going?Jonze: Good! I already gave him a spritz of lavender spray that helped him relax.Phoebe: He can be a little uptight sometimes.Jonze: [Laughs.] He seems pretty mellow. Alright, I’ll let you get back to work. It was nice to meet you. Be well.The publicist comes in, telling us to wrap it up.Jonze: Sorry. We had to call Phoebe. I’m glad we got to call her. That made me feel better. [He stalls the publicist again.] Let’s wrap this. We need a conclusion to this article, don’t you think? Or did that feel like an ending?I didn’t get to ask you my stupid Hollywood Foreign Press question. [Adopting bad “Euro” accent.] Meeester Jonze, your film is called Her, were you making a statement on the female race?Jonze: [Laughs.] The female race!Can you explain the, how you say, origin of zis title?Jonze: Nobody’s every asked me that.Why the movie’s called Her?Jonze: No!Well I have a million theories.Jonze: And they’re all right. All million theories are right!.Did you think about putting periods between “H,” “E” and “R” because, like, it’s a movie about a com-pu-ter.?Jonze: [Laughs.] I should have consulted you.Her goes into wide release this week.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"NYCC, saw, on, Hulu, Globe, the","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"perchance-to-electric-dream-a-curious-chat-with-spike-jonze"},{"id":"47613639851679","title":"On DVD This Week: Game of Thrones, Finding Dory, Better Call Saul, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Game of Thrones, Finding Dory, Better Call Saul, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | November 14, 2016 |  CommentsThere’s a lot to look forward to on home video this week, from a couple of award-winning TV series and another Pixar animated hit&nbsp;to an acclaimed music doc, a bizarre Nicolas Cage movie, and a few classics from Criterion.

Recently the head editor of ComingSoon.net was required to visit the set of the new James Bond movie, \"Casino Royale,\" and interview ALL THREE of the new Bond babes. How the guy struggled through a conversation with Eva Green, Catarina Murino, and Ivana Milicevic I’ll never know. My eyeballs would have popped right out of my skull.CS: Catarina, what was your reaction when you learned that you were going to be a Bond Girl?Catarina Murino: I screamed and jumped up and down. I was making a movie in Sardinia, and it was the day of a war, and I was a soldier with a baby, looking like a boy with a beard. It was so strange. Everybody was asking, \"Are you sure the phone call was for you?\"CS: How have each of you been preparing to play your respective roles?Eva: Actually, I got the part about two weeks ago, but I’m working on the script. I’m quite cerebral, so I’m imagining each scene and working on the character. I haven’t read the novel and I’m reading it at the moment. I’m a bad student, but I’m about to read it. In a way, I just imagined this movie as an old-fashioned movie in a very good way, because [Vesper] is quite sassy and sharp, and the relationship is kind of unusual and very funny, but you’ll just have to wait and see. I’m working at the moment.Caterina: Everybody told me that I was preparing [to play a] Bond Girl. No way. I’m preparing a role, and that role is Solange. She’s not at all the classical Bond Girl that you know before. She’s somebody that’s very modern, but she’s married to a very bad man. The man is very bad with James Bond, and he’s very bad with me. She doesn’t have a very quiet life. I had to prepare my English and physically, I prepared because Solange loves to ride horses, so I rode a horse every day for a month. I had one of the best stuntmen in England for the horse.CS: That brings us to the most American of the new Bond girls. Ivana, can you tell us a bit about who you play in the movie?Ivana Milicevic: Well, I’m bad. I’m Le Chiffre’s girlfriend and I guess henchman, you could say his bodyguard. Usually, bad girls aren’t blonde, but look at me, I look angelic, and yet I’m not. We kind of were into that. I’m just always with Le Chiffre, taking care of him. I figure he saved me from post-war Croatia or maybe I saved him, I don’t know.And that’s just a taste of the chat.

And teleportation.Maddie Hasson (Twisted) stars as delinquent teen Henrietta Cole in the sci-fi series. When Henry is assaulted by her classmate Clay Boone (Tanner Stine), her deepest instincts kick in, and she flees by inadvertently bending space and time in a violent blink, landing in her bedroom.(Photo by Erin Keating)Discovering your superpowers is never an easy journey — ask Peter Parker or Clark Kent. But Henry’s path is even darker and more visceral than some of those fumbling-adolescent tales.Based on the novel by Stephen Gould, Impulse comes after Liman’s 2008 feature film Jumper, based on the first book in the series and starring Hayden Christensen and Jamie Bell. The film disappointed, which Liman admits, but 10-episode Impulse is different in some fundamental ways.The series, which debuted on Wednesday, also stars Sarah Desjardins as Henry’s stepsister-to-be Jenna Hope, Enuka Okuma as Deputy Anne Hulce, Craig Arnold as Clay’s brother Lucas Boone,&nbsp;Missi Pyle as Henry’s mom Cleo Cole, and&nbsp;Daniel Maslany as Henry’s biggest fan Townes Linderman.Rotten Tomatoes spoke to Liman about the new series, his remarkable leading lady, and how he finds inspiration in real-world action sequences YouTube users post.(Photo by Erin Keating)Debbie Day for Rotten Tomatoes: I’m so glad to talk to you about Impulse. It was not quite what I was expecting.Doug Liman: Good. That’s the best. I’d much prefer to hear that than the other.RT: I was most surprised by Maddie’s performance. She’s incredible. Could you tell me about casting her?Liman: We were holding auditions for the protagonist, the heroine, Henry. Maddie came in and just lit up the room. We all turned to each other and said, “She’s a huge star.” I said, “Too bad she’s not right for the part.” My producing partner said, “But she’s so amazing.” I said, “Yeah, she’s amazing, but she’s the opposite of what we’re looking for.” I said, “If I cast her, I really would insist on rewriting the whole show to make the protagonist somebody who doesn’t want to be there, who is rebellious, who is — I’d want to change how the superpower is portrayed in the show.” Because the original idea is somebody who desperately wants to belong and be part of the town, and her superpower keeps sending her away. I said, “If we cast her, I’d want to turn it on its head and rewrite the whole script and make it about somebody who doesn’t want to be there and gets the power that keeps sending her back home. She wants to be anywhere but home.” As I’m saying it out loud, we’re looking at each other. We’re going, “You know, actually, that would be a better show.” We cast her and then reconceived the whole show around her and what she brought.(Photo by Erin Keating)RT: It’s not too often that you hear about an actor having such an impact on an entire story.Liman: I’ve always believed in some level of workshopping the part to fit the actor. It’s a two-way street. Sometimes my favorite performances, you realize those couldn’t have been just written in vacuum. They had to have been conceived in conjunction with the actor performing it. Certainly, that’s been my experience. Jason Bourne is a very different character because of the workshopping that Matt [Damon] and I did than was originally on the page.Never have I done such a wholesale reconceiving of the DNA of a show around one actor. Literally. It changed how I portrayed the superpower, because then suddenly it was going to be a curse. Instead of sending her out into the world, it was going to keep sending her home. It was just way more interesting. That’s what a great collaboration between a filmmaker and a star can do.You arrive at something really unexpected. That’s why when you said, “It wasn’t what I expected” — I don’t care if you hated it or loved it. I actually do care, because I really care about my audience, but I care most that it was not expected. What I’m aiming for as a filmmaker is unexpected and entertaining, because a lot of times, it’s unexpected. You’re like, “Yeah, it was unexpected, but the expected is better.” Clichés are clichés for a reason because they work. Any time you deviate from the cliché, yeah, you give the audience unexpected, but sometimes you have to work extra hard to deliver unexpected and great.RT: Can you tell me about the dotted line between Jumper and Impulse, how the show came about, and what its ties are to the film?Liman: It’s no secret that, of all my films, Jumper‘s the one that I harbor some creative regrets, feel like I could have done better. That’s something that’s hung over me. It dawned on me that rather than live with that regret, why not actually just go and try to do better? I went to secure the rights to a sequel novel. All these years later, with everything I’ve learned, I set out to create a superhero world that is unexpected, smart, grounded, exciting. Even despite all that, I still didn’t figure it out until I cast Maddie Hasson. Despite having all these big illusions about, “Yeah, I can do better,” the reality was until I cast Maddie, what I was going to make probably wasn’t going to be substantially better. It was that collaboration that was the missing ingredient for me. If you look back at my movies, it’s just that I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with exactly the right person.Swingers: Only Vince Vaughn can make the character of Trent appealing. In anyone else’s hands, he just would have been an asshole. Only Matt Damon could really make you root for Jason Bourne&nbsp;despite&nbsp;his really dark past. That to me is the connection.The other thing is that because it has been done independently, there were certain restrictions on me because it’s not done by the same people who did Jumper. It made people a little nervous that I’m the same filmmaker and that maybe I would inadvertently copy something I did in Jumper and infringe upon Fox’s copyright on the movie. It actually put me in exactly the situation I wanted to be in, which was people around me saying, “Push yourself and do something different and unexpected.”Just look at how we portray teleportation between the movie and the series, because that was one of the things where I was told, “You can’t make it look like it looks in the movie.” My response to that was to come up with something that is so much more interesting, which is that it’s destructive to the people around you. As a result of that, the first time she teleports, she gravely wounds Clay Boone, the star of the high school basketball team. Suddenly, you have that story line running through the series that she can hurt people with this power. It makes sense that any time you’re learning to do anything, you’re kind of sloppy. Why wouldn’t the first time you teleport, why wouldn’t it be sloppy?(Photo by Erin Keating)RT: When I got to the very last episode of the season, I honestly had the response, “Is that it?” because I wanted to see more immediately.Liman: So do I, especially in the hands of writer Lauren LeFranc, because I directed the pilot. As I said, when we cast Maddie, we had a looming start date to start shooting. I wanted to reconceive the show and brought in Gary Spinelli, who wrote American Made, who’d never worked in television before, to be in the trenches with me, because we’re reconceiving basically as we’re prepping to shoot. Lauren LeFranc came in to write the series. What was amazing about her is that scripts would come in, and I’d get to the end of the script and be like, “Oh my god. I can’t wait for the next script. I can’t wait to see what happens.” In that case, I had to wait a few weeks because they had to write it.RT: How did YouTube come to be the show’s home?Liman: I casually mentioned it to [YouTube Global Head of Original Programming] Susanne Daniels that I’d recently gotten the rights to the book and wanted to develop it as a TV series. Susanne said, “We’re starting a new channel here. We’ll buy it.” I wasn’t even pitching it. It was just like, “Uh,” because normally when I sell a TV show, it’s a whole process with a writer, and pitch out a whole season. This was one of these crazy situations where she said, “You, this world, we’re in.” I called my producing partner, and I was like, “I think I just sold a TV show without — I didn’t mean to.”Then I thought, “OK, do we want to sell it to YouTube?” I hadn’t gone anywhere else yet. When I talk about myself in interviews, I often talk about myself as being the independent filmmaker in the studio system. There’s no question I’m in the studio system. I live in New York, but I make Hollywood movies. I make commercial TV shows, but I bring an independent ethos to it, kind of a rebellious independent film ethos. Sometimes, I even bring independent film techniques to filming, and run and steal shots. My characters are more anti-heroic than your traditional Hollywood fare. My worlds tend to be a little more grounded — even when they’re high-concept, whether the world’s more grounded or the characters are more grounded, certainly they’re flawed.A lot of these traits that you see in independent films, and my whole attitude, my rebellious attitude as a filmmaker that makes me a little hard for studios to control, is that I’m happy making independent films. I don’t operate from a place of fear that if I piss off the studios, I won’t work again, because I’d be happy to go back to making independent films. I don’t need them. That makes me very hard to control. I come from this independent-film attitude.When I thought about Impulse, I thought, “At YouTube? It makes perfect sense that I go make something at YouTube, because YouTube is nothing but independent filmmakers.” In fact, all of the qualities that YouTube stands for are qualities that I myself as a filmmaker have stood for. I’ve even started referencing YouTube when it comes to my movies; for instance, with action sequences, my new benchmark isn’t what are competing movies doing, but what’s on YouTube because people are doing stunts for real and filming them. I’m like, that’s who we’re competing against. We’re not competing against some CG, computer-generated, clearly fake piece of action in a Marvel film. My style of filmmaking, I’m competing against someone who did some outrageous daredevil stunt on YouTube and filmed it and put it up on YouTube. I want to do something with my films and my action sequences that is equally engaging.Impulse is now available on YouTube Premium.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cancelled, Brie, Britbox, CMT, 2018, Pop, rotten","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"impulse-creator-doug-liman-turns-to-streaming"},{"id":"47613634680477","title":"Weinsteins To Present Estevez’s \"Bobby\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weinsteins To Present Estevez's \"Bobby\"by RT Staff | March 17, 2006 |  CommentsThe Weinstein Co. has acquired Emilio Estevez‘s ensemble drama \"Bobby,\" which follows the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel and its effect on the hotel’s inhabitants, played by a vast, star-studded cast.

What happened there has overshadowed his whole life yet also been swept under the carpet. I’ve always been fascinated by his story and couldn’t understand why no one has done a movie about him.”In addition to writing, producing, and directing Polanski, Chapa will take a supporting role as Eugene Gutowski, the Polish producer who collaborated with Polanski early in his career. Production is set to begin early next year.Not to be outdone, Polanski’s got his own project in the works; as the AP reports, the director is set to helm an adaptation of Robert Harris’ The Ghost next year. From the article:The book’s narrator is a ghostwriter, hired to help a former British leader complete his memoirs, who becomes enmeshed in a web of espionage and political intrigue.It has caused ripples in Britain for its parallels to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has known Harris for 15 years. Like Blair, fictional premier Adam Lang is a once-popular politician brought down by his close alliance with the United States in its “war on terror.”“There’s a lot of psychological intrigue in the story, as well as espionage and politics, and most of the action takes place in an oceanfront house during the middle of winter – all of it classic Polanski territory,” Harris said.Source: The Hollywood ReporterSource: AP","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"BET, drama, scene, Kaling, Amazon, play, Emmys, movies, Yoda, Tarantino, Television","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"damian-chapa-preps-polanski-biopic"},{"id":"47613681044146","title":"J.Lo Bails on the \"Dallas\" Flick","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})J.Lo Bails on the \"Dallas\" Flickby Binh Ngo | August 3, 2006 |  CommentsThey’ve still got John Travolta as J.R.

It’s open to interpretation — Roland Emmerich has a gargantuan disaster movie to sell and even he admits the whole 2012 theory is just, “a nice hook for the audience.” John Cusack, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover are a few of the stars swept up in Emmerich’s latest cataclysmic shocker. Rotten Tomatoes meets the cast and director in Cancun, Mexico – close to the once-throbbing heart of Mayan civilisation — for a 2012 fact-finding mission.Continue onto the next page and beware some mild spoilers as we start our journey through the world of 2012.Fact #1: Emmerich Was Reluctant to Re-enter the Disaster Fray“I was very reluctant. Even my friends joke with me, ‘Oh, you destroy the world again,'” admits the Teutonic helmer of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. “But when you find something you’re really good at and very successful with, then once in a while you want to do it again because it’s very easy for you to get a lot of money to make these movies. And every time you can do it a little bit better. We can do things now that we couldn’t do when we were doing Independence Day. I had this watershed moment on The Day After Tomorrow where I finally believed that you can create whole environments digitally, and I said, ‘I think I’ll do a whole movie like that.'”Fact #2: The Mayan Calendar Really Does End in 2012The Central American civilisation wasn’t into predictions — least of all about its own collapse — but their sophisticated ‘Long Count’ calendar does comes to the end of a cycle on December 21, 2012. Skeptics say it’s merely fodder for conspiracy theorists and cash-ins. But some New Age theorists are convinced the date will bring either cataclysm or enlightenment. “It’s fascinating that a culture which disappeared 1500 years ago would have this notion that the world would end on this exact date,” observes Emmerich. “Do I believe? Sometimes I do and then my brain says, ‘It’s ridiculous.’ But do some research and you find some other cultures say the same thing — it’s eerie.”Fact #3: Emmerich Tripped Up the PresidentThe production constructed a massive platform operated on a gimbal for the film’s rough-and-tumble earthquake sequences. Danny Glover, playing the US President, was the first 2012 headliner to attempt to manoeuvre his way across the ‘shaky-floor’ stage but tumbled and fell, prompting Emmerich to dial down the quake factor. “It was incredible — when this thing went, it felt really like an eight or nine point earthquake,” the director chortles. “We actually had to tone it down because people freaked out.”Fact #4: Cusack Was Thrilled to Take the LeadAt first sight, Cusack and Emmerich make an odd Hollywood pairing. But the 43-year-old star insists he was ecstatic when the director approached him. “I liked The Patriot and Stargate,” Cusack tells RT. “For me, if I can get a big movie like this every once in a while, I’d love to do it. And then you can use that to leverage smaller movies.” Plus, he insists the script, co-written by Emmerich and Harald Klauser, took him by surprise. “In a strange way, it’s not a genre disaster movie — it’s much more elegantly written and character-based. It doesn’t follow the normal disaster movie formula.”Fact #5: Emmerich Didn’t Touch Manhattan… Or Mecca“I wanted to stay away from New York because I had destroyed it too many times. So I said, ‘No New York this time.'” Instead, the skyscraping metropolis pictured is Downtown LA. As for Mecca, Emmerich originally planned to dish out the same destructive pulverising to the Muslim holy site that he unleashes on the rest of the world in 2012. But he bottled it. “That’s the problem with our world. If you would destroy Mecca, I would have a fatwa on my head. So we stayed away from it.” The Vatican on the other hand? It crumbles to dust, taking out a few thousand Catholic worshippers on the way.Fact #6: 3D Was Never an Option“I’m not sure about 3D yet,” Emmerich tells us. “It’s different when you’re James Cameron and you have three and a half years. But we had so many scenes with actors in these situations that I thought it was probably too dangerous to shoot in 3D. I want to see Avatar, and then I’ll make a judgement. So far what I have seen in 3D was not convincing to me. Whenever I see a 3D movie, I feel like I’m on mushrooms.”Fact #7: For Actors, Blue Screen Doesn’t Have to Be a Nightmare…Cusack’s harried limo driver is subjected to fire, ash, ice, water, wind and earthquakes. But the actor insists that having to do disaster-acting in front of a giant blue drape wasn’t the tedious challenge he thought it would be, thanks to Emmerich’s insistence on building a realistic soundstage world and creating each sequence with pre-visualisation technology so he could give his actors a sense of what they were panicking about. “The sets were astonishing,” says Cusack. “When I’m on the glacier, they built a massive glacier the size of a soundstage. It wasn’t what I’ve heard it can be like, where there’s nothing to play off.”Fact #8: …But it Often Does“Even beyond my wildest imagination, I couldn’t perceive things to the degree that they were being perceived by Roland,” says Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays 2012‘s doomsday-predicting science boffin. “I’d go into the air force hangar and see the blue screen and think, ‘Okay, it’s a set.’ But through Roland’s eyes, it’s this huge, expansive landscape. I felt like I was watching it all for the first time when he showed the finished film to me.”Fact #9: Thandie Newton Got Soaked“I got drenched,” moans the Crash star, who plays the US President’s feisty daughter. “I was in wet clothes all fucking day and I’d be like, ‘Eech, I want to go home.'” In one sequence, as Newton’s art-curator character is attempting to grab her place on one of the floating Arks built to save pockets of humanity, she endured days of dampening. “The biggest effects sequence I was involved in was when we were on the Ark and it was gradually filling with water. This tidal wave came around the corner! How do they do that? When you’re doing something like that, there’s water everywhere, you’re trying to get up the ladder and it’s amazing, it’s really happening. And then, ‘Cut! Reset.’ The water gets drained through God knows where, gets put back to God knows where and we go again.”Fact #10: Underneath That Calamity Dressing Lies Some Hefty Themes“The disaster doesn’t get resolved,” notes Cusack. “When you see the water come over the Himalayan peaks, it’s about what you’re going to do with your final days. How do you separate the essential from the non-essential? Who’s important to you and what are you going to do with the time you have left? If it is a genre movie, it busts it wide open.”Fact #11: The Governator Wants a Private ScreeningIn 2012, an unnamed Californian governor goes on telly to assure his citizens that everything’s going to be alright. In a heavy German accent. Then a monster earthquake strikes… It’s a little in-joke, although Schwarzenegger’s name is never mentioned. But Emmerich’s still nervous about showing him the film. “A good friend of his has seen the movie and told him about it.

As Twohy says on his site:Yes, I got your emails demanding another movie; yes I keep bumping into guys at the airport and at conventions and I take your pleas to heart. All I can say now is “We’re talking about it.” The DVD numbers were really good — we know that, and some potential financiers know that. But if another movie surfaces, then it probably won’t be a Universal movie and probably will be an independent movie… But that’s okay… Maybe it’s time to go back to our roots — as we go on to the UnderVerse.Pitch Black, while not a classic by any definition, made good use of its limited budget, so maybe this “return to roots” could be a good thing for the series. Or not.

Night Shyamalan and Samuel L. JacksonThe director and star recall days on set (\"try not to blink\"), a botched marketing campaign, and making a superhero movie when nobody wanted them.by Joel Meares | January 9, 2019 |  CommentsIn retrospect, it’s easy to see why&nbsp;Unbreakable&nbsp;was not the box office hit that many were expecting from M. Night Shyamalan in the year 2000. The director had the impossible task of following&nbsp;The Sixth Sense, the second biggest movie of 1999 (behind only&nbsp;The Phantom Menace); he was making a comic-book movie at a time when the genre was out of favor (thanks largely to the silliness of the late-’90s&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;movies); and the studio had marketed it, misleadingly, as a&nbsp;Sense-style thriller. And yet, it’s also easy to see why&nbsp;Unbreakable&nbsp;would go on to find a devoted audience on DVD and eventually streaming, and why it would start to pop up in “Best Superhero Movies” lists in the late 2000s: It’s really, really good&nbsp;– and well ahead of its time.&nbsp;The dark, grounded, and refreshing take on the superhero genre also benefited from some incredible performances from&nbsp;Bruce Willis (as train crash survivor and reluctant hero David Dunn) and Samuel L. Jackson&nbsp;(as Elijah Price, a.k.a. Mr. Glass, whose friendly fascination with Dunn belies more villainous intentions). In this oral history of&nbsp;Unbreakable, Jackson tells Rotten Tomatoes about his first impressions of “Night” (“a little dictatorial”) and the appeal of his fragile villain Elijah, while Shyamalan reveals the origins of his tale and its journey from risky studio proposition to cult favorite.What follows is a history of&nbsp;Unbreakable&nbsp;(2000), and reflection upon it, drawn from&nbsp;sit-down interviews with&nbsp;M. Night Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson.&nbsp;ALSO WATCH: An Oral History of&nbsp;Split&nbsp;| An Oral History of&nbsp;Glass“I think you might be a real-life superhero.”M. Night Shyamalan: When I was editing Sixth Sense, I was writing Unbreakable, and the idea originally was a plane crashed and the guy survives and then someone says, “I think you might be a real-life superhero.” But then I put it into a train ’cause I love trains and I felt it was more comic book-y for me. It felt more reasonable that he would survive [a train accident] without a scratch, and so [it] could be dismissed as luck. But then Elijah’s character comes to him and says, “No, I think you might be a superhero.” This idea of a regular person who doesn’t have anything to do with superheroes in a world in which that doesn’t exist is told: Hey, you know these fake things in comic books? I think they’re actually based on people like you.(Photo by © Buena Vista)“He said, ‘Oh I just finished this movie with this kid, and he’s writing a movie for us right now.’”Samuel L. Jackson: I was just finishing a job in Morocco and I had to go into Marrakesh. My wife was coming for few days, so we were gonna, I guess, take a holiday. I was in a casino, heard a voice – Bruce! – I turned around, we talked. He asked me what I was doing; I told him. I asked him where he’d been, and he said, “Oh I just finished this movie with this kid, and he’s writing a movie for us right now.” I was like, what movie was that, and he told me. I said, “Oh, I read that movie. I wanted to be in it.” He called Night on the phone, and Night says, “Oh, I’m writing one of your scenes right now.” And we start talking, he tells me what the movie’s about. [I said] don’t read it to me, I’ll just read it when you send it.“It was really from Quentin that I grabbed that union of Sam and Bruce.”Shyamalan: One of my favorite movies is Pulp Fiction, and I really wanted that flavor that Sam and Bruce gave in Pulp Fiction for Unbreakable. Obviously, [it’s] a totally different story and all that stuff, but that kinda cool, edgy, grounded quality that they both had in that movie… I thought [Willis’] quietness versus [Jackson’s] pizazz could be really fun. It was really from Quentin that I grabbed that union.(Photo by © Buena Vista)“His body’s so fragile, but he had this great mane of hair like a lion – very strong.”Jackson:&nbsp;I love the character. I’m a huge comic book fan. I like the fact that he had this great arc. [He’s] not a weak character at all; he’s just fragile, physically fragile. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to accept that they have something like that, carry on and have a strong belief that, “If I’m this person, there must be some person out there that’s opposite me that can justify the fact that God made somebody like me.” He had these things that were wrong with him that made him stronger. That’s what you want — you want a character that definitely knows what he’s about. I talked to the costume director about the color scheme; we had great talks about the color scheme and the kind of materials he wanted to use. I kind of brought the hairstyle idea to him and Night accepted it, and then okay, let’s build it and see what happens and to give Elijah things that were very distinct. It has a level of strength to it that his body didn’t have. His body’s so fragile, but he had this great mane of hair like a lion, very strong.Shyamalan: Sam brought that Frederick Douglas look to the table. The hair kinda parted and [created a] big silhouette that I love so much. He definitely brought the pizazz, which is what you expect from Sam.“Those guys were icons and I was being very aggressive about the way we were making the movie.”Shyamalan: I think I was 29 when I was doing Unbreakable. Or maybe even 28 when I wrote it. I was still in the early stages of my career, and those guys were icons… And I was being very aggressive about the way we were making the movie. Long takes. Three-minute takes, two-minute takes, four-minute takes –&nbsp;really aggressive filmmaking. And they just had to trust me. There’s no close-ups. There’s no this, there’s no that. And it’s very play-like.(Photo by © Buena Vista)“We were kind of like his puppets in an interesting way.”Jackson: First impression [of Shyamalan]: young, strong ego, a little dictatorial when we first started working together. He had certain ways he wanted us to do things, and he would tell us to do them. I came up through the theater, and theater is essentially a dictatorship – the director tells you to do something, you do it, or they ask you a question, you have to have the right answer to justify what you’re doing. Night went further than that. It was like, “I already know what you’re going to do, and I want you to do it this way.” We were kind of like his puppets in an interesting kind of way. There were specific times he would say, “Okay, try not to blink. Just do the whole thing without blinking.” Or he would say, “Don’t say the line that way, say it this way,” and I’m one of those actors that hates being given line readings. But he was very adamant about it. Bruce and I have been around together for quite a bit, so… it was kind of easy for us to kind of listen to Night and look at each other and go, “Yeah, wait till this kid finds out.”“We’re never gonna mention comic books, superheroes – any of that.”Shyamalan: I think for the studio at that time… it was seen as a fringe element of the movie – that this is about comic books. “Oh, those are those weirdos that hang out at those conventions.” Back then, there was just Comic-Con, and it was very niche at that time. People weren’t aware of it. It was more cult-like. So, they said, “Let’s not make this a cult subject movie; let’s sell it more as a general thriller. We’re never gonna mention comic books, superheroes – any of that.” That meant you couldn’t even [promote] the main plot of the movie because that’s the plot of the movie: “Hey, I think you’re a real-life superhero.” That couldn’t be said in the ads. It was a really weird and ironic time that the thing that dominates the film industry now was the one thing they were running from. They thought that was the least commercial element of the film. Obviously, times have changed a great deal.(Photo by © Buena Vista)“Immediately as the DVD came out you started to feel the change.”Shyamalan: When the movie opened I think there was a disconnect because [audiences] were thinking it was kind of a sequel to Sixth Sense – it was me and Bruce and we sold it like that. So, there was confusion. People were coming to see a scary movie and that’s not what they saw, you know? But immediately as the DVD came out, you started to feel the change in their perception of the movie. And… “Oh, wait, this is about comic books?” And then again, six months later, six months later, six months later… it just kept growing and growing until I would cross the street and, if you and I were hanging out, invariably someone would come up to us and say: “Unbreakable! I love it, man. When are you making the sequel?ALSO WATCH:&nbsp;An Oral History of&nbsp;Split&nbsp;|&nbsp;An Oral History of&nbsp;Glass","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Reviews, Cannes, CMT, 99%, Infographic, News, TV, Walt, Disney, fresh, MCU, zombies, Sematary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"oral-history-of-unbreakable-with-m-night-shyamalan-and-samuel-l-jackson"},{"id":"47613739763405","title":"New Writers (& Director) for \"The Mummy 3\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New Writers (&amp; Director) for \"The Mummy 3\"by Scott Weinberg | January 10, 2007 |  CommentsYep, looks like Universal is finally about to get off its butt and make a third \"Mummy\" movie.

Night Shyamalan's much-anticipated thriller is an underwhelming missed opportunity.by Christopher Campbell | January 9, 2019 |  CommentsM. Night Shyamalan seems to have delivered the first disappointment of 2019 with Glass, the much-anticipated sequel to both 2000’s Unbreakable and 2017’s Split. The first two installments, which stand mostly alone from one another, were received rather positively (69% and 76% Tomatometer scores, respectively, with the latter Certified Fresh). Unfortunately, Glass, which stars Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, James McAvoy, and Sarah Paulson, looks to be another one of Shyamalan’s duds (initial score: 40%) based on the buzz from initial reviews.Here’s what the critics are saying about Glass:Does it meet expectations?Glass is a major disappointment.– Germain Lussier, io9Shyamalan always swings for the fences… This time, though, it’s a swing and a miss.– Alissa Wilkinson, VoxGlass&nbsp;shatters under the weight of&nbsp;Shyamalan’s ambition. It’s a messy, muddled, often downright stupid movie. It broke my heart.– Chris Evangelista, SlashfilmThe movie, watchable as it is, is still a disappointment… more dutiful than necessary.– Owen Gleiberman, VarietyOne of the biggest personal disappointments I’ve ever experienced in a theater.– Mike Ryan, UproxxIs it not satisfying to see the gang all together?Instead of having his two earlier movies dovetail to create something deeper and richer, it quickly begins to feel like subtraction by addition.– Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment WeeklyIn Unbreakable, David and Elijah went together like a lock and key. Here, everyone feels like spare parts.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireIts first hurdle is telling a story&nbsp;that connects everything in a satisfying, logical way. To that end, the film succeeds…the film’s first act is absolutely excellent.– Germain Lussier, io9(Photo by Universal Pictures)Will die-hard comic book fans appreciate it?Glass&nbsp;certainly feels like it’s made by someone who both hates superhero movies and also has never seen one.– Mike Ryan, UproxxPrice’s adulations of comic tropes… [feel] as if they were scripted by someone who’s only read a few comic books and is pretty sure they know what they’re about.– Alissa Wilkinson, VoxAlthough he’s made three movies about them, Shyamalan doesn’t actually seem to know much about comic books, and he’s certainly got nothing to say about their journey to cultural dominance.–&nbsp;Sam Adams, SlateI’m sure M. Night Shyamalan has read some comic books in his day. I do sometimes wonder how many, though.–&nbsp;Matt Singer, ScreenCrushIs it full of Shyamalan’s trademark twists?This one will not start, or go, or end like you think.– Vinnie Mancuso, Collider[There are] a bunch of big reveals to unmask Scooby Doo style and a greater universe to&nbsp;ta-da!&nbsp;unfurl like one of his many, not-always-successful magic tricks.–&nbsp;Rodrigo Perez, The PlaylistAnd the ending?I can also confidently predict that the ending is going to piss more than a few people off.– Vinnie Mancuso, Collider[Glass] throws its own three-film buildup under the bus for the sake of a twist and an open-ended non-resolution that can be seen coming down the pike from miles away.– Karen Han, PolygonGlass is a good ending to the Unbreakable trilogy, but it may not give you the conclusion you were hoping for. You’ll probably either love or hate the ending.– Kirsten Acuna, InsiderThat ending— which can’t really be explained, for lack of time, space, and to avoid spoilers— is really something, but suffice it to say, it’s a bit baffling.– Rodrigo Perez, The Playlist(Photo by Universal Pictures)What about the positives?It’s not a bad film.– Don Kaye, Den of GeekGlass&nbsp;is still a spectacle, but in a singularly un-Marvel manner… Think The Flash getting caught in a traffic&nbsp;jam or The Hulk filing a W-2.– Vinnie Mancuso, ColliderGlass&nbsp;feels like a giant middle finger to the very people who would be excited to see&nbsp;Glass. That, on its own, is inherently fascinating.– Mike Ryan, UproxxEach time&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;seems like a lost cause, Shyamalan pulls something truly affecting out of his hat.– Karen Han, PolygonThere is enough experimentation — such as the stirring POV shots during the fight scenes — that shows a director still pushing his craft to bring his viewers something new. He’s not done surprising us.– Monica Castillo, The WrapGlass&nbsp;looks great… Shyamalan and cinematographer&nbsp;Mike Gioulakis&nbsp;compose each frame — sharp and crisp — with a careful offness.– Richard Lawson, Vanity FairHow is Bruce Willis’ return as David Dunn?Willis is phoning in his performance.– Chris Evangelista, SlashfilmJackson and Willis fit back into their older characters like well-worn gloves, both of them knowing what to do and how to move, although Willis gets less to do than the others.– Don Kaye, Den of Geek(Photo by Universal Pictures)And Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Glass?Jackson is clearly having a blast playing such a devious character. But it’s almost too little, too late.– Chris Evangelista, Slashfilm[Jackson is] devilishly fun as Mr. Glass but is ultimately only given a few moments to truly shine. In a movie called&nbsp;Glass, you wish there was more of him.– Germain Lussier, io9Although the movie is named after his character, Jackson really doesn’t shine until its final third. He’s delightful in a maniacally sinister way.– Monica Castillo, The WrapFor a good third of the film, Jackson outacts anyone sharing his scenes without even saying a word.– Kirsten Acuna, InsiderIs James McAvoy still amazing as “The Horde”?He’s more fun to watch now that he doesn’t have to be the whole show.– Owen Gleiberman, VarietyMcAvoy is once again top notch. He lights up the screen with his eerie physicality every time he appears, and cascades crazily through the Horde’s personalities like a human radio with a dial that can’t stop spinning.– Don Kaye, Den of GeekMcAvoy’s acting abilities… are pretty extraordinary, considering we&nbsp;meet even more of Kevin’s many personalities&nbsp;this time around.– Germain Lussier, io9(Photo by Universal Pictures)How are the action scenes?Every clash between David Dunn and The Beast is bone-crunchingly satisfying.– Vinnie Mancuso, ColliderThe action sequences in&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;are the best of the filmmaker’s career.– Chris Evangelista, Slashfilm[There is] a fight scene that’s filmed with all the excitement of a knitting circle.– David Ehrlich, IndieWireAt least we can always enjoy the first two movies, right?[Glass] manages to diminish both&nbsp;Unbreakable&nbsp;and&nbsp;Split&nbsp;in retrospect.– Alissa Wilkinson, VoxShyamalan now takes a huge, unfortunate step backwards, tarnishing the legacy of&nbsp;Unbreakable, his best movie,&nbsp;in the process.– Chris Evangelista, SlashfilmGlass&nbsp;opens&nbsp;everywhere on January 18.#1Glass (2019) 36%#1Adjusted Score: 53.3% Critics Consensus: Glass displays a few glimmers of M.

So do American Pie, Cruel Intentions, and so many more.by Whitney Friedlander | March 31, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Touchstone courtesy Everett Collection)Filmmakers like Cameron Crowe, John Hughes, and Bob Clark may make us think the 1980s were the true renaissance of movies made for and about teens, but let’s not discount the 1990s – specifically one year in particular: 1999.Depending on your definition of “teen movie,” there were up to 19 films in this genre released that year, according to Phillip Iscove, the television writer and co-host of the all-things-1999-movies podcast, Podcast Like It’s 1999. Even more important, Iscove says, is that teen rom-coms like 10 Things I Hate About You and She’s All That, black comedies like Jawbreaker&nbsp;and Cruel Intentions,&nbsp;and coming-of-age films like The Wood&nbsp;and American Pie&nbsp;still resonate with those who grew up in and around that era because “there’s a universality that they’re trying to hit.”But why this year in particular? Surprisingly, it’s not just because one of them featured Heath Ledger singing in the high school bleachers.The Clueless and Romeo + Juliet Effect(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)Before we dive into the year of 1999, let’s act like Alicia Silverstone’s Cher Horowitz from Clueless and totally pause at the mid-‘90s. Writer-director Amy Heckerling adapted that 1996 film from Jane Austen’s classic novel, Emma, replacing Regency-era British aristocracy with a posh Beverly Hills high school while star Silverstone kicked the dumb blonde trope out with last season’s fashions. A year before this, Baz Lurhmann’s flashy Romeo + Juliet set the Bard’s famous play about star-crossed teen lovers in a gritty, steamy beach city and made male lead Leonardo DiCaprio a teen heartthrob (his female counterpart, Claire Danes, was already known to younger audiences thanks to her cult TV show, My So-Called Life).So it shouldn’t be a surprise that, by the time greenlights, casting, and production turnarounds were through, we’d land in 1999 with 10 Things I Hate About You, an adaptation of Shakespeare’s marital comedy The Taming of the Shrew about elaborate scheming to marry off one daughter in order to gain access to another; She’s All That, which is rooted in George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion, a play about teaching a lowly flower salesgirl how to pass in high society; and Cruel Intentions, which is based on Les Liaisons dangereuses, Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s novel about bored socialites who break hearts for sport.“Clueless was proof-of-concept that there’s an audience [for modern adaptations of classic works] if it’s done well,” says Neil Landau, a screenwriter and professor at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. “Adults who greenlight movies love when it’s source material. It doesn’t feel as frivolous. I think the young people see them because of the canon and the things you study in high school.”Plus, he says, these works were in the public domain and therefore cheap to get licensing rights.Independents Studios + DVD Sales = Boffo Profits(Photo by Paramount courtesy Everett Collection)It’s also important to remember what was going on in the industry itself at that time. She’s All That was distributed by Miramax when it still was the hip younger sibling brought in to spice up Disney. 10 Things I Hate About You was distributed by Touchstone Pictures, which is also part of Disney. American Pie was produced by Summit when it was still considered an independent studio. Then there’s MTV Films, which, Iscove reminds us, had an ambitious slate in 1999 that included Varsity Blues, Election, 200 Cigarettes, and The Wood – all movies for or about teens and young adults that were released in July or earlier of that year. He says, nowadays, companies like Annapurna Pictures (Everybody Wants Some!!) and A24 (The Bling Ring,&nbsp;Eighth Grade) excel at distributing and producing these films, but it’s not all they do.Part of this is because we’ve since changed how we look for these types of movies. Tim Gray, the senior vice president and awards editor at Variety, says his trade magazine wrote in 1998 that “DVD players were expected to hit 1.4 million in 1999.” He says that number may sound like small potatoes, but it was a strong indicator that the public was willing to commit to a new technology – especially since he says Variety also ran an advertisement around that time saying that “it would be a $13 billion industry within a decade.” Since teen movies were still cheap to make, Gray says that “indie companies were emboldened by that idea” of DVD viewership the way that video cassette players in the 1980s made Hollywood realize that there was still business to be had once a film left theaters.Iscove argues that the desire for teens to see themselves on screen hasn’t changed – just how they find them may have evolved. We all know what “Netflix and chill” is code for, but think of the success of films like To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before and Alex Strangelove and realize that the kids may want to watch something on streaming channels too.White Male Humor Still Dominated(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The late ‘90s was still a time when white, male, heteronormative bro-culture dominated, especially since the (mostly male) development executives who were green-lighting these films had themselves been raised on now-questionable films like Porky’s and Risky Business. While there are exceptions – Jawbreaker,&nbsp;Election — this was an era where teen boys were straight, cis-gender, and supposed to treat sex like a conquest (see:&nbsp;Cruel Intentions and American Pie) and where teen girls were supposed to be OK with prettying themselves up and potentially dumbing themselves down in the name of popularity (see:&nbsp;10 Things I Hate About You and She’s All That). Oftentimes, these kids were white, suburban, and entitled. When the idea of sexual assault is brought up, such as Julia Stiles’ Katarina’s reveal toward the end of 10 Things, it’s done in an almost blink-and-you’ll-miss-it way.“It was the beginning of the ending of an era,” says UCLA’s Landau of this period when “virginity is a rite of passage for boys. For girls, it was filled with shame and stigma.” He says this only influenced mainstream views, as chances are girls and young women were going with boys in their age brackets to see these movies either in groups or on dates.However, these norms have evolved considerably since 1999. Director Kay Cannon’s summer 2018 hit Blockers threw the double-standard that girls can’t own their own sexuality in our faces. Some of the biggest successes to come out of the recent South by Southwest film festival were Booksmart and Snatchers, which mock the finger-wagging trope of “good girls don’t do that.” As for films about boys and sex? Another hit from SXSW was Good Boys, which still has rauchy humor but – as the trailer reminds us – features boys from a much more innocent age.We may never get another year as robust with movies that cater specifically to the teen audience as we did in 1999, and we may never again get teen movies quite like the ones we saw that&nbsp;year. But thanks to films like&nbsp;Blockers, like&nbsp;Eighth Grade, like&nbsp;The Spectacular Now,&nbsp;Dope,&nbsp;The Edge of Seventeen,&nbsp;Sing Street, and&nbsp;Lady Bird, we can rest assured that the genre is in good hands, and the adolescents of today won’t lack for entertainment that speaks to them on a personal level too.Check out our list of every 1999 teen movie ranked here.

The Brendan Fraser-led action-adventure remake of The Mummy has proven to be as enduring as its titular bandaged baddie, and ’90s moviegoers of a certain age still remember the film fondly.Although based on a black-and-white horror movie from nearly 70 years earlier, 1999’s&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;– released May 7 of that year – owes more to Harrison Ford than it does to Boris Karloff. With a swashbuckling sense of adventure, some supernatural spooks, and a stellar cast,&nbsp;Stephen Sommers‘ globetrotting spectacle&nbsp;recaptured Indiana Jones’ magic for millennials, swapping the Ark of the Covenant for a sarcophagus that never should have been opened, even if it was a blessing, not a curse, for moviegoers. How was it that&nbsp;The Mummy&nbsp;was able to channel Indy so successfully?It&nbsp;Put a Fun Spin on Past InspirationsBoth The Mummy and Indiana Jones draw inspiration from the same era — not ancient Egypt, though that’s obviously a factor, but&nbsp;the films of the 1930s. When they created Indiana Jones, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas wanted to revive the spirit of old matinée serials and pulp magazines. Indy was the modern version of Doc Savage, an adventurer who explored strange new lands and braved thrilling challenges.&nbsp;By virtue of premiering almost 20 years after Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy was able to invoke not just the spirit of those old serials in the same way, but also Indiana Jones itself, putting its own spin on the vintage tropes.But&nbsp;The Mummy also benefits from its own history. 1932’s&nbsp;The Mummy, one of Universal Studios’ classic monster films, provided the 1999 movie its name and general plot, and the remake takes those ideas and runs with them. The original film is great, but it’s slower than the shambling monster itself, and there is actually very little “mummy action,” as modern viewers might define it. Boris Karloff is chilling as the creature, but he’s hardly in bandages, instead opting to blend into society and manipulate victims with his piercing gaze.The 1999 Mummy effectively&nbsp;plunders the 1932 Mummy’s tomb, which seems fitting. It’s a good bit of grave robbing, though, as the remake does a genre switcheroo, infusing the old plot into another mold, one that Indiana Jones had so successfully revived, and makes it work spectacularly.Brendan Fraser is Harrison Ford with a Goofier Smile(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Brendan Fraser is still doing great work (he’s a delight as the voice of Robotman on DC Universe’s surprisingly good Doom Patrol series), but it’s hard to overstate just how hot he was in the 1990s, both as an acting commodity and as a hunk. Without Fraser, The Mummy&nbsp;doesn’t work, just as Harrison Ford is integral to Indiana Jones’ success.As Rick O’Connell, Fraser is able to showcase a lot more of his chops than one might expect, effortlessly conveying our hero’s wide range of emotions across a variety of outsized set pieces and quieter moments. When we first meet him in prison, he’s a quip-happy nihilist&nbsp;who remains somewhat distant once he’s freed. On the voyage to the City of the Dead, O’Connell gradually opens up, finding his purpose, his courage, and a hankering for romance. Fraser has all the looks of a classic pulp hero, only he’s got the charm and the heart to make O’Connell more than just an adventuring straight-man.In that way, Fraser’s not unlike Ford, who imparts Indiana Jones with just the right mix of world-weariness and wonder. If there’s a difference between the two, though, it’s that Fraser is more game than Ford. Whereas Ford makes characters like Han Solo and Indiana Jones work by keeping them somewhat at arm’s length — a subtle, constant eye-roll that lets viewers know not to take everything too seriously — Fraser is a puppy. There’s something indescribably late-’90s about the way his smile radiates in the role, his enthusiastic force of personality welcoming viewers into spooky tombs. Just as O’Connell couldn’t keep playing the part of the gruff veteran, Fraser can’t help but have a great time, and the audience loves him for that.The Supporting Cast of Characters Belongs in a MuseumWhile it’s fun to watch characters like Indiana Jones and Rick O’Connell&nbsp;explore unknown lands, their journeys would be far less entertaining without other memorable characters to play with. Where’s the fun in an action-adventure if there’s nobody to trade witty one-liners with?While&nbsp;Raiders of the Lost Ark has&nbsp;Karen Allen’s Marion Ravenwood, The Mummy has Rachel Weisz’s Evelyn “Evie” Carnahan. She’s a perfect match for O’Connell, as the two characters trade the high ground throughout the movie. When one makes a mistake, the other has the solution, and together they blur the line between courage and foolhardiness. Evie and O’Connell egg one another on, buoyed by Fraser and Weisz’s excellent chemistry.John Hannah, on the other hand, offers plenty of comic relief as Jonathan Carnahan, who is in way over his head when it comes to this whole “ancient curse” business — think of Henry Jones Sr., Marcus Brody, or even Temple of Doom’s Willie Scott. The sniveling Beni (Kevin J. O’Connor), along with the group of rival American Egyptologists, serves as a fitting counterpart to the heroes, just like many of Indy’s ersatz foes. Oded Fehr also imbues personality into what could have been a stock role as Ardeth Bay, the leader of the guards who have kept Imhotep at bay for three millennia.Then there’s Imhotep, the Mummy himself. As played by Arnold Vosloo (once he claims enough victims to graduate from emaciated CGI skeleton to flesh-and-blood human), Imhotep is an imposing villain, at times intoxicatingly so. He’s a larger-than-afterlife presence, making him an excellent foe for Fraser’s enthusiastic determination.It&nbsp;Shares the Same Exaggerated Gung-Ho Sense of Exploration(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Indiana Jones is a bad archeologist, but he’s an amazing hero. Same with O’Connell and Evie, who are destructive grave robbers even by 1920s standards. That’s not the point of these films, though. The point is to go on an adventure, using the past and exaggerated mysteries of foreign lands as inspiration.Watching O’Connell scream into a decomposing mummy’s face or watching Indy knock a Nazi into some propellers is a hoot, but the battles aren’t necessarily what make the films so memorable. It’s the journey into the unknown, following our friendly heroes into archaic, unfamiliar terrain.The matinée serials and pulp magazines both franchises draw from harken back to a very specific era for exploration, one that didn’t ever truly exist as it appears in pop culture, yet feels very nostalgic. The characters of Indiana Jones and The Mummy both live at a turning point of world history, right at the cusp of what we’d recognize as the modern world. It doesn’t seem like there’s much new to discover, so instead, archaeologists Indy and Evie turn to history. And in the world of these films, there’s far more buried in the past than the modern world expects.It’s a romanticism of sorts, one that’s not without its problems, but it makes for an exciting adventure at the crossroads of the past and the present, the intersection of the known world and the unknown.Both The Mummy and Indiana Jones are Way More Violent Than You Might RememberEven though The Mummy&nbsp;is more of an action-adventure romp than a horror movie like its classic predecessor, there are still plenty of scares and suspenseful moments. Indiana Jones operates on a similar level, because it wouldn’t be as exhilarating to see Indy whip his way through danger unless viewers, on some level, really feared that danger. Still, even if you’re aware that The Mummy&nbsp;boasts a few scary moments, if you haven’t rewatched it in a while, you might be shocked at just how violent it is.Raiders of the Lost Ark&nbsp;literally melts a dude’s face off during its climax&nbsp;when the Nazis open up the Ark of the Covenant, and who can forget the horrific sight of Mola Ram extracting a still-beating heart from a poor man’s chest with his bare hands in Temple of Doom? Taking a page from the same playbook,&nbsp;The Mummy blasts a bunch of excavators with acid, and that’s just a warm-up. Imhotep steals eyes and tongues from his victims, flesh-eating beetles gorge themselves as they crawl beneath the skin of their victims, and there’s plenty of torture. That the movie is technically pretty bloodless only makes the extent of the other gore even more shocking&nbsp;to watch.Raiders of the Lost Ark is infamously rated PG, as the PG-13 rating hadn’t yet been introduced. The Mummy, on the other hand, does sport a PG-13 rating, but in classic Indiana Jones fashion, it pushes the limit. Archaeology is dangerous, violent business, or so these movies would have you think. But for those of us slogging through our decidedly less exciting everyday lives, adventures like&nbsp;The Mummy — and the&nbsp;Indiana Jones franchise before it — provided thrills and ignited our imaginations like few others did. We don’t get a lot of movies like&nbsp;The Mummy any more, and that’s perhaps why lots of folks still remember it with&nbsp;unparalleled affection.The Mummy opened in theaters on May 7, 1999.#1The Mummy (1999) 61%#1Adjusted Score: 65.171% Critics Consensus: It's difficult to make a persuasive argument for The Mummy as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement, but it's undeniably fun to watch.Synopsis: Loosely adapted from the classic 1932 horror film starring Boris Karloff, The Mummy is set in Egypt, where over 3,000...

Gates and Sarah Ricard | October 22, 2015 |  CommentsThis week in TV news, reboots are all the rage as Laverne Cox announces her Rocky Horror Picture Show role, Netflix teases a Gilmore Girls revival, and NBC flirts with Cruel Intentions. Plus, all children of the ’90s will be excited to know that Simpsons World now has audio commentary!LAVERNE COX TO STAR IN ICONIC&nbsp;ROCKY HORROR ROLELast month marked the 40th anniversary of the cult film The&nbsp;Rocky Horror Picture Show, featuring&nbsp;Tim Curry in the famous&nbsp;role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter (which he also played on Broadway in the 1970s). Now some exciting casting news is bubbling up this week&nbsp;about the long-gestating revival at Fox — namely that Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox (Sofia) is taking on the Frank-N-Furter role. Cox shared the story on social media Thursday, saying “I am so excited that the news is out. I am so honored to be a part of the Rocky Horror legacy. #DontDreamItBeIt #TransIsBeautiful.” In Rocky Horror,&nbsp;sweethearts Janet Weiss and Brad Majors happen upon the mansion of mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter, who is in the midst of creating a new life-form — a muscular man named Rocky. The revival is expected to hit Fox in the form of a two-hour TV movie in fall 2016.SIMPSONS WORLD LAUNCHES AUDIO COMMENTARYGreat news for the most obsessive Simpsons fans! Simpsons World, the online destination where every Simpsons ever lives, now offers an audio commentary track option for episodes in its library. For the launch, the audio track is available for the first 10 episodes of season 18, with new tracks dropping every week. For&nbsp;the season 18 premiere, “The Mook, The Chef, The Wife, and Her Homer,” head writer&nbsp;Al Jean chats with other Simpsons scribes, directors, and guest star Joe Mantegna, who plays Fat Tony, giving behind-the-scenes intell about the origins of many of the jokes (the first being the allusion to The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover) and an obscene word that almost made it to air on one of Otto’s Grand Funk Railroad cassette tapes. Visit SimpsonsWorld.com for more Simpsons extras.NETFLIX IS REVIVING GILMORE GIRLSTV Line reported this week that the beloved dramedy Gilmore Girls will be returning, thanks to a deal with Netflix and Warner Bros. Television, after being off the air for over eight years. The revival will consist of four 90-minute episodes/mini-movies — all of which will be written by series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and exec producer Daniel Palladino (the two were notoriously booted from the show before its seventh and final season). &nbsp;While negotiations are still in progress, major cast members Lauren Graham (Lorelai), Alexis Bledel (Rory), Kelly Bishop (Emily), and Scott Patterson (Luke) are all expected to return. Sadly, star Edward Herrman passed away last year. It’s unclear if other series regulars Jared Padalecki (Supernatural), Milo Ventimiglia (Gotham), Matt Czuchry (The Good Wife), Liza Weil (How To Get Away With Murder), or Melissa McCarthy (Mike &amp; Molly) will be returning as well.A CRUEL INTENTIONS REBOOT IS IN THE WORKS AT NBCMany a ’90s kid snuck a viewing of hard R-rated Cruel Intentions&nbsp;— the 1999 teen version&nbsp;of&nbsp;Dangerous Liaisons starring Reese Witherspoon, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Selma Blair. Now NBC is planning a TV revival with a “modern spin.” The new Cruel Intentions&nbsp;will be centered around the 16-year-old son of Sebastian Valmont (Phillippe’s character in the film) and Annette Hargrove (Witherspoon’s character in the film) as he finds his father’s journal and learns of his family’s dark legacy. The film’s original writer/director Roger Kumble is set to direct the pilot.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Drama, Crackle, latino, Society, chucky, hidden, robots, Reviews, movies, street, Adventures, watch, hist","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"laverne-cox-will-play-rocky-horrors-frank-n-furter"},{"id":"47613772483295","title":"Critical Consensus: \"Blue\" Sinks, \"Violence\" Kills, \"Serenity\" Soars","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critical Consensus: \"Blue\" Sinks, \"Violence\" Kills, \"Serenity\" Soarsby Tim Ryan | September 29, 2005 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we have sexy divers (\"Into the Blue\"), secretive family men (\"A History of Violence\"), space renegades (\"Serenity\"), streetwise scamps (\"Oliver Twist\") and sandtraps (\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\"). Who will survive the scrutiny of the scribes?Is \"Into the Blue\" an action-packed thriller, or an excuse for Jessica Alba and Paul Walker to wear as little clothing as possible? More to the point, is this tale of attractive snorkelers who happen upon some dangerous treasure seaworthy? In a word, no, say the critics. Despite an attractive cast, the critics say this one is submarined by camp and unintentional laughs. At 23 percent on the Tomatometer, the scribes are definitely not \"Into\" this one.Why do millions of people pay good money to see violent images on the screen week after week? What evil lurks in the hearts of men? Is it possible that perpetual outsider David Cronenberg has made — gasp! – a mainstream movie? These are some of the questions raised by \"A History of Violence,\" the story of a small-town restaurant owner (Viggo Mortensen) with a secret or two. The critics are raising another question: Is this the best movie of the year so far? At 87 percent on the Tomatometer, it’s one of the best reviewed.Fangirls and fanboys of the world, rejoice! Your beloved, swiftly cancelled TV series, \"Firefly\" is on the big screen, and it’s getting really good reviews! A tale of a ragtag bunch of space fugitives, \"Serenity\" is winning praise for its great ensemble chemistry, genre jumping audacity, and punchy dialogue. At 80 percent on the Tomatometer, Joss Whedon’s space opera will leave its cult following with a feeling of \"Serenity.\"Roman Polanski is one of those directors whose work is filled with touches so personal that every film is a window to his soul. Polanski has adapted classics before (\"Tess,\" \"Macbeth\") and brought a heavy dose of autobiography to the table. While the critics aren’t completely opposed to his take on Dickens’ \"Oliver Twist,\" they have collectively questioned why Polanski made such a faithful, surprisingly bloodless version of a story that’s been pretty well covered in cinematic history. At 53 percent on the Tomatometer, the critics are saying let’s not \"Twist\" again.Feel-good sports stories never get old. Ever. That’s why so many of them get made. \"The Greatest Game Ever Played,\" Bill Paxton‘s second film in the director’s chair, tells the story of blue collar Francis Ouimet, an amateur golfer who shocked the sports world by defeating British champion Harry Vardon at the 1913 U.S. Open. The critics say the movie is as predictable as they come, but it’s also heartfelt and absorbing.

Yep, we’re going to bat for films that go splat. Everything here is ordered from almost-Fresh to super-Rotten — staff picks of bad movies that we love for different reasons. Some are underappreciated gems, some grew finer with age, and some are simply so bad they’re plain awesome.Want to take it further? Visit FandangoNOW to purchase the movies, or make your own Rotten favorites known in the comments!A Knight's Tale (2001)  59%#1Yeah, we’re cutting it a little close with this one, since it’s just&nbsp;shy of Fresh at 58%, but come on. An up-and-coming Heath Ledger, sporting wispy hair and medieval grime, in an underdog story set in the 14th century with a rock soundtrack? Alan Tudyk as the comic relief? Paul Bettany as Geoffrey Chaucer himself? It might lay the cheese on a bit thick, but a little bit of cheddar goes great with popcorn.Taken (2009)  59%#2Taken once, shame on the kidnapper — but then we’re taken on a slick and grimy thrillride through the Parisian underbelly, with Liam Neeson in late-career breakthrough mode as ex-CIA marauder Bryan Mills. Now, Taken twice or that third time, shame on Mills. Maybe you’re just a bad father at some point?The Mummy (1999)  61%#3The year is 1999. Ten years after The Last Crusade, and nine years before the next promised Indiana Jones installment. (Legend has it some people are still waiting for it…) In the meanwhile, enter this straight-shootin’ update of the Universal classic with enough fresh faces to keep the adventure new. There’s the put-upon sidekick (John Hannah), a comic adversary (Kevin J. O’Connor), and a brainy love interest (Rachel Weisz). Brendan Fraser doesn’t bring any particular depth to&nbsp;the hero role, but that’s forgivable, especially in light of the recent Mummy reboot.The Sandlot (1993)  63%#4Boomer nostalgia for the 1950s and 1960s apparently ran its course with adults by the time The Sandlot came out (“Bring on That ’70s Show!” they cried from their VW Westfalias), but there’s no shortage of ’90s kids who’ve adopted this as a movie mascot of their generation. It’s about the simple joys of a typical childhood: rowdy sports, poolside crushes, neighborhood tall tales, and treehouse s’mores. Detractors criticize Sandlot‘s slack pacing, but those into its rhythm find a movie that feels like a long, carefree dog day of summer.Return to Oz (1985)  54%#5For anyone who left The Wizard of Oz disappointed that their kids weren’t quite terrified enough by the flying monkeys, this sequel is for you — seriously, we still have nightmares about “wheelers”. Oz is a far bleaker place in this ’80s fantasy starring Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, a young teen sent by her auntie to a sanitarium to forget all that “nonsense” that (maybe) happened in the original. It’s almost Lynchian at times.Spaceballs (1987)  56%#6It’s unfortunate that Spaceballs essentially marks the downward turn of Mel Brooks‘ directorial career, because while it may not reach the heights of The Producers or Young Frankenstein, there is no better Star Wars parody out there, and it’s endlessly quotable. Considering the horrid output of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer in the ensuing years (Date Movie, Epic Movie, etc.), we’ll take the adventures of Lone Starr, Barf, Princess Vespa (she’s Druish), Dot Matrix, and Yogurt any day. May the Schwartz be with you.Phase IV (1974)  53%#7Famous for his title treatments and art in collaboration with the likes of Hitchcock and Preminger, Saul Bass directed a single full-length in his lifetime: Phase IV, an eco-terror curio about ants evolving into possible enslavers of mankind. The snail’s pace sinks the movie for most viewers, but there’s moments of genuine sci-fi spookiness and a memorable psychedelic ending. Put this on an evening double feature with THX-1138.The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)  56%#8The Wes Anderson movie that feels the most labored and heavy: apparently, it’s a nightmare shooting at sea, or when given excessive freedom at Cinecitta, the Rome studio of Federico Fellini fame. The Life Aquatic overcompensates for its narrative drift, which means once all formal film expectations are thrown out, you get to luxuriate in the movie’s visual design, punk soundtrack, and relentless insistence to turn Bill Murray into a maritime fashion icon.Deep Blue Sea (1999)  59%#9Before he famously battled motherf—ing snakes on mother—ing planes, Samuel L. Jackson battled genetically enhanced megasharks in a sprawling underwater research facility. And, in one of the greatest “Holy S—!” deaths of 1990s cinema, he lost. That scene alone is enough to recommend this Renny Harlin B-movie gem, but that wouldn’t be doing justice to LL Cool J’s wise-cracking chef or a steely Saffron Burrows, who holds an improbably straight face right up to the last bite-y shock.Step Brothers (2008)  55%#10This movie probably gets quoted more than any other around the office. It’s got endless one-liners and occasionally perfect punchlines from Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, playing literal manchildren, at the top of their comedy game, not to mention revitalizing the economy of war-torn Catalina Island.Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)  60%#11Within culture at-large, who would consider the second Die Hard movie better than the third? If Die Hard 2 were a sentient, self-conscious being, it’d probably offer to switch its Fresh rating with Vengeance‘s Rotten rating. After all, in Vengeance we finally get to see John McClane in his natural setting — New York — rushing from street to subway to take down a sadistic bomber, with a roped-in Samuel L. Jackson at his sardonic best.The Fountain (2006)  52%#12Three visually interconnected love stories told across 1,500 years, out of chronological order, starring (across all eras) Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman, who at one point transforms into a tree. All in 96 minutes. Impressive. If, uh, confusing.Tron Legacy (2010)  51%#13The dialogue is lousy and so is the characterization (why turn Kevin Flynn into The Dude, exactly?), but the special effects are immaculate, especially paired with a soundtrack that’s literally a dream come true: Daft Punk created the score before seeing the visuals, basing it off of childhood memories of watching the original TRON. Hmm: Good premise with incredible audio/visuals and, ultimately, vaguely disappointing? Yep, it’s a TRON movie.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty (2013)  51%#14We can all relate to the desire to get away from our real-world problems and imagine a&nbsp;universe&nbsp;in which we’re heroes. And sometimes, it’s OK if a movie does that for us, even if it’s a little saccharine. Ben Stiller‘s adaptation of James Thurber’s fantastical adventure has such a sweet optimism at its core, and it’s so beautifully shot, that it’s hard not to come away from it feeling a little warmer and fuzzier inside.The Last Dragon (1985)  58%#15The Last Dragon is admittedly goofy and outdated, but what its naysayers may not understand is that’s part of what makes it so charming. A hero named Bruce Leroy and a baddie who calls himself Sho’Nuff, the Shogun of Harlem? A Motown soundtrack that features Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and a top-10 hit from DeBarge? This is a cheesy camp classic absolutely steeped in the 1980s that preaches a positive message and never takes itself too seriously. If you can’t get with that, you can kiss my Converse.Super (2011)  49%#16Before he went intergalactic with Guardians of the Galaxy, director James Gunn took a stab at the superhero genre from a decidedly more earthbound perspective, exploring what it would be like if an everyday Joe — or Frank, in this case — decided to throw on a costume and fight crime. The result was this oddball comedy that ultimately put off a lot of critics who weren’t prepared for its surprisingly dark turns and jarring tonal shifts. Still it’s a treat for anyone who, like the folks at Marvel, saw the potential in Gunn to wrangle his off-kilter sensibilities for box office gold.Miami Vice (2006)  46%#17An art film disguised as action flick, Miami Vice was a box office bomb, rejected by audiences who expected a pastel-hued nostalgia trip from Michael Mann. Instead it’s an inky black, intense mood piece underscored with the male soap operatic tone that permeates heat. Admittedly, at times the dialogue is incomprehensible, and the narrative thread is barely there, meandering from white supremacist raids to clubbing in Cuba, but these are also the flaws that make Miami Vice gloriously entertaining. We encourage you to shake up some mojitos and take it to the limit one more time.Three Amigos! (1986)  45%#181986’s hottest comedy has everything: Steve Martin, an invisible swordsman, Chevy Chase, Chevy Chase killing an invisible swordsman, a gunslinging German pilot, a piñata, Chevy Chase getting stuck in a piñata, a rousing rendition of “My Little Buttercup,” a singing bush voiced by Randy Newman, hip thrusts, and Martin Short. Is it juvenile? Yes. Is it hilarious? Also yes.Ravenous (1999)  49%#19A slice of biting, mordant horror. Guy Pearce stars as a disgraced 19th century Army soldier banished to the High Sierras, where he’s greeted by more military with tales of a Wendigo nearby feeding on humans. The setting is the last place one expects ’90s snark and attitude, but here we are — this is a movie as funny as it is bloody.National Treasure (2004)  46%#20Before the Indiana Jones franchise was revived in 2008, and after we had already gotten two underwhelming Tomb Raider movies, Nicolas Cage came along to fill the globe-trotting explorer-cum-action star void. We know the story is preposterous, but it’s got Sean Bean in his best villain mode, Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight oozing gravitas, a conspiracy theory-fueled scavenger hunt, and for crying out loud, Cage’s character is named Benjamin Franklin Gates. It’s all ridiculous, but it’s just breezy and whimsical enough to be fun.St. Elmo's Fire (1985)  43%#21Yes, it’s vacuous and very, very ’80s, and no, it’s not quite The Breakfast Club all-grown-up that many hoped it might be. But this Joel Schumacher flick has style for days and fun performances from the Brat Pack at the peak of its powers. Think of it as a time capsule.Tommy Boy (1995)  42%#22Fat guy in a little coat…fat guy in a little coat… What more needs to be said? OK, how about that Tommy Boy, like Chris Farley was himself, is an overpoweringly daft but earnest and sweet road comedy? It’s the best movie Farley and David Spade did together, and we’re trying hard here not to make that sound like a backhanded compliment.Convoy (1978)  43%#23 Hypothesis: Smokey and the Bandit and other 1970s trucker movie were like baby boomer Westerns. Think about it: the open country, discovering America, women, and hijinks, whilst running afoul of the local jurisdiction. One of the better of these meathead movies is the absurd Convoy, with its fun characters and fleet stunt work and destruction, all surprising since it was directed by a down-on-his-luck Sam Peckinpah.Bad Boys (1995)  42%#24Get an early look at the auteur that would give us Armageddon and 9,000 Transformers movies! Michael Bay, before succumbing to blockbuster histrionics or hacking his films to death in the edit suite, delivered sleek, exciting (and coherent) action films like this and The Rock.Legend (1985)  38%#25Tom Cruise may have made his name on Risky Business and Top Gun, but between those two films, the 23-year-old actor costarred in romantic fantasy film Legend with Mia Sara and Tim Curry in a world inhabited by fairies, elves, and unicorns. Curry’s fantastical performance as the demon Darkness rivals that of his Dr. Frank-N-Furter in Rocky Horror.The First Wives Club (1996)  50%#26They’re free, and they love to be free, and they don’t care a bit that the critics dubbed their hilarious revenge flick a dud. And neither do we. Seriously, Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton have so much chemistry that we’d watch them read a phone book. Luckily, they’re given a lot more to do than that in this movie about three friends who’ve all been left by their husbands for younger women. They sing, dance, get plastered, dangle from a high-rise, and 22 years later, have us clamoring for a sequel.Beerfest (2006)  41%#27Broken Lizard, the team responsible for Super Troopers, is behind this underappreciated comedy about drunk people, made for drunk people, by drunk people (the idea came to the guys at a beer-drinking competition in Australia). You don’t need to drink a boot full of beer before watching this tale of Americans challenging those dastardly Germans for hoppy supremacy, but it helps — and it might have helped the critics who gave it a too sober response.Hot Rod (2007)  39%#28Andy Samberg stars as an aimlessly ambitous amateur stunt cyclist who finds purpose in raising $15,000 to cure his cruel stepfather’s illness, then beat him to death. A supremely stupid comedy with an epic scope a la The Jerk or Dumb &amp; Dumber.Reign of Fire (2002)  42%#29Before Game of Thrones lit up the small screen with its trio of badass dragons, Reign of Fire featured menacing fire-breathers in a dystopian modern London. The film stars Christian Bale, Matthew McConaughey, and Gerard Butler — that’s a lot of testosterone assembled to battle dragons. What could go wrong?High Tension (Switchblade Romance) (2005)  41%#30The name doesn’t lie: From the moment terror knocks on the door of a provincial French farmhouse, High Tension is tense as hell. Not much actually happens beyond “crazy person stalks girls” – it’s not unlike The Strangers, released the same year — but it is executed spectacularly well by Alejandre Aja, who would go on to direct the remake of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha 3D. The twist-ending left a bad taste in some critics’ mouths, but it’s not enough to take away from the awesomeness that leads up to it.Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982)  41%#31Watching the only non-Michael-Myers film in the Halloween franchise now — with the understanding that Myers is nowhere to be found — reinforces the strength of Season of the WItch‘s foundation as a classic horror film that is possibly even scarier today than during its release. The corporate/technology fear mongering theme is evergreen, and hearing that kiddy theme song is scarier than many of Michael’s attacks in later films.Man on Fire (2004)  38%#32Denzel Washington goes ham in Mexico City to get back the girl (a young Dakota Fanning) he was sworn to protect. That’s the entire story. There was no movie plot so basic that Tony Scott couldn’t jazz it up with crazy color grading, fast cuts, hard action, and swirling camera movements.Equilibrium (2002)  41%#33A sci-fi film starring Christian Bale dismissed as derivative when it came out in 2002 may now seem prescient in 2018, with the world chipping away at privacy, personal lives on vivid display on social media, and workplaces asking employees to rate their colleagues using software. Have you taken your Prozium today? If not, watch Equilibrium and weep for humanity.Xanadu (1980)  29%#34The roller-disco queen of so-bad-they’re-good movies, Xanadu was dismissed as a strange little bubblegum confection at the time of its release. It hasn’t aged well – bubblegum rarely does — but that’s half the fun: Come for the peak Olivia Newton-John, stay for the earworms, costumes, and choreography. The movie also features Gene Kelly in his final big-screen performance.Space Jam (1996)  43%#35No way you could name the last memorable Mickey Mouse movie the same way you could for Bugs Bunny. That wascally wabbit traveled up and down the court and into the next cartoon dimension with Space Jam, a glorious time capsule of streetball, hip-hop, James Newton Howard, and pre-crying meme Michael Jordan. He’s seen in this movie pursuing a baseball career, a lazy fictional construct for Hollywood screenwriters.Saw II (2005)  37%#36Common knowledge says you can watch the first Saw and be done with the series. But we say Saw II is also worth exposing your vulnerable eyeballs to: It’s got a mighty fine twist, and it was written before the series went up its own a– with convoluted mythology and uninspired character arcs.The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)  37%#37The red-headed stepchild of the franchise is also its dark horse, the riveting tale of a cultural outsider forced to find his place in Tokyo by driving kinda sideways. Or something. We still don’t totally get the mechanics of the “drift”. What we do get is the awesomeness of the Hulk Mobile, the mean green machine owned by Twinkie (Bow Wow), and the chase sequences which, at least by the standards of later series entries, respected the laws of physics.Beaches (1988)  40%#38Filed under “chick-flicks-that-make-ya-tick”, Beaches is a tearjerker that works. Even the recent Lifetime remake couldn’t come close to evoking the same feelings as the original. It’s become a jokey reference point for sappy films, but it at least does sappy well. The music and singing are staples to this day (and “Otto Titsling”, people, come on!), and if you watch it with your mother — sorry, guys — you’re gonna cry. And the cast? To die for!Super Troopers (2002)  35%#39After cutting their teeth on a super low-budget comedy in 1996, the guys at Broken Lizard clearly figured out their audience: Nothing screams “fan favorite” like a 90% audience score based on over 262,000 votes. Watching Super Troopers is practically a stoner rite of passage meow, and its huge cult popularity has even spawned a sequel 18 years in the making, due out this 4/20 (of course).Tango &amp; Cash (1989)  30%#40Stallone put out a lot of respectable garbage at the height of his popularity, almost none more respectable than this fun, brawling team-up with Kurt Russell. The two’s friendly rivalry produces real on-screen chemistry, to the point fans were looking forward to their reunion in the second Guardians of the Galaxy. Imagine the ’80s fanboy disappointment when they didn’t get any screentime together. Maybe the two had a good time reminiscing at the craft table; hopefully someone recorded that.Wet Hot American Summer (2001)  38%#41This comedy from the frequently hilarious&nbsp;minds behind sketch comedy show The State is worth watching, if only to see a bunch of stars before they went on to bigger things. We’re talking early Paul Rudd, pre-SNL/Parks and Rec&nbsp;Amy Poehler, pre-Archer/Bob’s Burgers H. Jon Benjamin, and Bradley Cooper in his feature film debut, among others. But it’s also a wacky, nostalgic, and often funny send-up of summer camps of yore, and how many of those are there, really?Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Secret of the Ooze (1991)  35%#42Another movie we’re not ashamed we can’t detach from childhood memories. The first Ninja Turtles is better in just about every objective way, but there’s something about how this film goes for broke on neutering the violence, a state-of-the-art (for the ’90s) ecological message, and the stupid “Ninja Rap” song that has remained wholesome and watchable through the years.The Thirteenth Floor (1999)  30%#43The Thirteenth Floor had the misfortune of coming out the same year as The Matrix. Lacking star power, CGI wizardry, and guns — lots of guns — this movie got ignored as just a reality-bending sci-fi clone. But watching the movie nearly 20 years after the fact, it’s a mildly bold, relatively compelling thriller about peeling away layers of consciousness.Silent Hill (2006)  32%#44Like its Konami namesake, the movie is about a mysterious, fog-shrouded town that traps desperate people within&nbsp;its nightmarish streets and decrepit buildings. Its latest victim is played by Radha Mitchell, who’s drawn to the city after her daughter repeatedly calls out for the place while sleepwalking. Up until the new Tomb Raider, this was the most solidly entertaining video game adaptation out there.Hook (1991)  29%#45Some movies really work because you see them as a kid, and as much as that’s a detriment, the concept is firing at its finest with Hook. Steven Spielberg, who became a household name on the back of movies featuring absent fathers, reconciled with his real-life dad in the early ’90s and started making redemptive movies during this era. Hook was the first: it’s mawkish but wholly earnest, which can be felt if one grows up with this film. Along the same theme, Spielberg’s next movie, Jurassic Park, features Sam Neill becoming a father figure over the course of the plot.Jupiter Ascending (2015)  27%#46Yes, Channing Tatum plays a shirtless space wolf- man. Yes, there’s Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne camping it up like he wants to test the volume control on your TV. Yes, this is the Wachowskis going all-in on ridiculous, world-building, original sci-fi. Wait, what’s not to like (when chemically enhanced with your friends)?Showgirls (1995)  23%#47Some bad movies earn so-bad-they’re-good status with age, but Paul Verhoeven’s Vegas shocker earned that notoriety from the moment it was born. Forget everything you knew about Elizabeth Berkley from Saved by the Bell.Blind Date (1987)  21%#48Bruce Willis in fine, frantic ’80s form, Kim Basinger making the most of a thankless role, and John Larroquette playing another perfectly unctuous yuppie you love to hate — all topped off with a delightful scene-stealing performance by William “Feeny” Daniels. It’s far from Blake Edwards‘ best, in other words, but there’s a lot to like about Blind Date.Son-in-Law (1993)  21%#49The world may not have been ready for Pauly Shore at the time, but in hindsight, his films were the right amount of stupid to keep the crappiness of the real world at bay. Son-In-Law is arguably the funniest of the Shore films. This might be a totally awesome time to kick back and re-watch a tubularly radical dude question things like whether farm chickens are “extra crispy or original recipe.”Just Go with It (2011)  19%#50This shenanigans-in-Hawaii comedy is nowhere near as good as the island-set Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which came three years before, but it’s also nowhere near as bad as some of Sandler’s latest Netflix efforts. The movie boasts genuine chemistry between the comedian and co-star Jennifer Aniston, and a hilarious turn by Nicole Kidman in a supporting role. Yes, you heard that right: Kidman and Sandler, together at last.Judge Dredd (1995)  22%#51Two years after the Freshly scored Demolition Man — also starring Stallone —&nbsp;Judge Dredd&nbsp;fell victim to harsh comparisons to its comic book source material (and of course the Anthrax song “I Am the Law”). But in a time when comic adaptations were relatively subpar, Judge Dredd served its purpose with no-frills action and an over-the-top premise that — in hindsight — makes it arguably as memorable as&nbsp;Demolition Man and others of the ilk.Grandma's Boy (2006)  16%#52A raunchy, ridiculous but overall amiable stoner comedy from Happy Madison. Adam Sandler’s pals Allen Covert and Peter Dante, who we’ve seen hanging around in his past films, take the lead for the first (and only) time, which gives the movie even more of its underdog, unpredictable quality. Toss in attention-grabbing performances by Nick Swardson and Joel Moore, naughty grandmas, a sexy post-Freaks and Geeks Linda Cardellini, and you got a bona fide cult classic.Encino Man (1992)  17%#53There is only one way to watch this irresistibly dumb early ’90s relic about a teenager (Sean Astin) who finds a caveman (Fraser) frozen in his backyard and thaws him out for some high-school shenanigans: After way too many Slurpees. Pauly Shore steals the show as Astin’s best friend Stoney, for better or worse, depending on your tolerance for the actor. If that tolerance is high, make it a double feature with Son-In-Law, Bio-Dome or Jury Duty.Black Knight (2001)  14%#54For baseball fans, Rob Deer is fondly remembered as the kind of guy who mostly struck out but would occasionally blast a picturesque 500-foot home run. Black Knight is the ultimate Rob Deer movie: batting average isn’t all that high, but when it connects — during a scene in which Martin Lawrence leads a band of troubadours in a stirring rendition of “Dance to the Music,” or when our hero uses a lighter to breathe fire through a knight’s helmet — it just kills.Kung Pow! Enter the Fist (2002)  13%#55Remember when Woody Allen took an old Japanese spy movie, redubbed all of the original dialogue, and came up with a nonsensical new storyline? This is like Steve Oedekerk‘s version of that, but with an obscure kung fu flick, and with added scenes that he filmed himself. It’s absolutely inane, and you will not come away from this movie a smarter person — we can pretty much guarantee that — but you will laugh, and you will later criticize yourself for it. Perfect for those of you who like to indulge in a little self-loathing.Drop Dead Fred (1991)  11%#56How can you&nbsp;not&nbsp;want to watch&nbsp;Princess Leia and Kate from Gremlins&nbsp;try to ward off Rick from The Young Ones? Maybe Carrie Fisher should have played the lead, and had Robin Williams accepted the role of Drop Dead Fred over his Hook project, it may have fared better. But we still get Rik Mayall as the imaginary friend who returns to kick some childishness back into Phoebe Cates’ soul — and face — and the result is a deliciously dumb&nbsp;comedy that still brings dem guffaws.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"zero, Arts, Walt, drama, 21st, The, vampires","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"56-rotten-movies-we-actually-love"},{"id":"47613799964388","title":"How Mystery Men Planted the Seeds for the MCU Template","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Mystery Men Planted the Seeds for the MCU TemplateOn its 20th anniversary, we look back at how the goofy superhero comedy unknowingly paved the way for the future and why it remains so memorable.by Eric Alt | August 6, 2019 |  CommentsAlthough the opening shot of 1999’s&nbsp;Mystery Men&nbsp;is pure DC Cinematic Universe – the strange semi-futuristic cityscape that echoes Tim Burton’s Batman, the worshipful but also terrifying statue of local hero Captain Amazing that feels straight out of Zack Snyder’s world – what follows actually lays out a template for what would eventually be Marvel’s complete and utter dominance in the superhero movie space.Two movies that were released just prior to Mystery Men – Blade in 1998 and The Matrix in March 1999 – are most often credited with kickstarting the comic book movie revival. The Wachowskis’ anime-inspired sci-fi blockbuster showed how super-powered action could and should look, while Wesley Snipes’ vampire crusader proved you could find success beyond Marvel’s A-list roster. But looking back, neither of those films really fit tonally with what the MCU would become. The real seeds were planted in a silly and underrated Ben Stiller comedy that celebrates its 20th&nbsp;birthday on August 6. Here’s how.The CastOne of the hallmarks of Marvel movies is that they are littered with big and unexpected names, from Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man to Robert Redford in Captain America: The Winter Soldier to Matt Damon in Thor: Ragnarok. For a superhero goof, Mystery Men shared similar out-of-the-box thinking, resulting in even the smaller roles being surprisingly memorable. The main team was comprised of an Avengers-level mix of mid- to late-’90s indie and comedy stars, including Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria, and Paul Reubens; the main villain was a supremely hammy Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush, and the periphery was dotted with “whoa, really” names like Eddie Izzard, Ricky Jay, Cee-Lo Green, Dane Cook, and Tom Waits. Superhero movies had come a long way from a time when they were the last refuge of stuntmen and up-and-comers, and Mystery Men took the baton from Tim Burton (who went way outside the box with Michael Keaton in Batman) and ran with it for a bit before Marvel took over.The World Building(Photo by Universal courtesy Everett Collection)Although Iron Man and Captain America: The First Avenger hit some of the expected story points, by and large Marvel got away from doing traditional origin stories. Rather than having each new hero start off in a blank slate world where they’re the only ones with superpowers, Marvel built a world where multiple heroes and villains existed in various points throughout history. Mystery Men, too, drops you right into the thick of it with a superteam fighting supervillains in a city that is so comfortable with its own Superman that he has corporate sponsors.There is a sequence about midway through the movie in which the Mystery Men hold open tryouts (a gag that would be recycled in Deadpool 2), and they are swarmed with wannabes. This is a world as used to seeing this sort of thing as the people of MCU New York are to seeing Spider-Man.The HumorNaturally, Mystery Men was never intended to be anything but a superhero spoof. But its willingness to embrace the core silliness of the superhero concept helped show Marvel how to overcome a major obstacle. The knock against the DC movies is that they are dark, plodding, largely humorless affairs. And if you start to take the idea of people in fancy suits flying around cities too seriously, the whole thing begins to falls apart. The self-awareness to know that humor makes comic book storytelling go down a lot easier fuels Marvel even at its darkest. Avengers: Infinity War or Avengers: Endgame would have been too much to take without the relief supplied by Dr. Strange and Tony Stark’s catty bickering, or Korg’s epic Fornite battle against Noobmaster69.The Team DynamicsAnd speaking of the bickering… A team of noble heroes who all share an unshakable respect for one another, and who treat each other with courtesy and dignity at all times… is boring. Like Mystery Men, Marvel understands that teams like the Avengers or the Guardians of the Galaxy thrive when they don’t get along. Likewise, the Mystery Men treat each other more like co-workers than real friends. Post-battle, they sit in diners and complain like they just clocked out of a factory job (and coincidentally, the original Avengers ends with… the team sitting around in a diner eating).The (Lack of) Secret Identities(Photo by MCA courtesy Everett Collection)This is an extension of the world-building idea, but it’s no coincidence that Marvel ditched the concept of “secret identities” as soon as it could. It’s a hindrance more than it is a help – watch how they bend over backwards to get Tony Stark fighting helmetless, or how many times Captain America takes his mask off so you can see his face. Mystery Men doesn’t even bother with masking its heroes. They exist in a world that’s gotten used to the idea of superheroes, just as the MCU seems to be pretty OK with one of the world’s most successful tech billionaires occasionally running off to fight Thanos, and where kids think nothing of asking Hulk for a selfie.The Balancing Act(Photo by MCA courtesy Everett Collection)In the end, though, Mystery Men still allows its crew of misfit heroes to have their moment. They’ve been the butt of the joke for most of the movie’s runtime, but they’re ultimately still allowed to be heroic and win the day. There’s just enough earnestness there to get away with it – had the movie gone more cynical, it would have piled on the jokes regardless of whether or not anyone saved anything. It’s a delicate balance, and a Marvel entry like Thor: Ragnarok actually feels right in line with it. It never quite tips completely over into out-and-out Thor parody, though it comes close. But Marvel had, by that point, settled so comfortably into a tone that both celebrates and pokes fun at the concept of superheroes that it all managed to work.And who would have thought it would be the Mystery Men who’d light the way?Mystery Men was released in theaters on August 6, 1999.#1Mystery Men (1999) 61%#1Adjusted Score: 65.325% Critics Consensus: Absurd characters and quirky gags are brought to life by a talented cast, providing this superhero spoof with lots of laughs.Synopsis: Based on the Dark Horse comic, Mystery Men.

And now we have the very first piece of casting gossip. I ask you comic fans: Would Tyrese Gibson make for a solid Cage?From IGN FilmForce: \" A film adaptation of the Luke Cage comic, which has gained considerable attention recently in the Marvel universe, is still on, and according to actor Tyrese Gibson, he is still the frontrunner to play the man once known as Power Man.We caught up with Gibson on the set of \"Transformers\" this weekend, and this is what he had to say about his role in the project: \"Right now they’re doing a rewrite on the film. John Singleton’s got me at the top of his list. I’m not full-on committed to the project but it’s something I’m extremely interested in. Met up with Neal Moritz a few times about it.

This time around, Jim Carrey and Tea Leoni play the thieving duo, forced into a life of crime when an Enron-esque scandal lands them in the red. Among the reported \"special effects\" are voice-distortion devices the robbers use in their heists.That being said, it’s rather perplexing that such a low-concept movie could spend quite so much money. Some speculate that last-minute scenes, improvised gags and reshoots explain the insane budget boom. That, or the 40-odd takes perfectionist producer-star Carrey demanded during his own scenes.\"Fun with Dick and Jane\" opens in wide release December 21, and is directed by TV/film vet Dean Parisot (\"Northern Exposure,\" \"Galaxy Quest\"), written by Peter Tolan (\"Analyze This,\" \"Just Like Heaven\") with a screenplay by Nick Stoller and Judd Apatow (\"Freaks and Geeks,\" \"The 40-Year Old Virgin\").","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"furious, Hallmark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"dick-and-jane-budget-balloons-to-100-mil"},{"id":"47613813275370","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Kevin Smith Goes On Offensive, Heath Ledger as the Joker, Simpsons Movie Scenes, And More!","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekly Ketchup: Kevin Smith Goes On Offensive, Heath Ledger as the Joker, Simpsons Movie Scenes, And More!by Nick Hershey | July 28, 2006 |  CommentsThis week in RT Ketchup: Kevin Smith answers critics in RT’s Forums; hunky Heath Ledger may play the Joker in the next \"Batman Begins\"; another grotesque \"Saw 3\" poster has been unveiled; you’d better get your \"Harry Potter\" DVDs fast; and some excellent clips of \"The Simpsons Movie\" have been released.In other news, Jay Leno to give his thumbs up; Disney returns to traditional animation; Lindsay Lohan incurs the studio’s wrath while filming \"Georgia Rule;\" and The Hoff decides to fight back!

Ritchie’s Gamekeeper is part of a \"Director’s Cut\" roster that also includes Terry Gilliam, John Woo, and Jonathan Mostow. According to Variety, the story \"revolves around the reclusive caretaker of a Scottish estate with infinite knowledge of the behaviors of all animal species. When the alleged killer of his son surfaces, the caretaker finds that Europe’s urban jungle is not so unlike that of the natural landscape to which he’s accustomed.\"Sounds pretty interesting. Andy Diggle is Ritchie’s co-creator on the comic book.

Jason has become the go-to guy for tough action characters with charm and humour, and has recently wowed critics with starring roles in Crank and The Bank Job, as well as two sequels to The Transporter franchise, and his latest role as Jensen Ames in the retooling of Roger Corman‘s Death Race 2000, Paul W.S. Anderson‘s Death Race.RT caught up with him to learn more about the film and grill him on upcoming turns in Crank 2, Transporter 3 and the possibility of an appearance in Nick Love‘s version of The Sweeney.Were you a fan of the original before you signed on for Death Race?I was aware of it, but I never actually saw it. I bought the DVD, but its still in the cellophane. I remember sitting down with Paul and I said, “I bought the original.” He said, “Don’t worry; you don’t have to watch it.” The only similarity is that it’s a race to the death and it’s got Machine Gun Joe and Frankenstein – they’re two characters from the original – the rest is more homage. We didn’t get too tied down with trying to nail ourselves to the original. I mean, it’s 30 years ago now.So there was no chance of it having any influence on how you would play it?Exactly. He wanted to keep it fresh and not muddy the water, so that’s one of the exact reasons I didn’t watch it.The cars looked awesome – how were they to drive? Did you get to do much driving yourself?Yeah we did. They juiced up a couple of the ‘hero’ cars – they’re the ones that aren’t built to such a high extreme level, but one of them was 650 horsepower, and because they’re so heavy – they’d bolted on all these exterior plates, armour plating and all the other shit like the mini-guns – they needed to give it some extra juice so you can throw that thing around. But the vision out of those things is the worst, you know, there’s a little slit in the windscreen, no rear view mirror, no side view mirror, it’s a nightmare in terms of awareness of where your fellow drivers are. There were a lot of collisions, bumps and bangs but still a lot of fun.We’re big fans of Crank at RT, can you tell us anything about Crank 2? How was it to film?It was great. Six weeks of madness. Neveldine and Taylor are the nuttiest directors I’ve ever worked for, and I’d repeatedly work for them time and time again, because they’re just so out there.It’s so offensive. Whatever the first one was, this one’s more – just completely rude, offensive and plain mad in every way. It’s great, there’s no movie like it and they’ve exceeded all expectations. To go and do that – balls to the wall – with no worries about trying to tone anything down, or to try to make it believable, you know, it’s just like a video game. There’s nothing more fun to do than to go and make something like that kind of a film, it’s pretty unique.Where did you film it all?It’s all in LA again. We’ve got David Carradine and he plays ‘Puon Dong,’ this really mad Asian Mafia guy, that… well I don’t to give too much of the plot away! It’s got Dwight Yoakam in it again, Amy Smart’s back and there’s a couple of other nuggets that I’m not gonna tell you about, keep those as a surprise. Chev Chelios is running around with a plastic heart. They’re farming him for his organs, because he’s the man that cannot die, so they give him an ‘Aviacore,’ a totally artificial heart, and he’s trying to find his heart. I’m giving too much away now! [laughs] Step back… step back!Is there any truth in the rumour that you’re appearing in The Sweeney? Were you a fan of the original?Yeah, I loved The Sweeney. I think Nick Love is a great filmmaker and the fact that Ray Winstone‘s in it – he’s one of my favourite actors and always has been – I’d crawl over broken glass to work with him. But I don’t know what’s happening with it, I don’t know whether they’ve got the script in the right spot that we want it in, so who knows?Are you excited about Transporter 3 coming out?Transporter 3 I’m very excited about. I know from what we’ve shot, it has potential to be the best of the three. I’m going to see it next Friday for the first time, so I’ll know a bit more then. There’s a new girl, that Luke literally found on the streets of New York, she’s the new chick. We’ve got Corey Yoen back as the action choreographer, so there’s some great fight sequences, and Frank Martins just doing the same old thing.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"superman, Guild, kong, Fresh, Academy, wars, Plus, joker, News, Emmys, Video, Holidays","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rt-interview-jason-statham-chats-death-race-crank-2-and-the-sweeney"},{"id":"47613850500862","title":"Galaxy Quest Is Still the Best Movie about Fandom","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Galaxy Quest Is Still the Best Movie about Fandom20 years after it first premiered on Christmas Day of 1999, Galaxy Quest remains as charmingly earnest and eerily prescient as it ever was.by Rafael Motamayor | December 25, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by DreamWorks)Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe&nbsp;are currently&nbsp;two of the absolute biggest properties out there, so it&nbsp;might be easy to forget&nbsp;how much of a niche market sci-fi and comic-book fans in general would have represented just 20 years ago. Before San Diego Comic-Con became a huge phenomenon garnering coverage from pretty much every news outlet around, genre fans were often ostracized and mocked by mainstream media. Everything changed on Christmas Day of 1999, though, when we got an adventure-comedy&nbsp;that was not only a love letter to sci-fi shows like Star Trek, but also one of the first movies to embrace fan culture as something positive.Galaxy Quest&nbsp;has a simple premise: what if aliens watched a sci-fi TV show from Earth and,&nbsp;believing&nbsp;it was real, asked the stars of the show for help in defeating an alien general? The film overcame production issues, including a change in directors from Harold Ramis to&nbsp;one who had barely done any feature films – and certainly no sci-fi movies – to become a cult hit that remains beloved decades later. It was even voted as one of the best Star Trek films by fans (higher than Star Trek Into Darkness). For it’s 20th&nbsp;anniversary, let’s walk in the suns of Warvan and explore why the film that got us to never give up and never surrender still endures to this day.It Nails the Fan Convention Atmosphere(Photo by DreamWorks)Back in the ‘90s, pop culture conventions were niche events, not at all like the juggernauts akin to San Diego Comic-Con. When Galaxy Quest begins, we meet a group of washed-up actors from the eponymous fictional sci-fi TV series at one such convention. The vast majority of the fans are dressed up in cheap costumes based on their favorite characters, and they’re being amped up by a moderator who appeared in one episode (played by Sam Rockwell).When the actors finally show up, it’s a sight that will be familiar to anyone who’s ever attended a similar event. The main actor in Galaxy Quest,&nbsp;Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen,&nbsp;arguably at the peak of his career), thinks too highly of himself, arriving late and soaking in all the attention from the fans while overshadowing his former co-workers. He occupies an entire table himself to sign autographs, while the rest of the&nbsp;cast&nbsp;are forced to share a smaller one. Alexander Dane (the late, great Alan Rickman), another&nbsp;actor on the show, has become absolutely fed up with making convention appearances and dealing with fan after fan coming up to him and repeating his famous catchphrase – to be fair, he did play Richard III.Galaxy Quest depicts not only the absurdity and the pettiness of it all, but also the love that goes into attending these fan conventions. It also predicted the rise of these conventions in ways no one could have foreseen back in 1999. The film, clearly inspired by Star Trek and its loyal fanbase, came at a time when these types of&nbsp;events drew just a few thousand fans. Now,&nbsp;similar events have become&nbsp;so big that they now encapsulate the entirety of pop-culture, and the biggest one, the aforementioned San Diego Comic-Con, draws in over 100,000 fans annually, with major studios dropping big announcements and news outlets reporting on them.It’s a Legitimately Good Sci-Fi MovieOne of the reasons&nbsp;Galaxy Quest remains as beloved as it is today is that, unlike many parodies and spoofs, it still makes the effort to be a good sci-fi movie in and of itself. After Harold Ramis left the project, a relatively unknown director named Dean Parisot&nbsp;signed on, and he made sure that the film looked better than just a cheap knock-off of old Star Trek episodes, which is what the original plan called for. In the newly released documentary&nbsp;Never Surrender, producer Mark Johnson says that Parisot directed the film as a drama, focusing on the characters and elevating the movie from operating merely as an extended joke.That feeling of legitimacy comes from the fact that the technical aspects of the film make it look as good as most sci-fi movies from the time. Where Spaceballs&nbsp;and other parodies used their lower budget to make fun of the movies they’re parodying via cheaper recreations, Galaxy Quest aims to look as good as —&nbsp;if not better than — some of the&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;movies themselves. The special effects were created by Industrial Light and Magic, who had plenty of experience with the Star Trek franchise, and production designer Linda DeScenna, who did set decoration for the first Star Trek movie, also did the set decorations for Galaxy Quest.Never Surrender offers&nbsp;the impression that there were some differences of opinion on how “cheesy” the movie should ultimately be, but the end result erred on the side of realism in order to properly sell the drama of the characters. The creature effects were even created by Stan Winston, known for his work on The Thing, Jurassic Park, Aliens and more. Winston and his team meticulously recreated both the cheap effects that would be appropriate for the show-within-the-movie, like the headpiece worn by Alan Rickman’s character, and the look of the “real” aliens, who might feel right at home in the bigger-budget&nbsp;Star Wars or&nbsp;Star Trek movies.What makes Galaxy Quest special is that the movie is more than a parody, it’s an homage. It’s&nbsp;not funny at the expense of Star Trek and other sci-fi shows, and it doesn’t turn the staples of the genre into dick jokes like Spaceballs&nbsp;does. Instead, the film plays out as commentary, and it’s funny because everyone who worked on the movie loved and understood the genre and knew what elements were worth poking a bit of fun at, and what elements needed to be played completely straight.It Pays Respect to Obsessive FansArguably the main reason why Galaxy Quest became such a hit with fans is the way the movie approaches fandom. This is a movie that came out well before the mainstreaming of geek culture and Comic-Con, before&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and superheroes became part of the day-to-day conversation. In other words, the nerds and sci-fi fans of 1999 were more&nbsp;accustomed to being&nbsp;portrayed as basement-dwelling, D&amp;D-playing social misfits.Galaxy Quest‘s treatment of this niche culture is best represented by&nbsp;Brandon (Justin Long), a trivia-obsessed fan who uses his knowledge of the show to guide Nesmith and his crew through a replica of the spaceship and save their lives. The movie doesn’t ostracize fans or treat their obsessive cataloguing of pointless details as a waste of time. On the contrary, it treats fan obsession as an asset, which was innovative and way ahead of its time.The movie also depicts how fans can at times mistake fiction for reality. We learn that the Thermians, the aliens who have come to ask Nesmith and his fellow actors for help, have based their entire culture around the TV show, which they consider to be historical documents. Their enthusiasm at watching Nesmith step into the bridge is infectious, and they try to emulate the virtues of the characters in the show, while being completely blind to the many, many flaws of the extremely human people behind the costumes. By the end, their enthusiasm even manages to make the actors themselves embrace the heroic values their characters represent. Nesmith has been so immersed in the success his role had afforded him that he had never considered the positive effect&nbsp;it had on others, how he actually inspired them to do good, until the moment he becomes an actual hero – all thanks to some alien fans.It Predicted the Power of Fan Culture(Photo by DreamWorks)After the actors save the Thermians and return to Earth, they are greeted by a wave of enthusiastic fans at the convention, who cheer at the sight of a literal spaceship crashing into the convention center. The ending of the film reveals that Galaxy Quest the TV show subsequently enjoyed a new wave of popularity that resulted in a revival series, thanks to the fans.In this way, Galaxy Quest was again ahead of its time, as it came out before studios and networks realized the power of fans, but predicted that&nbsp;fans would be able to bring a beloved show back from the dead. It came out a mere three years before the Fox series&nbsp;Firefly, which was cancelled in 2003 after just one season and eventually saw a feature film continuation in 2005 after fans campaigned to bring it back.Though only 20 years old, Galaxy Quest feels like the beginning of a new era for nerd culture. It coincided with the release of Star Wars: Episode I and the rise of blogs and sites that generated online debate. It foresaw the release of major geek-friendly film franchises that weren’t merely cult favorites but bona fide blockbusters, like X-Men, Spider-Man, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. Fan conventions became gathering places for hundreds of thousands of like-minded individuals to camp out for days on end in order to catch a glimpse of their favorite pop-culture stars or a trailer for the new movie in their favorite franchise. Fans now not only drive the box office, but they manage to revive their favorite franchises much faster than they used to – just look at the near-instant renewal of Brooklyn Nine-Nine.Galaxy Quest may not be widely regarded as a key player in the rise of geek culture and fandom, but it should be; its influence can be seen in everything from the 2009&nbsp;Star Trek reboot to Marvel’s&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy movies. If there’s one thing this cult classic has taught us, it is to never give up, and never surrender.Galaxy Quest&nbsp;was released on December 25, 1999.#1Galaxy Quest (1999) 90%#1Adjusted Score: 95.451% Critics Consensus: Intelligent and humorous satire with an excellent cast -- no previous Trekkie knowledge needed to enjoy this one.Synopsis: For four years, the courageous crew of the NSEA Protector donned their uniforms and set out on thrilling and often...

In this special video series, we speak to the actors and filmmakers who made those moments happen, revealing behind-the-scenes details of how they came to be and diving deep into why they’ve stuck with us for so long.&nbsp;Once we’ve announced all 21, it will be up to you, the fans, to vote for which is the most memorable moment of all. In this episode of our ‘21 Most Memorable Moments’ series,&nbsp;star&nbsp;Haley Joel Osment&nbsp;remembers the moment he said that iconic&nbsp;Sixth Sense&nbsp;line, “I see dead people,”&nbsp;the terrifying parts of that scene that were cut, and how it changed his life.&nbsp;VOTE FOR THIS MOMENT&nbsp;IN OUR 21 MOST MEMORABLE MOVIE MOMENTS POLLTHE MOVIE:&nbsp;The Sixth Sense (1999)  86%It’s easy, sometimes, to forget just how huge The Sixth Sense was. The movie that put director M. Night Shyamalan on the map –&nbsp;and drew all of those “next Spielberg” headlines that would hang over him for the next two decades –&nbsp;was the second biggest movie of 1999. And 1999, let us remind you, was no weak year for movies: The Sixth Sense made more money than Toy Story 2, The Mummy, and The Matrix at the domestic box office, and was only beaten out by a little prequel called The Phantom Menace. More impressive than what it earned, though, was how thoroughly Sixth Sense swallowed up the zeitgeist. If you didn’t know that –&nbsp;block your screens, under-a-rock­–dwellers –&nbsp;Bruce Willis was dead all along, or couldn’t recite Haley Joel Osment’s famous line (whisper it with us: “I see dead people”), you had clearly checked out of pop culture. Here, Osment, who at age 11 was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Cole Sear in The Sixth Sense, recalls how he became involved in the movie, and how it shaped his life and career.“[The audition] was nerve-racking in a good way.”“I think M. Night was auditioning people all over the country…[and] it was only with the third audition that I read for Night and everybody together at the same time. It was almost like doing a play ’cause I’d done it so many times in advance. It was nerve-racking in a good way. When the material is so good, the writing is so great, it’s emotionally affecting. Sometimes with acting you have to reach into your own history and your own life to find inspiration for feeling certain ways and that’s an effective way of doing things. But other times the scenes were just so well constructed that just by going through it you’re just kinda taken to the places you need to go.”(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection.)“Seeing Bruce on screen was my first movie-going experience.”“My&nbsp;parents told me that&nbsp;[Die Hard]&nbsp;came out the year I was born and my parents went out and saw the movie while I slept in a little baby carrier in the theater. So I guess that seeing Bruce on screen was my first movie-going experience technically. I was really familiar with his work and I loved Die Hard and actually I think The Fifth Element had just come out and I enjoyed seeing that. And I think Twelve&nbsp;Monkeys was about the same time.”“Night would dribble a basketball sitting in his director’s chair.”“The tone [on set] was really set by Night. He would dribble a basketball sitting in his director’s chair when they were setting up the lights for each scene because he was so relaxed and on such an even-keel. He was, I think, 28 when we shot that movie. And you know, handling all the pressure and stress that comes with doing something like that, he was just one of the most fun, calming presences on set. And I don’t think it would have succeeded without that.”THE MOMENT: “I see Dead People”Osment revealed to Rotten Tomatoes that he was glad Twitter didn’t exist at the time of The Sixth Sense’s release, and it’s not hard to see why. Even 20 years since its release, the scene in which Sear confesses to Bruce Willis’s Dr. Malcolm that he sees the dead is a GIF- and meme-maker’s dream. Clear away the fog of all those comic “takes” and the memorable Scary Movie spoof, though, and the scene maintains a palpable power and sense of dread. It’s expertly constructed –&nbsp;rewatching the film, it’s as if Shyamalan’s camera is screaming at us to get the big twist right then –&nbsp;and made memorable by Osment’s incredibly intense and mature performance. The actor says achieving that level of intensity wasn’t hard –&nbsp;a part of the scene that wouldn’t make the final cut helped him get into the character of the terrified ghost-seer.(Photo by David McNew Online USA / Getty)“There was an even-more morbid element to that scene that actually ended up getting cut out.”“I was just sitting in a bed, doing this scene with Bruce and we’re in… I think it was a decommissioned hospital, but it was a very realistic and creepy place and it was just very easy to put myself in that zone. There was an even-more morbid element to that scene that actually ended up getting cut out: When I tell Bruce my secret, [at] the last shot of the scene they pull back from my bed and you look out the window where you can see another entire wing of the hospital and in every window there is a person with some horrible injury or someone who’s gone pale because, you know, being in a hospital is a pretty heavy place for a ghost to linger around in this world. So, you pull back and you see all these people lined up on the other side of the frame. That was cut out of the movie, but everybody was on set that day with all this intense prosthetic makeup – horrible car accident victims and everything and people were all made up; that added an additional level of morbidness on set that day.”“Nobody’s on set saying ‘Oh, this is the big line. This is going to be a big part of this movie’s legend.’”“Nobody circled that line or highlighted it or put it on the call sheet as a tag line or something that would come to kind of symbolize the film. I think it took us all by surprise when it sort of had a life of its own after the movie came out. I remember shooting the scenes very well. And even in preparing that scene, and shooting it and doing all that. [But] nobody’s on set saying ‘Oh, this is the big line. This is going to be a big part of this movie’s legend.’ It was just a significant line [in terms] of what my character reveals to Bruce in that scene.”(Photo by David McNew Online USA / Getty)“I was lucky there was no Twitter at the time.”“It took a while for [the line] to become what it became, but eventually yes, after that first year it came out it kinda became… I guess you would call it a ‘meme’ now. I was lucky there was no Twitter at the time –&nbsp;not just because the ending would have been spoiled for people once the movie came out. It’s wild, because even today, at the Dodger game a couple weeks ago, they had the inter-inning trivia games they play with the players on the big screen and Yasiel Puig did the line and I was like, ‘Oh wow!’ It comes when you least expect it.”THE IMPACT: A Meme, and A CareerSense remains the second biggest horror movie of all time, only surpassed by the remake of Stephen King’s It in 2017. Watching the&nbsp;film again 20 years after its release, it’s not hard to see why it held the world so firmly in its thrall back then. There’s the crafty plotting, sure, and the precision of Shyamalan’s filmmaking. And it helps that it was a horror film that grandma could watch (the gore is tame by today’s standards, and the movie was just PG-13). But it’s the performances, particularly from Toni Collette (who would also be nominated for an Oscar) and Osment that give the film an unshakable feeling of realness –&nbsp;these are people you know –&nbsp;and, in so doing, also make it one helluva scary ride.(Photo by David McNew Online USA / Getty)“[My friend] went and slept on his parents’ floor in the middle of the night because he was still scared.”“The first time I ever saw it all cut together was at a screening room on the Disney lot. I went with my family and my really good friend and his family. And he was also 11 and I remember I went and stayed at his house that night and he went and slept on his parents’ floor in the middle of the night because he was still scared. That was the first window for me into, ‘Wow, this movie really has an effect on people.’ I don’t know if he was scared of me, but he definitely wanted to be close to his parents on the other side of the house.”“It’s emotionally difficult to watch children go through things like that –&nbsp;even in a fictional story.”“I think it’s just really emotionally difficult to watch children go through things like that. Even in a fictional story, so I think that really sorta drags you into it because [Cole is] someone who’s being forced to handle all the difficult things at an age where you’re not really supposed to be handling anything like that. It’s weird for me to have been in that position, remember it as a 10-year-old, going back to it now that I’m an adult. I’m older than Night was when he wrote and directed it. It’s interesting to have that perspective after all these years.”(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures/ Courtesy: Everett Collection.)“It’s in many ways the start of a journey for me that continues to this day.”“That movie changed my life. It allowed me the opportunity to go on to work on all these other films that I enjoyed so much, so I will always be grateful to Night for making that possible. And just the experience itself of making that movie, I learned so much about acting and filmmaking, and it’s in many ways the start of a journey for me that continues to this day.”The Sixth Sense was released on June 2, 2017.&nbsp;Buy or rent it at FandangNOW.#1The Sixth Sense (1999) 86%#1Adjusted Score: 93.089% Critics Consensus: M Night Shayamalan's The Sixth Sense is a twisty ghost story with all the style of a classical Hollywood picture, but all the chills of a modern horror flick.Synopsis: In this chilling psychological thriller, eight-year-old Cole Sear is haunted by a dark secret: He is visited by ghosts.

Here are short reviews of these films, which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival.\"Stranger than Fiction\" has an ingenious concept. It’s the story of an average Joe (Will Ferrell) who realizes that he is living in the midst of a novel; a woman (Emma Thompson) is accurately narrating everything he does. Eventually, he learns from the voice that he is going to die, and he tries desperately to both find the author and take control of his own life story. It’s a setup that promises a Charlie Kauffman-esque meta meditation on the nature of art and life. However, despite some wry dialogue and an effectively restrained performance by Farrell, \"Stranger than Fiction\" never really transcends its central idea. It’s a bit disappointing that \"Fiction\" isn’t stranger.The essence of \"Little Children\" boils down to two five-word sentences: \"My love is a fever\" and \"please be a good boy.\" When key characters in the film read these words, they know exactly what they mean, because they’ve been thinking the same things. What first appears to be another attack on suburban yuppies evolves into something much deeper. From the moment they meet onscreen, Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson) share an undeniable chemistry; they see in each other an opportunity to transcend their mundane existences. But their bond begins as a platonic one; they hang out at the pool with their small children, content to enjoy each other’s company. One of the best things about \"Little Children\" is how real it all seems. Winslet and Wilson generate so much heat, and their characters are created with such attention to detail, that it’s easy to see how they drift toward each other. The other performances are just as fine; Jennifer Connelly is solid as Brad’s decent, albeit distant, wife; the child actors are uniformly excellent; and Jackie Earle Haley, as a man with a sexual predisposition toward children, pulls off a nearly impossible accomplishment: he makes his character an empathetic (if not sympathetic) creation, a man who knows he has little control over his sad, empty life. \"Little Children\" is an adult film in the best sense; it creates three-dimensional characters, sets them loose to do what they will, and trusts that we will understand.A scene from \"The Host.\"What is \"The Host?\" It’s a monster movie, a political satire, a wacky comedy, and a poignant look at the ties that bind a dysfunctional family. What’s surprising is how much of this bizarro South Korean import works. If nothing else, \"The Host\" does a great job of shifting tones and defying expectations. When a schoolgirl is abducted by a mutant fish monster, her slacker dad, archery champion aunt, alcoholic uncle and kindly grandfather undertake a Sisyphusian mission to rescue her; meanwhile, incompetent and overly bureaucratic governmental and military officials warn the public about a supposed virus emanating from the monster without stopping the creature itself. The CG effects are solid, the laughs are goofy, and there’s a real sweetness in the family’s search for the little girl, the only person in the clan that everyone truly likes. If there’s a complaint to be had, it’s that, at two hours, \"The Host\" is a little flabby. With a few trims, this could be a fanboy classic.Yep, that’s Sam Jackson.

Read on for more about Ghostbusters, Rambo, and Hulk vs. Wolverine news and get ready for a week packed with new releases like Doomsday, Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, and the long-awaited Dark City Director’s Cut!The Real Ghostbusters DVD set is comingChildren of the ’80s, start saving your pennies — The Real Ghostbusters animated series is coming to DVD for the first time in its entirety, after the scattered releases of select episodes in the past few years. The 25-disc set will be available November 1 and will include all 147 re-mastered episodes, 12 hours of bonus material, the complete spin-off series Slimer! And the Real Ghostbusters, a never-before seen pilot episode, commentary tracks, and more bits of trivia than you could fit in the Ecto-1. Click here for more information.Sylvester Stallone’s Rambo Director’s Cut confirmedIt was a bit surprising when Rambo actor-writer-director Sylvester Stallone announced his desire to make a director’s cut of his 2008 sequel (also known as John Rambo) while promoting the film’s DVD release last May. (We will admit, we hardly saw the need for it, other than to allay those pesky rotten reviews.) Now it seems that director’s cut is indeed in the works, as producer Cliff Stephenson confirmed at a Comic-Con producer’s panel. “There’s a slightly different, slightly longer version of Rambo coming out next year,” said Stephenson. “It’s definitely more emotional, more effective and it’s Stallone’s favorite cut of the film.” To which we ask: will the Rambo Director’s Cut up the ante and increase the number of on-screen deaths per minute (tallied at 2.59 bodies per 60 seconds by the LA Times‘ John Mueller)?(Also from the producer’s panel: expect Battlestar Galactica on Blu-Ray!)Hulk Smash, Wolverine Slash…Hulk vs. Wolverine DVD previewedIt’s one of the ultimate geeky hypothetical what-ifs: who would win in a fight between Wolverine and The Hulk? (Yes, we know Wolverine was first introduced in a Hulk comic.) Fans saw the pair duke it out onscreen last weekend when Lionsgate and Marvel joined forces to present a preview of their 2009 DVD film, Hulk vs. Wolverine, a 40-minute animated release pitting the two Marvel Universe characters against each other. (Another Hulk vs. film will see him fighting Thor.) According to IGN DVD editor Christopher Monfette, well-staged fight action and cameos by familiar faces will please fans…peep some of said action in Marvel’s teaser trailer below.Click for this week’s new releases!DoomsdayTomatometer: 48%Writer-director Neil Marshall goes all Mad Max on Hollywood with his third feature film (after the well-received horror flicks Dog Soldiers and The Descent), in which a team of specialists infiltrate a Scotland that’s been quarantined off for 30 years, where inside survivors have devolved into a race of lawless, tribal cannibals. Marshall based Rhona Mitra‘s tough chick agent Eden Sinclair on such bad-ass heroes as Snake Plisskin, but does his reverent homage to sci-fi action flicks rival the classics from whence Doomsday was borne?Bonus Features:While the movie itself may be distractingly derivative, it’s the high-octane, post-apocalyptic action that we’re after. Especially if you watch Doomsday on Blu-Ray. It’s Universal’s very first release in the HD format after joining the Blu-ray camp, and though the Picture-in-Picture Blu-ray feature allows for learning fun tidbits while watching the film, there are only a handful of mildly entertaining bonus features.Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo BayTomatometer: 54%When Tomatometer ratings are high, a movie is most likely good; when they’re in the teens, it’s most likely Razzie-worthy. But in some cases, a Tomatometer in the 50s denotes a film that split critics. Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay is such a film. You probably already know if you’ll like this sequel about stoner BFFs Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn); the bigger question to ask yourself about renting this on DVD is, “What Would NPH Do?”Bonus Features:Where Harold and Kumar are concerned, one must go Unrated. The H &amp; K faithful should definitely pick up the Unrated 2-Disc release, which includes the Choose Your Own Adventure-like “Dude, Change the Movie!” feature; choose alternate plotlines for the boys and see a whole new movie unveil at your fingertips, using specially shot extra footage. What if Kumar didn’t bring a bong onto the plane? Forget bottomless parties — go with a topless party instead! The pot-ibilities are endless.Never Back DownTomatometer: 25%Like a Kickboxer for the Facebook generation, Never Back Down tackles an up-and-coming sport phenomenon: Mixed Martial Arts. Unfortunately, star Sean Faris is no Jean-Claude Van Damme (but then, who is?) and director Jeff Wadlow’s “underground high school fight club” flick comes off as a cheesy, aggressive version of The Karate Kid, with Djimon Honsou as Faris’ Mr. Miyagi. Wax off, readers.Bonus Features:Summit Entertainment is releasing a 2-Disc Unrated and Extended “Beat Down” edition, and considering Never Back Down‘s triumphant “Best Fight” win at the MTV Movie Awards, perhaps that’s what some of you want. Others should just rent the single-disc DVD.Lost Boys: The TribeTomatometer: N/AThe Coreys are back! Both Corey Feldman and Corey Haim make appearances (though Haim’s part was reportedly cut out of the final edit) in the long-awaited, but not necessarily asked-for, sequel to 1987’s cult vampire flick. Feldman reprises his role as Edgar Frog, now a seasoned vampire hunter who comes to the aid of a teenager and his bloodsucker sister in this direct-to-video release. (And in a bizarre MPAA ruling, Lost Boys: The Tribe is rated R for “strong vampire violence.”)We’re bringing you two exclusive clips from Lost Boys: The Tribe…click here to watch the sinister beach bum vamps and Edgar Frog’s triumphant return to the screen!Bonus Features:Lost Boys: The Tribe comes in three versions: Standard, Uncut, and Blu-ray Uncut. Each version also has the same Corey-tastic extras, including Alternate Endings with the Frog Brothers, Edgar Frog’s Guide to Coming Back Alive, a behind-the-scenes featurette and music videos.Wargames: The Dead CodeTomatometer: N/AWhile we’re on the subject of direct-to-DVD resuscitations of 80’s franchises we all thought were long gone, there’s a new WarGames flick out — and before you ask, no, Matthew Broderick is not pulling a Corey Feldman and won’t appear in this sequel. Hunky Matt Lanter stars as a computer whiz kid who accidentally hacks into a government defense computer and…well, you pretty much know the story already. Fun throwback trivia: Director Stuart Gillard started out as a writer for The Sonny and Cher Show, helmed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III and one of the best episodes of The Road to Avonlea (“How Kissing Was Discovered”).Bonus Features:A retrospective look at the original WarGames film might have made an interesting feature, but the sequel’s creators keep it short and simple with only a photo gallery, a making-of featurette, and commentary with star Lanter and director Gillard.Shine a LightTomatometer: 86%Between 2006’s Oscar-winning The Departed and his upcoming fall thriller Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese found time to make a critically-acclaimed rock documentary about go-to soundtrack contributors The Rolling Stones. (Believe it or not, you won’t hear “Gimme Shelter” in this Scorsese flick.) Incredibly, Scorsese got a slate of filmmaking rock stars of his own to help out behind the camera, nabbing Oscar-winning cinematographers Robert Richardson (The Aviator), Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood), Andrew Lesnie (Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), and John Toll (Legends of the Fall), Oscar-nominee Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men), and other award-winning lensers to capture footage for the film.Bonus Features:Look for special appearances by Christina Aguilera, Jack White, Buddy Guy, former President Bill Clinton and former Presidential Democratic party primary candidate Hillary Clinton, documented further in a making-of documentary. Four additional songs accompany the release.The Band’s VisitTomatometer: 98%Eran Kolirin’s fish-out-of-water tale garnered incredible reviews and was a front-runner for Best Foreign Oscar last year when a controversial Academy ruling declared it ineligible; now’s your chance to see what the fuss was all about, as it makes its way to DVD.Bonus Features:There’s unfortunately not much in the way of extras beyond a photo gallery and making-of featurette. Still, cinephiles and Oscar-hounds should find it an interesting watch, if only to decide once if it could have been a contender.Dark City: Director’s CutTomatometer: N/AWith shades of noir, Metropolis, Blade Runner and the later-released Matrix series, Alex Proyas’ Dark City has earned cult status among the most popular science fiction films in recent memory. Ten years after its initial theatrical release, Dark City is finally getting the treatment it deserves — in a multilayered, extra-packed Director’s Cut that eliminates the film’s opening narration and adds never-before-seen footage.Bonus Features:At 15 minutes longer than the original version, Dark City The Director’s Cut is presented how writer-director Proyas intended and with enhanced picture and sound.

The plot is about the search for an Easter Egg, and each stage of that search is an easter egg unto itself. And then, every paragraph is laden with easter eggs of its own, references to video games and anime films and, more than anything else, the ’80s.Steven Spielberg‘s adaptation of&nbsp;Ready Player One, which hits theaters March 30, makes a lot of changes to Cline’s book — author-approved changes, mind you, as Cline co-wrote the screenplay — but the spirit of the novel remains intact. In particular, the film, like the book, includes a ton of easter eggs and references. So many, in fact, we think it would require Cline himself multiple viewings to pick them all up. (Spielberg admitted recently that the special effects artists were adding things even he didn’t even pick up on until he was making very final shot approvals).We don’t want to spoil the movie for you — half the fun of&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;is in its surprise pop-culture references. But we do want to help you get the most out of your viewing experience — so you’re ready to catch every little easter egg on offer. With that in mind, we’ve put together a spoiler-free guide to what you should watch before you join Parzival, Art3mis, and a whole bunch of ’80s-flavored easter eggs in the OASIS.Spielberg’s Entire Oeuvre&nbsp;(OK, maybe not&nbsp;Schindler’s List)(Photo by ©Universal)And maybe not Munich, or Amistad or The Post. And definitely not War Horse. But there are tons of nods to and cameos from Spielberg’s big blockbuster hits, especially the one about the dinos. The Spielberg gems come thick and fast and pretty early in the pic —&nbsp;so eyes out. It all makes a bunch of sense, given that the filmmakers had to secure the rights for every easter egg they use here. And it has us imagining a Spielberg-directed Ready Player One sequel, full of easter eggs referencing the original Spielberg-directed Ready Player One: Our pop-culture–loving minds were just blown.Child's Play (1988)  71%Famous ’80s slashers abound in Ready Player One — if you’ve seen the trailer, you know Freddy and Jason are back for their first reunion since carving up a member of Destiny’s Child in Freddy vs. Jason. But it’s scene-stealing killer doll Chucky who gets the most love, and screen time, from Spielberg. We weren’t able to spot his Bride or his Seed anywhere, but maybe you will.Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)  93%(Photo by © TriStar)As if you needed a reason to revisit James Cameron’s genre-defining sci-fi action classic. We won’t say when, what or how T2 is referenced, but Steven Spielberg said during a South By Southwest Q&amp;A that this is his favorite easter egg in the movie.Back to the Future (1985)  96%(Photo by (c)Universal)There are blink-and-you’ll miss them references to Robert Zemeckis’s 1980s favorite throughout, and the director himself is called out by name. In fact, the whole movie feels undergirded by the spirit of Marty McFly and his journeys back and forth through time. So, it’s worth watching Back to the Future just to prep for the vibes. The most obvious allusion to the movie, though —&nbsp;and we’re not spoiling anything here if you’ve seen the trailers —&nbsp;is the DeLorean that Parzival drives when he is inside the OASIS.The Iron Giant (1999)  96%(Photo by ©Warner Bros. Pictures)One of the most beloved animated movies of the 1990s —&nbsp;and one of the most critically adored, with 96% on the Tomatometer —&nbsp;is used to great effect in Ready Player One. The giant robot’s role has been amped up considerably in the transition from book to film, a decision that seems to have paid off. When Spielberg first revealed the big guy in footage shown at Comic-Con last year, fans went wild; expect similar reactions in your theater when the Giant gets his big moments.Saturday Night Fever (1977)  82%Fans of the book will be excited to hear that Parzival and Art3mis make it to virtual nightclub, the Distracted Globe. And once there, well, it’s Dance Dance Revolution by way of John Travolta.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)  90%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Don’t expect to spot rogue Oompa Loompas in Ready Player One, or to spy a long-lost Augustus Gloop shooting through a random chocolatey tube somewhere in the background. Watch this wonderfully bizarre family classic to get a sense of the story beats. Wonka’s mysterious chocolate factory is a world of pure imagination, just like the OASIS, and danger lurks in both.Street Fighter (1994)  13%(Photo by ©Universal)OK, maybe skip the movie and bring a bucket full of coins to an arcade that still has Street Fighter 2. If you’ve seen the trailer, you know the battle scenes feature a cavalcade of your favorite kicking, punching and hadouken-ing SF2 fighters. And there is a moment near the end of the movie that will blow… no, nope, we’re not saying anything else. But while you’re in video game mode, do brush up on Halo, Overwatch, and all your N64 classics.King Kong (1933)  98%King Kong, 1933New York City’s favorite furry menace is central to one of Parzival’s key challenges, and that’s all we will say. You could dangle us from the top of the Empire State Building and we still wouldn’t tell you which one.Akira (2020)  90%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Like Ernest Cline’s book, Steven Spielberg’s film is littered with anime references. The most-front-and-center anime easter egg, though, comes in the form of the bike Art3mis (Olivia Cooke) rides. Yes, that’s Kaneda’s famous red motorbike from Akira.Say Anything... (1989)  98%The references in Ready Player One the book are broad. It wasn’t just about Spielberg movies and comics and Atari and anime; there were dramas and interesting novels and, yes, romcoms. And so it is with the film. You probably don’t need to rewatch the whole movie to get the key reference —&nbsp;just do a Google images search of the title —&nbsp;but there are worse ways to spend your time than enjoying a 98% Fresh classic.Mad Max (1979)  90%(Photo by ©Warner Bros)Spielberg told Rotten Tomatoes that there are strong narrative parallels between Parzival’s journey and Max Rockatansky’s. “It’s a journey, it’s a chase, it’s a race,” said Spielberg. “There’s a goal in all of them… Mad Max is evocative of what we did here.” (Also, look around in Halliday’s office.)Check out Movieclips’ Reference Guide for&nbsp;Ready Player One:","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Video, golden, SundanceTV, Reviews, Century, Access, Cosplay, killer, Tomatazos, movies, books, TV, GoT, FOX, Funimation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"ready-player-one-easter-eggs-watchlist-what-to-see-before-seeing-spielbergs-latest"},{"id":"47613862380292","title":"Brad Renfro: 1982-2008","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Brad Renfro: 1982-2008Rest in peace, Mr. Renfro.by Jeff Giles | January 17, 2008 |  CommentsBrad Renfro, star of The Client and Apt Pupil, passed away Tuesday of unknown causes.

Family members told the press she was stabilized after being admitted to an L.A. hospital, but her condition worsened; according to&nbsp;family spokesman Simon Hall, Fisher died at 8:55 a.m. on Dec. 27.Long before acquiring her own fame, Fisher was a member of Hollywood royalty. Born in Beverly Hills on Oct. 21, 1956 to singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds, she saw the best and the worst of the entertainment industry from a very young age; her parents went through a very public split after her father left the family when she was two, leaving the family in the middle of a lasting tabloid scandal.Fisher’s knack for fictional drama manifested itself early on. She picked up an early stage credit at the age of 15, appearing alongside her mother in the 1973 Broadway revival of Irene, then made her film debut two years later, opposite Warren Beatty in the classic satire Shampoo.&nbsp;That auspicious beginning was just a prelude, however, for the stratospheric rise her career took after she landed what would prove to be the role of a lifetime — Princess Leia in Star Wars.The original 1977 film’s massive success led to a pair of blockbuster sequels, both of which Fisher returned for, making her a household name even as Leia’s increasingly iconic status threatened to typecast Fisher’s future efforts. To her immense credit, after the original trilogy concluded with 1983’s Return of the Jedi, Fisher quickly diversified, drawing acclaim for her efforts in a variety of creative disciplines.Admirably open about her struggles with addiction and bipolar disorder, Fisher used a 1985 stint in rehab as part of the grist for her debut novel, 1987’s semi-autobiographic Postcards from the Edge; a bestselling critical success, it served as the first in a series of fictional and non-fictional literary efforts and ultimately inspired a screen adaptation — written by Fisher herself — starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine.After embarking on her new career as an author, Fisher also branched out into work as a script doctor, spending roughly 15 years as one of the industry’s more sought-after uncredited writers while salvaging screenplays for a list of films that included Hook, Lethal Weapon 3, Sister Act, and The Wedding Singer. During this period she also returned to the stage, penning and starring in the one-woman show Wishful Drinking, later commemorated with a documentary and autobiographical book of the same name.Fisher’s film career came full circle with the start of a new Star Wars trilogy, which commenced with Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm and hiring of director J.J. Abrams to helm what ultimately became 2015’s The Force Awakens. One of many members of the original trilogy’s cast to return, Fisher reprised her role again for 2017’s Episode VIII, for which she completed filming shortly before her death.Fisher is survived by her mother,&nbsp;her brother Todd, her half sisters Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher, and her daughter Billie Lourd, who shared her “very deep sadness” in a statement that concludes, “She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly.”For Carrie Fisher’s complete filmography on Rotten Tomatoes, click here.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"action, Hallmark, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"carrie-fisher-1956-2016"},{"id":"47613881185038","title":"Trailer Bulletin: The Ice Harvest","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Trailer Bulletin: The Ice Harvestby Scott Weinberg | August 29, 2005 |  CommentsHarold Ramis‘ ensemble heist comedy \"The Ice Harvest\" doesn’t hit the screens for a few months, but fans of John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Oliver Platt, Connie Nielsen, and Randy Quaid might want to check the (WMP) trailer out right here.Focus Features contributes a general plot synopsis: \"A wickedly funny thriller that takes moviegoers on a wild ride brimming with larceny, lust and lethal behavior.

To most fans, the question was: what took them so long? Their chemistry in every episode of the show was palpable. But six years later, we get to see them&nbsp;again in the new six episode X-Files series. SPOILER ALERT —&nbsp;We’re sorry to report that Scully and Mulder have split in the time since their last adventure.Actually, it gives the new show a great place to start when they are reunited. An internet conspiracy theorist (Joel McHale) presents Mulder (David Duchovny) with some convincing evidence of a new conspiracy. Scully (Gillian Anderson) remains skeptical, but even she finds reasons to believe. Anderson sat down with Rotten Tomatoes and other Television Critics Association reporters for a round of questions.Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: Were you as excited as all of us were to find out where Scully and Mulder were after all these years?Gillian Anderson: I was. I don’t think I had any expectations when I went into reading the first script and into the series at all. But when I read it, I thought, “You know what? That feels exactly right. That feels exactly where we need to be with this at this juncture.”Rotten Tomatoes: Was it bittersweet to find out that they had parted?Anderson: No.Rotten Tomatoes: Is it actually better dramatic material this way?Anderson: Definitely.Q:&nbsp;Some people shy away from returning to a famous character of theirs. Were you ready to inhabit Scully again?Anderson: I think so. I’ve worked really hard to shed her for such a long time, and I think felt like I had enough other work under my belt that, perhaps by taking it on again, it wouldn’t pigeonhole me. So hopefully that will be the case. I think it took me a long time to embrace it after we were done with the series. I think it took a good decade for me to suddenly start thinking of it as the gift that it was and to properly appreciate the opportunity that I had and also how fortunate I was to play such a great iconic character in a show that was iconic in and of itself, and for such a long time and that it could have been something else. It could have been something that I hated or had bad reviews.&nbsp; So I was very lucky, and I think it suddenly hit me some time later.Q: Scully is still the skeptic but she’s finding hard evidence. How does that change the characters?Anderson: We’re going to have to see as the series goes on a little bit further, because we’re only at the very beginning. Not all of the episodes deal with that part of the storyline and the mythology in that way. I think almost in the next episode it might be that didn’t necessarily even happen. As they used to, we jump very much in time. You’ll know when we get back to that subject matter, but it might not necessarily be in order, so to speak.Rotten Tomatoes: When Chris Carter told you there was going to be a comedy episode, what did you think of that?Anderson: I expected it. There had to be. I wouldn’t have done it if there wasn’t!Rotten Tomatoes:&nbsp;What sort of funny things do you get to do in it?Anderson: I can’t tell you anything. Just the same old, a lot of things like we used to do. So there were a lot of moments where we’re like, “Oh my God, we’re doing this again!”Q:&nbsp;Are there going to be any horrifying episodes in this six?Anderson: It’s so hard to tell because when we’re in it, it’s not until there’s audience reaction. We knew “Home” was freaky, but we didn’t realize that people were going to find it so freaky. So I’m not sure if I’m always the one who has the right perspective on it, because when we’re in it, I might get the sense of it to a degree when I’m reading it, but I’m not even sure if I do anymore in that respect. It’s after everything else has been added, so I don’t know.Rotten Tomatoes: Were you excited by the idea that conspiracy theorists have become a lot more public than they were since The X-Files?Anderson: I don’t know if I’ve ever had that thought before you just said that right then. The fact is that people have always approached us about it. It’s been a topic of our lives more than probably most people’s lives, so I’m so used to it. It doesn’t actually make me flinch.Q: What are some ways that the ability to dig up this information has changed?Anderson: I think you have to talk to Chris about that, because I’ve never really been a part of that research. Even on the episode I did, we had researchers. Obviously, with the world of the world wide web right now, it’s going to be easier to access stuff than it ever had before, but I don’t know what their process was.Q: Has anything fundamentally changed about the way Scully pursues information?Anderson: I’m trying to figure out whether there’s any examples of it in the episodes that we have. They go to their phones to find stuff like everybody does. That’s different. Having the laptop open to search stuff in the episodes, that’s different.Rotten Tomatoes: Did you develop any new skills doing The Fall and Hannibal that you were able to apply to Scully this time around?Anderson: I think it was actually more important to let go of those skills in order to get back to the essence of who she was, so that I didn’t get held up. That was more challenging than I expected.Q: Was it really difficult to let go of Dr. Du Maurier from Hannibal?Anderson: No, it’s not that. No, no, no. Not at all. I guess more with Stella [in The Fall] and playing Stella so much more recently. Here we’ve got another, for all intents and purposes, investigative officer at some point. Remembering how they differ and to what degree and what it is that makes them differ, so that when I’m answering questions or even just listening, that it’s Scully’s listening face and not Stella’s listening face. It’s that stuff.Q: The X-Files was very much of its time. How is this arc of 2016?Anderson:&nbsp;Well, I think the subject matter that is evident in the first episode, which is again, conspiracy, etc. but the climate of not just conspiracy especially by government, but in terms of how we’re listened to and how we’re controlled and how events have manifested around the world in a completely different way because of that information, etc. are all parts of this first episode. We touch on it, as you have seen, everything that is current that has to do with the things that we have always been interested in.

Fans have been waiting 14 years to see Scully and Mulder again and only had one movie sequel, The&nbsp;X-Files: I Want To Believe to tide them over. The cast and creator Chris Carter met with the Television Critics Association to introduce the new series, where Carter revealed he actually wrote a third movie script and scrapped it to conceive this six-episode series instead.Rotten Tomatoes joined a group of reporters speaking to David Duchovny about his return to the role that made him famous, FBI agent Fox Mulder. When we pick up with Mulder, an internet conspiracy theorist (Joel McHale) convinces him to resume his pursuit of the truth. While back on the FBI payroll, Mulder and Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate some other new cases too, including a were-monster.Fred Topel for Rotten Tomatoes: Has it been fun to play Mulder as the skeptical one in a role reversal?David Duchovny: It’s difficult because Mulder was always the engine of the show, was the guy putting his foot on the gas. It was more familiar to me once Mulder got reinvested in The X-Files after the first episode.Rotten Tomatoes: Even in the third episode, for comedic purposes, he’s like, “This can’t be a monster.”Duchovny: That’s a Darren Morgan episode. In these six — and it’s a very interesting thing because we always did it on the show — it was really like doing a different show almost from week to week on The X-Files even back in the day. It’s very tricky as an actor to try to find the right tone all the time on this particular show. A thriller, a horror, a mystery, a quest, a comedy. You’re right to point that out. I was skeptical; I’m skeptical in the first episode and I’m playing it again in a comedic way. Think about it as a gift to the actors and a real challenge to try to play it in different keys.Q: Do you look forward to playing Mulder more and more, revisiting him again?Duchovny: When I left the show and when we ended the show, the idea that I was talking about with Chris was to come back and do movies. We did the second one in 2008 and there just didn’t seem to be an appetite at Fox for the movie anymore, which surprises me, because we’re a homegrown property. It’s not some crappy comic book that you’re going to dig up and breathe life into. I’ve never understood. I think there’s probably more money in television, for them. That’s probably why they want to do it. When television reinvented itself in terms of its seasonal quality and the amount of episodes it demands, it became obvious to all of us that we could come back and do it in a way that would suit us at this point in our lives. As much as I would’ve wanted to get away from Mulder at a certain point, I always hoped and knew that if there was a demand we’d be able to come back and revisit from time to time. This would be now.Rotten Tomatoes: Did you ever read Chris’s third movie script?Duchovny: No, that’s the first I heard of it. I’m going to ask him for that later.Q:&nbsp;What do your kids think of this? Have they seen The X-Files?Duchovny: They’ve seen some. My son has seen more than my daughter. They’re excited about it coming on. They’re very excited about it coming on. I’m kind of happy. The last very visible thing I would’ve done is Californication. There’s no way they’re going to watch that. So I’m happy that they’re going to get a chance to see this. Although, they watched Aquarius,&nbsp;but this is more up their alley.Q:&nbsp;Could you ever see somebody else playing Mulder?Duchovny: My role? No, I don’t know how you could.Q:&nbsp;Would you ever want to go back to The X-Files as a series?Duchovny: Not a full series, no. Not every year. I think we could do more than six. We could do eight or 10. It depends on how it does. It depends on if people really want to see it. I feel like they do. I feel like it’s going to do really well so I imagine I would bet that we would come back and do another iteration. I’m not sure how many but it’ll never be 22 or 24 episodes. We’re just too old to work that hard.Rotten Tomatoes: Did you ever think you’d see the day when conspiracy theorists like Mulder were so prolific and had so many forums to express their views?Duchovny: That sounds like a nightmare. Is that happening? That is kind of the world we live in, isn’t it? It has its good points and its bad points, I guess. There’s so much information available, and there’s not a real vetting process of what’s true and what’s false. I’m much more old school, pre-Google. We had an encyclopedia in my house.&nbsp; That’s kind of where I got my information. I think I still live in that world.Q: What was it like going to the cemetery with headstones for Kim Manners and Jack Hardy?Duchovny: I knew Kim very well. Jack less so. Kim is a part of the show and he’s missed. He’s missed as a person and obviously as a director on the show. It was probably Darren. It might’ve been Chris but it was probably Darin Morgan because it was his episode. It’s sad but sweet as well.Q:&nbsp;Do you prefer standalone episodes to mythology episodes?Duchovny: I don’t say I enjoy one more than the other. They have different challenges. It’s just that’s what keeps the show fresh for an actor. It’s a cop show. It’s an FBI show, but it’s not really a procedural in that way. Procedurals can get pretty dull for the actors. Aside from having an interesting relationship to play within the procedural, there’s also, as I said, these changes of tone, these changes of subject matter. The frame of the show itself is incredibly flexible. I can’t think of any other show that had the same actors in it. You’ve got something like The Twilight Zone, that’s different actors. When you think about it, it’s very challenging and interesting to an actor to have to go in and do one of Chris’s episodes and then turn around and do one of Darren’s episodes. I think because it’s natural to us, just because we’ve been doing it for so long, it seems de rigueur, but it’s quite crazy when you think about it, and scary. I would be in middle of a Darren episode and somebody described it as a sitcom. It’s like, “Holy s–t, what are we doing? Is this really working?” We don’t know. It’s a little trippy.Q: After all these years, when did this new series become real for you?Duchovny: Just right now. Just this moment. I think when I received the first script, you know, obviously I knew I was going to do it.&nbsp; We were signed to do it at that point.&nbsp; But the work or the kind of imaginative reality of it, which is always, to me, the only reality of it.&nbsp; Probably when I got that first script and started to think about, “How are we going to do this?&nbsp; What do we do?&nbsp; What do we do now?”Q:&nbsp;Did you have to be convinced to come back?Duchovny: Well, for me, the experience of doing The X-Files, obviously from the beginning, I had no say in what was going on. It was&nbsp; one of my first jobs, and I was just happy to be working and happy that the scripts were interesting and good. But later on, I had more interest in writing or in adjusting sometimes with the scripts. But the trust that I have in Chris as the runner of the show, as the creator of the show, as the conceiver of the show, is complete. I don’t question Chris. If he says he’s got an idea and it’s going to work, six, eight, ten episodes, whatever, Chris is a serious person and an artist.&nbsp; If he says he’s got a way to make it work, I trust that.Q: Did you discover anything new about Gillian working with her this time?Duchovny: I think being able to have that history and to let it play in a scene. I think at this point, having known each other and worked together so much for over 20 years, we’ve gone beyond chemistry into history, which is a really cool thing to play as well, because you don’t have to play either. Well, if you don’t have chemistry, you’ve got to figure out a way to make it happen, but if you have history, we’ve all seen movies and television shows where you see a mother and daughter or father and son and you’re like , “There’s no way. It doesn’t feel right. There no history. It doesn’t feel like history.”&nbsp; Gillian and I actually have history, so we don’t have to play it.Season ten of The X-Files&nbsp;premieres on Sunday, January 24 on FOX after football.

For the first time, mutants have a choice: retain their uniqueness, though it isolates and alienates them, or give up their powers and become human. The opposing viewpoints of mutant leaders Charles Xavier, who preaches tolerance, and Magneto, who believes in the survival of the fittest, are put to the ultimate test — triggering the war to end all wars.\"Many fans of the legendary X-Men comic series are upset over Fox’s apparent decision to end the film series here, when scores more stories and characters exist in the history of the comic.

The magical kingdom.by Jeff Giles | August 22, 2007 |  CommentsHere’s yet another story about filmmakers teaming up to resurrect an old property that, by all accounts, did just fine for itself the first time around — but in this case, the possibilities are intriguing enough that we don’t even mind it’s a remake. According to Variety, Todd McFarlane (creator of Spawn) will be working with screenwriter Josh Olson (A History of Violence) to produce what’s being called “a revisionist take” on The Wizard of Oz.Should be interesting, no?As some of you might recall, this isn’t technically McFarlane’s first trip down the yellow brick road — he launched a line of Oz toys a few years back that included a Dorothy that looked like…well, this:But don’t freak out just yet, Oz fans. Olson’s vision for the project is a little less extreme. From the article:“I saw those toys, and Dorothy as some bondage queen isn’t something I want to do…the appealing thing about the Baum books to me is how wildly imaginative they are. There are crazy characters from amazing places. I want this to be ‘Harry Potter’ dark, not ‘Seven‘ dark.”And McFarlane agrees:“My pitch was ‘How do we get people who went to ‘Lord of the Rings’ to embrace this?’ I want to create (an interpretation) that has a 2007 wow factor. You’ve still got Dorothy trapped in an odd place, but she’s much closer to the Ripley from ‘Alien‘ than a helpless singing girl.”Of course, this isn’t the first time someone has tried splashing a new coat of paint on the Oz stories — 1985’s Return to Oz, starring a young Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, was roundly criticized at the time for being too scary for kids. (Which was ironic, considering that it probably hewed closer to L. Frank Baum’s original series of books than the first movie did, but you can’t win ’em all.)No director or release date has been announced for the project, which will be released through a partnership between Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures.Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Central, Awards, stoner, emmy, TIFF, renewals, Rock, Avengers, The, Superheroes, adventure, Pop, nightmare, OneApp, Biopics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"todd-mcfarlane-new-wizard-of-oz"},{"id":"47613897945879","title":"High-Impact \"Flyboys\" Battle Clip Online","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})High-Impact \"Flyboys\" Battle Clip Onlineby Scott Weinberg | August 29, 2006 |  CommentsYou’ve probably already seen the half-flashy, half corny trailer for Tony Bill‘s \"Flyboys\" by now, and if so you probably remember some of the cool-looking bi-plane dogfights.

Who's playing them? How closely will the story mirror the games? We break it all down.by James Grebey | February 19, 2021 |  CommentsGet over here! — because we’ve got all the info you’ll need about the upcoming Mortal Kombat&nbsp;movie. An action-packed, R-rated adaptation of the classic fighting video game series, Mortal Kombat looks like it might be the rare video game movie that’s actually pretty good (or, at least, pretty fun). Here’s the rundown on what to expect from the film, which comes out on April 16.IT WILL PREMIERE IN THEATERS AND ON HBO MAX(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Mortal Kombat, like all of Warner Bros.’ 2021 movies, will be available to stream on HBO Max for no additional cost on the same day it premieres in theaters, on April 16, 2021. WarnerMedia, which owns both the famed film studio and the streaming service, made the somewhat controversial decision due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as it’s still unclear when the masses will be able or willing to see movies in theaters. Mortal Kombat will open in theaters (including in Imax) on April 16, but it can also be safely streamed at home, though&nbsp;the film will only be available on HBO Max for one month&nbsp;before&nbsp;going down the traditional premium VOD route.IT’S DIRECTED BY SOMEBODY WITH VIDEO GAME EXPERIENCEMortal Kombat was directed by Simon McQuoid, and while it’s&nbsp;the Australian director’s feature film debut, he’s a fairly prolific director of commercials. And, crucially for those wondering if he has the chops to helm a big action movie based on a video game, McQuoid has directed ads for Call of Duty and Halo.&nbsp;Greg Russo, who co-wrote the script with Dave Callaham (The Expendables,&nbsp;Wonder Woman 1984), is another relative unknown, but Aquaman director James Wan is producing, which bodes well.THE FIRST TRAILER SHOWCASES&nbsp;THE FRANCHISE’S BRUTAL STREAK(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)An ad for HBO Max’s upcoming slate of movies featured a quick glimpse of Mortal Kombat earlier this year, but the first proper trailer debuted on February 18. Fans of the video game series and its notoriously violent finishing movies will be pleased to know that there’s a “red band” trailer — essentially meaning the trailer itself is rated-R. Considering that Kano drops an F-bomb and there’s tons of bloody, gory action (Sub-Zero stabs Scorpion with his own frozen blood!), the trailer seems like a fitting promotion for the movie, which is decidedly R-rated. The final few seconds alone, a quick montage of several of the “fatalities” — the infamously graphic finishing blows from the game series — seem to merit the rating.(ALMOST) EVERY CLASSIC MORTAL KOMBAT CHARACTER IS IN IT(Photo by ©New Line Cinema)So far, there’s really only one character from the original Mortal Kombat arcade game who hasn’t been confirmed to appear in the 2021 movie: Johnny Cage, the Hollywood action star-turned-champion who was the ostensible protagonist of the 1995 movie. The new Mortal Kombat stars Lewis Tan, best known for Into the Badlands and Wu Assassins, who&nbsp;plays&nbsp;a brand-new character (as far as we know) named Cole Young, an MMA fighter with a birthmark shaped just like the Mortal Kombat logo, meaning he’s destined to fight in the iconic tournament.However, there are plenty of other familiar faces. Joining Cole in his fight to defend Earth are Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), a special forces officer; Kano (Josh Lawson), an Aussie mercenary with a laser eye who is typically more villainous than he appears to be here; Liu Kang (Ludi Lin), a Shaolin monk with fire powers; Kung Lao (Max Huang), a Chinese warrior with a razor-sharp hat; and Jax Briggs (Mehcad Brooks), another special forces officer who has robotic arms following a run-in with a certain chilly ninja. Lord Raiden (Tadanobu Asano), a god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm, will serve as a mentor for the forces of good.(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)On the other side stands Shang Tsung (Chin Han), the right-hand-man of Shao Khan, the ruler of the mystical realm of Outworld. Mileena (Sisi Stringer), a fighter with a gnarly mouth, also appears in the trailer, as does Goro, the four-armed champion.And, of course, Sub-Zero and Scorpion, arguably the two most famous Mortal Kombat characters, appear as well. The former, a deadly warrior with the ability to control ice, is played by Joe Taslim, who has proven his martial arts bona fides in movies like The Raid and&nbsp;The Night Comes for Us,&nbsp;and he appears to the film’s major villain. The latter, an undead ninja whose name in life was Hanzo Hasashi, is played by veteran actor&nbsp;Hiroyuki Sanada, who is probably best known outside of Japan for his roles in&nbsp;The Last Samurai,&nbsp;Westworld, and&nbsp;Danny Boyle’s Sunshine.THE SYNOPSIS PROMISES PLENTY OF ACTION(Photo by New Line Cinema &amp; Warner Bros. Pictures)The Mortal Kombat games do have a fairly complex mythology — there’s a plot reason why all those fighters need to throw hands. Essentially, Shang Tsung, the emperor of another realm called Outworld, has his sights set on conquering our world, otherwise known as Earthrealm. However, in order to get permission to start the conquest, Outworld’s champions need to defeat Earthrealm’s champions in a contest known as Mortal Kombat. The movie appears to be following the same basic set-up, though the specifics may vary, of course.Here’s the official synopsis, per Warner Bros.:“In Mortal Kombat, MMA fighter Cole Young, accustomed to taking a beating for money, is unaware of his heritage—or why Outworld’s Emperor Shang Tsung has sent his best warrior, Sub-Zero, an otherworldly Cryomancer, to hunt Cole down. Fearing for his family’s safety, Cole goes in search of Sonya Blade at the direction of Jax, a Special Forces Major who bears the same strange dragon marking Cole was born with. Soon, he finds himself at the temple of Lord Raiden, an Elder God and the protector of Earthrealm, who grants sanctuary to those who bear the mark. Here, Cole trains with experienced warriors Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and rogue mercenary Kano, as he prepares to stand with Earth’s greatest champions against the enemies of Outworld in a high-stakes battle for the universe. But will Cole be pushed hard enough to unlock his arcana — the immense power from within his soul — in time to save not only his family, but to stop Outworld once and for all?”That sounds like what most viewers would expect, more or less, so it’ll be the action that determines whether or not the film will win fans over. Judging from the trailer, it looks like&nbsp;Mortal Kombat has that part nailed.IT’S THE THIRD MORTAL KOMBAT MOVIE (AND POTENTIALLY THE SECOND GOOD ONE)(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)Movies based on video games are typically thought of as uniformly terrible, though that’s starting to change. Last year’s Sonic the Hedgehog movie was, perhaps surprisingly, quite well-received, as was Detective Pikachu the year before. The 1995 big screen adaptation of&nbsp;Mortal Kombat&nbsp;is generally considered to be one of the better video game movies ever made, and it has become something of a cult classic (its defenders make a much better case for it than its Tomatometer&nbsp;score might suggest). The 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat Anhiliation, however, is universally considered to be pretty awful. So, if 2021’s Mortal Kombat is any good, it stands a chance of winning the title of best Mortal Kombat movie.Expect a violent fatality if it does.Mortal Kombat will premiere in theaters and on HBO Max on April 16, 2021.On an Apple device?

And if the star, the director, and the concept weren’t interesting enough, the flick is now cobbling together a solid supporting cast.From Variety: \"Mos Def, Melonie Diaz, Mia Farrow and Danny Glover have joined the cast of Michel Gondry’s comedy \"Be Kind Rewind,\" starring Jack Black. Shooting starts Sept. 5 in Passaic, N.J. New Line won the bidding last spring for domestic distribution rights.Gondry also scripted \"Rewind,\" in which Black will portray a goofball who becomes magnetized trying to sabotage a power plant and then erases all the tapes in the videostore while visiting a pal (played by Mos Def) who works there and his co-worker (Diaz).

But what about when the situation is flipped? We thought it was worth taking a look at the opposite scenario, when movies that largely resonate well with audiences are savaged by critics.We looked at a number of films with low Tomatometer ratings and high Audience Scores to determine what, if anything, might result in the critical dismissal of horror flicks that moviegoers hold near and dear to their hearts. There’s a bit of the occult, a dash of religious panic, and a few choices that are a little wacky. On top of that, we even discovered a few franchises that managed to defy expectations and consistently strike a chord with their fans over several installments, even as critics pooh-poohed them.So read on to see what horror flicks you loved and critics didn’t, and let us know where you fall on the entries listed below. Then, go back and check out our list of movies that critics loved and audiences shunned to see if that matches your tastes any better!Event Horizon (1997)  29%Audience Score: 61%Divide: 37 percentage pointsCritics were not all that kind to this gruesome combination of space adventure and supernatural horror, but there’s no denying that the movie has become a cult classic of the modern era. Just mention this movie on Twitter and watch how many people respond!Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008)  40%Audience Score: 72%Divide: 37 pointsFilmmaker Darren Bousman probably doesn’t mind all that much that critics don’t love his offbeat, fan-friendly horror musical mash-ups, because his target audience sure does. Repo! has more than its fair share of vocal supporters, as does The Devil’s Carnival, which presently enjoys an 87% approval rating among movie watchers.The Covenant (2006)  4%Audience Score: 62%Divide: 58 pointsNow this one just boggles my mind. I like a whole lot of goofy horror films but I cannot image what 62% of the audience enjoyed about this patently ridiculous tale of four young warlocks who get up to no good. Then again, the movie is full of handsome young men, so perhaps that explains some of the audience approval.The Reaping (2007)  8%Audience Score: 49%Divide: 41 pointsOne of those occult thrillers in which a professional skeptic who has seen it all finally faces something she cannot explain in a creepy location. Something that deals with biblical plagues. I think. Pretty sure I fell asleep during this one.The Phantom of the Opera (2005)  33%Audience Score: 84%Divide: 51 pointsYes, the musical. It’s only tangentially a horror film but we had to include it because wow: 84% of the audience liked this adaptation? One can only assume that’s a lot of residual fandom and goodwill from people who adore the stage version — and of course the music — but one could also assert that those fans deserved a better cinematic adaptation. Maybe they’ll try again in a few years.Stigmata (1999)  22%Audience Score: 63%Divide: 42 pointsHorror fans enjoy nothing more than a truly horrific possession story, and while&nbsp;Stigmata&nbsp;didn’t win over all that many fans on the Tomatometer, the Audience Score remains inordinately high for this rarely-discussed occult story. (I do recall Patricia Arquette delivering a fantastic, punishing performance, but that’s about it.) Perhaps this film critic should take the advice of the Audience Score and give&nbsp;Stigmata&nbsp;a second spin.House of 1000 Corpses (2003)  20%Audience Score: 65%Divide: 46 pointsRob Zombie is sort of the poster child for “fans dug it, but critics did not,” and it all began with his gruesome grindhouse-style debut. His second film,&nbsp;The Devil’s Rejects, fared slightly better, with a 53% Tomatometer, but then his&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;remake (25% Tomatometer vs. 59% Audience Score) proved one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt: Mr. Zombie’s fans are nothing if not loyal, and very few film critics are big fans of the man’s films.Idle Hands (1999)  15%Audience Score: 58%Divide: 42 pointsNever try to apply logic to a certified cult flick. I remember not caring for this one when it played theaters, but somehow this bizarre horror-comedy about a slacker with a possessed hand has turned into a bona fide cable/Netflix favorite. It just&nbsp;goes to show that a movie may fail at the box office, and it may also fail to win critical acclaim, but if people like it enough, it can enjoy a very long afterlife.Ravenous (1999)  49%Audience Score: 78%Divide: 33 pointsThis one really confuses me. I have yet to meet a film critic who dislikes this fascinating tale of war, cannibalism, and insanity, yet the Audience Score is clearly the one on the side of goodness and decency. Speaking as both a film critic and a horror nut, I cannot recommend this strangely engaging genre concoction highly enough. And get a load of that awesome score!Saw (2004)  51%Average Audience Score for the Saw Series: 64.4%Average Tomatometer: 28.4%Divide: 36 pointsWow! Talk about a disparity between critics and horror fans! I’m a film critic and a Saw fan but this surprised even me. Film critics have never&nbsp;particularly liked this franchise, but that hasn’t stopped fans from digging through every terrible trap, brutal betrayal, and ridiculous resurrection. The eight&nbsp;Saw movies&nbsp;hold&nbsp;an average Audience Score of 64.4%,&nbsp;which may not sound super impressive, but considering the average Tomatometer for the same films is 28.3%, it’s pretty solid.Underworld (2003)  31%Average Audience Score for the Underworld&nbsp;series: 65.2%Average Tomatometer: 24.8%Divide: 40.4 pointsWhat? Film critics didn’t fall in love with a “werewolf vs. vampire” rendition of Romeo &amp; Juliet set in a gloomy Gothic location? How weird! Granted, there’s a lot of down time scattered across this series, but there’s also some pretty decent action and some wildly indecipherable accents. Though some critics dug the first chapter, it gets pretty dire after that, and thanks to a pretty decent average Audience Score, we’re looking at a beefy 40-point differential for the entire franchise.Resident Evil (2002)  36%Average Audience Score for the Resident Evil&nbsp;series: 55.5%Average Tomatometer: 27.7%Divide: 27.8 pointsThis is the other Screen Gems franchise (after Underworld) that doesn’t even bother screening films for critics but brings in lots of money from movie theaters from all over the world. And yes, there’s definitely some fun to be found within this willfully wacky zombie action franchise. Unfortunately, while most of my colleagues don’t seem to agree with me on that last part, there are enough moviegoers who do, resulting in a nearly 28-point chasm.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Marathons, Television, tv, Superheroe, jamie, spider-man, Best, crime, poppins","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"12-divisive-horror-movies-that-audiences-loved-but-critics-savaged"},{"id":"47613950595884","title":"Horror Movie Survivor Hall of Fame","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Horror Movie Survivor Hall of FameThey've been through the worst, but they're still alive!by RT Staff | October 28, 2015 |  CommentsThe most successful horror franchises tend to feature protagonists audiences can root for — heroes that viewers hope will beat the odds and emerge from their respective situations victorious and, well, alive. With that in mind, we here at RT decided to look back at some of cinema’s most stubborn survivors, those characters that somehow managed to avoid being offed in multiple horror movies.Needless to say, you may want to avoid what follows below if you’re allergic to spoilers. Without further ado, here are our choices for the Horror Movie Survivor Hall of Fame!Ellen RipleySurvived: The Alien FranchiseYou can’t keep a good woman down. Case in point: Ellen Ripley. Even if she only survived two-and-three-quarters of the first three Alien films, the DNA in her blood cells was enough to create a pretty killer replica (which gives us all hope for future Chuck Norris clones, but we digress).Ripley could have gone the way of Dr. Frank Poole a whole bunch of times throughout the series. As the only survivor of the Nostromo (not counting Jones the cat), she&nbsp;still could have been torn to shreds when the alien hid on her shuttle. In Aliens, Ripley and a few of her compatriots survived a tough battle with the Alien Queen aboard the Sulaco. Even a universe-saving suicide in Alien 3 barely slows Ripley down — the follow-up isn’t called Alien Resurrection for nothing. How does she do it? Our guess is those decades-long stasis naps do a body good.Ash WilliamsSurvived: The Evil Dead FranchiseYou can possess him with a few demons. You can chop off his hand. Hell, you can even send him back through time. But the one thing you cannot do to Ashley “Ash” Williams: keep him down for good.The same can’t be said of Ash’s friends, who, in the first two Evil Deads offer up a survival rate of exactly zero. Ash is actually supposed to have died in the final frames of The Evil Dead, but the sequel retcons the whole thing, causing him to re-endure a gory getaway in the forest cabin. In the process, he loses his hand, but hey, chainsaw hand as replacement.In the final Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, Ash is sent to 1300 AD. His only way to get back to the present time and his job at S-Mart: Going through a horde of the undead (led by an Ash clone) to retrieve the Necronomicon, the book of the dead. Groovy.&nbsp;Dr. FrankensteinSurvived: The Frankenstein Series by Hammer FilmsSome folks just don’t know when to quit. You’d think that Baron Victor von Frankenstein would reconsider his diabolical experiments in reanimation after nearly getting his dome lopped off in The Curse of Frankenstein, but no; this guy’s got a one-track mind. Unlike the Frankenstein of Mary Shelley and the Universal movies, our man Vic (played with eyebrow-raised relish by Peter Cushing) doesn’t evolve from hubristic to guilt-ridden — he’s pretty much a murderous mad scientist from minute one. After surviving the guillotine in The Curse of Frankenstein, the Baron continued his artificial life experiments in a bunch of Hammer films (either five or six, depending on whether you count the Cushing-free The Horror of Frankenstein as part of the cannon — many don’t). It’s pretty amazing that Frankenstein can perpetually stay one step ahead of death, given that angry townspeople, public officials, and even his own stitched-up creations are always trying to kill him.Tommy JarvisSurvived:&nbsp;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Friday the 13th, Part V – A New Beginning, Friday the 13th, Part VI – Jason LivesThe Friday the 13th series only had two protagonists who would carry themselves into sequels. The first was the original camp survivor who would be unceremoniously offed in Part II‘s opening sequence. The other: Tommy Jarvis. He first appeared in&nbsp;arguably&nbsp;the series’ best installment, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, as a young boy vacationing with his single mother and sister. With a penchant for masks, he and his sister succeed in confusing Jason, before Tommy is taken over by madness and hacks poor ol’ Jason Voorhees to death. The ambigious final shot of The Final Chapter suggests he has taken on an evil spirit.In the godawful sequel, A New Beginning, Tommy is a taciturn mental patient, drifting in and out of institutions. As copycat murders begin around him, he suspects that his psychosis is taking over under the cover of night. Turns out the killer was just a disgruntled paramedic. In his final appearance,&nbsp;Jason Lives, Tommy attempts to tear Jason’s corpse asunder, but a steel pipe left in his heart attracts a bolt of lightning and Jason is resurrected. Ultimately, Tommy lures him back to the lake and to a watery grave. But we all know how long the dead stay dead in horror movies, don’t we?Laurie StrodeSurvived:&nbsp;Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H20,&nbsp;Halloween (2007)It’s no wonder that Laurie Strode takes a breather every couple of Halloween installments; neither sleep nor time nor even a franchise reboot can rid her of Michael Myers. In the original Halloween, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) survived the babysitting gig from hell, successfully keeping Michael Myers at bay (though he killed a couple of her friends). In&nbsp;Halloween II, she learned why she’d been stalked — it turned out that she was a blood relative of the knife-wielding psycho.Laurie lay low for the next four Halloweens, but reemerged in Halloween H2O; she had faked her own death and changed her name, but she couldn’t stay hidden from her brother forever. Unfortunately, Myers finally got the best of Laurie in Halloween: Resurrection. Rob Zombie’s 2007 franchise reboot began at the beginning of the Laurie Strode story, with Scout Taylor-Compton stepping into the role; whether this incarnation of Laurie Strode shows the same survival instinct as the first remains to be seen.Dr. LoomisSurvived:&nbsp;The Halloween FranchiseMost psychology PhDs don’t receive gun training in school, tranquilizer or otherwise. Not sure about cursed zombie entrapment (that could be covered during mandatory intern hours), but Dr. Samuel James Loomis is somehow capable of all these things. At one point in&nbsp;Halloween 4, he agilely escaped death by diving behind some convenient barrels while his unkillable former patient took out a gas tank with a truck, causing a near-fatal explosion.Dr. Loomis’ constant attempts at shooting Michael Myers really only impeded the guy’s momentum. It only took the first two films for Loomis to realize that bullets just wouldn’t work. At the end of II, he decided to be the martyr and blow both Michael and himself up using a combo of oxygen and ether.Oh wait… but they both survive&nbsp;—&nbsp;somehow. Maybe Loomis got the explosive recipe wrong. But that’s great because then we got him for four more films! In those films we saw him use Michael’s female prey as bait to lure him into a trap consisting of a metal net, a tranquilizer gun, and his fists. But it was when he used his shrink skills to reason with the monster that we thought, “Oh yeah, that’s what he was trained to do.”Kirsty CottonSurvived:&nbsp;The Hellraiser FranchisePuzzle boxes were all the rage in the 1980s. Of course, when Kirsty Cotton played with one, she suffered the consequences: the opening of another realm filled with sado-masochistic Cenobytes led by none other than Pinhead himself. Pinhead’s posse included Butterball, Chatterer, and&nbsp;the Female. After attacks from a deceptive dead-skin-wearing uncle, a group of deal-reneging “explorers” from another realm, and a stepmother hell-bent on devouring her boyfriend, Kirsty&nbsp;even withstood a trip to the Cenobyte realm. In Hellraiser III, she existed only through old interview footage, but&nbsp;she returned in Hellseeker with some gruesome tricks up her sleeve.Being orphaned could inspire one to focus on new hobbies and interests, like mastering such a puzzle box, incidentally called the “Lament Configuration.” That, and a propensity for turning the tables on your loved ones, could be all you need to survive when confronted by violent unearthly beings that thrive on the pleasures of pain.Nancy ThompsonSurvived:&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street, Wes Craven’s New NightmareHow exactly does one defeat a nemesis who manifests himself in the dream world and makes nightmares come true? Nancy Thompson seemed to have figured out the trick, but not before notorious burn victim Freddy Krueger dispatched a good number of her friends and family in gruesome ways.After Freddy skewered her BFFs and effectively turned her boyfriend into a bloody geyser in the original Nightmare on Elm Street, Nancy somehow managed to escape, only to meet her end in Part 3: Dream Warriors. But here’s the kicker: Freddy actually came after the actress who played Nancy, Heather Langenkamp, in Wes Craven’s [very meta] New Nightmare, in which he also terrorized director Craven himself and the man who portrayed him in the movies, Robert Englund. Whoa… And maybe, you might think, a name change would help protect poor Nancy, but Freddy’s too smart for that.Jill TuckSurvived:&nbsp;Saw III through Saw 3DThroughout all the twists and turns of the Saw&nbsp;franchise, one woman emerged as the series’ unlikely hero (seriously, the bad guys got waaay more screen time than the goodies): Jill Tuck, the ex-wife of serial killer Jigsaw. Jill was a rehabilitation clinic director who suffered a miscarriage after an assault from a junkie, prompting Jigsaw’s descent into madness.Despite the Saw series’ brutally high body count, Jill survived five filmed appearances. After Jigsaw’s death in Saw III, she received a mysterious box via his will. For a while, her role as either protagonist or antagonist was up in the air, making her the most compelling character outside of Jigsaw himself. Then it was revealed her final role in Jigsaw’s twisted blueprint was to “test” his apprentice, crazy corrupt cop Mark Hoffman. Jill almost took him out, but was eventually killed in the final Saw with the infamous reverse bear trap.Cindy CampbellSurvived: The first four&nbsp;Scary Movie&nbsp;moviesA high-school-student-turned-college-student-turned-anchorwoman-turned-professional-boxer-turned-caregiver, Cindy Campbell knows how to throw down and maybe even snap some necks. Her response to a home-attack by Ghostface? What else? Throw a HOUSE PARTY! That would be the safest thing to do, right? But everyone ended up dead. Go figure. Her&nbsp;Matrix-like aerial fighting skills got her through another night, but could she survive a wedgie in Scary Movie 2? Turns out… she could and did!This one was handy though. Only Cindy Campbell could MacGyver random objects into a tractor, allowing her to crash through the door of a refrigerator she was locked in. Even a UN nude-ray couldn’t stop this savvy ingénue. At one point, an alien Command tripod ensnared her with Venus flytraps in a grimy old bathroom, and she was instructed to find the key to free herself and her friend Brenda. The key was located behind her eye, but it wasn’t a problem for Cindy. She’s got a glass eye (old bar fight injury).Cindy has survived a lot. She’s slick and sagacious. But we’re still not sure whether she’s still with us, since she sat out&nbsp;Scary Movie 5.Sidney PrescottSurvived:&nbsp;The Scream FranchisePoor Sidney Prescott. She survived an entire franchise dedicated to her demise, and it really all came down to reasons that were far beyond her control. What’s that saying about “the sins of the father” (or, in this case, mother)? Yeah, Sidney sort of represents the epitome of the adage.Consider this: Sidney’s own boyfriend, Billy, played the long con on her and ultimately tried to off her in the first Scream because Sidney’s mom broke apart his parents’ marriage — yikes. But it got worse: who should come around for revenge in Scream 2 but Billy’s mom herself, understandably upset, along with an accomplice who just wanted to be famous for killing Sidney. Scream 3 saw Sidney terrorized by a half brother she never knew she had, upset about being rejected by their mother, and 4‘s Ghostface Killer turned out to be Sidney’s own cousin, itching to get a taste of Sidney’s fame. Sidney is safe and sound as of now, of course, but you never know; there might be a great granduncle or a step-niece just rarin’ for a go at her.AliceSurvived:&nbsp;The Resident Evil FranchiseAt first, it wouldn’t appear that the Umbrella Corporation of the Resident Evil films planned very well for a possible outbreak of their zombifying T-virus. In fact, the soldiers sent to Umbrella’s secret lab in 2002’s Resident Evil spent most of their time simply trying to survive.But even in the face of this population-decimating epidemic, there was one particular survivor who eventually went on the offensive for the good of all mankind, and her name was Alice. The folks at Umbrella must have spotted her potential, too, because in Apocalypse (2004), they outfitted Alice with some genetic modifications, and in Extinction (2007), they even cloned her in hopes of building a butt-kicking army. She’s survived attacks by all kinds of mutations, speedy, strong, and grotesque, but she hasn’t fallen yet. Alice and Umbrella both know the whole ordeal is Umbrella’s fault, and her quest to bring them to justice continues through to the franchise’s&nbsp;sixth installment, which is scheduled to open next year.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, movies, Walking, TV, kids, Bowl, elm, Fox, VICE, TV, discovery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"horror-survivor-hall-of-fame"},{"id":"47613923944230","title":"\"Bat\" Bits: \"Dark Knight\" Casting, Justice League, and … Spawn?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Bat\" Bits: \"Dark Knight\" Casting, Justice League, and ...

Nevertheless, we’ve got a few notable new titles, especially for you lucky readers who found a Blu-ray player under the tree this season!1. Towelhead — 47%Aaron Eckhart takes on the most unlikable role of his career in this 1980s-set suburban drama adapted and directed by Oscar-winner Alan Ball (American Beauty) from Alicia Erian’s novel of the same name. Worth a viewing for those interested in seeing what Ball has to offer on the big screen after giving TV audiences such award-winning series as Six Feet Under and True Blood, although those averse to the idea of Eckhart’s onscreen relationship with a 13 year old girl may want to skip it, as most audiences did in theaters.Next: Conservative hijinks in An American Carol2.\tAn American Carol — 13%One might argue that liberals get most of Hollywood’s output to consume, so why not throw right wingers a cinematic bone once in a while? Spoof veteran David Zucker (Airplane!) did just that, rallying all the conservative A-listers he could find (Kelsey Grammer, Dennis Hopper, Jon Voight), a few C-listers (Kevin Farley, Leslie Nielsen) and even – gasp! – David Alan Grier. Cast interviews and a commentary by Zucker might make this watchable…nah, probably not.Next: Watch Bob Saget squirm at his Comedy Central Roast!3. The Comedy Central Roast of Bob SagetNow here is controversial comedy at its finest: the art of the roast, practiced for years by the Hasty Puddings crowd until the masterminds at Comedy Central put the ploy to good use. After all, who doesn’t love seeing celebrities (or better yet, comedians) suffer through jokes at their own expense? Saget takes it well, considering the line-up: Jeffrey Ross, Cloris Leachman, and even Uncle Jessie himself. While this roast didn’t quite measure up to, say, the beating inflicted on poor little Flava Flav (or, as we call him, “Flava Flaaaaaaaaaaaaav!”), Norm MacDonald’s bizarrely straight-laced bit is worth watching again.Next: Did you know Matthew McConaughey had a 2008 movie worse than Fool’s Gold??4. Surfer Dude – 00%Despite having “direct to video” written all over it, Surfer, Dude actually did open in theaters — and, three weeks later, exited them — last September. And despite having a few stars who could open a film once upon a time (Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, and, um, Willie Nelson), the comedy about a surfer dude (McConaughey, naturally) who just wants to…surf, tanked big time. Something tells us that after making only $52K during its theatrical run (with a budget of $6 million, according to Box Office Mojo), even the best possible DVD campaign won’t dry the tears everyone involved with Surfer, Dude. After all, bongos don’t buy themselves.Next: Nip/Tuck heads to Hollywood5.

(One of history’s longest-running single seasons, Part 1 spans 14 episodes that ran on F/X from October 2007 to February 2008. Part 2 begins airing in January.)Re-watch what happens when Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon) pack up shop, head to Hollywood and become consultants on a medical soap, Julia (Joely Richardson) introduces a lesbian lover (Portia de Rossi) and her trouble-seeking daughter (90210‘s AnnaLynn McCord), and Matt (John Hensley) discovers his new girlfriend is his biological sister. But what’s even scarier than reality TV, sociopaths, and incest? The return of Dawn Budge (Rosie O’Donnell)!!!Next: ABC Family goes Greek6. Greek Chapter 2ABC Family struck gold with their turn towards teen-friendly programming in recent years, as evidenced by the network’s trio of shows hitting DVD shelves this week, starting with Greek. The seriocomic adventures of undergrads at Cyprus-Rhodes University continues in Chapter 2, in which the guys of Kappa and the girls of Zeta Beta Eta Whatever get wrapped up in more riveting shenanigans; should the semi-skanky Rebecca get booted from sorority life for appearing in a Girls Gone Wild-esque video? Who will win Greek Week? Audio commentaries and a handful of extras sure to delight the teenage ABC Family-watching crowd are also included.Next: Get in on the Secret Life of the American Teenager7. The Secret Life of the American Teenager Season OneThink Juno meets 7th Heaven and you’ll get a good idea of what this ABC Family series is about; in it, a soap-ishly intertwined network of high school kids and their parents deal with the “secret” realities of teenage life: kids have sex, and sometimes they also get pregnant. (But hey, on this show, so do their parents.) More akin to 90210 (the new version) and Degrassi than the cheeseburger phone-wielding-hipster-zeitgeist of Juno MacGuff, The Secret Life of the American Teenager frequently pulls more viewers than Gossip Girl (to which we say, ZOMG!), making Season 1 a good post-holiday gift for the teenager on your list. You know, because having “the Talk” is way awkward. Let Molly Ringwald do the talking for you.Next: Zzyxzs, belly buttons (or lack thereof), and Kyle XY Season 28. Kyle XY The Complete Second SeasonWrapping up the ABC Family slate hitting DVD this week is Kyle XY, a show about a teenage boy who wakes up one day with no memory, no belly button, and lots of questions. In Season 2, Kyle explores his link to a shady company called Zzyzx. And never mind the show’s unmistakable Christian subtext — there’s a show on TV teaching kids words like “zzyxz,” and how awesome is that?Kyle XY The Complete Second Season comes with all twenty-three episodes spread across six discs, and include audio commentaries, an alternate ending, and more.Next: Baghead9. Days of Thunder Blu-ray — 42%The movie often called “Top Gun on Wheels” scored middling reviews with critics and doesn’t hold up especially well, but will make a decent addition to your growing Blu-ray collection if you love racing, like over-the-top sports movies, and have ever considered naming a pet “Cole Trickle.” The 1990 NASCAR flick starred a young, post-Maverick Tom Cruise (who also shared story credit) and boasted memorable supporting turns by Robert Duvall, Michael Rooker, and Dennis Quaid (not so much for the then-23-year-old Nicole Kidman, who played Cruise’s leggy brain surgeon love interest). Unfortunately, Days of Thunder on Blu-ray lacks considerable bonus features, so the only reason to buy it (other than your ceaseless love of early ’90s action flicks and/or obsession with celebrity Scientologists) would be to crank up the volume and listen to its AWESOME soundtrack in glorious, lossless High Def audio.Next: Do you dare climb aboard the Event Horizon on Blu-ray?9. Event Horizon Blu-ray — 22%Lastly, we recommend another critically-dubious but awesome-in-HD title this week: Event Horizon. Love it or hate it, Paul W.S. Anderson’s 1997 sci-fi horror tale has become a cult hit of sorts thanks to its gory space happenings, so horror-inclined Blu-ray enthusiasts should take heed. As with many a Blu-ray title released these days, Event Horizon will serve as little more than an HD library addition thanks to only moderately upgraded audio and visual enhancements; however, the bonus menu contains a wealth of special features, though all have previously been released. That said, how many other space ships do you know that have been to Hell and back?Until next week, happy renting (and happy holidays)!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Sundance, BAFTA, Lionsgate, high, Moore, Mirror, Television, new, Cannes, movies, on, Music, E3, Pet","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"RT-on-DVD-A-Matthew-McConaughey-Stinker-or-Event-Horizon-on-Blu-ray"},{"id":"47613961867058","title":"Producers of Notorious B.I.G.

Biopic Seek Unknown StarGot the flow down phizat, platinum plus like thizat.by Jeff Giles | August 10, 2007 |  CommentsThink you look like Christopher Wallace, A.K.A. the Notorious B.I.G.? Want to be a movie star? We’ve got the news you’ve been waiting for. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the producers of the upcoming Biggie biopic will fill the film’s lead role through an open casting call.Translation: Starting this Sunday at 3 A.M. Eastern Standard Time, anyone and everyone who thinks they’re right for the part is encouraged to submit an audition video, via a process outlined at the link below. As the article quotes Notorious producer Wayne Barrow:“As it relates to the individual Christopher Wallace — his looks, his stature, what he represented, the swagger, the sensibility of the man — all those elements are very difficult to find, no matter where you go,” Barrow said Thursday. “In the typical Hollywood world, no one came to mind outside of Forest Whitaker who could capture that essence genuinely.”Whitaker does have the requisite laid-back charm, but as the article notes, he’s creeping up on 50 years old, and Wallace was only 24 when he was murdered in 1997. If a film about the rapper’s life is ever to be made — and this one has been gestating for the better part of a decade — casting an unknown might really be the only way to go. George Tillman, whose previous credits include Men of Honor and Soul Food, will direct.Source: The Hollywood Reporter","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Awards, RT21, motion, justice, adaptation, Kimmy, Tubi","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"producers-of-notorious-big-biopic-seek-unknown-star"},{"id":"47613989733178","title":"\"Almighty\" Sequel Begins Shooting in D.C.","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Almighty\" Sequel Begins Shooting in D.C.by Scott Weinberg | March 21, 2006 |  CommentsFilming has begun on the hilarious comedy \"Evan Almighty,\" starring Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham.

Midsommar, set in remote Sweden during a flower-dressed festival, is designed as an anomaly: A gruesome horror movie that allows all its gore and brutality to curdle in open, bright daylight. There’s no hiding away in this one, folks, inspiring us to offer up our own selection of the 11 scariest scenes where the blood shines bright as the sun.11.&nbsp;Pinbacker Attacks in&nbsp;Sunshine (2007)  77%(Photo by Fox Searchlight. All rights reserved/Courtesy Everett Collection)Here’s a movie that turns up the heat — literally — as a space crew treks with a nuclear payload to reignite our dying sun. A monumental task for those onboard the Icarus II, but the real danger takes on a more human face when they encounter the derelict Icarus I, which disappeared on the same mission seven years earlier. Sunshine morphs into a sun-bright slasher in its third act, a contrast to the earlier somber psychological tone, but director Danny Boyle tackles the shift with zest, challenging himself to pull the knife out of shadows and into retina-searing white light.10.&nbsp;The Finale in&nbsp;Session 9 (2001)  64%A condemned asylum. Inside: clattering chains, disturbed wheelchairs, and crumbling wards. A group of people enter to clean up the place, some who harbor dark histories. Sound like a set up for classic dark and stormy Gothic tale? Not so with Session 9. What kind of clean up crew would work at night? Come on, this is a horror movie: Logic is king here. A slow atmospheric burn with minimal gore until its final minutes, but even when things go to hell, the blood is bathed in New England sun.9.&nbsp;Freddy’s Coming For You in&nbsp;A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)  94%Time for a victory lap: Hop into the convertible on this bright school morning having vanquished the tormentor of fatal dreams, turn around and wave goodbye to your mom standing on the porch. Suddenly, the top slams down and the car peels down the street, as mama is sucked through the front door window. The nightmare has only just begun. The original Friday the 13th‘s Jason Voorhees made the last-second jump scare a mandatory inclusion for ’80s slashers and beyond. Freddy Krueger may have perfected it.8.&nbsp;Michael Myers Stalking in&nbsp;Halloween (1978)  96%John Carpenter’s classic did a lot of things right. Gave us a classic creepy synth score. Destroyed suburbia’s manicured image as a stronghold of safety and comfort. And it rolled out the red carpet to let masked killer Michael Myers to wander and stalk his prey in broad daylight. The shot of Myers staring up at you from among the billowing laundry sheets hung to dry in the yard remains an iconic and violating image.7.&nbsp;The Day After in&nbsp;The Hills Have Eyes (2006)  52%The Carter family is subjected to a litany of brutal terror over the course of 24 hours. During the initial day, they’re led off-road and their car gets mangled in the desert. The family separates in search for help. A dog gets gutted. The gas station attendant commits suicide. And always mutants are watching them from afar in the brush and rocks, leading to a long night of crucifixions, immolation, rape, murder, and baby-snatching. And then the next day, the cannibals feast on sun-cooked flesh. It’s a torturous chain of events that transforms the remaining Carters&nbsp;into out-for-blood hunters in a highly questionable, deeply satisfying revenge ending.6.&nbsp;Randy’s Death in&nbsp;Scream 2 (1997)  81%You knew director Wes Craven wasn’t fooling around when he killed off know-it-all cinebuff Randy, portrayed by Jamie Kennedy as someone as smart and cynical as the audience. How could he have fallen for the afternoon masked killer in the local news van with noisy nearby breakdancers? Oldest trick in the book! But it’s also series’ most shocking homicide outside of Drew Barrymore’s, the one that tells the oh-so-smart audience that no one was truly safe. The Arquettes, Courteney and David as Gale and Dewey, frantically search for the killer in the college square by accosting students with their new-fangled mobile phones, presenting on screen when awful taunting calls escaped the constraints of landlines and curly cords, and into a new world of free-roaming terror.5.&nbsp;The Ceremony in&nbsp;The Wicker Man (1973)  89%Midsommar owes a blood debt to this provincial classic: the unsettling tale of an uptight Christian cop investigating a young girl’s disappearance on an island of decadent mystic pagans has thematic and visual parallels to Aster’s film. Likewise, nearly the entire movie is set during the day among verdant nature and maypole celebrations and foreshadowing musical rhymes that seem to follow the officer everywhere he goes. It’s far too late when he realizes the true nature of his work, leading to a fiery climax in the friscalating dusk light.4.&nbsp;The Premonition in&nbsp;Final Destination 2 (2003)  48%Some of the best horror wedges&nbsp;its way into the normal, degrading the routine and humdrum into a morass of paranoia and fear. Final Destination 2 does that with the daily morning commute, because what could be more humdrum than getting in our 1,000 lb. metal husks every day, navigating them manually down the road as cars careen towards us in the opposite direction separated only by capriciously painted lines on the ground? Suddenly, something as innocent as a flatbed of loose tree logs becomes a rolling thunder revue of broken windshield, splattered heads, and Michael Bay–style auto explosions.3.&nbsp;The Opening Chase in&nbsp;28 Weeks Later... (2007)  71%28 Days Later‘s famous opening features calm shots of the hero wandering an empty London metropolis depopulated by zombies — moments we would consider eerie, almost beautiful, but not scary. 28 Weeks Later takes the opposite approach. It’s set in the countryside, as a band of infected descend upon defenseless survivors. The camera is in your face, the footage choppy and frantically (but not confusingly) edited, save for a gliding crane shot as our new “hero” flees across the field and towards a waiting river boat. The fact that he just abandoned his wife to the zombies moments earlier contribute to the gut-punching bleakness of the situation. Now that we consider scary.2.&nbsp;Leatherface Appears in&nbsp;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)  89%Like a rusty chainsaw, Tobe Hooper’s horror masterpiece takes a moment to rev up. But once it gets going, the movie is relentless, grinding down the viewer’s endurance up until the famous ending of Leatherface cutting the rising sun light in boiling anger. It’s a great final appearance, but his first introduction is even better. Hapless travelers, in search of gas for their thirsty boogie van, approach a piquant homestead, oblivious that its inhabitants are cannibal freaks who have no qualms doing their dirty deeds in daylight. Leatherface suddenly appears from out of a hallway, smashes his victim’s head in with a hammer as the body crumples and twitches on the ground, and then slides the slaughterhouse door shut. Looks like meat’s back on the menu, boys!1.&nbsp;The Beach Attack in&nbsp;Jaws (1975)  98%The scene that made a generation of filmgoers terrified of open water. It’s immaculately crafted pop horror and it still works today. Steven Spielberg uses a collage of beach crowd noise and throngs of people innocently rising to disorient the viewer,&nbsp;telling us to be just&nbsp;as alert as Roy Scheider’s police chief. Spielberg famously had to use every filmmaking tool he knew to overcome critical obstacles like a malfunctioning shark, and here heightens and stylizes reality as Jaws approaches the beach. A split diopter lens shot puts an obtrusive face and a possibly drowning distant swimmer in equal focus. A dog is discovered missing.&nbsp;We get that terrifying first-person viewpoint as Jaws picks his victim, and the incessant John Williams theme building on the soundtrack. Then a dolly zoom as terror dawns on Schieider’s face. A geyser of blood erupts out in the ocean as pure pandemonium breaks out, and a frantic mother loses her son. It’s a powerful scene in how powerless it makes a man of law feel against a force of nature.Like this?

For decades, rumors have swirled of a sequel, remake, or TV adaptation of the Aquarius-era stoner film about a stunning young woman who sleeps her way through the galaxy. In the aughts, Robert Rodriguez was attached to a remake that would have starred his then-girlfriend and muse, Rose McGowan. That never materialized, nor did a proposed TV adaptation whose pilot was to be directed by Nicolas Wending-Refn.Despite its cult fame, Vadim’s 1968 mind-bender has never been followed by a sequel or a remake.&nbsp;But it has nevertheless proven extremely influential, and its DNA can be found in plenty of hits, flops, and obscurities, many of them also based on comic books and featuring badass female protagonists. Barbarella’s not particularly successful combination of kitschy, over-the-top camp comedy, social satire, and stoner spectacle provided just as much a template for the films that followed it as the voyeuristic sexuality for which&nbsp;it became&nbsp;famous.&nbsp;It has inspired some riotous cult classics, but also a lot of sexy science fiction satires that, like Barbarella itself, aren’t particularly sexy, funny, or satirical.1. Flash Gordon (1980)  83%(Photo by Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)If Mike Hodges’ Flash Gordon feels an awful lot like Barbarella, that’s because they were conceived from similar blueprints. Both are big-budget, kaleidoscopic science fiction epics produced by Italian super-producer Dino DeLaurentis and overflowing with tawdry sensuality, eye-popping special effects, and enough trippy spectacle to satisfy the most demanding stoner.DeLaurentis clearly conceived of Flash Gordon as the next Star Wars&nbsp;— the comic strip was a big influence on George Lucas’ deathless space opera. But despite its echoes of Star Wars, Flash Gordon owes just as much, if not more, to Barbarella’s combination of BDSM-infused naughtiness and incongruous, child-like innocence.Flash Gordon replaced the free love sexuality of Barbarella with the sweaty, stimulant-fueled sensuality of disco at its most brazenly sensual, with equally explosive and unforgettable results.2. Heavy Metal (1981)  60%(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Few of Barbarella’s far-flung offspring can match the movie’s pedigree for hipness. The exception is the cult 1981 Canadian animated film Heavy Metal, which&nbsp;is funnier and more genuinely satirical as well, if every bit as juvenile. It was produced by Ivan Reitman, co-written by Len Blum and Daniel Goldberg (writers of Reitman-directed hits Meatballs and Stripes) and featured a voice cast that included much of SCTV’s beloved crew (John Candy, Harold Ramis, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy), as well as John Vernon and Richard Romanus. Throw in a primo rock soundtrack featuring Cheap Trick, Devo, Black Sabbath, and Donald Fagen and you have an instant cult classic irresistible to the blacklight-and-bong-in-the-closet crowd.The much-loved adaptation of the popular science fiction and fantasy magazine of the same name is a mind-bending, time-hopping anthology film united by a glowing green orb of PURE EVIL that reappears throughout pulpy vignettes and an adolescent boy’s unending fascination with the naked female form at its most cartoonishly buxom.The kids might have come for the boobs, but they stayed for the rocking tunes, groundbreaking animation, and thought-provoking satire. Ah, who are we kidding? They came for the boobs, they stayed for the boobs, and they return to it for the boobs. But all that other stuff doesn’t hurt, either.3. Tank Girl (1995)  38%(Photo by MGM courtesy Everett Collection)It seems like every generation has a Barbarella of its own that reflects the changing fashions and mores of the times that produced them and irrevocably shaped them. Barbarella was a happening, groovy be-in of a movie that could only have happened in the late 1960s,&nbsp;Flash Gordon gave the sexed-up outer space shenanigans a disco feel, and 1995’s Tank Girl, yet another zeitgeist-chasing adaptation of a cult comic book about a plucky, kick-ass heroine of the future, gave this material a Riot Girl update. The sensuality of Rachel Talalay’s campy cult flick was smartass, sarcastic, androgynous, and gender-bending in sharp contrast to the soft, doe-like femininity of Jane Fonda.Tank Girl takes place in a grim, dystopian, drought-ravaged future where the malevolent forces that control the limited water supply hold supreme power. They’re opposed by free-thinking punks like the title character (Lori Petty) and her friends, who occupy a gross world overflowing with sexual deviants, most notably a pedophile named Rat Face (Iggy Pop), who is as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside.Squeamish studio executives toned down the sexuality of the comic strip and earlier versions of the script that dealt much more extensively with the romantic and sexual relationship between Tank Girl and Booga (Jeff Kober), a mutated human-kangaroo super-soldier hybrid. Rumor has it there was even a fabled shot of a naked kangaroo penis that was excised from the final version, but plenty of kinkiness and sexual suggestiveness made it into the film all the same. Besides, even in a punk-rock, post-Barbarella world, nobody needs to see a naked kangaroo penis.4. Barb Wire (1996)  27%Starring as a warrior for good in a futuristic, titillating science fiction future world in a high-profile adaptation of a popular comic book made Jane Fonda a movie star. That did not happen, however, when Fonda’s fellow activist/sex symbol, Baywatch breakout star and animal rights zealot Pamela Anderson, decided to follow in Fonda’s footsteps. Here, Anderson plays the titular comic book badass, Dark Horse comics’ futuristic bounty hunter Barb Wire, in a poorly received action fantasy with the misplaced audacity to flat-out steal the premise of Casablanca…&nbsp;with Anderson in the Humphrey Bogart role.While&nbsp;Vadim’s visually stunning but dramatically and comedically inert cult classic is sleaze with prestige, or trash with class, Anderson’s ill-fated attempt at becoming a buxom, cold-blooded action star is just straight-up garbage, a lurid exploitation movie devoid of ideas and intelligence. As an unofficial, blood- and boob-saturated remake of Casablanca, Barb Wire&nbsp;fails to improve upon its inspiration.5. Starship Troopers (1997)  65%(Photo by TriStar Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)If Barbarella is not as sophisticated a satire as it sets out to be, that’s probably because director Roger Vadim has a lumbering, heavy-handed touch all wrong for sly comedy. The same cannot be said of Paul Verhoeven, the mad genius behind Robocop and Total Recall.Verhoeven’s wildly divisive 1997 Robert Heinlein adaptation/parody Starship Troopers might just have&nbsp;been&nbsp;too satirical.&nbsp;His brutal vision of a fascist future — in which ridiculously good-looking super-soldiers, both male and female, live and shower together en masse as they take on an evil insectoid species — is so straight-faced that, at the time, it was mistaken by some for what it was sending up. The film’s nudity and hard R-rating&nbsp;go a long way toward separating Starship Troopers from Star Wars, as does its pitch-black satire and intense violence.6. Hollow Man (2000)  27%With the 2000 Invisible Man riff Hollow Man Verhoeven took his bleak, uncompromising worldview to the story of a brilliant, troubled scientist (Kevin Bacon) who discovers the secret to invisibility and, being a misogynistic sociopath, abuses his new power to sexually assault a neighbor as part of an ongoing crime spree that includes various murders and menacing Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue), an ex-girlfriend he’s unhealthily obsessed with.Verhoeven goes further than any version of this story other than The Invisible Maniac in illustrating just how quickly the power of invisibility would corrupt a man and unleash his ugliest, most violent and sexual urges. As a result, Verhoeven made a movie that is disturbingly sexual without being sexy, and darkly satirical in its take on the underlying ugliness of human nature without even trying to be funny.7. Planet Terror (Grindhouse Presents: Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror) (2007)  76%(Photo by Weinstein Company courtesy Everett Collection)Needless to say, Rose McGowan did not get to play Barbarella for Robert Rodriguez, but 2007’s&nbsp;Grindhouse&nbsp;— an ambitious attempt by Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino to replicate the vibe of an evening at a sleazy, sordid drive-in in the 1970s&nbsp;—&nbsp;gave them a consolation prize in the form of Planet Terror, Rodriguez’s half of the double feature.Planet Terror casts McGowan as Cherry Darling, a pissed-off go-go dancer who ends up doing battle with zombie-like creatures, as well as the usual assortment of creeps with wandering hands that are ubiquitous in movies like this, at least one of whom ends up getting stabbed in the face with part of Cherry’s wooden leg.Eventually, Cherry’s busted fake leg is replaced by an assault rifle and a grenade launcher, and&nbsp;she starts dealing out death with her peculiar new arsenal. Planet Terror exists for the sake of its central audacious image of woman and weapon welded together into something brazen and bizarre and awesome and new. Unfortunately, like Vadim, Rodriguez isn’t capable of satire — sledgehammer, savage, sophisticated, or otherwise. Leaden, labored camp is more his speed. A tough, sexy, confident woman who is also a deadly weapon? That’s a wet dream out of Heavy Metal, but it’s not quite enough to base an entire movie around, even one this intentionally ridiculous.Nathan Rabin is the author of six books and the proprietor of Nathan Rabin’s Happy Place.Follow Nathan on Twitter:&nbsp;@NathanRabin","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"on, south, toy, the, mission:, TIFF, and, ABC, Winners, animated, thriller, Emmy, natural, revenge","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"beyond-barbarella-celebrating-50-years-of-sexy-sci-fi"},{"id":"47614011567938","title":"WATCH: Independence Day: Resurgence Trailer","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})WATCH: Independence Day: Resurgence Trailerby RT Staff | December 13, 2015 |  CommentsWe always knew they were coming back.

One of the earliest entries in the Sandler catalog is the golf comedy Happy Gilmore, about a wannabe hockey player who finds unexpected success as a professional golfer. And even though it’s just one in a long line of fish-out-of-water comedies that define the early part of Sandler’s big-screen career, the film ultimately changed the face of sports movies — or at the very least, the sport of golf — and has attracted a legion of fans unlike any of this other comedies.From the unforgettable lines and oft-imitated golf swing to the Mandalorian connection and the introduction of Bob Barker to a new generation, Happy Gilmore remains as relevant as ever. Throw in a soundtrack that seamlessly blends a variety of artists like Lynyrd Skynyrd, House of Pain, Kansas, and of course Diana Ross and Lionel Richie, and then tack on a Star Wars-inspired ending with spirits appearing the sky, and you’ve got yourself one iconic offering.So go to your happy place, because in honor of the 25th&nbsp;anniversary of Happy Gilmore, we’re&nbsp;breaking down five reasons why this is Adam Sandler’s best movie. Ever.It Holds Rarified Status as a Fresh Adam Sandler Comedy(Photo by ©Universal Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)To say Happy Gilmore is Sandler’s first Fresh movie isn’t saying much, considering he was just getting started in the film world after SNL. And even though he has given us a few gems lately — pun intended —&nbsp;Happy Gilmore actually remains just one of a handful of Fresh films over his entire career. When it comes to comedies, Sandler cranked out more in his first 20 years than a first grade Billy Madison can even count, but&nbsp;Happy is joined by only The Wedding Singer, Punch-Drunk Love, and Funny People&nbsp;in the Fresh comedy category, and it’s debatable whether the latter two are even comedies in the first place.It Is Ridiculously QuotableOne sign of a strong and long-lasting comedy is that a bunch of the jokes live on in popular culture for many years. And while Sandler’s Billy Madison brought plenty in 1995, especially when you’re debating the positive attributes of shampoo and conditioner, Happy Gilmore took it to a whole new level the next year. Whether it’s on the golf course, somewhere else in the world of sports, or in our every day lives, the film has earned a gold jacket in quotable lines.“Gold jacket, green jacket, who gives a s–t?”“I eat pieces of s–t like you for breakfast.” “You eat pieces of s–t for breakfast?”“The price is wrong, bitch.”“That’s your home! Are you too good for your home?”“How am I supposed to chip with that going on, Doug?”“You can trouble me for a warm glass of shut-the-hell-up. ”“Somebody’s closer.”It Changed the Way People Enjoy GolfThere is no denying that Happy Gilmore, along with the emergence of some guy named Tiger, drove golf into the mainstream in the late ’90s. And while other classic golf films like Caddyshack and Tin Cup have contributed some pretty notable entries to golf culture, no other golf movie has influenced the game quite like Happy and his unorthodox 400-yard golf swing.&nbsp; In a sport where people are still very much enamored by the long ball, the Happy swing remains one of the most attempted moves on a golf course by people of all skill levels. Sure, it’s mostly done for laughs, but you never know when you might really connect with one. Which is why everyone from kids to adults and pros to hackers love to give it their best shot – running start and all.Some of the celebratory moves that are teed up throughout Happy Gilmore continue to live on in the world of golf as well. Happy riding his golf club like a horse was famously reprised by PGA Tour pro Boo Weekley during the 2008 Ryder Cup. Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) shooting his ball into the hole with his finger gun is a move all true golfers strive to perfect.And let’s be honest: if you’re not incorporating Chubbs’ (Carl Weathers) “it’s all in the hips” move when teaching your buddy the basics of the golf swing, you’re doing it wrong.The Supporting Cast&nbsp;Is OutstandingSpeaking of Weathers, who is currently enjoying a career resurgence in a galaxy far far away with The Mandalorian, he headlines a talented and memorable supporting cast in Happy Gilmore. Known partly for Predator at the time — in which his arms are unceremoniously shot off — the veteran actor provides plenty of laughs in Happy, complete with one of his arms having been replaced by a hilariously too long and easily damaged wooden hand.Julie Bowen plays Happy’s love interest, Virgina Venit, in what was one of her first film roles. She has, of course, gone on to win multiple Emmys for her role on Modern Family, but her totally-’90s hair and girl next door charm in Happy Gilmore is a nice reminder of her earlier work. You’re welcome for the points at your next trivia night.There are also a few great cameos from people like Ben Stiller, whose nursing home orderly character will forever instill fear into the hearts of the elderly.&nbsp;And who can forget Kevin Nealon “feeling the flow” as a pro golfer, and longtime Price is Right host Bob Barker with his mean left hook? Speaking of which…It Features a Fight Scene That Defined a GenerationCould we have kept Barker’s fight scene with Sandler in the supporting cast section of this article? Probably. But this is more than just a fight scene. It’s the fight scene. Not only did it take home the first ever Best Fight award at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards, but it also introduced and endeared Barker to a whole new generation of fans, as ratings for The Price Is Right were reportedly on the rise with college kids after the film’s release. And the legend only grows with stories from set about how Barker wanted to do his own fighting stunts, and how he would only do the role if he won the fight.And now, to quote the man himself as he delivers a beat down to Happy, “I think you’ve had enough.”Happy Gilmore&nbsp;was released in theaters on February 16, 1996.On an Apple device?

This Christmas, for the first time,&nbsp;we at Rotten Tomatoes are spreading the love, giving you an expanded list of the Best Christmas Movies ever – all Fresh and sparkly and ranked by Tomatometer – but also the below list of movies that fall on the Rotten end of the Tomatometer, but which are still on our own nice lists come December. They’re movies the critics mostly dismissed, but&nbsp;that are still&nbsp;worth your yuletide time.A Bad Moms Christmas (2017) 32%This 2017 sequel celebrates Father Christmas by doubling the number of moms in the first film. Titular bad moms Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, and Kathryn Hahn butt heads with their own mothers, played by Christine Baranski, Cheryl Hines, and Susan Sarandon, in a comedy that doesn’t aspire to much more than a chance for these talented actresses to pass on a little Christmas cheer and chaos. And that they do.Almost Christmas (2016) 49%The worst thing Almost Christmas has going for it is also the best thing: it’s so familiar. It’s a big family coming together for the holidays and they all have their own personal drama and relationships but also there’s love there, and more than a few laughs. We’ve seen this movie before, but we keep seeing it (and studios keep making it) because it works. Like milk and cookies for Santa, comedy-dramas like Almost Christmas and the yuletide are a natural, comforting fit.Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) 49%No, not the classic animated special featuring Frankenstein’s Monster himself, Boris Karloff, as the narrator; that holiday gem sits at 100% on the Tomatometer. This Jim Carrey vehicle, directed by Ron Howard, translates Dr. Seuss’ whimsical illustrations into live-action, and the results aren’t particularly good, for goodness sake. But, while the Dr. Seuss-meets-Tim Burton’s nightmares aesthetic is a bit unsettling, the comedy holds up — especially in a scene where the Grinch’s own echo shouts “you’re an idiot” at him.Ernest Saves Christmas (1988) 36%You’ve got to appreciate a movie that gives the whole plot away in the title. One of the earliest&nbsp;Ernest&nbsp;films,&nbsp;Ernest Saves Christmas&nbsp;sees Ernest (who began life as a character in local TV commercials) helping Santa Claus as he seeks his replacement. It’s kind of a proto-Santa Clause, in a weird way.The Family Stone (2005) 53%Imagine if the worst blowout your family had over a holiday meal was a movie, and also kinda charming and cathartic rather than stressful. That’s The Family Stone, which stars the great Diane Keaton as a forceful matriarch and Sarah Jessica Parker as a potential (emphasis on the “potential”) future daughter-in-law. Rachel McAdams as a kind of Regina George in sweatpants almost steals the show. Bring tissues.Four Christmases (2008) 25%Four Christmases understands that the holidays can be rough, especially if you’re dealing with multiple families who may or may not all like each other and/or you and your partner. This 2008 film –&nbsp;which has developed a following over the past decade –&nbsp;adds some hilarious big-name actors (Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon) to that reality in order to create a movie experience that’s a relatable escape. Look out for a very funny turn by Katy Mixon, who would go on to star in American Housewife.Last Christmas (2019) 46%Take the Mother of Dragons and the hot guy from Crazy Rich Asians, mix them with the music of George Michael, bring in Emma Thompson to co-write the script and Paul Feig to direct, and sprinkle a bit of holiday magic over the whole thing, and you’re looking at Last Christmas. Look, we get that the story is somewhat predictable – pretty much everyone figured out where it was going just from watching the trailer – and it’s all a tad overly sentimental, but with this kind of pedigree, it’s hard not to be charmed by its immensely likable stars and its feel-good fuzziness.The Holiday (2006) 49%It’s fair (if a little reductive) to say that The Holiday is what  would be if it only focused on two couples instead of, like, 25. Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet star as two women who swap homes for the holidays and fall in love with Jude Law and Jack Black, respectively. A little predictable, sure, but in that special way that’s warm and reassuring — the Christmas rom-com equivalent of chestnuts roasting on an open fire.Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992) 34%There’s something charmingly old-school about Kevin McCallister’s second adventure. He travels to New York by mistake thanks to lax airport security regulations, enjoys a New York City that feels bygone for some vague nostalgic reason, and Donald Trump makes a cameo (that was cute, rather than controversial, at the time). But, if remembering Christmases of yesteryear isn’t enough for you, Home Alone 2 is worth it if only because it’s a hoot to see young Kevin inflict a possibly fatal amount of damage to the hapless Wet Bandits, once again.The Ice Harvest (2005) 47%The Ice Harvest is a Christmas movie in the way Die Hard is a Christmas movie: Arguably. Harold Ramis’ thriller comedy is set on Christmas Eve, and there’s a cool wintry vibe throughout the whole thing. It’s enough to make The Ice Harvest a good Christmas watch when you want to come up for some less holly jolly air while still feeling like you’re honoring the Christmas spirit.Jingle All the Way (1996) 17%Jingle All the Way is not just an unfairly maligned Christmas movie — it’s also a pretty good Power Rangers movie in disguise. Turbo-Man is a hero for our time, as are dads like Howard Langston (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Myron Larabee (Sinbad) who, in the true spirit of Christmas (read: capitalism), will brave crowded malls to make sure their kids get the perfect present under the tree on Christmas morn.Office Christmas Party (2016) 41%A typical workplace Christmas party is either underwhelming (oh, there’s fake holly in the break room) or a terrible mistake (how many co-workers did I kiss?). This 2016 comedy is about the latter sort. Starring Jason Bateman, Olivia Munn, and T.J. Miller, Office Christmas Party doesn’t quite go so far as to put the “X” in “X-mas,” but it certainly earns its R rating, making it a rowdy change of pace for this time of year.The Polar Express (2004) 56%Robert Zemeckis’ take on the classic Christmas children’s book was extremely ambitious — only problem was that motion-capture technology wasn’t quite there yet in 2004, so CGI Tom Hanks and Co. ride the titular train straight through the uncanny valley. You can’t help but appreciate what Zemeckis was trying to do, and there’s a very sweet Christmas story underneath the eerily smooth textures. In fact, there’s a case to be made that the uncanny look of the movie only adds to the surreal holiday magic that propels this mighty train’s engines. A case –&nbsp;but not an open-and-shut one.Reindeer Games (Deception) (2000) 26%Another action flick set at Christmastime, Reindeer Games sets itself apart from Die Hard and The Ice Harvest,/i&gt; by making the holiday a little more than just scenery. When Ben Affleck and Co. rob a casino, they’re all dressed as Santa Clauses (Santas plural, not the Tim Allen kind). Reindeer Games is a pretty thorough fusion of Christmas and kick-ass, which is no small feat.Santa Claus Conquers the Martians (1964) 22%Kris Kringle doesn’t actually do much conquering in this extremely cheap-looking 1964 sci-fi comedy. Instead, Martians kidnap him in order to bring some Christmas cheer to their very boring martian children.&nbsp;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&nbsp;is the subject of one of the best&nbsp;Mystery Science Theater 3000&nbsp;episodes, but even without the bots’ commentary, it’s a hall-of-fame “so bad it’s good” flick –&nbsp;every character acts like they’re high on a mixture of sugarplums and quaaludes. Also, fun fact: This was the first time Mrs. Claus ever appeared on screen.The Santa Clause 2 (2002) 56%The Santa Clause 2 is a charming second reminder to always read the fine print –&nbsp;and one that’s just 5% shy of Freshness on the Tomatometer. It’s fun to see Tim Allen as a more confident Santa Claus in his second go-around, and the film operates in a neat space thematically. Everything is fantastical and Christmasy, while also being grounded with talk of contracts, parenting, and finding love after divorce. Let’s call it “Christmas magical realism.”Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) 42%It doesn’t take a lot of work to make the Santa Claus fable horrifying (“he knows when you are sleeping / he knows when you’re awake”). So, Silent Night, Deadly Night takes the next logical step and makes an axe-murderer out of him. There are some depictions of mental health in this movie that&nbsp;deserve&nbsp;big lumps of coal, but if you’re willing to just accept Silent Night, Deadly Night as a seasonally appropriate ’80s slasher, you won’t be disappointed.Star Wars: Holiday Special (1978) 27%George Lucas made a habit of going back to update or change parts of the Star Wars films he didn’t like for new “special editions,” but the one thing he can’t do is erase this 1978 TV special from history. Sure, there was a cool cartoon that introduced Boba Fett to the far, far, away galaxy, but the actors all look miserable and/or stoned, large swaths of the dialogue are incomprehensible Wookie-speak, and at one point Chewbacca’s grandpa gets noticeably horny. If you haven’t seen it, it’s worth tracking down this holiday season, if only to see why George hates it so much.Whoever Slew Auntie Roo? (1971) 56%Imagine if Psycho was set at Christmastime and centered on a demented British lady and her mummified daughter instead of a demented American man and his mummified mother. Who Slew Auntie Roo — originally titled Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?, because, British — is excellent counter-programming for all that colorful feel-good Christmas fare.On an Apple device?

Initially pursuing a career in graphic design, he eventually auditioned with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, earning a spot among the student body and winning several awards during his tenure at the school.Initially focusing his efforts on the stage, Rickman picked up some early TV credits — including an appearance in the 1982 BBC program The Barchester Chronicles — but his first taste of widespread acclaim came courtesy of his Tony-winning portrayal of the Vicomte de Valmont in Les Liaisons Dangereuses, a role he held during the play’s 1985 Royal Shakespeare Company run and reprised when the production moved to Broadway in 1987.Rickman’s first major film appearance arrived in 1988’s Die Hard, in which he played Hans Gruber, the delightfully snide terrorist whose takeover of a Los Angeles high rise is foiled by the indefatigable efforts of New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) — but not before hero and heavy engage in a battle of wits and one-liners that spawned several sequels and a legion of countless action-thriller imitators. It was followed by a number of memorable roles that included eminently loathable bad guys (like the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1991’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves), comedic turns in films such as Dogma and Galaxy Quest, and several appearances as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter franchise.Along the way, Rickman continued to compile a varied list of stage and television credits. He moved into directing, helming The Winter Guest (1995) and A Little Chaos (2015). His voice could be heard in episodes of King of the Hill and Back at the Barnyard. He won a Golden Globe Award, an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his work in the 1996 HBO movie Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny — and as a recent testament to his range, in 2013, he portrayed Ronald Reagan (in The Butler) as well as legendary club owner Hilly Kristal (in CBGB).One of Rickman’s most frequent collaborators, Emma Thompson, was among the first to pay tribute after news of his passing broke, sharing that she’d “just kissed him goodbye” and offering a tender eulogy filled with fond memories of their relationship. “He was the ultimate ally. In life, art and politics,” wrote Thompson. “I trusted him absolutely. He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again.”Read also:&nbsp;Alan Rickman’s complete filmography","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"robots, curtis, 2018","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"alan-rickman-1946-2016"},{"id":"47614046457685","title":"Upcoming TV Fantasy Series That Could Be the Next Game of Thrones","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Upcoming TV Fantasy Series That Could Be the Next Game of ThronesCastings, development, and more news about the most exciting new fantasy series coming to TV and streaming, including His Dark Materials, Lord of the Rings, and the Game of Thrones prequels.by Erik Amaya | November 18, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by New Line Cinema)TV is set for an onslaught of high-profile fantasy epics in the next few years, and we at Rotten Tomatoes can’t wait. Witness the buzz around The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;television series in development at Amazon — acquired for $250 million and expected to ultimately cost more than $1 billion — along with the&nbsp;Gormenghast series announced&nbsp;in 2018 by FreemantleMedia North America, and HBO’s endless plans for the Game of Thrones world. It’s a big change from the genre’s historical position in the medium.It may be strange to think of it now, but Game of Thrones&nbsp;was a risky proposition when HBO first began development of the series, and its prospects were buoyed by the fact that its more fantastic elements appeared later in the narrative (we had to wait so long&nbsp;for those dragons). Prior to that, fantasy was relegated to syndicated fare like Conan the Adventurer and&nbsp;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. Xena: Warrior Princess&nbsp;was an outlier in terms of quality storytelling, but its occasionally cheesy effects proved to the television executives that fantasy TV was too expensive, while other series proved it was often built on poor story standards. GoT changed that perception, even if the fantasy shows that emerged in its wake&nbsp;— The Shannara Chronicles&nbsp;and Shadowhunters&nbsp;for example — proved closer in story quality to the BeastMaster television series.But The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;and the Game of Thrones prequels are not the only promising fantasy series in development at the moment. A number of classic fantasy epics and novels will become television thanks to the power of streaming services like Amazon, cable options like BBC America, and other outlets that are worth spotlighting. There are also a few notable series not yet scooped up by the powers in television that we think should get the TV treatment as soon as possible. So here is a handy list of the fantasy series currently in development and a couple we hope will follow them.FANTASY SERIES COMING TO TV AND STREAMINGUPDATED: The Lord of the Rings(Photo by Amazon Prime Video)TV Release Date: most likely 2021Based On: J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, an epic tale of four Hobbits, a Wizard, an Elf, two Men and a Dwarf attempting to destroy the Dark Lord Sauron’s master weapon without letting him discover their plan. A war across most of Middle-earth ensues.The Fanbase: The obsessive devotees of Tolkien’s legendarium and fans of the Peter Jackson film series.Everything We Know So Far: Amazon is committed to produce a five-season series based on The Lord of the Rings in partnership with Tolkien’s estate and the various rights holders of the Rings and Hobbit film series. Amazon renewed the series for season 2, while season 1 is still early in pre-production in New Zealand, Deadline reported in November. The renewal necessitates a break in filming season 1, so that the writers room can reassemble and address season 2 plotting and scripts — possibly facilitating simultaneous or back-to-back filming of seasons 1 and 2.While early reports speculated that the series would focus on a younger Aragorn, who roamed the lands of Middle-earth as a Dunedain ranger under various names like Strider and Thorongil, Amazon’s own teases&nbsp;contradict that theory.&nbsp;In February 2019, Amazon&nbsp;released an&nbsp;interactive map of Middle-earth extending into the far east region not included on maps Tolkien made himself; though he sketched out some topography for the area in his notes. The streaming platform also included this enigmatic quote from Tolkien’s Ring Poem: “Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky.” But after weeks of teasing, the map finally changed to reveal a Second Age setting — the time in which the Elven rings were forged and the Dark Lord Sauron conquered lands in the southern parts of Middle-earth.The streamer also released the series’ social media pages on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.In July of 2019, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom director J.A. Bayona signed on to helm the first two episodes of the series. He and producing partner Belén Atienza will also serve as executive producers.(Photo by HBO: Joseph Mawle as Benjen Stark in 'Game of Thrones')The cast includes Robert Aramayo, Owain Arthur, Nazanin Boniadi, Joseph Mawle, and Morfydd Clark as Galadriel. In March of 2021, Tom Budge announced his departure from the series, citing the producers’ decision to take his character in a different direction. That same month, Wayne Che Yip took over directing duties in New Zealand.Read More: “Everything We Know About&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings&nbsp;Amazon Series”It’s Most Like:&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings film series. Since the TV rights to Tolkien’s work remained with his estate, hammering out a deal with the likes of Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, and MGM suggests Amazon has an interest in making the series visually consistent with Jackson’s vision of Middle-earth.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: The Lord of the Rings films are all Certified Fresh at 91%, 95%, and 93% respectively. The Hobbit films less so — 64%, 74%, and 59% — but they were always at a disadvantage by adopting the tone of LOTR. The tale of Sauron and the various people he encounters in the Second Age share the scope and thematic consistency of Tolkien’s classic fantasy novel.The Witcher: Blood Origin(Photo by Netflix)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The world created by Witcher novelist Andrzej Sapkowski and Netflix’s Witcher television series.The Fanbase: The various factions of Witcher fans who come to the series thanks to the novels, video games, Netflix series, and that song.Everything We Know So&nbsp;Far: On July 27, 2020, Netflix announced its intention to produce a 6-episode limited series based on a key aspect of Witcher lore. 1200 years before Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill) walked the Continent, a conjunction of the spheres forced the worlds of monsters, elves, and men to become one land. And out of the tumult, the first Witcher was born. Laurence O’Fuarain stars as Fjall, a fierce warrior whose search for redemption leads him into unlikely company. Declan de Barra serves as showrunner while The Witcher’s Lauren Schmidt is also onboard as an executive producer. Production is expected to begin in July. Unfortunately, Jodie Turner-Smith, who was cast as another lead character, dropped out in April over scheduling conflicts.It’s Most&nbsp;Like: Well, The Witcher, but the prominence on Elves does offer it a slight Lord of the Rings vibe as well.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: The first season of The Witcher produced a Tomatometer score of 67%, but an audience of 91%, so the program will likely please fans of the Continent and its history.Game of Thrones Prequels(Photo by Macall B. Polay/HBO)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The yarns of history or myth A Song of Ice and Fire author George R.R. Martin likes to tell while characters eat sweet meats and plot their next move in the Game of Thrones. Also based on the short stories and longer histories the author publishes while he is not finishing The Winds of Winter.The Fanbase: Game of Thrones&nbsp;fans, which is a large part of HBO’s subscriber base at this point.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know So Far: At one point, HBO president Casey Bloys said there could be as many as five prequel series after Game of Thrones completed its run in 2019. Developed with Martin, multiple premises were in an informal competition for a programming slot. All of those initial programs failed to become series, but a new round of spinoff development began in 2021.In the interim, the first&nbsp;prequel to get the greenlight in a 10-episode, straight-to-series order, is called House of the Dragon. The announcement was made at the October 29, 2019 HBO Max presentation on the Warner Bros. lot in in Burbank.House of the Dragon#HouseOfTheDragon, a #GameofThrones prequel is coming to @HBO.The series is co-created by @GRRMSpeaking and Ryan Condal. Miguel Sapochnik will partner with Condal as showrunner and will direct the pilot and additional episodes. Condal will be writing the series. pic.twitter.com/9ttMzElgXm— 🔥 Game of Thrones 🔥 (@GameOfThrones) October 29, 2019The series, set 300 years before the events of Game of Thrones, tells the story of House Targaryen. Emmy-winning director Miguel Sapochnik (Game of Thrones) and Ryan Condal (Colony) will partner as showrunners and will also serve as executive producers along with Martin and Vince Gerardis. Sapochnik will direct the pilot and additional episodes of the series, which will be written by Condal.Martin responded to the news on his blog.“House of the Dragon has been in development for several years (though the title has changed a couple of times during that process). It was actually the first concept I pitched to HBO when we started talking about a successor show, way back in the summer of 2016. If you’d like to know a bit more of what the show will be about… well, I can’t actually spill those beans, but you might want to pick up a copy of two anthologies I did with Gardner Dozois, Dangerous Women&nbsp;and Rogues, and then move on to Archmaester Gyldayn’s history, Fire &amp; Blood.”Martin released Fire &amp; Blood, the first volume of a two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros, in November 2018. Centuries before the events of A Song of Ice and Fire series, the Targaryens fled Valyria and landed at Dragonstone. The book begins with Aegon the Conqueror, who married his sister and created the Iron Throne. The second prequel would cover the events in that novel up through the Dance of Dragons, a bloody, great civil war between Targaryens for the Iron Throne that saw sibling slay sibling and dragon battle dragon.Did someone say “dragon battle”? Yes, unlike the now-deceased first prequel, the second story should feature some of the most fearsome of the Targaryen dragons, including Balerion (The Black Dread), the only Westeros dragon to have lived in Valyria and whose skull is seen filling the basement of the Red Keep in Game of Thrones.“But… let me make this perfectly clear… I am not taking on any scripts until I have finished and delivered Winds of Winter. Winter is still coming, and Winds remains my priority, as much as I’d love to write an episodes of House,” Martin wrote in his October 30, 2019 blog post, following news of the series order.In his September post, Martin gave an update following the intense media attention to news on the second prequel:&nbsp;“Yes, it is based on material from one of my books.&nbsp;(FWIW, those who have read Fire &amp; Blood will realize it contains enough materials for a dozen shows.) This one has a title, but no one else has revealed it, so I had better not either. (But it’s not the obvious title.)“It has a script and a bible, and both of them are terrific, first rate, exciting. They’re the work of Ryan Condal,” he wrote. “He’s a helluva strong writer, and a huge fan of A Song&nbsp;of Ice and Fire, Dunk &amp; Egg, and Westeros in general. I’ve loved working with him, and if the Seven Gods and HBO are kind, I hope to keep on working with him for years to come on this new successor show, the title of which is…&nbsp;Ooops. Almost slipped. Can’t say yet.&nbsp;I can say that there will be dragons. Everyone else has said that, so why not me?”Across late 2020 and early 2021, a cast formed including Rhys Ifans, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Sonoya Mizuno, Paddy Considine, Olivia Cooke, Matt Smith, Emma D’Arcy and Fabien Frankel. Considine plays King Viserys Targaryen, a kindly ruler of the Seven Kingdoms whose unusual plan for succession leads to the Dance of Dragons. The other castmembers either play his relatives or other ambitious people within the realm looking to use the instability for their own gain.Read more: Everything We Know About HBO’s Game of Thrones (Dead) PrequelTales of Dunk and EggIn January of 2021, word broke that HBO is also developing as series based on Martin’s “Dunk and Egg” novellas. Currently known as Tales of Dunk and Egg, the proposed program is set 90 years prior to Game of Thrones and will center on Ser Duncan the Tall, aka Dunk, and his squire, Egg, as they journey around Westeros. It is unclear how important Egg’s destiny as King Aegon V Targaryen will be to the program, though.Four Other PrequelsBeyond House of the Dragon and Dunk and Egg, four other projects are in the works at HBO. These include an animated series of which little is known, a program Bruno Heller is developing about House of the Dragon supporting character Lord Corlys Velaryon – although it is unclear if it is a direct spinoff of that series – a show focusing on Princess Nymeria and the founding of Dorne 1,000 years before Games of Thrones, and another set in the King’s Landing slum of Flea Bottom.They’re&nbsp;Most Like:&nbsp;Game of Thrones.Chances They Will Be Certified Fresh Hits: Unless they’re colossal train wrecks,&nbsp;the prequel series will be hits. Until its eighth and final season, GoT&nbsp;never dipped below 90% Fresh on the Tomatometer. And with a new production staff coming in, the senioritis that plagued GoT‘s final year shouldn’t be a factor.The Kingkiller Chronicle(Photo by DAW Books)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: Patrick Rothfuss’s as-yet incomplete trilogy – which began with The Name of the Wind and continued in The Wise Man’s Fear – and other works Rothfuss set in the same reality. The main series tells the tale of a famed scribe and biographer listening to the stories of an adventurer, arcanist, and musician named Kvothe, who appears to have settled into a retirement as an innkeeper.The Fanbase: Fantasy lovers and musicians like Hamilton’s Lin-Manuel Miranda.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp; Lionsgate has been developing a series, film, and video game series based on Rothfuss’s novels since 2015. In November of 2016, Miranda signed on as a “creative producer” for the film and TV aspects of the project. The films – the first of which is to be directed by Spider-Man’s Sam Raimi – will concern Kvothe’s chronicle, while the TV series will explore other aspects of Rothfuss’s world. Both the author and Miranda are said to be developing characters for the series, which was in development at Showtime. In February of 2019, Showtime president Gary Levine told reporters showrunner John Rogers (Leverage) and “a group of writers” were working on the series with input from Manuel, but offered no further details. The premise reportedly revolved around two traveling musicians a generation prior to the events of the main novels and eventual film series. By that September, Showtime passed on the series, but left Lionsgate’s television division free to shop it around to other outlets. Reportedly, a number of scripts have already been written and at least one set-to-launch streaming service may be in the process of reading them. In November of 2020, Miranda said working on His Dark Materials gave him a new perspective on the material and that it just needs the right director and script to make the whole thing work.It’s&nbsp;Most Like:&nbsp;Other fantasy epics with a wonderful Interview with the Vampire–esque narrative conceit.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit:&nbsp;It all depends on when it happens. Since the movie appears to be further along in development, it remains to be seen how much crossover will exist between it and the series. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. attempted cohesion with the film franchises for the first couple of years, but eventually needed narrative distance. And without that strong tie to the films, it is unclear if fans will take to new characters without Kvothe as a unifying force. Also, this is assuming the film itself is a Certified Fresh hit.Earthsea(Photo by Emma McIntyre/Getty Images; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.)Based On:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Earthsea&nbsp;novels and stories of Ursula K. Le Guin. Set on a planet of small archipelagos, various cultures, and a real magic tradition, the first novel centers around Ged, a young mage who comes of age while trying to escape a demonic shadow he conjured into being. Sadly, Le Guin passed away before anyone could make an&nbsp;Earthsea&nbsp;adaptation that reflected her core concept for the world: a fantasy setting composed mainly of brown-skinned people accepting the inevitability of death.The Fanbase: Almost every fantasy and science fiction fan on the planet.It’s Most Like:&nbsp;Itself. The Earthsea series set the standard for so many that followed.Everything We Know So Far: Optioned for films by Nightcrawler’s Jennifer Fox (pictured) shortly before Le Guin’s death in 2018, A24 and Fox revealed in September of 2019 they will develop the project as a television series.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: Adaptations of Earthsea have not fared well. Studio Ghibli’s Tales from Earthsea,&nbsp;directed by Hayao Miyazaki’s son Goro, rests at a Rotten 43% on the Tomatometer and almost equally bad audience score of 46%. Le Guin was disappointed in its focus on combat and an externalized villain, despite praising its visual beauty. An&nbsp;earlier Sci-Fi Channel miniseries fares a little better with an audience score of 53%, but has no official Tomatometer score. Le Guin was not a fan, as it cast Shawn Ashmore as the brown-skinned Ged among other liberties taken with the material. Her criticisms of the adaptation are far more entertaining than the show itself. All of which means that any new&nbsp;adaptation&nbsp;has&nbsp;an uphill battle as it begins its development as a television series&nbsp;— at least the Tomatometer bar is set low.The Wheel of TimeDebbie DayTV Release Date: TBDBased On: The epic fantasy series by Robert Jordan and concluded by Brandon Sanderson&nbsp;— whose own Mistborn series is getting the film-franchise treatment&nbsp;— after Jordan’s death in 2007. Set in a world that is both Earth’s distant past and far future, the cycle of time is threatened by a Shadow of ultimate evil. It searches for “The Dragon Reborn,” a being of light fated to clash with the Shadow. Various enemies and allies of both sides appear as the main characters learn more about their fate and even cross into parallel worlds. Each book in the latter half of the series — books eight through 14 — hit&nbsp;No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.The Fanbase: Probably every fantasy fan you know.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp;Amazon and Sony Pictures Television announced in February 2018 that they are developing the series in concert, and at a London press event on Oct. 2, 2018, they announced that they ordered the one-hour action-fantasy to series, with Rafe Judkins (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Chuck), who adapted the novels for television, serving as showrunner and executive producer. Rick Selvage and Larry Mondragon of Red Eagle Entertainment, Ted Field and Mike Weber of Radar Pictures (Beirut, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) and Darren Lemke (Shrek Forever After) are executive producers. Consulting producer Harriet McDougal edited the Wheel of Time novels written by her late husband Jordan and is the current copyright holder. In June 2019, Rosamund Pike signed on to star in the series as Moiraine, a woman who leads a group of youngsters across the worlds in an attempt to find the Dragon Reborn. Pike will also serve as a producer on the series. That August, the streaming service announced the five fresh faces who will play those&nbsp;young men and women:&nbsp;Madeleine Madden as Egwene Al’Vere,&nbsp;Marcus Rutherford as Perrin Aybara,&nbsp;Barney Harris as Mat Cauthon,&nbsp;Zoë Robins as Nynaeve, and Josha Stradowski as Rand Al’Thor (pictured above).&nbsp;In September that year, Hawaii 5-0’s Daniel Henney joined the cast as al’Lan Mandragoran, the last scion of Malkier’s noble line. In March of 2021, Amazon released a very brief tease of Pike’s Moiraine declaring “Do not underestimate the women in this tower.”(Photo by Tor Books)It’s Most Like:&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings, which may be a problem as Amazon’s five-season LOTR series is also in the works.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: It’s hard to say. Judkins boasts credits on CF seasons of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Fresh season of Chuck, but his primary credits also include a co-producer role on the 27%-scoring first season of Hemlock Grove; that said, the disastrous Netflix supernatural series starred Bill Skarsgård, who’s gone on to roles like Pennywise in CF horror film It and the mysterious prisoner in another supernatural series, Hulu’s CF hit Castle Rock. The key issue now is whether or not Amazon will have money to develop another property with an epic scope once LOTR begins production.The Sandman(Photo by DC Comics)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The DC/Vertigo comic book series by writer Neil Gaiman and a variety of artists, including Sam Keith, Mike Dringenberg, Michael Zulli, and Jill Thompson, in which Dream of the Endless – the manifestation of dreams across the cosmos – faces a dilemma when his self-imposed obligations make it impossible for him to continue to function as he has for millennia. Of course, before he can deal with that internal conflict, he must put his realm, the Dreaming, back in order after being held prisoner on Earth for 75 years.The Fanbase: Goths, Tori Amos fans, and people who started reading books for fun at a really early age.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp;After nearly 30 years of attempts to adapt The Sandman into a feature film, Warner Bros. Television and Netflix struck a deal for a direct-to-series adaptation&nbsp;— which is, really, The Sandman’s best destiny outside of the comics. Gaiman will executive produce alongside Krypton’s David S. Goyer&nbsp;— the pair was also attached as executive producers on the last feature film attempt&nbsp;— while Wonder Woman screenwriter Allan Heinberg will co-write the pilot alongside Gaiman and serve as showrunner.The rumors are true. The tangled story of Morpheus, King of Dreams is becoming a Netflix series! Warner Brothers and executive producer Allan Heinberg (Wonder Woman screenwriter) have signed on to bring the dream of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman into reality. pic.twitter.com/cOMjPL5cqp— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) July 1, 2019Following the announcement, Gaiman took to Twitter to clear up some confusion about his role in the series. Among the nuggets he offered: the series will be set in the present day&nbsp;— outside of flashbacks to certain incidents in history, we’re presuming&nbsp;— and not the late 1980s/1990s setting of the original comic book series. He will be involved “much more than American Gods” but “less than Good Omens.” He also hopes “we can make something on television that feels as personal and true as the best of the Sandman comics did.” The first season will be 11 episodes and comprise the story told in the comic’s first seven issues (now known collectively as Preludes &amp; Nocturnes) and “a little bit more.” We’re hoping a single-issue tale like “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Calliope” or “A Dream of a Thousand Cats” becomes that “little bit more.” Although, we’ll be stunned if “The Sound of Her Wings” is held back until season 2. The cast includes Tom Sturridge as Morpheus, Gwendoline Christie as Lucifer, Vivienne Acheampong as Lucienne, Sanjeev Bhaskar and Asim Chaudhry as Cain and Abel; and Boyd Holbrook as the Corinthian.It’s Most Like: Good Omens, which is no surprise as Gaiman began writing the series around the time he and Terry Pratchett were writing the novel upon which the recent Amazon series was based. Both span thousands of years of history and see characters learning they are more than their titles. Then there’s also the whimsy to consider, and another role in which Michael Sheen could dress all in white. Although, the Corinthian is a far less agreeable chap than Aziraphale.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: Good Omens was a Certified Fresh hit at 82% on the Tomatometer. Readers seemed to like it a bit more, as it has a 92% audience score. American Gods, also based on Gaiman’s work, came out of its second season with 75% on the Tomatometer and an 82% audience score. Considering Gaiman intends to be more involved in The Sandman than he was during American Gods’ reportedly troubled second season, we predict a high Tomatometer score when the Sandman series eventually debuts. Though the comic was a magnet for Gothy types, it really appeals to just about everyone who gives it a shot. Presumably, its best qualities will make it irresistible to Netflix subscribers and reviewers alike.&nbsp;Gormenghast(Photo by BBC/courtesy Everett Collection)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: Mervyn Peake’s mid-20th century novel trilogy&nbsp;— Titus Groan, Gormenghast, and&nbsp;Titus Alone — and the incomplete follow-ups centering on Titus Goran, reluctant heir to the immense Castle Gormenghast and the surrounding domain. But even as Titus grows up knowing he must eventually become a ruler, an ambitious kitchen boy plots his downfall.The Fanbase: Writerly types like Neil Gaiman.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp; Gormenghast fan Gaiman,&nbsp;Doctor Who scribe Toby Whithouse, and Star Trek: Discovery’s Akiva Goldsman&nbsp;set up a new version of Gormenghast&nbsp;for FremantleMedia North America&nbsp;in 2018 without a streaming platform or broadcaster&nbsp;attached, but in August 2019 the project&nbsp;landed at Showtime. While the 2000 BBC adaptation of Gormenghast, starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers (pictured above), focused on the first two novels, the new series will cover all three of Peakes completed novels and the two further stories he outlined prior to his death in 1957.It’s Most Like:&nbsp;Historical fiction with a few fantasy trappings.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: Unlike most of the other projects in development, Gormenghast is notable for a distinct lack of magic despite its fantasy setting. Like the grounded first season of Game of Thrones, the more realistic world will set it apart from Middle-earth and the Hyborian Age.The Chronicles of Narnia(Photo by Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The seven Narnia novels by author C.S. Lewis, in which a group of WWII-era British school children gain access to a parallel realm known as Narnia. There, the Great Lion Aslan – a manifestation of Jesus Christ – teaches the children life lessons while giving them dominion over the land. The series eventually pivots from the Pevensie children to their cousin Eustace Scrubb, who goes from being a right git to a proper hero of Narnia. Santa Claus also makes a cameo appearance.The Fanbase: Fans of high fantasy with overt Christian allegories.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp;On October 3, 2018, Netflix announced it acquired the film and television rights to the Narnia book series. The plan includes both films and television series, which suggests there may be a way to include the prequel novel, The Magician’s Nephew, in the story cycle. Mark Gordon, Douglas Gresham, and Vincent Sieber will serve as executive producers for the television series and as producers for features. In June 2019, Coco co-writer Matthew Aldrich signed on to oversee the adaptation as an overall creative director for both the television series and the planned films. In early 2021, Netflix film cheif Scott Stuber mentioned Narnia is still in the works.It’s Most Like: As Lewis and Tolkien were friends and sparring partners, similarities between Narnia and Middle-earth abound, right down to walking trees. As realized in other media, though, Narnia is not as fully formed as Tolkien’s Arda, with the world, costumes, and critters seeming more traditionally European in concept.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: The Narnia film series followed a downward slope with The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe obtaining a Certified Fresh 76% on the Tomatometer, Prince Caspian following it up with a 67%, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader striking out with a 50% score. But as the series eventually changes protagonists, the switch to Eustace always made Narnia a tougher theatrical sell. He may fare better on television.Conan(Photo by Universal Pictures)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The stories of Robert E. Howard featuring Conan the Cimmerian who roamed a fictional “Hyborian Age” said to occur after the destruction of Atlantis, but before the rise of “modern” civilization. An accomplished warrior in his teens, Conan became a pirate, thief and mercenary before claiming the throne of Aquilonia in his forties by strangling the man who was sitting in it at the time.The Fanbase: Everyone from fantasy authors like Robert Jordan to filmmakers like Oliver Stone and former president Barack Obama, as well as fans of the Conan films like 1982 Universal Pictures release&nbsp;Conan the Barbarian,&nbsp;starring Arnold Schwarzenegger (pictured).Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far: At one time, Amazon was developing a series based more directly on Howard’s stories than later authors’ work or the Marvel Comics series of the 1970s and ’80s. Colony co-creator Ryan Condal was onboard to write and produce with Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik attached to direct the pilot.&nbsp;But years went by with no further developments and both Condal and Sapochnik moved on to House of the Dragon. In September of 2020, word broke indicating Netflix now had the property with Pathfinder Media set to produce. But as before, news on Conan is surprisingly scarce.It’s Most Like:&nbsp;A Dark Age version of Thrones in which men wear fewer garments.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: In light of the significant change, this one is tough to call. Netflix’s experience with fantasy (The Witcher, Cursed) is encouraging, but without any creatives attached to the project, the program is even more of a wildcard than it was during the Amazon years.The Dark Tower(Photo by Photos by Jonathan Hession -- Sam Strike in 'Nightflyers' Syfy/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images; Jasper Paakkonen in 'Vikings' History)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: Stephen King’s flagship fantasy series The Dark Tower. Across eight novels, a number of short stories and numerous connections to his other writings, the series details the journey of gunslinger Roland and his band of friends as they attempt to reach the Dark Tower — anchor point of the multiverse — before the Man in Black can destroy it. Once there, Roland discovers he’s played out this cycle before, clearing the way for film and television adaptations to be sequels of the original novel series.The Fanbase: King’s wide audience and fantasy lovers who manage to get past the rough first chapters of The Gunslinger, the cycle’s first novel.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp;Originally intended as a companion piece to 2017’s&nbsp;The Dark Tower&nbsp;film centering on the life of Roland (played by Idris Elba) in Mid-World,&nbsp;the series will instead start over with Nightflyers’ Sam Strike (pictured above left) as Roland and Vikings’ Jasper Pääkkönen&nbsp;(pictured above right) as the villainous Man in Black. Considering the film’s poor performance (17% on the Tomatometer), it is probably for the best. In early 2020, Amazon passed on the project, although executive producer Glen Mazzara said he hoped the series will find a home elsewhere. One year later, we doubt Roland will ever make it to the Dark Tower in live action.It’s Most Like:&nbsp;Like a number of fantasy series from the 1970s and ’80s, it openly wears its Tolkien inspiration everywhere. In fact, King says as much in a foreword to the novel series. But it grows by leaps and bounds as King discovers a way to tie Mid-World to Derry, Maine, and his other favorite locations.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: It seems The Dark Tower may be unworkable as either a film or television series. Or, at least, too expensive and unwieldly for companies already engaged in creating things like The Lord of the Rings and The Witcher. In terms of critical reception, any such series would need the full resources of a streaming service or cable outlet to be welcomed favorably.The Ruin of Kings(Photo by Macmillan Publishers/Annapurna Pictures)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: The first novel in author Jenn Lyons’ A Chorus of Dragons series. Young thief Kihrin discovers he may be of the royal bloodline, and he may also be at the center of a prophecy stating that he will end the empire. There are a lot of conditional statements in his life, making him sound more like the most timid Skyrim player to ever live. But the Black Brotherhood, after buying him as a slave, may provide motivation enough for him to care about his foretold destiny.The Fanbase: Since the book only debuted in February 2019, the fanbase is still forming.Everything We Know So&nbsp;Far: Annapurna Television optioned the rights shortly after The Ruin of Kings was published. Presumably, the search is underway for key creatives and a home for the program.It’s Most Like: Game of Thrones and The Lord of the Rings with its mix of prophecies, scrappy heroes, gods, witches, zombies, and even krakens.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: Even odds. A Chorus of Dragons is such a new concept that a simple logline makes it sound utterly derivative of other popular series. But with fantasy, it is all in how those well-worn creatures and tropes get used. And if reviews of the novel are to be believed, The Ruin of Kings mixes those elements in an unexpected and worthwhile way.The Broken Earth(Photo by Orbit)TV Release Date: TBDBased On: N.K. Jemisin’s novels about a world in which the single supercontinent, Stillness, is ravaged every few centuries by a dramatic climate change known as “The Fifth Season.” The most recent Fifth Season proved to be particularly bad, leading some to believe the end is at hand. The society of Stillness is broken into races, castes and species. Those divisions help and hinder the people’s efforts to weather the possible apocalypse. Set against this landscape is the tale of three women with the power to both calm and agitate seismic activity under Stillness.&nbsp;All three books in the series won the Hugo Award for best novel.The Fanbase: The voting bodies of both the Hugo Awards and the Nebulas, who nominated The Fifth Season and The Obelisk Gate for best novel in their respective years.Everything&nbsp;We&nbsp;Know&nbsp;So&nbsp;Far:&nbsp;The Fifth Season was optioned by TNT in August of 2017 with Sleepy Hollow’s Leigh Dana Jackson set to write the pilot. Heroes’ Tim Kring was also set to serve as an executive producer. There has been no news since, but development on even a simple (from a design perspective) high-school drama can take forever.It’s most like… Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind with a touch of Game of Thrones.Chances It Will Be a Certified Fresh Hit: As suggested above, it could be a strong counter-program to Amazon’s The Wheel of Time&nbsp;and Lord of the Rings series with a strong emphasis on female characters and ecological disaster. At the same time, TNT is not known for long-running fantasy series – unless you count the fantastic elements of The Librarians – with its last true fantasy project, The Mists of Avalon, debuting back in 2001. That miniseries falters at 44% on the Tomatometer, but it should be noted that TNT was very different entity at the time. The current leadership could offer The Broken Earth the money and support it needs to be a special voice in fantasy television.OUR FANTASY TV WISH LISTElric of Melniboné(Photo by Nelson Doubleday)Based On:&nbsp;The novellas – and later novels – of Michael Moorcock featuring Elric, a frail albino who also happens to be the 428th and final emperor of Meliboné. Though quite weak, Elric’s sword, Stormbringer, offers him renewed health and vitality, but it requires a constant supply of souls to keep it powered. At odds with traditional Meliboné society, his antics cause him troubles at court and lead to his own nephew plotting a coup against him.Why We Want&nbsp;a TV Series:&nbsp;In its setting, it may remind some of&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;and&nbsp;Conan, but Moorcock actively wrote Elric as an antithesis of the Cimmerian wanderer. Heady, weird, and expressly anti-Conan,&nbsp;Elric’s chances of success commercially or critically are a long shot. But then, an enterprising producer could position a series based on Moorcock’s stories as a compelling alternative to&nbsp;Conan.Dragonlance(Photo by Wizards of the Coast)Based On:&nbsp;The&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;role-playing scenarios by Laura and Tracy Hickman and the later tie-in novels by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. In the world of Krynn, dragons dominate and dragonlances are the only weapons mortals not adept in magic can use to kill them. In the first trio of novels, the Heroes of the Lance fight to restore order to the realm. Since then, nearly 200&nbsp;Dragonlance&nbsp;novels have been published.Why We Want&nbsp;a TV Series:&nbsp;While seemingly obscure, a properly developed&nbsp;Dragonlance&nbsp;series would have the potential to fill the void left by&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;when it ends in 2019. The upcoming&nbsp;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;film is said to be based on&nbsp;Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the first&nbsp;Dragonlance&nbsp;novel, but a full series devoted to the game mechanics of D&amp;D&nbsp;and&nbsp;the world of Krynn could be something revolutionary. And as Geek &amp; Sundry’s&nbsp;Critical Role&nbsp;proves every Thursday, there is an audience for stories steeped in the role-playing tradition.Got another fantasy novel or series you think a smart network or streaming service should adapt?

Since then the filmmaker has turned down a Harry Potter installment and seen his mooted adaptation of Yann Martel’s Life of Pi fall over, but this week he returns with Micmacs, a typically oddball piece about an orphan and a circus troupe taking on evil weapons manufacturers. The film touches on Jeunet’s work with former colleague Marc Caro, particularly the off kilter characterization of their hit, Delicatessen. We caught up with Jeunet to discuss the film.RT: So, Micmacs is finally here. It’s good to see you back.J-PJ: Yes. But, you know, I lost two years working on Life of Pi.Was that stressful?No, no, because I think I made the best part. I wrote the script, which was a pleasure, and Twentieth Century Fox was very happy with the script. And I made the storyboard to figure out the digital process. For that I had a model of the boat and the tiger and the kid, and with my video camera I took 3,500 digital shots for editing.That’s almost like a feature film.Yes. The thing was ready to shoot. We knew everything, except it was too expensive.Will you ever come back to it?Ang Lee is supposed to make the film now. It will be an expensive movie, in any case.It’s been over five years now since A Very Long Engagement and I guess audiences might have been wondering, “Where has he gone?”Yes, it’s a little bit dangerous in this case — especially in France.Has the film been received well there?Well… yes and no. I had three huge successes and three is enough, you know. [Laughs] Now this film is very good for some and for others it’s just a piece of sh-t. Normal in France, you know. Lucky for me my film is sold everywhere in the world. I don’t count in terms of French admission, but in terms of world admission. But I try to just make the most beautiful film I have in my head. On the other hand, I feel that I am ready to make another film with American actors, but maybe with the French rhythm. I would like to find the perfect compromise.You’ve mentioned that Micmacs resembles a combination between Delicatessen and Amelie. Do you go back and look at your old films to achieve this, or is it just something subconscious that’s there?Maybe because I was so starving to shoot, maybe it was a mix of everything I love. My references were like Mission: Impossible, Sergio Leone’s movies, and jokes I wanted to put in for a long time — like the gag over the credits. No limits. I didn’t care. I wanted to make a film for the fun.So is this “Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Greatest Hits”?Yes, yes. Recycled here. [Laughs]Where did the idea for this film originate?It was a mix of three different things: of the weapons seller issue, the story of a revenge, and the feeling to make something with a silly original band of people, like the toys of Toy Story, or the Seven Dwarfs of Snow White.It also has something of a silent film, almost slapstick feel to it.Yes. Totally, Buster Keaton. The scene with the cannon is completely Buster Keaton.Danny Boon’s in this, and he’s a huge star in France, with Welcome to the Sticks—21 million admissions! Amelie was a huge film in France, with eight and a half millions before that.Before he came along. Did you enjoy working with him?Oh yes. He’s a very nice guy. I hired him just before the success of Welcome to the Sticks, but after that he stayed the same. He could have gone crazy. I saw, after the success of the film, one million people in front of his balcony in his hometown. But he stays the same. Very nice guy, polite, never late. Very creative, imaginative actor and technical in the centre.What do you demand most out of actors in your films — do they have to be inventive?It depends, but I do some tests every time. For everybody — even Dominique Pinon, my favorite performer.What is it about Dominique that you love?You know, he surprises me every time. And I love his face. For me, it is beautiful. Marc Caro used to say there are two definitions of beautiful: the African statues or the Greek statues, you know? We prefer the African statues. Dominique Pinon is a beautiful African statue. I couldn’t imagine my films without him.Going back to your wish to do something else in English. You had that thing with Harry Potter, and you did the fourth Alien film. Would you say Alien Resurrection was a satisfying experience for you?Yes, yes. I read a lot of times that it was a nightmare, because a lot of people would like it to have been a nightmare. It wasn’t the case.Were you worried when you started on the film, given what happened to David Fincher on the previous installment?Yeah. I spoke with him and he said, “Escape!”How did Fox convince you then?Well I was just curious, and I was sure that I would be fired after three weeks. [Laughs] Sometimes people ask you to do something and sometimes it’s very silly.Was there any tension between what your personal style is and what the studio wanted?The pressure was to save money. They want to save money first. It’s a strange game because they want the best film that you can make and on the other hand they want the cheapest film they can get.That would have been a bigger budget than Amelie or Micmacs though.Oh yes, of course.So do you find it more restrictive working on a bigger budget and for a studio?No, I don’t care. I’ve made some commercials and I’m used to working with a lot of money. I am very respectful with the money because I am from the generation after the war; I was taught to turn off the light in my room or finish my plate of food.Who would you like to work with then — or what kind of film would you like to do next?Really, I don’t know. Now, I would like to make an adaptation. I don’t feel like writing another story. I will write the adaptation, but from the book. I am looking for a very good book. Like A Very Long Engagement; about the war, or fables, something… I don’t know. When I don’t do promotion I read one book per day.Would you ever make an animated film?No… well, at the beginning of my career I made animated films and I know what is involved. Now, everybody wants to make animation and it drives me crazy. For example, the Fantastic Mr. Fox: when I read that [Wes Anderson] directed the film by email, I’m sorry, but he’s a crook. You don’t make a film by email because it’s a long work and you have to be present every step of the way.Where can we find your early animations? Are they released?Oh… I am not very proud of them. [Laughs]Would you consider shooting a film in 3D?Yes. I could have made Micmacs in 3D but we didn’t talk about it at the start. Now I regret it. But it depends on the subject. If it’s a couple f–king in the kitchen then you don’t need it… and often I feel like making that story.What about revisiting one of your films, like doing a sequel to The City of Lost Children, for example?A sequel? No, I don’t think so. Now the girl is an adult! Maybe Amelie in 20 years. There is a joke in Micmacs about Delicatessen but in the first time I wanted to make a joke with Amelie. I wanted Audrey [Tautou] with two babies crying, and Mathieu Kassovitz asleep on the couch watching a football game, but Audrey was shooting Coco Chanel and didn’t want to. She refused. Too bad for me. [Laughs]If you’re ever going to make a sequel — City of Lost Children.You would like to see that?I love that film.That’s funny because when we released the film it was very tough for us. In Cannes film festival.Because of Delicatessen?In France they love when you have a success and then they love to kill you after.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"black, 99%, Martial, Games, Marvel, female, leads, Disney+, Ghostbusters, composers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"jeanpierre-jeunet-talks-micmacs"},{"id":"47614037335888","title":"20 Under-the-Radar Black Movies You Should Seek Out","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})20 Under-the-Radar Black Movies You Should Seek OutValerie Complex shines a spotlight on some of the quiet achievers and overlooked gems of Black cinema, from history-making recent debut feature Burning Cane to a showcase for Cicely Tyson's formidable talent.by Valerie Complex | January 31, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Paul Yee / © Oscilloscope Laboratories / courtesy Everett Collection)It’s Black History Month, and to mark the occasion we’ve compiled a list of Black-centered films that have gone under-the-radar or which have been criminally underrated by the general public –&nbsp;and sometimes the critics.Many Black film lovers will be familiar with most of the movies on this list, but they’re not always among the most celebrated Black stories or movies from Black creators. And broadly, far too many Black films are dismissed for one reason or another – especially when the stars are unrecognizable.When you dig into the list, you’ll see documentaries, drama, comedy, and musical titles from the 1940s to 2020 that we consider true hidden gems. Add them to your watch list, stat!What do you think of this list? What did we miss? Be sure to comment with a film you’ve seen that is under-the-radar or overlooked that you’d like movie fans to know about. Jinn (2018) 91%Summer (Zoe Renee) is a carefree 17-year-old Black girl who loves hanging out with her friends and dancing. She has a close relationship with her famed meteorologist mother, Jade (Simone Missick), but their relationship shifts when Jade converts to Islam –&nbsp;and the change prompts Summer to reevaluate her identity and her path forward. Nijla Mu’min writes and directs this beautiful film, which features rich, three-dimensional characters who exist at the intersection of Blackness and religion. The Fresh family drama highlights the insecurities that come with change and the challenges of faith.Princess of the Row (2020) 88%In Princess of the Row, Alicia Willis (Tayler Buck) leaves foster care to search for her father (Edi Gathegi), who lives on skid row and has PTSD. Despite the impoverished circumstances, Alicia is determined to stay out of the system and keep her family together. Director Van Maximilian Carlson and co-writer A Shawn Austin create an authentic viewing experience that will leave audiences cheering for the leads, and one that has been hailed as a harrowing drama about two demographics often kept on the margin: foster care kids and the homeless.Premature (2020) 93%The Certified Fresh Premature follows a high school senior who gets hit with a heavy dose of reality. Seventeen-year-old poet Ayanna (Zora Howard) engages in a summer romance with the mysterious music producer Isiah (Joshua Boone), immersing herself in the relationship to the point where she loses her sense of self; after an unexpected pregnancy, she realizes she needs to make adult decisions before leaving home for college. Director Rashaad Ernesto Green and his Premature co-writer and star, Howard, craft a modern-day Harlem romantic drama where the characters are fully actualized and the narrative free of racial stereotypes.Jezebel (2019) 89%As America enters an era where online sex work has become increasingly unsafe, movies like Jezebel are ushering in a new generation of genre films centered on sex workers taking control of their careers. The film is based on director Numa Perrier’s life as a sex worker – she also co-stars – who battled sexism and racism to achieve financial success. It’s important to understand this business from the Black female perspective because it’s a subject that is rarely addressed with authenticity and genuine, nuanced understanding of the industry and the lives of those who work within it.Night Comes On (2018) 98%Actress Jordana Spiro made a smashing Sundance debut as a director with her first feature-length movie, Night Comes On. This is where many audience members first discovered the talented Dominique Fishback – transfixing in this month’s Judas and the Black Messiah – who plays Angel, a young woman who emerges from juvenile detention with a mission: to find her 10-year-old sister, and avenge her mother’s death. The film was released to DVD in September of 2018, with very little fanfare, which is unfortunate because it is magnificently performed and directed with a sincerity and heart that captures the beauty of Black sisterhood and the faults of a broken justice system. Critics took huge notice –&nbsp;the movie is Certified Fresh at 98% on the Tomatometer –&nbsp;and we hope wider audiences start to soon, too.The Fits (2016) 96%Anna Rose Holmer‘s coming-of-age character study, The Fits, stands out because it tells the kind of unique story we hadn’t seen on screen before its release – or since. Toni (first-time actress Royalty Hightower) is a tom-boy who follows in her brother’s footsteps and trains in boxing before discovering a new passion when she auditions for the school dance troupe. As a sudden outbreak of fainting spells sweeps through the school, Toni begins to question her identity and need to fit in.Hale County This Morning, This Evening (2018) 97%With Academy Award nominations and hearty public endorsements from the likes of Trevor Noah, Hale County has bizarrely still managed to fly under many movie-lovers’ radars. Filmed over a five-year period, this documentary chronicles the daily lives of several members of the Hale County, Alabama community as they work, go to school, raise children, and move into and out of each other’s lives. Aided by stunning cinematography, the film shatters expectations about Blackness in the South and shines a nuanced light on an amazing and tight-knit community.Charm City Kings (2020) 80%This Sundance favorite brings the audience into the life and mind of sensitive neighborhood kid Mouse (Jahi Di’Allo Winston), who wants to be a part of the Midnight Clique dirt bike group. Bike culture is a big part of Baltimore’s Black community, but one that had rarely been explored before director Angel Manuel Soto‘s acclaimed film. That’s part of why Charm City Kings is worth seeking out: Not only is it an impressively told coming-of-age story, but an intimate look at a collective where friends become family and bond over their love of summertime riding.Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. (1993) 67%Chantel Mitchell (Ariyan A. Johnson) is a 17-year-old high school junior from Brooklyn, New York, who’s determined to become a doctor and make it out at all costs. However, her plans are derailed when her boyfriend Tyrone (Kevin Thigpen) gets her pregnant; confused and filled with anxiety, Chantel grapples with the thought of becoming another teen pregnancy statistic. But Just Another Girl on the I.R.T is not just another pregnancy story. Writer and director Leslie Harris addresses the HIV/AIDS crisis, racism, and problems in the education system in a hopeful and not heavy-handed way, painting a vivid picture of life in New York City in the early 1990s as she does.The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1974) 89%An adaptation of the novel of the same name by author Ernest J. Gaines, Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman stars the legendary Cicely Tyson as Pittman, a 110-year-old former slave who lives in the South, and recounts her life from birth on a slave plantation to the Civil Rights era of the 1960s. A Black cinema staple that often gets lost in the shadows of the landmark Roots miniseries, which premiered on television six years later – and also featured Tyson – director John Korty’s film is a moving must-see.Menace II Society (1993) 83%Cold-blooded is the best word to describe the Hughes brothers’ Menace II Society. Caine Lawson (Tyrin Turner) grew up surrounded by gang culture but doesn’t want to live that life forever; his best friend, O-Dog (Larenz Tate), lives hard and fast and doesn’t care if he lives or dies. His support system consists of his grandmother (Marilyn Coleman), a caring teacher Mr. Butler (Charles S. Dutton), and his girlfriend, Ronnie (Jada Pinkett Smith), all of whom encourage him to move away from the projects; but a series of tragic events will make his escape difficult. The film does not hold back in showing the desperation and brutality that hopelessness and poverty can breed.The Watermelon Woman (1997) 100%Watermelon Woman is an piece of lesbian cinema that is underrated by some and under-seen by many. Cheryl Dunye crafts a story that tackles several themes of racism, sexism, and identity, placing herself in the center of the narrative as a filmmaker searching for the actress who was dubbed the Watermelon Woman. The quest leads Cheryl to explore archival sources that exclude or ignore Black lesbians working in Hollywood, all as she deals with love and New York life in the mid-1990s.Daughters of the Dust (1991) 93%Daughters of the Dust kicks traditional storytelling to the, well, dust, and sees director Julie Dash brandishing her own unique style. The film tracks the traditions, food, and livelihoods of the Gullah community members who reside off Georgia’s coast: Young Haagar (Kaycee Moore) wants to move to the mainland away from a tradition-bound family, as Yellow Mary (Barbara-O) returns from the mainland with her female lover. Cultures and lifestyles collide in this beautifully poetic film that preaches the importance of holding on to history and traditions – no matter where you are.New Jersey Drive (1995) 62%New Jersey Drive came at the tail end of a cinematic era of hood classics –&nbsp;New Jack City (1991), Boyz n the Hood (1991), Juice (1992), Menace II Society (1993), and Above the Rim (1994) – and largely failed to make an impact. Those movies jumped back and forth between New York and California, but director Nick Gomez wanted New Jersey in on the action. With little education and few job opportunities, Newark friends&nbsp;Jason (Sharron Corley) and friend Midget (Gabriel Casseus) begin jacking cars and trading them in for cash. It’s all fun and games until Midget starts to think he’s untouchable. Now Jason and his friend find themselves on the wrong side of the law while making dangerous enemies in their neighborhood.Giving Voice (2020) 100%Produced by John Legend, with appearances from Oscar winners Denzel Washington and Viola Davis, the documentary Giving Voice highlights the lives and talents of high schoolers of color across the U.S. who’ve taken a deep interest in playwright August Wilson’s work. (Washington and Davis starred in Washington’s adaptation of Wilson’s Fences.) The students are all competing in the national August Wilson monologue competition, and not only do Wilson’s words give them the confidence to pursue their dreams of becoming actors on stage and screen, but they learn valuable lessons from his text that they can apply to their lives.Bright Road (1953) - -1954’s Carmen Jones is a landmark of Black cinema: It solidified Harry Belafonte and Dorothy Dandridge as Hollywood stars. But many don’t know that their first film together was the hopeful Bright Road, which was released a year before their classic second outing together. In the movie, Jane Richards (Dandrige) is a teacher who notices one of her students, C.T. Young (Phillip Hepburn), is more withdrawn than his classmates. Richards works closely with him to improve his grades, but they tank when his best friend dies of pneumonia; eventually C.T. comes out of his funk and begins to engage in class until summer vacation. Bright Road stands out in Belafonte and Dandrige’s filmographies for allowing the actors to display their talents without being forced to play overtly sexual, or to conform to stereotypes.Class Act (1992) 17%For some, this comedy is considered the Trading Places of the ’90s with Duncan Pinderhughes (Christopher “Kid” Reid), a dull straight-A student with no social life, and Blade Brown (Christopher “Play” Martin), the school bully, swapping permanent school records. They agree to keep things that way as Duncan gets good grades for Blade, and Blade teaches Duncan how to be cool. However, they both start to realize that their new lives aren’t what they expected. After the success of House Party and three sequels, rappers Kid (Reid) and Play ( Martin ) wanted to branch out in a different direction, and Class Act was born. It may not have received the same hype as the House Party movies – and is fairly Rotten according to critics – but it’s a hilarious movie cherished by its fans and well worth tracking down.Cabin in the Sky (1943) 81%Life, death, and redemption are the themes of the 1943 musical Cabin in the Sky. Little Joe Jackson (Eddie ‘Rochester’ Anderson) gets into a fight and dies; waking up in Purgatory, he learns he’s getting sent back to Earth to prove he belongs in Heaven, or he’s going straight to Hell. He awakens, remembering nothing, and falls back into his old ways, including treating his wife Petunia (Ethel Waters) like crap. While Joe is trying to improve, an angel known as the General (Kenneth Spencer) and the devil’s son, Lucifer Jr. (Rex Ingram), fight for his soul. It’s, well, a lot, but full of great musical numbers and performances from Duke Ellington and Lena Horne. With that level of talent on screen, it’s little wonder the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.Under the Cherry Moon (1986) 36%Prince fans and movie fans alike love the musician’s first feature, Purple Rain –&nbsp;the movie features some of the most memorable scenes of 1980s cinema and best songs from his discography. Yet no one seems to talk about Prince’s second feature film, Under the Cherry Moon. Lighter in tone and shot in black-and-white, the film follows gigolos Christopher Tracy (Prince) and his cousin, Tricky (Jerome Benton), who live on the French Riviera and thrive by swindling wealthy French women out of money. After Christopher meets the 20-year-old heiress Mary Sharon (Kristin Scott Thomas in her feature film debut), and falls in love, things get complicated.

You’d avoid if you saw him on the street, but when he’s telling off a millennial holding up the coffee line, you quietly cheer. He is also the central figure of the new Audience Network comedy Loudermilk, from director Peter Farrelly.A recovering alcoholic, Loudermilk has an impeccable reputation in his AA group for helping others get clean. The process isn’t pretty, but now Loudermilk turns his attention to Claire Wilkes (Anja Savcic), who may be his toughest case yet.Livingston spoke with Rotten Tomatoes before the premiere of Loudermilk. Here are six things you might hate, but you’ve got to love him for it.1. BEING RIGHT ONLY MAKES HIM MORE OBNOXIOUSWhat’s worse than an obnoxious loudmouth? An obnoxious loudmouth who has a point. Loudermilk is past worrying about making people happy. They found the right actor to play him because Livingston is about 20 years beyond wanting to make his characters likable.“Honestly, I learned a lot on Swingers by watching Vince [Vaughn] do his thing,” Livingston said. “He’s such a d— in that movie, in a lot of the movies he does, but that’s the guy that everybody wants to hang out with. It’s not that he’s likable. It’s that he’s confident enough that he doesn’t give a f—. He says what he thinks.”That lesson has served Livingston in a lot of roles he’s played, from Office Space to Sex and the City.“I think there’s something that people [respond to],” he continued. “It’s not like they want to like him. They want to imagine themselves being able to do that and then they like themselves, imagining they can do that. After that, I felt a lot more free about Jack Berger doesn’t have to be likable. He just has to be trying his best.”It works for acting, but in real life even Livingston still wants to be liked.“I know that feeling well and wouldn’t it be great to be free of that?” he said. “We all want to be liked but there’s something about I think we all sort of envy that guy that doesn’t give a f—.”2. HE TELLS PEOPLE WHAT OTHERS ARE AFRAID TO SAYWhen an addict is spiraling out of control, it does them no good for a friend to say, “Hang in there. You’re doing your best.” That’s enabling.“There’s all kinds of people trying to pat them on the head and say it’s going to be OK, it’s not your fault,” Livingston said. “There comes a time when sometimes people just need to be told, ‘Look, you f—ing —hole, this is what’s going down. Do you see what’s going down? This is what’s going on. You can do something about it or not but it’s not doing you a service in hiding it.’”3. HE CAN MOCK AA MEETINGS BECAUSE HE LOVES THEMLoudermilk certainly isn’t making fun of 12-step programs. These meetings provide a vital resource for people in need. Still, there’s a good-natured comedy in Loudermilk’s frustration with his own attendees.“It’s a world that we haven’t really looked at, at least in a comedy way, because it’s been sort of either a dirty little secret or a sacred cow,” Livingston said. “We’re poking fun at it, but we’re doing it lovingly. We’re doing it with love.”Even at its most comical, the AA meeting is still a support group. Any group of well-meaning people trying to help, but maybe screwing up just as much, can be dysfunctional.“It’s a community of people who are wrestling with many of the same demons and sharing war stories, mostly just being there for each other,” Livingston said. “There’s a certain brand of gallows humor. There are some great anecdotes. There’s something kind of magical about when a new person walks in and everybody knows exactly where that person is because they’ve all been there.”4. IT MAY NOT BE THE BEST MEETING, BUT IT’S THE ONE HE’S GOTCreating Loudermilk’s AA group didn’t have to mimic an actual support group too strictly. That’s because every meeting is as unique as the individuals who show up for that meeting. Loudermilk just has to make do with what he’s got.“They’re all so different but there is a common theme,” Livingston said. “They’re not only different from program to program, just from room to room and group to group, it’s a different animal. But they all have a component that ties them together which is it’s people who are in a very humbling position having to admit that something is out of their control and taking over their life. And yet, not only coming together to try to change that in themselves but to try to be of support to other people.”5. LOUDERMILK HAS HIT BOTTOM SO THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENTIn AA, rock bottom is the lowest point where an addict decides it’s time to change. Sometimes it can be catastrophic but not always. It was pretty damaging for Loudermilk. So just imagine how much worse he was before then.“I think his bottom was when he got in a car accident with his wife,” Livingston said. “I think that’s the thing that haunts him, and I don’t even think that’s when he turned around. I think it probably took him another year or so after that to turn around. This is all actor bullsh– backstory. Maybe it’ll come out in season 2. If there’s a ghost that’s haunting him, that’s the one that he still has to work with.”That’s not the end of the story of Loudermilk’s wife. Look for her to factor into later episodes of the series.“I think in his head that something changed in that moment,” Livingston said. “It factors back in later in the season, so I don’t want to spoil it too much. I think in many ways, he’s more torn up about that accident than his ex-wife is. She’s put it behind her.”6. LOUDERMILK GIVES LIVINGSTON A HEALTHY OUTLETThis is a bit of a more healthy obsession than substance addiction since he can use it to better his work. Livingston admitted to obsessing over character details, and Loudermilk lets him go wild.“You’re trying to crack the character and do all this work of what would he do, what would you do?” Livingston said. “Ultimately, you don’t have any idea. You really only know what you think you would do. To get all that, not only in your head but sort of in the body so that it’s happening without thinking about it, it just never ends. How would he pick up the bottle? How would he open the car door? There’s something about that process.”Livingston hopes Loudermilk doesn’t pick up any bottles, but the car door applies. “I think probably his favorite way is to reach inside and open it from the inside,” Livingston said. “The car door’s broken, and he’s too lazy to fix it.”No matter how much prep he puts into it, Livingston ultimately has to just stop and do the scene.“Now the beauty of it is, there’s something about being an actor, having a deadline,” he said. “They turn the camera on and then after a little bit they turn the camera off. That’s it. That’s all you got. You’ve got that much time to do it, you hope it’s good.”Loudermilk premieres October 17 at 10:30 p.m. on Audience Network.&nbsp;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"to, hard, TV, It, El","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"ron-livingston-shares-6-reasons-youll-love-to-hate-loudermilk"},{"id":"47614042927955","title":"\"Pirates 4\" — Hold the Gore (Verbinski)?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Pirates 4\" -- Hold the Gore (Verbinski)?by Scott Weinberg | May 8, 2007 |  CommentsIt might not come as a shock to hear that director Gore Verbinski probably wants to take a break from the \"Pirates\" some time soon. Word is he might be collaborating with \"Bloom County\" creator Berkeley Breathed on a CGI flick.One source indicates that Disney is almost assuredly going forward with \"Pirates 4,\" but the man usually at the helm might be off adapting Mr. Breathed’s \"Flawed Dogs: The Year End Leftovers at the Piddleton \"Last Chance\" Dog Pound\" for Disney. This one would be a CGI sort of feature.Further word states that BB’s \"Mars Needs Moms\" will also be made into a movie — only this one might be directed by Robert Zemeckis!Hmm, I need to pick some of these books up, I think. I still think \"Bloom County\" was the funniest comic strip ever created. (Well, and \"The Far Side.\" Oh, and \"Calvin and Hobbes,\" obviously.)But the big question is … who’ll they get to direct \"Pirates 4\"? Disney should get someone who still needs to make a good pirate movie, like Renny Harlin or Roman Polanski. (They directed \"Cutthroat Island\" and \"Pirates,\" respectively, and there’s a double feature that’ll give you a fresh respect for the \"POTC\" series.)Source: Jim Hill Media","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"drama, TV, of, Starz, Prime, razzies, 2017, Movies, boxing","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"pirates-4-hold-the-gore-verbinski"},{"id":"47614033004366","title":"Helena Bonham Carter Joins Tim Burton’s New Project","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Helena Bonham Carter Joins Tim Burton's New Projectby Scott Weinberg | October 19, 2006 |  CommentsIt’s a piece of casting news that’ll please many, but shock no one: Helena Bonham Carter has been cast opposite Johnny Depp in Tim Burton‘s movie version of \"Sweeney Todd.\" Needless to say, this trio has collaborated on numerous occasions, with generally excellent results each time out.From IGN FilmForce and Variety: \"Depp will play the title role, the demon barber of Fleet Street, while Bonham Carter — per a Variety scoop — portrays Mrs. Lovett, a killer who hands out delicious meat pies made from the remains of her victims.

Anderson Has Been Crushing It for 25 Years","content":"Hear Us Outvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hear Us Out: Paul W.S. Anderson Has Been Crushing It for 25 YearsThe frequently dismissed writer-director broke out with Mortal Kombat in 1995, and he's been crafting box office hits for a global audience ever since.by Mark Hofmeyer | August 18, 2020 |  CommentsIn 1995, Paul W.S. Anderson introduced himself to the world with&nbsp;Mortal Kombat, an action flick about three fighters preventing the apocalypse by entering a magical martial arts tournament. The film came on the heels of the&nbsp;30-year-old director/movie lover’s debut film&nbsp;Shopping&nbsp;(also the feature debut of&nbsp;Jude Law), and his fresh style, his ability to stretch a budget, and his love for the&nbsp;Mortal Kombat video game helped secure his spot in the director’s chair.&nbsp;It was a&nbsp;high-profile gig that many directors had turned down, as the stench of Super Mario Bros. and Double Dragon still filled the air in Hollywood.Instead of being scared away, Anderson plugged his nose and jumped headlong into the $20 million-budgeted production, adapting a video game beloved for its&nbsp;bloody, graphic violence into a PG-13 family-friendly movie. Guided by longtime producer Larry Kassanoff and fueled by geeky enthusiasm, Anderson hired a diverse cast and crew of excellent martial artists who understood the film’s cheeky tone and focused on giving Mortal Kombat fans what they wanted — lots of fights.When it was released during the waning days of summer on August 18th, it pulled off a nearly flawless victory,&nbsp;overcoming the 1990s video game adaptation curse — commercially, at least — and claiming the number one spot at the U.S. box office with an impressive $22 million opening weekend. Critics were split&nbsp;at 47% on the Tomatometer, but audiences loved the electronic soundtrack, creative fight scenes, and diverse cast of committed actors who sacrificed multiple bruised ribs to&nbsp;bless us with some excellent brawls. The film remained number one at the box office for three weekends and finished with a stellar $122 million worldwide haul.To celebrate Mortal Kombat’s 25th anniversary, we look back and break down five reasons why it serves as the perfect exemplar of Paul W.S. Anderson’s career.HE&nbsp;WORKS WITH DIVERSE, INCLUSIVE CASTS(Photo by R.E. Aaron/©New Line Cinema)Assessments of Anderson’s career are full of backhanded compliments and hyperbolic criticisms, and they never bother to&nbsp;discuss his 25-year history of casting diverse groups of actors and his willingness to think outside the box. It feels strange to compliment someone for doing what’s right, but in 2020, it’s still rare to see such inclusive casts. It took the beloved Marvel Cinematic Universe a full decade to unleash Black Panther&nbsp;and&nbsp;Captain Marvel while they&nbsp;built their brand with Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, and Doctor Strange. Compare that to Anderson, who, in 1995, dared to cast&nbsp;Robin Shou&nbsp;as the savior of the world in Mortal Kombat&nbsp;and, in 1997’s Event Horizon, gave Laurence Fishburne some all-timer dialogue (“We’re leaving”) as the captain who fights back against a spaceship from&nbsp;hell.In 2005, AVP – Alien vs. Predator saw Sanaa Lathan become an honorary Yautja hunter, or Predator, after she kills a Xenomorph and helps rid the world of a justifiably pissed off Alien Queen.&nbsp;In fact, before Jordan Peele’s&nbsp;Us&nbsp;opened with $70 million dollars, it was&nbsp;AVP&nbsp;that held the record for the&nbsp;highest opening weekend&nbsp;for a movie led by a black woman. That’s an impressive&nbsp;accomplishment, and when talking about her character Alexa Woods,&nbsp;Lathan said,&nbsp;“In 1979,&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;came out and Sigourney (Weaver) was in it with a bunch of guys, and nobody at that time expected the woman to be the hero, so that was a tradition that&nbsp;Alien&nbsp;started. When Paul did this, I think he had it in mind, and he auditioned all races, to set this apart and yet still carry on that tradition, which is great, because it’s a woman and you would never expect a black woman to be the hero.”(Photo by Coco Van Oppens/©Screen Gems, Paramount Pictures, ©New Line Cinema)Of course, Anderson is most famous for his collaborations with Milla Jovovich, who he helped solidify into an action icon. The two first teamed up for the 2002 sleeper hit Resident Evil, which led to an 18-year collaboration (and an ongoing 11-year marriage)&nbsp;that saw the six Resident Evil movies collectively grossing over $1 billion worldwide. If you’ve listened to the Blu-ray commentaries and read various interviews, it’s clear Jovovich and Anderson have worked closely during their collaborations, and their teamwork has created some all-time movie moments (yeah, we said it). In an interview with Thrillist, Anderson said he had to fight to cast Jovovich over a male star because she was “a strong female lead back in the day when that was absolutely not acceptable in mainstream Hollywood movies.” Within the Resident Evil franchise, Alice has saved the world, wiped out gigantic creatures, and joined forces with Ali Larter, Oded Fehr, Li Bingbing, Colin Salmon, Michelle Rodriguez, and Boris Kodjoe.Anderson’s adherence to female-fronted action franchises and diverse casting are evident again in his upcoming 2021 film Monster Hunter, another video game adaptation that features Jovovich and international action superstar Tony Jaa.&nbsp;As a fan of Ong-Bak and Triple Threat, it’s thrilling to see Jaa on the poster of a major international release.Listen, it’s a shame that a director hiring a diverse cast is rare enough that we applaud it when it happens, but one look at the history of Hollywood reveals why Paul W.S. Anderson stands out in that respect.HE KNOWS HOW TO STAGE UNIQUE FIGHT SCENESDo yourself a favor and rewatch the nearly 10-minute final fight between Liu Kang (Robin Shou) and Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). It showcases the actor’s martial arts skills, and the scene isn’t edited into oblivion as they trade up to 12 strikes before a cut. Shou helped choreograph the fight, and he worked with stunt icons Pat E. Johnson (The Karate Kid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), J.J. Perry (Warrior, Captain America: Civil War, Haywire), and Jeff Imada (They Live, The Bourne Ultimatum) to create some iconic battles throughout the film.It’s clear that Anderson learned a lot on the set of Mortal Kombat, as he and his various production designers over the years have built sets around the fight choreography to make them unique. In AVP, Soldier, Resident Evil: Afterlife, and The Three Musketeers, the fight scenes blend seamlessly into the surrounding environments in fantastic action set-pieces. Watch this corridor fight in Resident Evil: Retribution&nbsp;and you’ll see Anderson, Jovovich, and the stunt crew in perfect sync as they execute an expertly staged brawl that looks beautiful in 3D.(Photo by Rafy/©Screen Gems courtesy Everett Collection)Another&nbsp;highlight occurs in Resident Evil: Afterlife. The bathroom fight between Alice (Jovovich), Claire Redfield (Larter), and the executioner, a&nbsp;hulking monstrosity who loves body piercings and wields a massive axe, is an ambitious spectacle. Shot with a Phantom Camera and James Cameron’s Avatar 3D rig, the battle makes the most of its setting, as it&nbsp;erupts into a shower of exploding porcelain, tile, and broken pipes. Does it rely a little heavily on the slow-mo? Sure, but setup is simple, the action is economical, the result is satisfying, and we even get a wall flip and a superhero landing. Part of what makes it work is that Larter and Jovovich did most of their stunts, which only adds an extra layer of badassery.When Anderson doesn’t have the luxury of a Robin Shou, Jason Statham, or Milla Jovovich to bust heads, he has no problem getting creative. While filming Mortal Kombat, Anderson was fully aware that Goro, the four-armed&nbsp;behemoth from the video games, could barely move, as the beautiful looking 10-foot tall animatronic created by the legendary Tom Woodruff Jr. (who worked with Anderson again in AVP) was basically a glorified lawn ornament. Knowing&nbsp;the fight scene would be cumbersome and&nbsp;ineffective if played seriously, he had Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) hit Goro with a low blow (the close-up of his bulging eyes is admittedly cheesy), kick him into a pit, and throw in an Easter Egg for fun. When life hands you a beautiful animatronic lemon, have some fun with it and make some fan-service lemonade.HE MAKES EFFICIENT USE OF SMART PRODUCTION DESIGN AND PRACTICAL EFFECTS(Photo by ©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)In 1995, Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that, “as impressive as the special effects are at every turn, even more crucial is Jonathan Carlson’s superb, imaginative production design, which combines Thailand exteriors with vast sets that recall the barbaric grandeur of exotic old movie palaces and campy Maria Montez epics.” Very early on in Anderson’s career, he realized that inspired production design and practical effects could make movies look much more expensive than their budgets. In his relatively lower-budget films like&nbsp;Mortal Kombat ($20 million), Resident Evil ($32 million), and Death Race ($45 million), it helped to utilize exotic exterior shots and settings to help limit the number of extras, locations, and set builds.There’s a moment in the 2008 film Death Race&nbsp;when a massive big rig called The Dreadnought smashes into a spiked barricade and explodes. In an interview with Grantland, Anderson explained, “We crashed that truck for real, and it was an awesome thing to shoot, because it’s 10 tons of steel flying, traveling really fast, hitting a dead stop, and flying through the air.” It’s one of the best examples of Anderson making the most of his budget. He and producer Jeremy Bolt realized early on that their $45 million budget wouldn’t allow them to shoot around the world, so they settled on industrial areas in Montreal to stand in for the film’s island, where the prison races take place. With the money they saved, production designer Paul Austerberry (who also worked with Anderson on&nbsp;The Three Musketeers and&nbsp;Pompeii and would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Guillermo del Toro’s&nbsp;The Shape of Water) and stunt coordinator Andy Gill (Bad Boys II,&nbsp;Pearl Harbor) focused on procuring real cars, generating real explosions and, of course, obliterating an 18-wheel Dreadnought. Anderson was also able to bring in some&nbsp;A-list talent,&nbsp;like Tyrese Gibson, Ian McShane, and three-time Academy Award nominee Joan Allen, who classed up the production.Anderson’s most beautiful creation comes&nbsp;in the 1997 horror spectacle Event Horizon. The “haunted house in space”-themed film focuses on a search and rescue team&nbsp;who&nbsp;fall prey&nbsp;to a ship that has returned from a Hell-like dimension with a malevolent spirit on board. The massive gravity drive at the ship’s core&nbsp;was built by production designer Joseph Bennett on the cavernous James Bond stage in England’s Pinewood Studios, and&nbsp;it actually worked (the part that spun on cue, that is;&nbsp;not the part that&nbsp;opened a wormhole to Hell). Emboldened by a gigantic $60 million budget, Anderson cherry-picked elements from the best of the genre, peppering in visual references to&nbsp;films like&nbsp;Solaris, Alien, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.The film is arguably most famous for its images of torture and depravity, which Anderson conceived after researching the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch and Pieter Bruegal. But&nbsp;he understood the importance of showing only just enough, and the few frames of mayhem we do get in the film have inspired a sort of&nbsp;cult fascination among horror hounds.&nbsp;These scenes feature grotesque, Clive Barker-inspired practical makeup; hit pause at the right moment, and you’ll see the gnarly, bloody gags the special effects department clearly spent a lot of time to create. The film’s&nbsp;practical effects and massive sets still hold up to this day, and it’s one of the reasons we agree when Laurence Fishburne’s Captain Miller says, “I will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance, and then I will launch TAC missiles at the Event Horizon until I’m satisfied she’s vaporized. F— this ship!”HIS FILMS ARE LARGELY “CRITIC-PROOF”(Photo by R.E. Aaron/©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)The 47% Tomatometer score for Mortal Kombat is the highest of Anderson’s 11 theatrically released films since 1995; none of his movies even&nbsp;comes close to Fresh. Writers frequently offer only the faintest of praise for his body of work, and begrudgingly at that,&nbsp;as they use terms like “unusual genius” or&nbsp;say that&nbsp;“there are a few, ahem, gems lying around his filmography.” Nobody seems willing to admit that the laser scene in Resident Evil is meant to be funny, or that “Grid” the Xenomorph from Alien vs. Predator might be the deadliest alien in the franchise. The narrative has been set since 1995, and the reviews now write themselves, despite the fact the critics might have failed Anderson, at least according to some.But even though the average Tomatometer score for his 11 theatrically released movies is a super Rotten 27%, there are still plenty of Fresh moments in his filmography. Even his lowest-rated film, the curious Blade Runner-sidequel&nbsp;Soldier&nbsp;(12% on the Tomatometer), features a jacked-up Kurt Russell battling Jason Scott Lee in a thrilling final fight that’s so intense you almost feel the exhaustion by the end of it. Anderson also isn’t without his defenders;&nbsp;James Cameron&nbsp;loves Resident Evil,&nbsp;Quentin Tarantino&nbsp;included The Three Musketeers on his Best of 2011 list,&nbsp;and prolific film critic Ignatiy Vishnevetsky considers Anderson to be the “world’s least pretentious auteur who makes lively, unpretentious mid-budget genre movies fixated on video-gamey ‘cool’ and distinguished by their leanness and their inventive — and sometimes even poetic — use of space.”The success of Mortal Kombat wasn’t a fluke because Anderson and his talented crew knew what they were making, and they made it earnestly. Ashby, who contributed to the script in addition to playing Johnny Cage, said, “We didn’t write Hamlet or anything, but we had fun with it.” That playfulness is all over the movie, and it’s&nbsp;still refreshing today.INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCES LOVE HIS MOVIES(Photo by R.E. Aaron/©New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)In 1995, Mortal Kombat brought in $122 million at the worldwide box office. Most importantly, it made $51 million (42%) of&nbsp;that sum overseas. The $71 million domestic haul was impressive for the scrappy video game adaptation, but the 100+ million distinction is what gave it major credibility. This trend of solid global returns has become a staple for Anderson, who has realized for a long time that focusing on worldwide returns and thinking globally will keep him working&nbsp;well into the future.In 2017, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter “rocked” China with a $93.4 million debut, which is remarkable considering&nbsp;China&nbsp;doesn’t allow “ghosts&nbsp;and the supernatural” to be shown on screen (with some&nbsp;exceptions). After its worldwide theatrical run had ended, box office receipts showed that it made 91% of its money overseas, with $285 million of its $312 million worldwide haul made outside the United States. This topped the 82% of Resident Evil: Retribution&nbsp;and the 80% of Resident Evil: Afterlife, which also set records internationally. In other words, the&nbsp;Resident Evil&nbsp;movies were global event films; in Japan, The Final Chapter&nbsp;made almost as much money as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which was released just a week earlier. Closer to home, 2014’s&nbsp;Pompeii managed to become the highest-grossing Canadian production of the year, despite less than explosive&nbsp;box office returns here in the U.S., and it became the fourth film directed by Anderson to win the Golden Screen Award.Paul W.S.

Anderson has been thrilling audiences around the world for 25 years, and it all began with a silly, action-packed video game adaptation that blossomed into a nostalgic fan favorite. Since then, Anderson has consistently worked with diverse casts and talented craftsmen on limited budgets to produce eye-popping, undemanding entertainment, and his filmography is littered with sleeper cult classics like&nbsp;Event Horizon,&nbsp;Alien vs. Predator, the&nbsp;Resident Evil franchise, and yes,&nbsp;Mortal Kombat.&nbsp;In most interviews, he seems comfortable with his career, and he should be; he knows what his fans want, and he delivers, even if he’s not a critical darling. It may not be a flawless victory, but for a lot of folks, it’s good enough.Mortal Kombat&nbsp;was released on August 18, 1995.#1Mortal Kombat (1995) 44%#1Adjusted Score: 46.254% Critics Consensus: Despite an effective otherwordly atmosphere and appropriately cheesy visuals, Mortal Kombat suffers from its poorly constructed plot, laughable dialogue, and subpar acting.Synopsis: Three reluctant fighters are drafted for an intergalactic martial-arts tournament that will determine the fate of the human race in...

Get your minds out of the gutter.by Jeff Giles | January 22, 2008 |  CommentsHis Pinkville may have been spiked by United Artists, but Oliver Stone isn’t wasting time moving on to his next project — one that his detractors will be happy to learn has the potential to be every bit as polarizing has they’d expect.The film in question, titled simply Bush, will star Josh Brolin as George W. Bush. According to Variety, the script — penned by Stone’s Wall Street co-writer Stanley Weiser — will focus on Bush’s “life and presidency.” Of course, as Variety points out, Stone’s low opinion of Bush’s foreign policy is well documented — but the director says that will have no bearing on his film:“It’s a behind-the-scenes approach, similar to ‘Nixon,’ to give a sense of what it’s like to be in his skin. But if ‘Nixon’ was a symphony, this is more like a chamber piece, and not as dark in tone. People have turned my political ideas into a cliche, but that is superficial. I’m a dramatist who is interested in people, and I have empathy for Bush as a human being, much the same as I did for Castro, Nixon, Jim Morrison, Jim Garrison and Alexander the Great.“How did Bush go from an alcoholic bum to the most powerful figure in the world? It’s like Frank Capra territory on one hand, but I’ll also cover the demons in his private life, his bouts with his dad and his conversion to Christianity, which explains a lot of where he is coming from. It includes his belief that God personally chose him to be president of the United States, and his coming into his own with the stunning, preemptive attack on Iraq. It will contain surprises for Bush supporters and his detractors.”Brolin, currently riding a post-No Country for Old Men hot streak that has him currently filming the role of Harvey Milk’s assassin in Gus Van Sant‘s Milk, “won’t make a formal deal until financing is sealed,” but barring any last-minute setbacks, he’ll be ready for Bush‘s April start — despite Stone’s contention that his star is “actually better-looking than Bush.” Sharpen those pens, right-wing pundits!Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, tv, boxing, Emmy, TCA, Society, video, Music, lord","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"oliver-stone-josh-brolin-prepare-to-film-bush"},{"id":"47614060043101","title":"Forget \"Dukes of Hazzard 2\" — Is \"Super Troopers 2\" On Tap for Broken Lizard?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Forget \"Dukes of Hazzard 2\" -- Is \"Super Troopers 2\" On Tap for Broken Lizard?by Jen Yamato | August 14, 2006 |  CommentsEven though last year’s \"Dukes of Hazzard\" raked in a respectable $80 million at the box office, don’t look for another go from the Broken Lizard crew. \"Dukes\" director Jay Chandrasekhar and fellow Lizard Kevin Heffernan told RT they’re over it, and after this month’s \"Beerfest\" they plan on turning their attention to more Broken Lizard projects, including \"The Greek Road,\" \"The Babymaker,\" and … \"Super Troopers 2!\"A direct-to-video \"Dukes of Hazzard\" prequel is already being filmed without the involvement of the Broken Lizard guys, but they seem ok with that. \"Beerfest\" kicks off the first release from Warner Bros. in a three-year deal, and they’ve got a few more crazy scripts up their sleeves.This month, the Broken Lizards compete in every drinking game known to man in \"Beerfest\"\"The Greek Road\"One such project is a completed script called \"The Greek Road,\" which the Lizards (Heffernan, Chandrasekhar, and fellow members Steve Lemme, Paul Soter, and Erik Stolhanske) have finished co-writing. They are in talks with Warner Bros. to secure funding for the period pic, which is set in ancient Greece and would require a larger-than-normal budget for a Broken Lizard movie.And what is the plot for this next pic? Heffernan explains, \"The movie we really want to do next is called The Greek Road. It’s set in ancient Greece, it’s a comedy. The general idea is that I play a fellow by the name of Plato — he is a freshman wrestling recruit at Athens University, and he’s failing his freshmen seminar, Basic Thought.\"\"So they bring in this hotshot senior to tutor him. His name is…Socrates. So Socrates tutors him and they end up road tripping to the Olympics to wrestle. And then the gods try to stop them. It’s a period piece. Steve is Socrates, and then Eric, Paul and Jay play Zeus, Poseidon and Hades who are trying to stop us from getting to the Olympics.\"Chandrasekhar says \"The Greek Road\" will likely start filming in spring 2007; but first, he’d like to squeeze in another Broken Lizard production this fall:\"The Babymaker\"\"I want to make a movie with Kevin called \"The Babymaker,\" said Chandrasekhar. \"He plays a former high school football star who’s married and he and his wife want to have a kid, and they try for a year and they just can’t have a kid. Sothey go to a doctor and the doctor says, \"Your sperm is no good,\" and he goes, \"Nah, trust me dude, the sperm’s good.\" And [the doctor] says, \"It’s no good, I’m telling you it’s no good,\" and he goes, \"IT’S GOOD.\"And so he eventually tells his wife that five years ago he donated 20 batches of sperm to a sperm bank, and they don’t take it unless it’s good. He did it because he needed a little extra money for his wife’s ring. And she’s furious; \"You have other kids out there, you bought my ring with beat off money!\" So he goes back to the sperm bank and says, I need my sperm back…And they say, well we only have one batch and we promised it to somebody. So then he goes and puts together a little team of his friends, and they go and try to do a sperm bank heist.\"\"Super Troopers 2\"But what of a sequel to the beloved cult hit, \"Super Troopers?\" Though fans have long been screaming for a sequel, reprising their Vermont State trooper characters is not on the immediate horizon for the five-some. However, they are considering the sequel in the future and have settled on a loose story — it would be called \"Super Troopers ’76,\" and it will be a prequel in which they play the equally inept fathers of their \"Super Troopers\" characters.\"The joke is that we’ll make it Super Troopers ’76, set during the bicentennial,\" Chandrasekhar told RT. \"We’ll have a little shaggier hair and mustaches…we might do it, I don’t know. That movie has sort of a special place in a lot of people’s hearts, so all we can do is f*ck it up…So I don’t know…I’ve been writing some little gags and I have a little file of \"Super Troopers 2\" gags, and we’ll see if we turn that into a flick or not.\"In the meantime, Broken Lizard’s \"Beerfest\" sloshes into theaters August 25.

Read on for details:Birdman 91%Unless you’ve been completely oblivious to all of the awards season buzz, you’re probably already well familiar with Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman. Featuring a powerhouse performance from Michael Keaton, the film centers on a washed-up actor named Riggan Thomson (Keaton) who, eager to reestablish himself, is on the verge of making his Broadway debut. But his past continues to haunt Riggan, and he may be slowly losing his grip on reality. Certified Fresh at 92 percent, Birdman has already won numerous awards, and it’s currently nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor, among others.The Theory of Everything 80%Another film that caused quite a stir this past year was James Marsh’s The Theory of Everything, which features another remarkable lead performance. Eddie Redmayne plays famed theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, beginning with his early days at Cambridge — where he meets his first wife Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) and is diagnosed with ALS. The film depicts Hawking’s relationship with Wilde, as well as the progression of his condition through the years, and both Redmayne and Jones earned Oscar nominations for their superb work. Certified Fresh at 79 percent on the Tomatometer, The Theory of Everything does hit some familiar biopic notes, but the film’s subject is such a fascinating man — and its performers are so good — that it succeeds pleasantly.The Interview 51%Maybe you weren’t paying much attention to all the awards gossip, but you probably at least caught something about Sony being hacked late last year allegedly by the North Koreans? The impetus for the digital invasion — so the story goes — was this comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, in which a talk show personality who’s been invited to North Korea to interview Kim Jong Un is approached by the CIA and asked to assassinate him. Apparently, North Korea didn’t take it so well, but according to about half the critics, there wasn’t much worth talking about anyway. At 53 percent on the Tomatometer, The Interview isn’t the strongest collaboration between Franco and Rogen, and it’ll probably be remembered more for the controversy that accompanied it.Games of Thrones: Season FourIt’s unlikely you’ll be interested in picking up season four of Game of Thrones if you’re not already a fan, and if you’re picking up season four, it’s also unlikely you haven’t already seen all of it.

First Man, the new Ryan Gosling drama that chronicles everything that went into Armstrong’s “one step,” is just the latest in a long line of movies about getting to the moon, and not getting to the moon, and what happens when we’re there. As lunar missions evolved from pure fantasy to a high-stakes space race, and eventually to historical events, so too did movies change.“When I was young, I watched many movies about aviation and space,” astronaut Alfred Worden recalls. “I was fortunate that my father worked in a theater.” Worden, who was the command module pilot for the Apollo 15 mission and worked as a consultant on First Man, notes that space movies have gotten much more “sophisticated” since his childhood days, especially when it comes to accuracy. “I think the relationship between science fiction and science fact is always interchangeable,” adds Bert Ulrich, NASA’s multimedia liaison for film and television collaborations. “Both influence each other.”Here&nbsp;are 10 films that track how&nbsp;filmmakers have viewed the moon, and how they predicted or reacted to real trips to Earth’s nearest neighbor.Le Voyage dans la lune (A Trip to the Moon) (1902)  100%French filmmaking pioneer Georges Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon is generally considered to be the first sci-fi movie. Loosely inspired by Jules Verne, the silent movie boasts vivid special effects and a complex plot for something made more than 100 years ago. It’s incredibly fanciful — the protagonists crash into the man in the moon’s eye when they first arrive and meet aliens known as “Selenites.” Especially when filmmaking was still in its infancy, audiences probably had no idea what was in store for the moon, both on screen and in real life.&nbsp;Frau im Mond (By Rocket to the Moon) (Woman in the Moon) (1929)  75%It only took a couple of decades for things to get a little more serious. Fritz Lang, the German director behind the seminal silent film Metropolis, offered an incredibly prescient depiction of space travel, in part because this was the first film to employ a scientific advisor, rocket scientist Hermann von Oberth. The rocket in the movie launched vertically, had multiple stages, and was so believable that the Nazis actually banned the movie in Germany during World War II because&nbsp;the technology it featured was so similar to their top secret V-2 rockets.Destination Moon (1950)  64%The space race didn’t begin in earnest until 1957, but Destination Moon, which won an Academy Award for its special effects, was ahead of the game. There are no aliens and really not much interpersonal drama; it’s just four men on a dangerous mission. It didn’t just predate the Apollo program, though. Destination Moon is also about the privatization of the space race, many decades before Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin came onto the scene.From the Earth to the Moon (1958)  38%With the space race underway, audiences were especially interested in space movies, and Hollywood was eager to provide. Despite being made when many movies were trying to mimic or leapfrog past real-world innovations,&nbsp;From the Earth to the Moon is based on Jules Verne’s 1865 novel of the same name. While that book was amazingly prescient for its age, the movie, which is set shortly after the Civil War, can’t help but feel like it’s straddling a time when trips to the moon were fantasy, and a near future where they would become fact.Countdown (1968)  67%Countdown, which was made with NASA’s cooperation, is about a last-ditch attempt to beat the Soviets to the moon. Even with that high-stakes race at its core, many reviewers found&nbsp;the movie to be rather dull, perhaps&nbsp;because it&nbsp;focuses so much on the more bureaucratic, less glamorous aspects of space travel.Marooned (1969)  86%Marooned came out four months too late to “predict” Apollo 11, as the historic mission had already happened. What the movie did do, however, is predict the events of Apollo 13, as the plot focused on NASA trying to figure out how to keep three stranded astronauts alive after something goes wrong with their Apollo spacecraft. It was also quite faithful to the real space technology of the time. “Marooned was the first space movie that I would consider close to reality,” Worden says. “The spacecraft interior was the focus, and as I remember, fairly well detailed for authenticity.”The Right Stuff (1983)  96%Once trips to the moon were officially no longer science fiction, Hollywood was able to turn these incredible true stories into historical dramas, which it did with the&nbsp;The Right Stuff, the tale of the first seven astronauts and the birth of Project Mercury. According to Ulrich, both genres of space movie are hugely important. “In the case of historical dramas, it’s reliving events; in the case of fiction, it makes people imagine,” he says. Worden says he prefers true stories to fiction, though he notes that The Right Stuff “took great liberties with [the book it was based on] and changed it into something that was part comedy and part reality.” Both he and Ulrich say that the film helped generate interest in the space program, regardless.Apollo 13 (1995)  96%The dramatization of NASA’s near-disaster is such an amazing true story that director Ron Howard says some viewers in a test screening thought it was “unrealistic.” In Worden’s view, historical dramas like this and First Man are much more meaningful than fictional movies because “they tell the real story of success growing out of failure. Something everyone can relate to in a very interesting and profound way.”&nbsp;Apollo 13 also overcame one hurdle that all post-Apollo 11 movies have to deal with: A much higher bar on special effects, since we’ve all seen footage of the real moon missions. The Apollo 13 actors needed to take 612 trips in what’s known as a “vomit comet” in order to achieve 25 seconds of weightlessness at a time. “The weightless motions were excellent,” Worden says, and he would know.Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)  35%Even though moon movies generally trended in a more realistic direction, and more imaginative sci-fi fare took place beyond the moon’s orbit, Hollywood still finds ways to “spice up” what really happened. The found-footage horror film Apollo 18 is one example, as is the third Transformers&nbsp;movie, which featured a scene&nbsp;in which Buzz Aldrin, playing himself, saluted Optimus Prime. According to Dark of the Moon, the Apollo missions were just a cover story. “For something like Transformers, we’re going to give a little more leeway,” Ulrich says of NASA’s involvement.First Man (2018)  87%In some ways, First Man seems like the end of an era, as it’s positioning itself as the definitive movie about the definitive moon mission. But, it’s not all nostalgia. SpaceX wants to go to Mars, and NASA is readying its new Space Launch System for a return to the moon. “Interest in lunar exploration is really starting up again,” Ulrich says. “I think that it’s a little bit of a back to the future. It reflects the past with the Apollo missions, but now you’re looking back to the future of going to the moon.”First Man&nbsp;is in theaters Friday, October 12","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"winner, History, Comics, Trailer, RT21, Biopics, HBO","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-moon-in-the-movies"},{"id":"47614106379118","title":"Who’s Ready for \"Stargate 2\" (and Maybe \"Stargate 3\")?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Who's Ready for \"Stargate 2\" (and Maybe \"Stargate 3\")?by Scott Weinberg | July 21, 2006 |  CommentsRoland Emmerich and Dean Devlin don’t seem to work together anymore, but now that MGM is apparently interested in re-starting the \"Stargate\" movie franchise, the old partners might just be back in business.

In November, he reunited with his frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese for Casino, a companion piece of sorts to their 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas. Just a few weeks later, he shared the screen with fellow acting titan Al Pacino for the first time in Heat, Michael Mann’s cops-and-robbers epic.Yet at the time, this one-two punch wasn’t necessarily regarded as a triumph. Sky-high expectations for a de facto Goodfellas follow-up and a Pacino/De Niro team-up meant that both movies garnered a lot of reviews that were more respectable than ecstatic, and months later these two awards hopefuls received a grand total of one Oscar nomination between them — for Sharon Stone’s career-best performance in Casino.Criticisms leveled at both movies at the time zeroed in on the crime-picture familiarity that now makes&nbsp;them feel like classics. Some came down especially hard on the idea that Pacino, Pesci, and particularly De Niro were repeating themselves. De Niro had&nbsp;delivered gentler, change-of-pace performances not&nbsp;much earlier&nbsp;in movies like 1990’s&nbsp;Awakenings and 1993’s&nbsp;Mad Dog and Glory, and the close proximity of Heat to Casino wound up calling attention to his characters’ similarities across the two films: Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described him as “a scowling cipher, a forbidding synthesis of dictator and monk,” then a few weeks later noted that in Heat, “as in Casino, he’s playing an ice-minded humanoid.”It’s true that both movies find De Niro acting in a chillier register than his work in, say, Taxi Driver or The Godfather Part II (to say nothing of the genuinely sweet Mad Dog and Glory). Sam “Ace” Rothstein, the mob-affiliated casino boss he plays in the Scorsese picture, and Neil McCauley, the career criminal he plays in Heat, do their respective jobs with ruthless professionalism. McCauley offers the spiel that lends Heat its title, explaining that anyone serious about the heist&nbsp;business needs to be able to drop all attachments “in&nbsp;30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.” Ace, in the meantime, is the kind of exacting control freak who demands one of his buffet chefs put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin. If Neil and Ace are less immediately magnetic than even some of De Niro’s more villainous characters — the scene in Heat where he must rebuff the vaguely inexplicable interests of Amy Brenneman is one of cinema’s least romantic meet-cutes — the tension in both movies comes when the De Niro character’s detachment is challenged.That’s visible in the famous Heat diner scene, the mid-movie sit-down when McCauley meets with cop Vincent Hanna (Pacino) over coffee. As the conversation continues, Mann catches more of each actor’s reactions, cutting to them when they’re listening, not just when they’re speaking. So much of the scene’s drama happens in the actors’ eyes, as De Niro portrays McCauley, briefly freed from the responsibilities of organizing a major heist, making thoughtful considerations as he answers Hanna’s questions about his motivations. The scene probably wouldn’t be as effective without De Niro’s unforgiving exterior, and it certainly wouldn’t be as chills-inducing with other actors.In Casino, the steely enforcer lets his guard down in an early scene where he proposes marriage to Ginger (Sharon Stone), negotiating and equivocating about how their “mutual respect” can lay the groundwork for a good partnership, even though she doesn’t love him, and says so upfront. It’s more subtle than either pleading or outright strong-arming and, as such, both heartbreaking and a little pathetic.(Photo by ©Universal courtesy Everett Collection)It’s no shock that De Niro is actually great in both of his 1995 movies, though it is a little surprising that even after their reputations grew, he still managed to be underestimated. The images Casino and Heat projected of the actor as a serious, driven professional were especially appropriate for that stage of his career — a stage that these two movies helped bring to a close. His filmography is too long and varied to categorize every performance, but Heat and Casino are arguably his last two big-ticket leading-man parts in the crime genre that made him famous. Over the next few years, he would do a lot of character and supporting parts (Sleepers,&nbsp;Cop Land,&nbsp;Jackie Brown,&nbsp;Great Expectations) and some self-conscious riffs on his past roles (The Fan&nbsp;revisits both Taxi Driver and Cape Fear; Analyze This parodies his mafia parts; Meet the Parents depends on his tough-guy image). Later, he would do more comedies, often about aging and/or families, sometimes to great effect (Silver Linings Playbook; The Intern), sometimes less so (The Big Wedding; The Family).Many of these later-period movies are about bringing De Niro back down to earth, even when they’re not directly kidding his on-screen history (and a lot of them do, beyond even his two comedy franchises). Sometimes this can be read as undermining his legacy, sticking him in unserious paycheck-friendly gigs like Dirty Grandpa or Grudge Match&nbsp;when he “should” be doing more projects with titans like Scorsese, who took a 24-year break from casting De Niro after Casino, or big-name auteurs like Mann. While it’s true that De Niro has appeared in his share of movies that aren’t especially worthy of his talent, it often seems that he’s both willing to work and remarkably free of ego in the work itself.(Photo by ©Lionsgate)His characters in Casino and Heat are quite the opposite; they wouldn’t be caught dead doing jobs that could be perceived as beneath them. (McCauley’s promise to Hanna in the coffee-shop scene makes this more or less literal.) They’re men of discipline, yes, and certainly McCauley displays less hubris than Ace, who at one point broadcasts his own television show to settle scores with the Las Vegas gaming commission. But they’re both larger than life — not because of particularly gregarious personalities, but because they loom outside what Heat refers to as a “regular-type life.” De Niro can get away with moments of unemotional minimalism because of his own towering work before these movies, especially the volcanic outbursts of Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Untouchables, and Raging Bull, among others. In 1995, at least, his reputation preceded him.Neither of De Niro’s 1995 movies were received as a farewell to the iconography and prestige involved with being the legendary Robert De Niro, and knowing his work ethic, they probably weren’t intended that way, either. But&nbsp;25 years later, they play like De Niro has honed his most familiar tics into a sleek, efficient weapon. Heat and Casino both prepare him for middle age, and this doesn’t just mean his comic roles and character-actor parts. Look at an underseen later-period De Niro movie like Stone: It generates plenty of intensity as his parole officer character faces off against a prisoner played by Edward Norton, but this is a life-sized De Niro, his anger and violence repressed, his disappointments flattened out.This extends to his recent reunion with Scorsese, The Irishman, where he plays a hitman as an unquestioning working stiff. The film is powered by the idea that maybe those classic gangster movies were even sadder and less glamorous than viewers entirely realized at the time — something else that both Heat and Casino were preparing for back in 1995, when they were met with good-but-not-great receptions. Neil McCauley orchestrates a precise and ambitious heist, falls in love, and the LAPD still catches up to him; Ace Rothstein ends his long, detailed, decades-spanning story about Vegas with a shrug as he returns to bookmaking. Maybe a lot of those beloved De Niro icons were secretly workhorses all along.Casino was released on November 22, 1995. Heat was released on December 15, 1995.&nbsp;On an Apple device?

He filmed Blade Runner directly after playing Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back and Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and resumed those characters immediately after, in Return of the Jedi and Temple of Doom.

If you’ve got your eye on the tabs you know that Jolie is holed up in a Paris high-rise with her kids Zahara and Maddox, as well as soon-to-be baby daddy Brad Pitt (we’ve been poring over People magazine’s in-depth analysis of the pair’s non-matrimonial \"mystery\" rings; he’s wearing a gold band on his right middle finger, while she’s MOVED hers from right index finger to thumb!).But back to \"Sin City 2.\" The sequel will pick up with two more of Frank Miller’s pulp-noir stories, \"Lost, Lonely and Lethal\" and \"A Dame To Kill For,\" and has \"Sin City\" stars coming back, including Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Brittany Murphy, and Michael Clarke Duncan.From Sci Fi Wire: \"\"The film’s been kind of postponed because Robert has been interested in Angelina Jolie for the lead,\" Dawson said in an interview. \"But she’s very pregnant right now.

It wasn’t on the day it came out, but maybe a year and a half later. My parents were about to embark on what would end up being a nasty divorce, and my father was no longer living at home. It was well before the “50% of marriages end in divorce” world we’re all deeply familiar with now, and my parents’ separation made me feel like an outlier in our slightly Stepford-ish Connecticut town. I didn’t know anyone else whose parents were divorced. Would we survive it? It felt like the end of the world.My two younger siblings and I watched Mrs. Doubtfire for the first time on VHS, a rare universally approved pick from the local Blockbuster. Instantly, we were transfixed by Robin WIlliams’ effortless charisma. This was the dad that every kid wanted, and in my 9-year-old eyes, my father was a hilarious hero much like Daniel Hillard, an energizer bunny of a mostly stay-at-home dad, especially compared to my far grumpier workaholic mother. You’d expect a story like this to totally villainize the mother, but what happened was something far different. The film quickly became a tender ode to modern families when love simply isn’t enough, and what happens when families break apart for the better.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)Mrs. Doubtfire showed that life could not only be okay after divorce, but that in some cases it was the best case scenario for everyone involved. It was clear that the Hillards were dysfunctional and in pain. Dan and Miranda (Sally Field) were in precarious positions and relying on slightly toxic habits to stay mentally afloat. And stuck in the middle of it were Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence), and Natalie (Mara Wilson), who were as lost and confused by this brave new world as my two younger siblings and I were, and who in many ways mirrored myself and my younger brother and sister. All of us, real or fictional, were desperately in need of our father’s love and support, and rendered emotional and reactionary by all the new, seemingly unnecessary changes, complicated by a not entirely effective court system. But the film also provided us something else: a glimpse into the secret lives of parents.Look at the lengths to which Dan Hillard was going: He was willing to risk everything to see and be with his kids! I needed to believe that there was a reason why my father wasn’t around, why this was all “for the best” in spite of it feeling like the worst. Mrs. Doubtfire’s outlandish scenario gave me hope — after all, being Mrs. Doubtfire made Dan a better father (and even at a young age, I knew my father could stand to be a bit more, well, fatherly).(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)Watching it again as an adult proves the film to be even sweeter in that regard. Now a woman of 32 with much more context not only for my parents’ divorce, but the lives of moms and dads, I notice a real sense of compassion for both of the parents in the writing. “When I’m not with Daniel,” Miranda admits to Mrs. Doubtfire at one point, “I’m better. And I’m sure he’s better without me, too.” And we saw throughout the film how true that was: Without Miranda there to pick up the slack and give Daniel the easy out on enforcing responsibility and general childcare, he had to learn to step up. And without having to feel like a constant nag and familial buzzkill, Miranda was able to chill out a bit. Mrs. Doubtfire really did effectively co-parent with her! Being apart made them both better parents.And Daniel’s speech at the court; the love he had for his kids? How badly he needed them? That he wanted them in his life even after the divorce, and would do whatever it took to do so? It’s exactly what a young child wants to hear about fathers. That even when we don’t see them or have them around, they’re thinking about, fighting for, and caring about us, ’til the end. Of course, the film isn’t perfect, but its heart was earnest in its intent.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. courtesy Everett Collection)My father did not turn out to be anything like Daniel Hillard during or after the nasty battle that followed, but the magical potential I saw in Mrs. Doubtfire of what life could be in a divorced family brought my tiny heart hope. It made the whole ordeal feel less ostracizing and more survivable. Maybe dad wasn’t around because he was out there looking for a job and a good home for us to be able to visit — and after all that happened, mom would be happier, and so would dad, and we’d all be okay in the end. Because “there are all sorts of different families,” as Mrs. Doubtfire tells Katie McCormack at the end of her children’s show, “but if there’s love, dear… you’ll have a family in your heart forever.”Mrs. Doubtfire was released on November 24, 1993.#1Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) 71%#1Adjusted Score: 74.69% Critics Consensus: On paper, Mrs. Doubtfire might seem excessively broad or sentimental, but Robin Williams shines so brightly in the title role that the end result is difficult to resist.Synopsis: After out-of-work actor Daniel Hilliard (Robin Williams) loses custody of his three children to his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field), he...

Nobody else, except for maybe Jamie Lee Curtis, has survived three movies in a franchise, and not even she got a Halloween TV series. Entering season 3&nbsp;of Ash vs Evil Dead, Campbell says they may have finally found Ash’s breaking point.Chopping up all of his demonically possessed friends in the woods didn’t break him. Traveling back to medieval times to fight more “Deadites” didn’t do it. Returning to Elk Grove, and the 1980s, didn’t do it. So what could season&nbsp;3 have in store that Ash hasn’t faced yet?Bruce Campbell spoke with Rotten Tomatoes by phone while he was on a book tour for his second autobiography, Hail to the Chin: Further Confessions of&nbsp;a B Movie Actor. Campbell teased Ash’s breakdown and eight other things about the new season and the Evil Dead franchise as a whole.1. ASH GOES FROM MEDIEVAL TO SHAKESPEAREANArmy of Darkness let Ash go medieval on an army of Deadites. The Bard comes a little later in history, but Campbell says Ash will feel the burden of a Hamlet or Macbeth.“Wait ‘til you see season 3, man,” Campbell said. “It’s going to be Shakespearean this year.”To chainsaw or not to chainsaw. That is the question.“Ash is finally going to be pushed over the edge which is really fun to do,” Campbell continued. “He’s going to become unhinged. It’s pretty edgy. It’s pretty out there. Ash is going to become unhinged essentially.”2. HE’S CASHING IN ON FAMESince Ash became a hero of Elk Grove, he stuck around to capitalize on it. What other kind of store could Ash Williams open but a hardware store? You’ll see his commercial for Ashy Slashy’s Hardware in the season premiere.“The fun there was to imitate every sh–y commercial you’ve ever seen,” Campbell said. “We’ve all seen ‘em. ‘Or your mattress is freeeeeee.’ Every local town has ‘em, so we figured Ash would fall right into the same trap, try and capitalize on his fame in the cheapest way possible.”3. THERE&nbsp;ARE MORE LITTLE ASHES THAN WE THOUGHTThe Williams family keeps growing. Ash’s dad (Lee Majors) is promised a return, even though he splattered in season 2. In season 3, Ash meets his long-lost daughter, Brandy (Arielle Carver-O’Neill), and — wouldn’t you know it? — she takes after Dad.“She does in many ways, and I love the fact that Ash doesn’t like it when she swears,” Williams said. “He’s becoming the paternal figure. He will be against his better nature. He’s got to rise to the occasion. What’s fun is to see a guy who is so over all this, he has to not only save the world, but raise an unruly daughter at the same time. I love that dynamic.”Honestly, it’s surprising that this is Ash’s first offspring. If he’d hung around the Middle Ages another nine months, he might’ve found out about more.“I would expect that he might have some lineage back then, yeah,” Campbell speculated.4. WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITYIt’s been some 35 years of Ash chainsawing demons. At a certain point, he’s got to face the facts. It’s not just a coincidence he keeps reading from the Necronomicon.“It all comes to a head at the end of the season where we start to pay off some of the mythology,” Campbell said. “Who is Ash? Why is he foretold in an ancient book? It was time to get into that. The myth combined with sh– getting weirder and bigger and worse, it’s one big pressure cooker of a season.”5. ASH GETS TO TAKE A BREAKWith new cast members joining the fight, there isn’t quite so much pressure on Campbell to do all the gore and action. You’ll see him in an epic Deadite battle using all the instruments of a high school music room in the season premiere, but then his costars share the load.“My daughter this year get probably more blood than I do,” Campbell said. “Dana [DeLorenzo] and Ray [Santiago], who I call The Kids, they get hammered this year too. Everyone gets it. I might be slightly blood-lighter this year. We’ll see. I’m not sure what the stats are. There’s plenty of blood to go around, no question about it.”But it’s all integral to the plot, of course.“Yeah, we don’t play the ‘can you top this’ game,” Campbell said. “We don’t shy away from gore but we don’t chase it too much either. Overall, there’s more focus on the big story this season but plenty of sh– happens in between and plenty of twisted stuff on top of that, I might add.”6. ASH WILL NEVER QUITE LOSE THE AUDIENCE“Ash is an idiot,” Campbell said. So he admits that and embraces Ash’s most bonehead moves. But the important thing is that Ash remains the good guy. He’ll always be our man with the chainsaw.“If you don’t give a sh– about your lead character, you’re doomed,” Williams said. “There has to be enough qualities about him that you go ‘OK, I’ll root for the guy.’ He is a good guy. That’s what sets him apart in the horror world. There are very few good guys in horror franchises. As flawed as he is, he’s still a good guy you can root for.”7. DON’T PAY TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TIMELINESeason 2&nbsp;had Ash return to the cabin in the woods in the ’80s. This was after he returned to Elk Grove to answer for the town’s suspicions when he returned alone from the camping trip in Evil Dead 2. Williams suggested the audience not concern themselves too much with the chronology of events. That’s not what’s important here.“Look, timelines are all screwed up anyway, so none of that really matters,” Campbell said. “It was fun just to explore his hometown, go into his room, meet his girlfriend, meet his family. That to me was the fun part. Just going to Elk Grove was awesome.”It did answer a question everyone had to be wondering though: What would regular people think of his missing friends and this crazy story about demons and time travel?“That’s right,” Campbell said. “What would be his myth? Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Misunderstood or heroic?”8. THEY’RE NEVER GOING BACK TO EVIL DEAD 1’S TONEThe Evil Dead served its purpose. It launched director Sam Raimi, producer Rob Tapert, and Campbell’s careers. But they’ve all moved on. The original The Evil Dead was more of a straight horror movie, but they’re not nostalgic for that. They’re happy with the transition to comedy in the sequels and TV series.“Nah, to me the first Evil Dead was just kind of failed melodrama,” Campbell said. “Very earnest, clunky dialogue said by earnest, inexperienced actors. That’s what that was. No, I don’t need to go back to that. I actually like the tone that we’ve hit with Ash vs Evil Dead, which is basically 50/50: 50 percent humor, 50 percent horror.”9. THEY WANT TO DO SEASON&nbsp;4 BEFORE A FOURTH MOVIEThe Evil Dead movies were locked in a trilogy for decades. There was a remake that could’ve started a new film series, but it’s been Ash vs Evil Dead that brought back hope for a new Ash movie.Campbell says keep waiting. By the end of season 3, this story line will beg to continue with another season.“Well, at the end of season 3, we’re free to go anywhere because it’s going to be a game changer,” Campbell said. “Yes, we’re willing to take these leaps. We’ve just taken a leap.”Nothing is guaranteed on television, but Campbell is pushing for a fourth season with all his might.“Well, we’ll be lucky to get a fourth season,” Campbell said. “We teed it up huge. Now we just want to see if Starz/Lionsgate wants to pull the trigger. This is the TV game. It’s a rough game, so we’re waiting to hear about a fourth season. One crisis at a time.”Ash vs Evil Dead season 3 premieres on Sunday, February 25 on Starz.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Podcast, werewolf, It, war, Musical, in, cooking","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"bruce-campbell-on-ash-vs-evil-dead-season-3"},{"id":"47614122392438","title":"Early Spoilers Galore on \"National Treasure 2\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Early Spoilers Galore on \"National Treasure 2\"by Scott Weinberg | December 20, 2006 |  CommentsHere’s where I come across a dilemma: I want to share with you the spoilerrific plot points for the eventually upcoming \"National Treasure 2\" — but I refuse to read the article and spoil the sequel for myself.

And it’s just less than a month before Disney’s new take on the story lands in&nbsp;cinemas across the country. To celebrate the anniversary of the original game-changing animated classic, we’re looking back at its first few minutes, which make up one of the most spellbinding opening sequences in movie history. Here’s how it came together – and how it almost looked, and sounded, completely different.“The Circle of Life”&nbsp;Might Have Looked Very DifferentThe opening moments of The Lion King are some of the most powerful moments Disney animators have ever put to screen: from the second Lebo M.’s Zulu chant kicks in over a rising red sun, to the moment that same sun slices through the clouds to bless baby Simba, held skyward by Rafiki, the sequence holds the audience in its thrall. Twenty-five years on, it has lost none of its&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to drop your jaw. And yet. Originally, the scene –&nbsp;now widely regarded as one of the most awe-inspiring movie openings ever –&nbsp;was going to be quite different. For starters, rather than simply show the animals wordlessly moving towards Pride Rock, the scene was to feature dialogue; one early iteration would have them sing a prayer in Swahili. Also, in one early incarnation of the scene we were to meet The Lion King’s villain, Scar, who was to be shown angrily watching over the proceedings until being noticed and slinking away. Ultimately, the filmmakers went in a different direction, opting for zero dialogue, and move history was made.(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)The Song Was Written in Two Major Flurries of InspirationIt’s hard to believe that a song as powerful as “The Circle of Life” – which opens the film, stage show, and presumably also the upcoming live-action film&nbsp;– came together so quickly. Both of the song’s key elements –&nbsp;the memorable Zulu chant that opens the film, as well as the sung English verses and chorus&nbsp;–&nbsp;were created in moments of sudden inspiration. Lyricist Tim Rice has said that the main melody was dreamed up by Elton John in less than two hours. “I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon,” Rice says in The New Illustrated Treasury of Disney Songs. “By half-past three, he’d finished writing and recording a stunning demo.”The Zulu section –&nbsp;including the famous “Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba!” –&nbsp;came about in similarly inspired fashion. Hans Zimmer (pictured above), who had been brought on to compose the score, tapped Lebo M., a then-exiled South African composer living in the U.S., to help with the music. Zimmer and the directors told the&nbsp;composer what they wanted to do with the opening scene, and, during one session, Lebo began to riff on ideas. At first, it looked like the session was not going anywhere, and that the team might not have the right music for the opening scene ahead of a screening for executives. Then, suddenly, Lebo cried out “Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba,” and all present agreed –&nbsp;instantly –&nbsp;that the chant would open the film.The Creation of Pride Rock&nbsp;The opening scene of The Lion King introduced audiences to the movie’s signature sound and feel, but also to one of its most indelible images: Pride Rock, a jutting formation of giant rocks that becomes almost an amphitheater on which much of the film’s key action takes place. It is where baby Simba is introduced to the world; where Scar meets his fate; and where Simba and Nala’s baby is held aloft in the film’s final, bookending moments. It would also go on to become the signature set piece in Julie Taymor’s Broadway production of The Lion King. Many curious fans have dug into The Lion King’s production history in search of the real-life landmark that inspired Pride Rock, believing that it exists somewhere in Kenya. While it’s true that the filmmakers traveled to Kenya’s Hell’s Gate National Park to research the animals and landscape, the look of Pride Rock itself was something that came straight from the minds of the animators. Co-director Roger Allers has reportedly said, “….we used a variety of inspirations. Many people try to say, ‘Pride Rock is based on this mountain here,’ but they are wrong. An artist in Burbank invented Pride rock.”(Photo by © Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everett Collection)“Circle” Became the Defining Moment of the Movie, And The First TrailerThe power of The Lion King’s opening scene was&nbsp;obvious&nbsp;from the very beginning. Apparently, after seeing the sequence for the first time, then CEO of the Walt Disney Company, Michael Eisner, said the scene was almost too good, telling the creative team that now the rest of the movie had the pressure of living up to the opening minutes. The marketers recognized the power of the sequence, too, and elected to use the “Circle of Life” sequence in its entirety for the film’s first trailer. It was a bold move for Disney. Never had the company released a trailer that was simply one uninterrupted scene, and it was rare to release trailers with no dialogue at all. It was a risk that paid off, though: The Lion King trailer became water-cooler conversation, and by the time the movie opened wide in American theaters on June 24, 1994, it had built so much buzz it would enjoy&nbsp;the biggest opening for an animated movie ever up to that point.Coming Full “Circle”: From Screen to Stage and Back AgainThe opening sequence of The Lion King would find a second life in Taymor’s six-time Tony–winning Broadway production. In the live musical, the film’s now-famous images of animals moving towards Pride Rock were translated into a theatrical experience in which&nbsp;dancers wielding mammoth animal puppets move majestically down the theater’s aisles towards the stage, on which Pride Rock stands. It is widely considered –&nbsp;just as the moment in the film is – one of the great openings in musical theater.&nbsp;Back on screen, in late 2018, Disney paid homage to its own marketing campaign for the original film, releasing a trailer for the upcoming live-action Lion King that prominently featured the opening scene with just flashes of other moments from the film; a TV spot that aired during the Super Bowl in 2019 similarly centered on the opening song. Online, fans went wild: already excited by the casting of names like Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, as well as James Earl Jones (returning as Mufasa),&nbsp;they were now assured that the filmmakers&nbsp;were aiming to capture spirit and emotions of the original movie, and its awe-inspiring opening.The Lion King&nbsp;was released June 24, 1994 |&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;is in theaters everywhere July 19, 2019","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Apple, horror, Writers, Grant, Skip, miniseries, park, Sneak, VOD, The","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"the-story-behind-circle-of-life-the-lion-kings-incredible-opening-number"},{"id":"47614138583934","title":"Mellow Greetings!

Demolition Man Is Still a Clever, Action-Packed Treat 25 Years LaterFive reasons why the Sylvester Stallone/Wesley Snipes action flick has the staying power of... Taco Bell.by Kevin Bauer | October 8, 2018 |  CommentsLike many of its ’90s sci-fi/action peers, Demolition Man, rides a razor’s edge between comedy and action. Where others like Judge Dredd, Barb Wire, and Tank Girl stumbled, Demolition Man succeeded by the sheer charisma of its three leads, its full-comedy vision of the future, and a smart chunk of satire straight out of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Ultimately, it has a lot to say and has a ton of fun&nbsp;saying it.Some 25 years after its release – it opened in the U.S. on October 8, 1993 – the the film has achieved a kind of soft cult status. (Enough so that Taco Bell and Warner Bros. teamed up for a pop-up 25th birthday celebration at Comic Con back in July.) Here are&nbsp;five of the reasons it’s worth taking the film out of the freezer, and revisiting San Angeles.SYLVESTER STALLONE AND WESLEY SNIPES(Photo by © Warner Bros. )In the crime-ridden hellscape of 1996, only one man has the guts to face the worst criminal of all time. That’s Los Angeles Sergeant John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), a tough-as-nails, take-no-prisoners cop who always gets the job done.&nbsp;The criminal in question is&nbsp;Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes), cartoonishly murderous bad guy with a capital B. When Spartan inadvertently gets some hostages killed while apprehending Phoenix, both men are cryogenically frozen only to be awoken 36 years later in the crime-free utopia of San Angeles, 2032.Stallone was&nbsp;no stranger to tough-guy cop roles (and two years later he would tell us, “I am the law!”), but he cranks his performance here up to 11, deepening his snarl, adding swagger to his gait, deriding a future that wants to yank his leash even harder than the past did. Most surprising is Stallone’s comic timing, projecting mockery and irritation at a world-gone-soft. Hard to blame a guy who can’t figure out the three shells.It’s nothing compared to Snipes’ madcap performance, though. As if director Marco Brambilla told him “go nuts” before every take, Snipes is a giddy homicidal maniac, leering, quipping, bouncing, dancing, cackling, and giving impromptu martial-arts demonstrations as he sees fit. There isn’t a bit of scenery he doesn’t chew the hell out of.SANDRA BULLOCK’S BREAKOUT PERFORMANCE(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Equally impressive is Sandra Bullock‘s star-making performance as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, one of San Angeles’ unfailingly polite police officers. Bullock’s joviality is epidemic-level infectious, and she has a screen presence and charisma that matches – and occasionally outshines – Stallone’s performance. The next year she would bring these same qualities to&nbsp;Speed.In some ways, both characters are fish out of water. Spartan might be a violent brute in a too-peaceful world, but Huxley is a cop who longs for action who, when she gets it, often struggles and fails – whether it be while grappling with “murder/death/kills” in her jurisdiction or dealing with genuine human connections like physical love.A Totally Bizarre (and sometimes convincing) Vision of the Future(Photo by © Warner Bros.)The Fifth Element&nbsp;is wild, sure, but its vision of 2263 isn’t that far-fetched if you think about it. McDonald’s still around. Frenetic pop stars are on the air 24/7. Compare that to Demolition Man – set only 39 years in the future upon its release. It’s a time when…Taco Bell has won “the franchise wars” and is the only restaurant in town.Toilet paper has been completely replaced by the three shells, which nobody will explain how to use.Cussing is punished with police citations – which are incidentally good TP replacements.Arnold Schwarzenegger became president (OK, that’s a bit closer to home).That’s a helluva lot of change in only 39 years, but not all of the changes are punchlines.Prisoners are subject to hypnotic suggestion.Love, sex, and procreation are heavily restricted by the government.Corporations have monopolistic rule on society.People are ostracized for the slightest display of incivility.OK, so maybe not too far from reality then.It has something to say (cribbed heavily from Huxley)(Photo by @ Warner Bros.)It’s no mistake that Bullock’s character is a Brave New World reference (Lenina is a major character from the book and Aldous Huxley was the writer). In that famous novel, everyone has a clearly defined place in their utopian society from the time of their “decanting” (no one is born anymore –&nbsp;that’s barbaric, you see). The trouble with that is even utopias contain haves and have-nots, and that disparity is enormous.Demolition Man is no different. Want to live your life freely? Want to cuss, smoke, drink, have sex, and whatever else? Hope you’re ready to live on ratburgers in abject poverty in the sewers. Spartan and Phoenix may come from a dystopian version of the ’90s, but San Angeles’ 2032 utopia is just as hellish thanks to its sheer level of oppression.IT’S GOT A GREAT LITTLE MORAL(Photo by © Warner Bros.)As with most works about utopias, from Brave New World to The Giver, Demolition Man settles on the idea that the answer is balance. It’s easy to give in to fear and allow creeping restrictions in our lives. We can mistake things that constrain us as things that make us safer and freer, but there is always a cost. Human nature simply wasn’t meant to be repressed. It was meant to express itself in all its awkward and chaotic beauty.Spartan recognizes this in his arc, as he goes from from unhinged, violent cop to balanced member of society who uplifts the repressed and ostracized. Huxley discovers the opposite, as she unburdens herself of San Angeles’ restrictions and embraces life to the fullest with adventure and romance. The key to life, happiness, and a healthy society is balance. And lots and lots of Taco Bell.Demolition Man hit theaters on October 8, 1993.But what do you think?

Ed Wood, Tim Burton’s biopic on “the worst director of all time,” may have been the critical darling its subject could only dream of (it’s Burton’s highest-rated directorial effort at 92% on the Tomatometer), but it hardly caught on. The comedy took in less than a third of Burton’s comparatively small $18-million budget, whereas the filmmaker’s predecessor, Batman Returns, skyrocketed to become the then-highest-grossing opening weekend of all time. To give an idea of the comedies the public did pine for in 1994, Jim Carrey starred in three movies in the top 20 that year. Ed Wood&nbsp;was decidedly nothing like a Jim Carrey movie.Dark, sweet and restrained (by Burton standards, anyway), Ed Wood chronicles the life of Edward D. Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp), a crossdressing wannabe auteur in the 1950s who befriends his hero, a washed-up and drug-addled Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), and makes schlocky B-movies with a misfit crew. Here are just a few reasons why it remains a high-watermark for Burton and pretty much everyone involved — and warrants some serious reassessment if you shrugged it off 25 years back.IT’S BURTON’S SMALLEST MOVIE(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Wait, so where did the guy go who wowed with the visual feasts Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice and the thrilling art direction in Edward Scissorhands and Batman? He’s Mostly absent here. There are some nifty, Burtonesque flourishes — a cheesily spooky title sequence that harkens back to ’50s horror and sci-fi sets the tone perfectly — but overall, Burton puts a simple story over any distinct style. It’s him at his least showy, a move that lets the comedy’s quickfire script breathe and doesn’t muddy up its already arresting performances. Besides, when you have black-and-white cinematography (thanks to cinematographer Stefan Czapsky) this beautiful, why complicate things? Burton, in fact, was so adamant about the film being monochrome that Columbia dropped the picture (Disney picked it up later).…AND HIS MOST PERSONAL(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It’s not hard to understand why Burton would relate to a story about an energetic young director bonding with his childhood idol. Burton famously adored Vincent Price, casting him in the stop-motion Disney short “Vincent” and as The Inventor in Edward Scissorhands, and, like with that relationship, the one between wide-eyed Wood and an aging Lugosi boasts a delightful mutual appreciation. While Ed Wood capitalizes on the odd couple for comedic effect (it’s tough not to laugh as an Energizer Bunny-like Wood shepherds around a moribund, ever-frowning Lugosi), the bromance always comes off as weirdly sweet. Ed Wood was a labor of love for him — in fact, Burton, who demanded creative control, even waived a paycheck.THE PERFORMANCES ARE ACE(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The success of any buddy comedy — and boiled down, Ed Wood is one — rests on the chemistry of its stars. Depp upped his game, giving a performance that’s all gusto and unrelenting optimism and over-the-top tics yet still somehow grounded. Wood’s ridiculous, but you pull for him. Landau, too, imbues what could be a cartoonish Lugosi — essentially, his Dracula character thrown into ’50s California, complete with the accent, mannerisms, and gait — with some real emotional heft, and he rightfully nabbed a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Sarah Jessica Parker is a great comedic foil as Wood’s encouraging (and later disapproving) girlfriend, and Bill Murray is brilliantly deadpan as aspiring transsexual John “Bunny” Breckinridge.THE SCRIPT SIZZLES(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)“We envisioned Ed Wood as more of an indie-style picture, because we had written two big Hollywood hits that we were very unsatisfied with,” co-writer Larry Karaszewski told Medium, referencing the Problem Child movies. You can see what he means: He and Scott Alexander’s script, written in a mere six weeks after the go-ahead from Burton, has a quirky, left-field, character-driven quality that doesn’t scream “huge studio” (like, say, Disney) or “big-deal director” (like, say, Burton). So Burton reining in the very sensibilities that made him a name is necessary, especially with a script packed with this much snappy dialogue. Just take this exchange between Wood and Breckinridge, during the filming of Plan 9 from Outer Space:Breckinridge: What about glitter? When I headlined in Paris, audiences always loved it when I sparkled.Ed Wood: No.Breckinridge: Cats’ eyes?Ed Wood: No!Breckinridge: Well, I’m going to need some antennae.Ed Wood: No! You’re the ruler of the galaxy — show a little taste!IT WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME(Photo by Buena Vista Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Ed Wood may have not saturated the zeitgeist and spawned copycats the way Pulp Fiction did in ’94, but it’s not too much of a leap to suggest it helped open the door for other love letters to ragtag groups of outsider filmmakers with questionable tastes. Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights a few years later similarly embraced the freak-flag spirit of the early porn industry. Interestingly, Wood’s line about Plan 9 from Outer Space (“This is the one I’ll be remembered for”) is echoed by Nights’ Burt Reynolds, talking about his directorial opus (“This is the film I want them to remember me by”). (Also interesting: Wood helmed porn in ’70s.) Wes Anderson’s seafaring adventure-comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Disaster Artist, a big-screen retelling of the making of “the worst movie ever,” also have traces of Ed Wood. And Wood’s spirit was alive and well in documentaries about enthusiastic, unfazed, unrealistic dreamers — be they about aspiring filmmakers (American Movie) or rock bands (Anvil! The Story of Anvil).Ed Wood&nbsp;opened nationwide on October 7, 1994.Like this?

Ace Ventura: Pet Detective/When Nature CallsAllllll righty then, comedy fans! We're hunting down every clue and exploring every rhino cavity to solve the biggest case in Jim Carrey's career: Do the Ace Ventura flicks deserve their Rotten splats?by RT Staff | November 12, 2020 |  Comments(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Was Jim Carrey’s 1994 the single best&nbsp;year for a relative newcomer to the big screen ever? Or was it just the single best year for any actor&nbsp;–&nbsp;period? Consider that in this 12-month span, the&nbsp;In Living Color star appeared in three movies that were smash hits at the time and have gone on to become comedy classics: The Mask, Dumb &amp; Dumber, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.&nbsp;Each would spawn catchphrases, sequels, and remain in the pop culture conversation almost three decades on, but only one stands out from the otherwise-Fresh pack for earning itself a big green splat on our Tomatometer.That film is Ave Ventura, which featured arguably Jim Carrey’s most Jim Carrey performance, a fact that split critics almost evenly –&nbsp;the movie is Rotten at 49% – between those who were repelled by his rubber-faced gonzo efforts and those who felt Carrey was the best thing about this sophomoric story of a stolen football mascot and the quest to track it down. (Still,&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;were kinder to the 1994 movie than they were to its sequel, released just a year later: Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls was slapped with a Rotten Tomatometer score of just 25%.)Were the critics talking out of their… ahem, asses?

In this case, rumors that Frank Miller wants her to be in \"Sin City 2\" appear to be valid.\"Yeah, we’ve talked about it, and I’ve read the comic,\" she said. \"I don’t think the film’s being made at this moment, so when it’s actually going to be made, I’m sure we’ll talk about it.\"Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen in \"Sin City\"Robert Rodriguez has said on many occasions that the second film would be based on Miller’s graphic novel, \"A Dame to Kill For.\" Perhaps the timing was perfect, because Miller spoke to Jolie at precisely the moment when she felt her least sexy.\"It was a funny thing, because the idea came to me when I was pregnant.

ABC drama Somewhere Between, about a woman who knows her daughter is going to be murdered, will begin shooting in Vancouver and air in summer 2017. Classic sitcom producer Norman Lear has entered into talks with Netflix to potentially launch reboots of All in the Family, Good Times, The Jeffersons, and Maude as part of an anthology miniseries in which contemporary actors will act out scripted scenes — as originally written — from the vintage shows. And, finally, people are talking about Russian reality show Game2: Winter that will purportedly allow rape and murder as part of contestants’ survival tactics in the Siberian wilderness.That’s a Lot of TV!Click for larger imageOriginal scripted television is up 71 percent since 2011 across cable, broadcast, and streamers, according to&nbsp;FX Networks Research.

The fictional historian/CIA agent/President, created by Tom Clancy for 1984’s The Hunt for Red October, has been the focus of multiple Clancy novels, four of which — Red October, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, and The Sum of All Fears — have been made into movies.Turnover in the role is nothing new — Ryan has been played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck — and a new film in the series has been rumored since 2006, when Moviehole reported that Paramount was interested in filming a script (now rumored to be titled By Any Means Necessary) not based on any of Clancy’s books.Even if he isn’t the new Jack Ryan, however, Gosling is still lining up work: Variety reports that he’s signed on to star in Andrew Jarecki‘s feature directing debut, All Good Things. The movie, described as a “period love story/murder mystery,” will be filmed from a script by Jarecki, Marcus Hinchey, and Marc Smerling. According to Variety, Kirsten Dunst is in negotiations to star opposite Gosling. From the article:Set in the 1980s, story centers on the scion of a New York real estate dynasty (Gosling) who falls for a beautiful girl from the wrong side of the tracks (Dunst). But the fairy tale ends when the girl disappears.

Her analyses consistently take into account not just the movie or series at hand, but the overall state of the industry. Her reviews hinge upon how specific business decisions – from casting with&nbsp;Judas and the Black Messiah&nbsp;to release strategies with Wonder Woman: 1984&nbsp;– interweave with and work alongside plot, performances, and visual style to inform&nbsp;the final product audiences see.In an interview with Rotten Tomatoes, Bastién discussed the varying misconceptions about critics – both from an industry and an audience perspective: “Part of the problem with how audiences see critics as worthless and don’t understand the point of them is linked to the state of modern criticism,” Bastién said. “A lot of critics confuse their job for being PR. It’s not – we don’t work for these studios.”Bastién, like many of her peers, refutes the false impression that critics “just hate things” – in fact, the opposite is true.“What guides me as a critic, first and foremost, is my passion and my curiosity,” she said. “I hope that shows through my work – that I really love the forms of film and television, and they mean a lot to me, and they’re distinctive, and they’re beguiling, and they’re challenging.”Especially in the midst of the ongoing pandemic, Bastién seeks to be engaged by cultural texts, whether movies, comic books, novels, or television series. “I just love to learn about them and explore them, fall into them, and just get to exist in the headspace of a completely different world for a while.”Angelica Jade Bastién is a staff critic at Vulture/New York Magazine.

In terms of old things, there’s a David Lean film called The Passionate Friends from 1949 that I think was the best thing I’ve watched in the past year, above all else. Watching the second season of the Harley Quinn animated series was great.Do you binge-watch?I’m watching so many things for work, whether it’s directly reviewing a piece or for background research on something I’m doing, so I’m not much of a binge-watcher.I grew up in a time where waiting for a show week-to-week was the norm. And I think that kind of lets things breathe a little bit better, so I actually try to avoid that.Do you have a routine for when you’re screening something at home?Maybe a nice glass of champagne in a coupe glass, because I am haughty like that. And you know, some incense. I definitely have the lights off, to kind of really envelop yourself into that environment, especially at home.(Photo by Warner Brothers)What makes a good movie?For me, a good-to-great movie rests on the perspective of the artists involved. Do they have something to say? Is it novel, is it interesting, is it challenging? Does it challenge the status quo or does it capitulate to it?You know, one thing I like to keep in mind is, as much as I love film and television as media, they’re completely capitalist enterprises, and that can totally influence the art involved. I tend to believe that good art, it challenges status quo more than anything else. It has a voice, it has a perspective, it has an understanding of history without being completely beholden to it. It has a strong visual grammar and perspective that feels in line with the story and thematics it’s interested in telling.Above all else, I seek joy, I seek pleasure, and I seek being challenged as a viewer.What were you watching the first time you saw yourself on screen, and what did you relate to about that story?You know, it’s so funny getting asked a question like this. Because sometimes I wonder about the impulse to see yourself on screen. And I think sometimes people really judge this on the basis of identity. Like, “I’m a Black woman and I’m seeing another Black woman on screen that looks like me, moves like me, has similar concerns as I do.”For me, I think the time that I really, really first saw myself, or at least spiritually saw myself on screen, was in Now, Voyager with Bette Davis’ performance. I am separated by time, race, sexual identity, with this woman. So you know, it’s not like we line up in those sort of ways. But spiritually, I felt like when I saw it as a teenager for the first time, I was blown away by is portrayal of mental illness and anxiety, and the complications that can happen between a daughter and a mother.What is the hardest review that you’ve ever written?Every new review is the hardest review I’ve ever written lately, to be honest. It’s been tough going. I will say, the Judas and the Black Messiah review was very tricky for me. Partially because I wanted to bring in a historical perspective, but not be so weighed down on it.Who is an under-the-radar director or screenwriter that you think more people should know about?I’d say up-and-coming may be a better term for them. Channing Godfrey Peoples, who wrote and directed Miss Juneteenth. I’m really excited to see where her career goes. And Chinonye Chukwu, who wrote and directed Clemency with Alfre Woodard, is a writer-director I’m very interested in. I’m so curious to see where these women’s careers go.What is your favorite movie from your childhood?I could be a basic bitch and mention Jurassic Park, which was apparently the first movie I saw in theaters, but I was so young I don’t remember it.Favorite movie from my childhood… I did see Eve’s Bayou when I was very young, because my mom also really likes it. Partially because my family’s from Louisiana, I consider myself a Southern broad, and the way the South is depicted in films is very fascinating to me. Especially when Black people are allowed to inhabit these works. The text that is Eve’s Bayou is so dynamic, it’s so rich, it’s so challenging, it’s so visually inventive. It’s an amazing independent film. I’ve had taste since the beginning, apparently.Is there someone in your life, that’s not a critic, whose opinion you seek out and admire?E. Alex Jung. We’ve really become closer friends in the pandemic, and it’s a friendship I cherish. Partially because he’s really influenced me to ask for my worth and then some, and really challenge myself as a writer. I sometimes like to write my reviews or pieces as love letters to friends, and I keep them in mind. He was in mind with writing I May Destroy You.(Photo by Doane Gregory - Netflix)You are the world’s foremost expert on Keanu Reeves. Can you talk a little bit about your interest in him?He’s one of my muses, so to speak. Keanu’s been a star my entire life. He’s just one of those stars who’s just had incredible longevity. And as a kid, watching movies with him just brought me a lot of joy. And for me as a critic, I often try to unpack, “Why does this piece of art or this actor or this work or whatever make me feel this way?” I always kind of deconstruct from there. Start with the emotion and then think about the filmmaking techniques that brought it out in you, right?So with Keanu, it’s a lifetime love, pretty much – I’ve just always been fond of his work. And as a critic, it’s funny because now people’s opinions of him have changed, but when I was writing the piece in 2016, a lot of people were ragging on Keanu… They saw him as a star but not a worthwhile actor. And I’ve always argued that he actually is. He’s incredible with his physicality, he’s incredible with his presence. He gives such space to the actresses who act alongside him, in ways that a lot of male actors and stars do not.He’s just all-around fascinating. Especially when we deal with conversations about race and what it means to be arguably white-passing in Hollywood.You’ve also written about Cary Grant. I wonder if there’s overlap there with the way that you write about Keanu Reeves and his public versus private persona, too. Is that an interest for you, the embodiment of those multiple selves?Star persona and star-making is one my greatest obsessions as a critic, because I think stars and our relationship to celebrity speaks to a lot of very complicated ideas about power, about beauty, about capitalism, about beauty as currency within a capitalist society. And it also really enriches our understanding of what actors are doing and how manicured these personas are.One of my pet peeves is when people say, “That actor is just playing themselves.” I’m always like, “Damn, do you know them? Did you just get coffee with this person?” Because that doesn’t really make sense. You only know what they let you know.Stars are very manicured. These personas aren’t created in a vacuum, you know what I mean? Even if they create them themselves, even if they’re just altering aspects of themselves. I think it’s just really rich. Acting makes legible certain cultural considerations. Our physicality can really speak to internal dynamics in really fascinating ways, which is why I really return to acting and star persona as subjects.Is there an actor or director or screenwriter – and now that I’m asking this question I realize what I think the answer is going to be – whose work you always love?You would think I would say Keanu, right? Because I love Keanu. But Keanu did Knock Knock with Eli Roth, and I’m never finishing that film. I will never finish that film. I love Keanu. Not doing it.In terms of an actor who, like, anything they appear in – Michelle Pfeiffer is a big one for me. I’m in love with her and probably always will be. Bette Davis, of course. Claude Rains. Juano Hernandez… Eartha Kitt, definitely. I’m a huge fan. One of my goals is to write a biography on her. Definitely one of my goals.Also the classic Hollywood actress Theresa Harris – she was a Black woman who didn’t get a lot of roles, and they were often maids and stuff like that, but she was lightning-bright. She was charismatic. She had a forcefulness to her that, it’s a shame that she was, you know, in Hollywood at that time when her artistry couldn’t be properly developed.Wong Kar-wai. Whoo, yes. I will be there for Wong Kar-wai. Park Chan-wook, definitely, in terms of modern directors. Nicholas Ray. Whoo. Big Nicholas Ray fan. Nicholas Ray, that’s a director who rips. So many people could learn from Johnny Guitar&nbsp;and In a Lonely Place.John Carpenter. That question – I don’t know if you’re going to get to it – but the movie or TV series you love that’s Rotten on the Tomatometer… I was like, damn, there’s a lot of John Carpenters I like that are Rotten on here.Let’s dive into that. Are his the Rotten movies that you love?Specifically In the Mouth of Madness and Prince of Darkness, I noticed, were Rotten. The tides have turned on The Thing, obviously. Like, even if it was critically not accepted at the time, it’s definitely become a cult classic. So I don’t need to defend that.But In the Mouth of Madness, I saw it a few years ago at the Music Box in Chicago for the first time. And it was such an amazing experience. It blew me the f–k way. And Prince of Darkness, too. Like, the fact that those movies are Rotten tells you there’s something wrong with critics. Sometimes critics get it wrong.(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Courtesy of the Everett Collection)What is the movie or television series that you have watched more than any other?This is going to be an interesting answer to say, given the conversation swirling around its creator, but definitely Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the show I’ve seen the most. March 10, 1997, I heard that theme song, completely changed my life. And really got me interested in storytelling and feminism, and all these ideas.Even if that show is riddled with issues racially, especially, but also in terms of how it portrays female characters. There’s a lot of internalized misogyny going around Sunnydale, in my opinion. And I don’t think Joss Whedon and some of the writers may have been as aware of that as they should be. But that’s definitely the show I have seen, backwards and forwards, the most.Who are your greatest influences when it comes to your writing?I’ll be a hundred: My greatest influences are not other critics, for the most part. Probably my greatest influences are Angela Carter – who wrote The Bloody Chamber, which is one of my favorite pieces of fiction in any medium and completely influences my sense of language and my desire to find a sense of poetry and musicality in the sentences I write. I’m also completely, completely enamored and influenced by James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. They’re really important to me. Also Truman Capote is an influence of mine. Those are probably the really, really big ones.Also my criticism, maybe this sounds kind of weird, it’s influenced by actors and what I see actors doing a lot. I really want my writing to have a physical presence, if that makes sense.Two of my greatest influences on me, as an artist – point blank, period – are Bette Davis and Elizabeth Taylor. I have them on my desk, so I look at them every day when I’m writing. Especially Bette Davis. You know, Bette Davis sort of reminds me to always be working on your craft, to be getting better, to be curious, to challenge yourself. And Elizabeth Taylor reminds me that I’m just that b—h and I need to keep that in mind, and to always seek pleasure in what I do.Do you have advice for critics who are still finding their voice?Part of it is making sure you remain a voracious reader and watcher. You should always be absorbing more art than you put out, in my opinion, as a critic. And finding your voice is really about finding what passions guide you and what obsessions guide you. And I think for me personally, being guided by my obsessions – rather than being, say, a “jack of all trades” kind of critic – has really helped me stand out and find my own path. And I think that’s very important to kind of keep in mind, that you won’t be everything for everybody, and that’s okay.(Photo by Hill-Hecht-Lancaster Productions )What is your favorite classic film?Oh, honey I don’t think I could name just one. I don’t even think I could name… Just one?Yes. Just one!Hmm. God, this is hard. Oh my god. Name just one. Favorite, favorite, favorite. Oh my god, this is such a hard question. I’m having a million movies running through my head. I think it’s terrible to ask this question. Because how are we supposed to answer just one?I did mention In a Lonely Place and Nicholas Ray. I’m obsessed with that movie. … It’s one of the richest noir texts. It’s heartbreaking. It’s sharp and cunning and revealing about masculinity and femininity, and the way they clash together in American society. It’s beautifully shot.Oh, no! You know what? I’m going to cross that out. Cross, cross, cross, cross.I’m going to mention Sweet Smell of Success, which is another obsession of mine. It is one of the, in my opinion, the best-looking New York film I’ve seen. [Cinematographer] James Wong Howe created magic in that movie. It’s brutal! It’s revealing about masculinity and power and desire. The people are ugly and messed up in it. It’s such a fascinating movie.What do you consider required viewing?I find the idea of required viewing a very tricky thing, because the history of film is so broad and wide, and dynamic, and rich, and complicated.I definitely think Bill Gunn, Kathleen Collins are important artists to consider and study. The work of John Cassavetes, definitely. A lot, a lot, a lot of directors today love to steal from him. But they don’t have John Cassavetes-like actors. They don’t have a John Cassavetes-like perspective. No artistry, no nothing. They just think having some white people screaming in the room is Cassavetes-like – and no, it’s not.In the Mood for Love, I think, is definitely required viewing. Works by Billy Wilder like Sunset Boulevard, Some Like it Hot, Witness for the Prosecution, Ace in the Hole. Ida Lupino‘s work is – you cannot be writing about gender in Hollywood, especially in regard to directors, without knowing and understanding her place in its history. Agnès Varda‘s work, I think, is really vital and necessary.The thing is with doing required viewing is that, I think what’s required for viewers is curiosity. Consider everything I’m saying as a jumping off point for digging into the history of film.Should I mention TV shows or just films?Go for it with TV shows!The Twilight Zone. People continue to try to do what Rod Serling did, and they’re not Rod Serling, which I am continuously reminded of.TV is often such an interesting time capsule. Let me look at my DVDs, actually. Let me see what I’m forgetting. … I will say, Batman: The Animated Series&nbsp;– also must viewing for people.If you’re interested in seeing dynamic women on screen, watch Barbara Stanwyck in damn near anything. Clash by Night, Forty Guns. She’s definitely one of the best actors to ever be put in front of a camera, in my opinion.Those are just a few things off the top of my head. I could keep going, but I think I’ll stop.Angelica Jade Bastién is a staff critic at Vulture/New York Magazine.

It’s open to debate, but most movie buffs would agree that he’s created a body of work that is astonishing in its consistency and depth. Scorsese’s films contain many grand themes – organized crime, male insecurity, spiritual and moral uncertainty – and they’re executed with a level of artistic panache and intimate detail that few can match. Scorsese has exerted a profound influence on many important directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, and John Woo. And with apologies to Lee and Woody Allen, Scorsese is perhaps the greatest cinematic chronicler of New York’s distinctive social landscape.While he’s considered one of the most important filmmakers to emerge in the 1970s, the 2000s have found Scorsese enjoying yet another fertile period, one that culminated with The Departed, for which he was granted his first Best Director Oscar. With his latest, Shutter Island, hitting theaters Feb. 19, we’ve decided to take a closer look at some of Scorsese’s most important films. However, rather than rank them by Tomatometer, we chose the movies that we feel best define the man’s art and stylistic breadth.So join us for a tour of Scorsese’s career — a journey that will take us from the Bronx to Vegas, from Tibet to Boston, with plenty of interesting scenery along the way.Mean Streets (1973)  95%Release Date: October 14, 1973 – Scorsese initially considered entering the priesthood, but ultimately decided to enroll in New York University’s film school, where he directed a number of shorts before graduating in 1969. It was here that he met two of his most important collaborators: a young actor named Harvey Keitel, and Thelma Schoonmaker, who would become his longtime editor.In 1967, Scorsese directed his first feature, Who’s That Knocking at My Door?, starring Keitel as a young Italian American wracked by Catholic guilt. The film had a palpable sense of place and a soundtrack heavy with contemporary rock, but was occasionally sidetracked by excessively arty touches. Scorsese’s second feature, the solid-if-unspectacular Bonnie and Clyde-aping Boxcar Bertha, was made under the tutelage of exploitation maestro Roger Corman. Fellow director John Cassavetes told Scorsese his next film should be more personal, and the result was Mean Streets, a powerful tale of urban sin and guilt that marked Scorsese’s arrival as an important cinematic voice.Keitel stars as Charlie, a low-level Mafioso whose devout Catholicism and loyalty to an old friend, the violent and impulsive Johnny Boy (Robert DeNiro, in the first of his many great performances for Scorsese) fill him with conflict. His love life is no easier: he’s torn between Diane (Jeannie Bell), a stripper, and Johnny Boy’s epileptic sister Teresa (Amy Robinson), and his lustful feelings consume him with self-loathing. From Mean Streets‘ electrifying title sequence (featuring grainy super-8 home movies of the characters over Ronettes’ bittersweet plea “Be My Baby”) to its inevitably grim conclusion, the film provides a far darker, less glamorous tour of the gangster life than The Godfather — one filled with uneasy alliances, sudden, clumsy violence, and moral dread.Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974)  88%Release Date: May 30, 1975 – Before Mean Streets‘ release, Scorsese was hired to direct Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, a vehicle for actress Ellen Burstyn. It was his first Hollywood production, and though it’s atypical of the kind of movie Scorsese would become known for, Alice showcases the director’s skill for capturing the small details in the lives of people facing adversity. Alternating between fantasy and everyday life, this intelligent dramedy found Scorsese making the most overtly feminist film of his career.Burstyn plays Alice Hyatt, a New Mexico housewife reeling from the death of her husband. She decides to sell her possessions and hit the road, with her young son in tow, to live out her dream of becoming a professional singer. She gets a job at a seedy lounge and finds a boyfriend in Ben (Harvey Keitel), but their relationship shatters when Ben’s violent temper emerges. She skips town again, taking a job as a waitress in Phoenix, where she bonds with her coworkers and begins an uncertain but strong romance with a lonely rancher named David (Kris Kristofferson). Burstyn’s powerful, risk-taking performance won her an Oscar for Best Actress, and the movie was adapted into a long-running sitcom, but Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore also proved that Scorsese was no one-trick pony; he could put his stamp on more conventional material.Taxi Driver (1976)  96%Release Date: February 8, 1976 – The nightmarish, endlessly compelling Taxi Driver confirmed Scorsese’s reputation as one of the foremost figures of the “Movie Brat” generation and provided Robert DeNiro with perhaps his most iconic movie role: Travis Bickle, a lonely, socially awkward, and dangerously volatile Vietnam vet turned late-night cabbie. DeNiro ad-libbed the movie’s most famous line (“You talkin’ to me?”), and Paul Schrader wrote the script (ominously, the Bickle character was partially based upon himself), but Scorsese pulled it all together, and the result is a haunted, unforgettable portrait of troubled masculinity and, by proxy, the urban malaise that plagued New York in the mid-1970s.Bickle is an insomniac, and takes the graveyard shift driving a taxi around the city, frequently returning to Times Square. However, the more he sees during his nocturnal excursions, the more he seethes: he’s disgusted by the pimps, prostitutes, and junkies that regularly line the sidewalks of his route. One ray of light comes in the form of Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a presidential campaign worker who’s intrigued by Travis. But after an ill-fated date to a porno flick, Travis begins to stalk Betsy — and the candidate as well. He also takes it upon himself to save Iris (Jodie Foster), a teenage prostitute, from her life on the streets — a life she seems unwilling to abandon. The movie builds to a feverish, brutal climax that finds Travis exploding with the violent rage that’s been simmering throughout the film, before ending with an oddly elliptical, dreamlike coda.Taxi Driver won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar; it also inspired John Hinckley, Jr. to attempt to assassinate President Reagan. In other words, it’s cinema at its most primal and provocative, a masterwork that continues to leave audiences both profoundly moved and deeply unsettled.New York, New York (1977)  63%Release Date: June 21, 1977 – Today, New York, New York is probably best remembered for Frank Sinatra’s unparalleled rendition of its title tune, but it stands as a monument to the kind of epic, ambitious, auteur filmmaking that became virtually extinct by the end of the 1970s. Following the success of Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, Scorsese grafted his gritty realism onto the glitzy superficiality of the classic MGM musicals that he loved. The result is uneven, but while it bombed at the box office and remains one of Scorsese’s least-loved works, New York, New York features several show-stopping numbers and a distinctive style that’s all its own.Robert DeNiro stars as Jimmy Doyle, a roguish jazz saxophonist who develops an on-and-off relationship with an up-and-coming singer named Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli). Their relationship is troubled from the beginning — Jimmy is a difficult customer, too temperamental for the responsibilities of love or his career. After a long split, the two find each other again, and this time, they’re at the top of their respective games — Francine’s topping the charts, and Jimmy has become a respected musician and club owner. In attempting an old-school rags-to-riches tale against a glittery backdrop, Scorsese can’t help but flesh out his characters’ painful insecurities, all of which makes for a stylistically jagged but often fascinating picture.Raging Bull (1980)  93%Release Date: December 19, 1980 – By the end of the 1970s, Scorsese’s career faced uncertain times. He directed the all-star rockumentary “The Last Waltz,” which chronicled the Band’s final gig, and the little-seen but queasily fascinating “American Boy,” a doc about Neil Diamond roadie and all-around sketchy character Steven Prince. But he had a bad drug habit, and Robert DeNiro, obsessed with bringing former middleweight champ Jake LaMotta’s autobiography to the screen, worked overtime to coax the director back into action. The result, Raging Bull, is considered by many to be Scorsese’s greatest achievement, a kinetic, on-edge portrait of a brutal, flawed man that never loses sight of its protagonist’s humanity.The film charts the rise of LaMotta (DeNiro) through the middleweight ranks, aided and abetted by his brother Joey (Joe Pesci), who acts as his matchmaker and sparring partner. After throwing a fixed fight, LaMotta is granted a title shot by underworld fixers in the fight game, and also begins to court the teenaged Vicky (Cathy Moriarty), who he meets at a Bronx swimming pool. LaMotta is most expressive in the ring, delivering flurries of punches to his opponents; on the outside, though, LaMotta is fiercely possessive of Vicky, and his inability to control his emotions leads to a long, sad decline.Filmed in tactile black-and-white, the movie is perhaps Scorsese’s most articulate meditation on male inadequacy, and its fight scenes are vivid and electric. Raging Bull was nominated for eight Oscars, and while winning two — Best Actor for DeNiro, and Thelma Schoonmaker for Best Editing — it failed to take home the Best Picture or Best Director awards, two honors that would elude Scorsese for years to come. Still, the director can take comfort in the film’s critical appraisal — the prestigious British magazine Sight and Sound called Raging Bull the best movie of the 1980s.The King of Comedy (1983)  89%Release Date: February 18, 1983 – Simon Cowell should be thankful that the average deluded American Idol also-ran isn’t Rupert Pupkin. The single-minded fameball at the center of Scorsese’s pitch-black The King of Comedy is a type with whom we’ve become increasingly familiar in our tabloid-saturated times: Pupkin is needy, desperate, and willing to do anything to become famous. However, as played by Robert DeNiro, he’s a strangely sympathetic psychopath — and not an untalented one at that. Largely ignored and misunderstood upon its release, The King of Comedy today looks eerily prescient, and finds Scorsese dissecting our showbiz-fixated culture through the lens of the troubled loners that populated his previous films.The lonely Pupkin amuses himself by seeking autographs and play-acting a late night talk show (he has a full set in his apartment, and banters with cardboard cutouts of the stars). One night, he has a chance meeting with one of his idols, chat host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), who non-committally promises to check out Pupkin’s comedy act. Convinced he has his foot in the door, Pupkin shows up daily at Langford’s office until eventually he’s forcefully ejected. He then hatches a plot to kidnap Langford in a last-ditch effort to realize his dreams. With terrific performances from DeNiro, Lewis, and a borderline possessed Sandra Bernhard (who plays Pupkin’s accomplice), The King of Comedy is about as black as black comedies come, but it makes for riveting, prophetic entertainment. Most ironic line of dialogue, courtesy of Langford: “You don’t just walk onto a network show without experience.” Just you wait, buddy.After Hours (1985)  89%Release Date: September 13, 1985 – Like Taxi Driver, After Hours chronicles one man’s nightmarish, paranoid nocturnal journey throughout New York City. Unlike Taxi Driver, After Hours is a comedy — albeit an absurdist, Kafka-esque one. Scorsese had difficulty securing funding for some of his dream projects, so he decided to scale down for After Hours, adopting an underground, almost punk-rock aesthetic. The result was a different kind of Scorsese picture, an oddball movie that maintained the themes of his previous work while adjusting to the changing times.Griffin Dunne stars as Paul, a corporate drone who meets an intriguing woman named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) in a diner. He gets her number, and shortly thereafter she invites him to the apartment where she’s staying. But when Paul clumsily loses his money — and finds out that Marcy is more than he bargained for — he decides to head home. Subsequently, Paul is confronted with a bizarre series of circumstances — including subway fare increases, a bondage session, the loss of his keys, a suicide, Cheech and Chong, and a marauding mob that wrongly believes he’s a cat burglar — that prevent him from leaving Soho. Loaded with tension and wacky characters, this cult favorite found Scorsese making common cause with the burgeoning 1980s indie movement.The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)  81%Release Date: August 12, 1988 – In the mid-1980s, Scorsese directed a pair of films that got him back in the mainstream’s good graces (The Color of Money, a sequel to The Hustler starring Tom Cruise and Paul Newman who won a Best Actor Oscar; and the long-form music video for Michael Jackson’s “Bad”). Next, he turned to a project of intense personal significance: an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis’ novel The Last Temptation of Christ.It was Scorsese’s most controversial film to date; a scene in which Jesus (Willem Defoe), in a dream, forsakes the cross to marry Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) drew thunderous protests from religious groups (unfortunately for Scorsese, the brouhaha did little for the film’s commercial prospects, as it bombed at the box office). However, The Last Temptation of Christ was hardly an empty provocation; while the film deviates from Scripture, it’s a sincere, deeply-felt attempt by Scorsese, a dedicated Catholic, to explore the mysteries inherent in Jesus’ tale – most notably, the grey area between his divinity and his humanity.The Last Temptation of Christ touches on many of the greatest hits from the Gospels, from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount to his Crucifixion. However, in drawing from the novel, Scorsese depicts Christ’s complex relationship with Judas (Harvey Keitel) and provides him with an inner monologue laced with uncertainty and distress over his supernatural visions. Each of the actors speak in their own accents, which lends an immediacy to the proceedings, and the on-location shoot in Morocco makes for a vibrant, mysterious stand-in for ancient Israel. The Last Temptation of Christ is austere, serious moviemaking, and though it isn’t always easy to watch, it’s a brilliant example of Scorsese’s ability make transcendent cinema out of inner tumult.GoodFellas (1990)  96%Release Date: September 19, 1990 – Raging Bull may be Scorsese’s most critically revered film, and The Departed was his biggest commercial success, but Goodfellas is probably his most cultishly adored picture. The tale of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), an Irish-Italian mobster-turned snitch contains one of the most oft-quoted lines of dialogue in any Scorsese film, courtesy of Joe Pesci as the psychopathic Tommy DeVito: “I’m funny how? I mean, funny like I’m a clown? I amuse you?”It’s easy to see why Goodfellas continues to resonate: It’s brilliantly acted, shockingly violent, unnervingly tense, and wickedly funny. It also contains one of Scorsese’s best soundtracks, utilizing the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter” and Derek and the Dominoes’ “Layla” to evocative effect. And once again, Scorsese is brilliant at capturing the distinctive milieus and daily rhythms of the underworld and bonds that form between those who live outside the law.Hill is a Brooklyn kid who’s always dreamed of being a part of the Mafia. His wish comes true when he teams up with such local toughs as DeVito and Jimmy “The Gent” Conway (DeNiro) for a series of burglaries and hijackings. After attempting to recover money from an indebted gambler, many of the wiseguys are sent to prison, where Hill starts dealing drugs to support his family. Upon their release, the gang executes a spectacular heist of money and jewelry from JFK Airport, a crime that breaks the tight bonds of the gang. Hill convinces Conway and DeVito to join him in the drug trade, but soon, the wiseguys’ trust in one another has completely eroded. Based upon true events, Goodfellas feels absolutely authentic, not least because Scorsese is brilliant in depicting the inherent appeal of the gangster life — and its dark consequences.The Age of Innocence (1993)  84%Release Date: October 1, 1993 – After a tense, assured remake of Cape Fear in 1991, Scosese did another U-turn. When it was released in 1993, The Age of Innocence seemed like a radical departure for the director; he took time out from chronicling New York’s gangsters and loners to craft a lush period piece about the city’s society life of the 1870s. However, like many of Scorsese’s other films, The Age of Innocence, based upon Edith Wharton’s novel, explores the social codes of a time and place that govern – and restrict – people’s behavior; Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) are as bound by the conventions of their environs as Charlie and Johnny Boy were in Mean Streets. They may not have the outlets for emotional release afforded Scorsese’s other protagonists, but their passions run just as deep. The result is the director’s prettiest film, and a deeply poignant one.Archer is an upstanding (but questioning) member of New York’s upper crust at a happy point in his life – he’s engaged to beautiful socialite May Welland (Winona Ryder). However, May’s cousin Ellen has just arrived in town, causing a scandal — she was unhappily married in Europe, and rumor has it she had an affair with a commoner. Seeking a divorce from her husband, she consults Archer, an attorney, for advice. Though he’s sympathetic to Ellen and feels she shouldn’t be shunned because of her marital status, Archer asks her to consider the social ramifications of her decision. What follows is a delicate dance between Archer and Ellen, who are powerfully attracted to one another; Archer sees possibilities for happiness with this new woman beyond his humdrum marriage.Scorsese’s pacing is stately, but The Age of Innocence succeeds where many period-pieces fail, showing impeccable period décor as well as passion and, ultimately, bittersweet longing.Casino (1995)  80%Release Date: November 22, 1995 – Upon its release in 1995, critics were somewhat disappointed by Casino. With the focused brilliance of GoodFellas fresh in their minds, many felt Casino was simply a well-crafted yarn that lacked the narrative focus to achieve its ambitious aims. However, seen 15 years later (and endless replays on cable), Casino has aged remarkably well; its telling of Vegas’ Genesis story is complicated, to be sure, but Scorsese deftly balances the historical details with the human drama, and he’s helped immeasurably by excellent performances from Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone (in arguably her greatest performance).Casino is the story of how Las Vegas went from a sleepy desert outpost to a major tourist destination, told primarily through the eyes of Sam “Ace” Rothstein (DeNiro), a master sports handicapper recruited by the mob to manage the Tangiers Casino – and skim as much money as possible. Rothstein is a great success at generating illicit revenue, but his personal life takes a perilous turn when he marries former prostitute Ginger McKenna (Stone) and his old buddy, the violent, impulsive Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is brought in to provide muscle. Soon, Ace is besieged by the FBI, his closest associates, and, eventually, the mob itself.Casino is filled with fly-on-the-wall details about how criminal organizations function – it’s a secret history of one of America’s most iconic cities, and a reminder of the criminality that helped build it. But it’s also a story about how human failings can derail even the most seemingly foolproof of plans.Kundun (1997)  75%Release Date: December 25, 1997 – In The Sopranos, there’s a scene in which a young Mafioso sees Scorsese (played by Anthony Caso) entering a nightclub and shouts, “Marty! Kundun — I liked it!” Coming on the heels of the gangster epic Casino, Kundun took some by surprise, but this biography of the 14th Dalai Lama can be seen as a companion piece with The Last Temptation of Christ. Made in Morocco with a cast of non-professional actors, it’s a devout, patient, gorgeously-shot work — and if it doesn’t delve deeply enough into the inner workings of His Holiness, Kundun provides both a dramatic recreation of the conflict between Tibet and China, as well as a crash course in Buddhist principles and rituals.Kundun begins in 1937, with a group of lamas searching for the latest incarnation of the Dalai Lama. They discover a two-year-old in a farming village near the Chinese border, and the boy is deemed a worthy successor after successfully selecting which items randomly laid on a table belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. The boy grows into his role, with intensive study of Buddhism and a preternatural grasp of political affairs. However, he’s tested when China annexes Tibet; after a few promising meetings with Mao Zedong, the Dalai Lama (played as an adult by Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong) realizes that Tibet’s way of life is under attack.Featuring a moody, evocative score by Philip Glass, Kundun is one of Scorsese’s most visually ravishing pictures, and while it occasionally veers into standard biopic tropes, it’s a reverent, impassioned work. Kundun‘s sympathetic treatment of Tibet irked Chinese authorities, who permanently banned Scorsese and screenwriter Melissa Mathison from entering the country.Gangs of New York (2002)  73%Release Date: December 20, 2002 – After the underrated Paul Schrader collaboration Bringing Out the Dead, Scorsese tackled a long-gestating dream project: Gangs of New York. Loosely based upon Herbert Asbury’s 1928 true crime book of the same name, Gangs was an attempt by one of cinema’s poets of organized crime to explore the roots of American gangsterism — and its inextricable ties with society and government. Set in Civil War-era Manhattan, the movie depicts a city teeming with hatred and violence — Gangs‘ Five Points setting is worlds away from the genteel folks living across town in The Age of Innocence. Costing more than $100 million and clocking in at nearly three hours, Gangs of New York can feel overstuffed, and it sometimes lacks historical context, but it’s always watchable, thanks to the impeccable production design and a gonzo performance from Daniel Day Lewis.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his first performance for Scorsese) stars as Amsterdam, the son of Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), an Irish immigrant gang leader. Vallon is killed in a gang war by Bill “The Butcher” Cutting (Lewis), who leads the virulently anti-immigrant Natives gang. Amsterdam is raised in a home for orphans, but upon his release as a young man, he returns to the Five Points section of New York, where Cutting rules with an iron fist. Amsterdam becomes Cutting’s right-hand man, while secretly planning to kill him. Meanwhile in the mayor’s office, Boss Tweed schemes to employ the gangs’ mutual antipathy to his political advantage. However, forced conscription of Irish immigrants into the Union army threatens to bring New York to a boil. Given that Scorsese had wanted to make this film for decades, his insistence on packing in as many events as possible is understandable, but it can make for a grueling experience. Still, Lewis is mesmerizing to watch, and rarely has a period piece captured an era with such acute attention to detail.Gangs won Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director, but he couldn’t repeat at the Oscars, losing Best Director and Best Picture to The Pianist and Chicago, respectively.The Aviator (2004)  86%Release Date: December 25, 2004 – As the old saying goes, if you’re poor, you’re crazy, but if you’re rich, you’re eccentric. Few lived this maxim quite like Howard Hughes, who was a business tycoon, film producer, aviation pioneer, and germophobic loon. Scorsese’s handsome, sprawling biopic brings Hughes – or at least the idea of the man – to modern audiences. As history, The Aviator is often dubious (and it downplays some of Hughes’ less amusing idiosyncrasies — his enthusiastic, lifelong racism, for instance). However, Like Casino, The Aviator charts a historic moment before American business became more corporatized – when go-for-broke dreamers could change the status quo.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Hughes as a cocksure, free-spending optimist; when we first meet him, he’s ignoring all sensible budgetary concerns to make Hell’s Angels the most spectacular picture possible. He also has a passion for fast airplanes and beautiful women, heedlessly breaking speed records, spearheading grand designs for flying machines, and courting Hollywood stars like Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett). And as the owner of TWA, he’s locked in battle with Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and Pan-Am for control of the airline industry. However, Hughes’ paranoia and obsessive-compulsive behavior contribute to his eroding social stature – by the end of the film, he’s sequestered himself in his private movie theater, terrified of germs and antagonists. Scorsese captures the glamour and ambitious spirit of Hughes’ era, and DiCaprio is outstanding at projecting a boyish recklessness that hardens into madness.If The Aviator whitewashes certain aspects of Hughes’ life, it’s never less than watchable and breezily compelling. And though it didn’t win Best Picture, The Aviator took home five awards on 11 nominations.The Departed (2006)  90%Release Date: October 6, 2006 – For years, Scorsese was to the Oscars what Susan Lucci was to the Daytime Emmys – a perennially deserving runner-up. When The Departed won both Best Picture and Best Director, some surmised that it was not simply because of the quality of the film – it was for the whole of Scorsese’s body of work. Still, if The Departed is a notch below GoodFellas or Raging Bull, it’s still a remarkable picture – an entertaining, complex cat-and-mouse tale that traded the mean streets of New York for South Boston without sacrificing Scorsese’s acute eye for regional detail.A loose remake of the Hong Kong crime drama Infernal Affairs, The Departed is directed with matchless assurance from the man who wrote the rulebook on this kind of picture – and still finding new ways to expand the boundaries. (It should not pass without mention that Scorsese bookended The Departed with two fine rockumentaries: No Direction Home, a mammoth, insightful exploration of Bob Dylan’s early career that aired on PBS, and Shine a Light, an exhilarating live document of the still-spry Rolling Stones).Irish Mafia head Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) has a plan to stay one step ahead of the Boston authorities: utilizing Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who has just graduated from the Massachusetts State Police Academy, as his personal spy. However, the cops have a mole of their own: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), who quickly earns Costello’s trust. Before too long, it becomes apparent that both sides have people on the inside; as a result, Sullivan and Costigan work frantically to root out their counterpart. The Departed is filled with fine performances – Nicholson is at his grouchy, angry best here, and features juicy supporting roles for Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin, to name just a few. But ultimately, The Departed is Scorsese’s triumph – a film with the grit and emotional weight that compares favorably to this cinematic master’s finest work.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"harry","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"director-martin-scorsese"},{"id":"47614189375385","title":"WB Readies \"Batman\" & \"Superman\" Sequels","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})WB Readies \"Batman\" &amp; \"Superman\" Sequelsby Scott Weinberg | February 23, 2006 |  CommentsAccording to Variety, WB is wasting no time in moving ahead with sequel to last year’s \"Batman Begins\" and this summer’s \"Superman Returns.\" Both directors, Christopher Nolan &amp; Bryan Singer, in addition to both leading men, Christian Bale &amp; Brandon Routh, are under contract for the sequels.\"Warner Bros.

It’s not totally uncommon for prestige to pluck a horror performance from the dirt and see it as the radiant flower it is: Ruth Gordon won an Oscar for her eerie turn in Rosemary’s Baby; Bette Davis got a nod for her freaky What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? role; and Jodie Foster, Natalie Portman, and Kathy Bates all took home Oscars for Silence of the Lambs, Black Swan, and Misery, respectively. But even when a horror performance is honored, a whole lot of people twist themselves into knots trying to say a film wasn’t actually horror — Kaluuya was nominated for a Golden Globe in the Musical or Comedy category.Ever since the premiere of Peele’s sophomore feature Us at SXSW, Lupita Nyong’o’s stunning performance as Adelaide and Red — two distinctly different but complementary versions of the same character — has been earning her high praise. Not since Jeremy Irons’ turn in David Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers has an actor in a horror film rendered such a complex psychological study of the self through twinning. Nyong’o’s transformation is physical and visceral and — pretty clearly — the caliber for awards consideration. So Peele kindly settled any debate before it began by tweeting: “Us is a horror movie.”In honor of all the actors who’ve toiled away in horror, either to be forgotten or snubbed, here are 13 horror performances we’ve adored – but which the major awards ignored.Essie Davis in&nbsp;The Babadook (2014)  98%(Photo by ©IFC Midnight)Before Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook premiered in 2014, Essie Davis was best known in America for her roles in The Matrix films and her portrayal of master sleuth Phryne Fisher in Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries (check it out on Netflix – it’s a lot of fun). But grieving single mother Amelia was an opportunity for Davis to shine as a complex, terrifying anti-heroine haunted by a ghoulish children’s book character, and the death of her husband. Davis was so committed to the role that she lost her voice for three days after performing a wrenching 11-second scream on set. She told the Guardian, “It didn’t matter if I looked like s–t and felt like s–t every day, because that’s what it needed.” Her face — often in closeup — is puffy, with wild eyes darting in response to every creak in the house. Amelia is creepy and dangerous, and yet Davis imbues her with a sensitivity that makes her circumstance relatable and that much more horrifying.Toni Collette in&nbsp;Hereditary (2018)  89%When we look back on the scariest mothers of movie history, Toni Collette’s performance as Annie will likely hover around the number-one spot for a long while. Annie is unabashedly selfish with her time and art, quite different from so many of the doting mothers on film who give up their lives for their children. She both has pain and inflicts pain — indicative of the generational trauma of their family — which means she can’t really be boiled down into Good or Bad. Collette slams her whole body and being into this character for a riveting, histrionic performance that lays waste to restraint. Annie’s grief, laughter, and anger show themselves on the screen with Shakesperian levels of gravity and calculated artifice, and no one will soon forget the horrific contortions of Collette’s face as she wails in mourning for the dead. Also, against all odds, Collette somehow finds little slices of humor and humility in Annie. Miraculous. (Miraculous, too, that she was snubbed last awards season.)James McAvoy in&nbsp;Split (2017)  77%How many completely different characters does a guy gotta play in the same movie to get any awards talk? In Split, McAvoy embodies&nbsp;23 separate personalities, ranging from a literal beast who can crawl up walls to a prim, post-menopausal woman in heels and pearls named Patricia. McAvoy said his favorite character of the bunch was actually a 9-year-old boy named Hedwig, who’s got a slight speech impediment and a whole lot of saliva when he talks. In that role, McAvoy chewed up the scenery, shoulders slumped like a bored child, bouncing off the walls with the energy of a kid who’s seen way too many shoot-’em-up movies. McAvoy’s greatest craft trick, however, was in finding the silliness amid the horror, keeping the tension taut throughout those laugh lines, and then searching his way back to a more tender performance as Kevin Wendell Crumb, a broken man lost in his many identities.Nicolas Cage in&nbsp;Mandy (2018)  90%(Photo by © RLJE Films)It’s no secret that Nicolas Cage is known for throwing himself deeply into his roles, creating a kind of fun dance of them, seeing how far he can take the character with spontaneous emotional outbursts. Too many filmmakers simply rely on that Cage-iness when they cast him in their movies, but director Panos Cosmatos offered the actor real motivation with the character of devoted and then heartbroken Red Miller, whose quiet, sensitive side embraces his love, Mandy, with all his heart, before she is brutally ripped from him. Despite Cage’s character having to smelt his own battle axe, Cage himself is actually appropriately restrained and then only unhinged in rare moments when the narrative calls for it, but every emotion is grounded in grief and then wild and painful revenge. Cage co-star Andrea Riseborough as Mandy deserves more than a mention here, as well, having delivered an equally stellar performance that ranges from philosophical monologues to maniacal laughter.Betty Gabriel in&nbsp;Get Out (2017)  98%Betty Gabriel was filming a low-budget action movie called Beyond Skyline when co-star Frank Grillo recommended her for a role in Blumhouse’s The Purge: Election Year. Word had it that Jordan Peele was going to direct his debut feature and was looking to fill out a couple of roles. Gabriel showed up, and the rest is history. As housekeeper Georgina, Gabriel locates the heart of this supporting character — both the woman she was and the new woman who’s inhabiting her body. In one pivotal scene, her voice quakes as she says, “No. No-no-no-no-no-no,” her eyes — filled with tears — at odds with the smile on her face, as though she’s a dummy puppet and either part is being manipulated by a different puppeteer. This chasm in Georgina’s personality becomes her central tension and the source of so many skin-crawling scenes, with the underlying message that the scariest thing is not knowing yourself.Gong Yoo in&nbsp;Train to Busan (Busanhaeng) (2016)  94%Yeon Sang-ho’s ultra-violent zombie action film earned a place in America’s hearts, not just because of its thrilling and bloody chase sequences, but because it’s really the story about a father’s sacrifice for his child. Gong Yoo plays Seok-woo, a busy, divorced dad whose young daughter has asked him to take her to be with her mother in Busan. Before he even gets on the fateful train with the girl, he already feels like a failure, unable to properly show love. Gong Yoo’s performance of this sad dad finding his way grounds an otherwise flighty narrative. Even in busy action sequences populated by hundreds of zombified extras, Yoo exudes a kind of nervous strength focused singularly on the survival of his daughter. Sang-ho also includes another dad in the film, Sang-hwa, played by Ma Dong-seok, who offers an extremely complementary performance to Yoo’s, displaying a kind of earnest courage, which Yoo feeds off of for the transformation of his character.Tony Todd in&nbsp;Candyman (1992)  75%(Photo by ©TriStar Pictures)Who can make you jump out of your skin and also yearn for his fateful embrace? The candyman can! Tony Todd’s presence in this frightfully ridiculous story rises above the material. The convoluted urban fairy tale features Todd as its boogeyman, called from his grave when his name is said in the mirror three times. Todd said he was immediately taken with the role, despite some misgivings around race in the story, simply because the imagery of gore in the city was something he hadn’t seen before. In 2015, he told IGN: “I’ve always wanted to find my own personal Phantom of the Opera.” That desire is evident in Todd’s melodrama and theatricality. He embodies and flaunts the grotesque, a mythically imposing figure with sweeping grand gestures that become impossibly romantic — even though the Candyman’s got a rib cage of bees! Todd’s resonant voice, wide smile, and mesmerizing eyes add up to one tempting, unforgettable villain.Jeff Goldblum in&nbsp;The Fly (1986)  92%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp. )It’s galling that, at first, the studio couldn’t see Jeff Goldblum as Seth Brundle, the brilliant scientist destroyed by his own teleportation creation. But perhaps they didn’t know that Goldblum would work out like a madman and drink coffee every waking minute of his days to embody the maniac his character would become — the Brundlefly. Cronenberg knew. As Brundle, Goldblum’s natural charisma perfectly matches Geena Davis’ Veronica, a journalist who’s come out to a stranger’s apartment to check out his weird machines. Veronica’s inquisitiveness puzzle-pieces together with Brundle’s excitement, and the two settle into a lovely, if short-lived, romance. Where Goldblum shines is when he transforms into a wild man capable of snapping off a strongman’s arm in a bar. In one scene, the actor ad-libbed an entire caffeine-fueled, buzzy monologue about philosophy and science while Davis played off his energy as the straight-man. Even under pounds of goopy makeup, Goldblum makes his Brundlefly a sympathetic monster of circumstance.Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie in&nbsp;Carrie (1976)  93%Director Brian De Palma was adamant that Carrie’s telekinetic outbursts were simply about teenaged angst, but young actor Sissy Spacek latched onto the idea that Carrie was “really about a young girl who is an artist who just wants to be normal,” and that the girl dreamed of expressing herself through poetry one day, but her fascist mother took it away from her. Spacek’s mythology of her character was so deep that De Palma at times just let her run off with the role, while he focused on specific shots. Her mannerisms equally evoke an innocent naïf and an all-powerful goddess, and her performance is matched only by that of Piper Laurie, who didn’t at first understand what would be required of her from the script, until she read it with the eyes of Lady Macbeth. The result of Laurie’s work is an unrivaled whites-of-her-eyes performance of Biblical intensity, glimmers of it present in Toni Collette’s Annie of Hereditary.Mia Farrow in&nbsp;Rosemary's Baby (1968)  96%Though Ruth Gordon was honored by the Academy Awards for her part as the nosy neighbor attempting to lure Rosemary into an orgy with the devil, Mia Farrow sadly was not, despite the arc of her emotions anchoring this nightmarish tale. Director Roman Polanski himself said he didn’t really have to direct her. He trusted her to come to these emotions herself, and he didn’t pre-plan or storyboard any shots, instead watching how Farrow approached the scene and setting up around that. Rosemary transforms from shy, childlike cheerleader wife to pregnant paranoid prisoner of a cult. The way she&nbsp;moves between gullibility and strength becomes so relatable, while the gaslighting becomes more and more absurd — an accurate, if frightening, portraiture of a woman at the whims of her man and the devil he’s made a deal with. Her performance is so affecting that the calm and resolute demeanor she strikes when she’s made peace with her destiny is both surprising and inevitable.Isabelle Adjani in&nbsp;Possession (The Night the Screaming Stops) (1983)  87%(Photo by Courtesy the Everett Collection)Three words: Subway tunnel scene. Andrzej Zulawski’s tale of an unearthly sex monster who’s taken hold of a Berlin housewife turns into high art because of Isabelle Adjani’s dedication to self-annihilation over the course of the film. Here, she plays Anna, one half of a marriage that’s suddenly imploding in hysteria and intrigue. Anna’s husband, played by an impeccable Sam Neill, attempts to search out where and with whom she’s been spending her time. When she is in the house, she’s erratic, cutting herself and her husband with an electric knife, eyes possessed. But in that tunnel scene is where the audience gets the full indication of how much Anna’s body is not her own, as Adjani flagellates herself with a milk carton, ramming her tiny frame into the tile walls, bathing in the spilled milk as though she’s communing with a higher, violent spirit. She barks and gasps with laughter until her body erupts with blood and green goop, and, holy wow, is it unnerving.Linda Blair in&nbsp;The Exorcist (1973)  83%Linda Blair earned an Oscar nomination for her role as possessed little Reagan, thank God, but lost out to another young actor, Tatum O’Neil, in the Supporting Actress category. Famously, writer William Blatty blasted George Cukor for leading a campaign to denigrate horror films as undeserving of an Academy Award, but Blair’s performance lives on, award or not. As the lovable Reagan (pre-possession), she gleams with innocence and precociousness, which makes that moment when she stands with blank eyes, cursing her mother’s fancy guests and urinating on the carpet, so shocking. The emotional flexibility it takes for a child to then be strapped to a bed, globbed with green makeup, hurling incredible insults at adults, is otherworldly, not to mention the physicality required of her to constantly thrash on the bed and yank at the straps on her wrists and ankles. Oh, lord, and then there’s the crucifix… We’ll just say it’s a tour de force performance most adult actors wouldn’t have the maturity to do, let alone a child.Jack Nicholson/Shelley Duvall in&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shining (1980)  84%Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall as Jack and Wendy Torrance are two sides of a terrifying coin. Jack is all action, while Wendy is reaction, their push and pull and friction grinding this film into brutal horror. One gets the sense that Nicholson was born to play his role of a sadistic alcoholic narcissist who blames his wife and children for his writerly failures, even though they’ve uprooted their lives to fulfill his dream of finally getting some free time to work on that novel. Nicholson is wild-eyed and untethered, some of his greatest lines (“Here’s Johnny!”) resulting from a multitude of takes meant to wear the actors down into lunacy. Duvall embodies pure, unadulterated fear, lip quivering, earth quaking beneath her. Nicholson’s performance lives on for its horror only because Duvall can deliver the uncertainty and panic, her arms limply but dutifully swinging a baseball bat at an approaching monster Wendy always knew lurked beneath.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"sequels, Tyler, heist, Netflix, Creative, of, DC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"major-awards-need-to-stop-ignoring-incredible-horror-performances"},{"id":"47614201302944","title":"RT Interview: Gus van Sant and Dustin Lance Black on Milk","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})RT Interview: Gus van Sant and Dustin Lance Black on MilkThe director and writer tell RT about the journey to screen for the biopic.by Rich Cline | January 22, 2009 |  CommentsGus Van Sant and Dustin Lance Black look rather exhausted at this stage in their publicity whirlwind for Milk. The day RT sits down with them, the film has just received four BAFTA nominations, including one for Lance’s original script. The jetlag seems to be getting to them, but they perk up when they start talking about Harvey Milk and their very different journeys into this project.Milk is an interesting companion piece to Rob Epstein‘s Oscar-winning documentary The Times of Harvey Milk, which is credited as a key reference.Dustin Lance Black: It was an inspiration because of a speech that’s in it, and I heard that when I was in college. I’m from San Antonio, Texas, and Harvey says, “There’s a kid out there in San Antonio who’s going to hear my story and it’s going to give him hope.” And it’s true – it really did do that. I’d heard of Harvey about six years before that, from a theatre director who told me his story, and it was a revelation to me that there was such a thing as an out gay man, much less one who was elected to public office and celebrated. You don’t have that in Texas!But it’s tough to do a comparison between the films. The thing I wanted to do in the script was get much more personal. The documentary doesn’t have most of the stories that I was drawn to. It doesn’t have Cleve Jones’ story, which is a father-son story, which I related to the most. And it doesn’t have Scott Smith and Harvey’s story. It doesn’t have Jack Lira. It doesn’t have any of the actual love stories. But it has the political framework, which is great. And the most transformative time in Harvey’s life was that political time, so obviously both Rob Epstein and I were drawn to that. I just thought it was an opportunity to get more into the personal stories – of what it was to be gay in that transformative time. In narrative I can take liberties and create that; in documentary maybe there wasn’t the material there to dive into those stories. To me it felt like there was more to be told.How did you get in contact with the people from Harvey’s life?DLB: It was a challenge. It was unfinanced, and there was no movie or book to base it on, because I didn’t have the rights to anything. But also it was a great opportunity, because I was forced to make those drives to San Francisco to meet all the real people. It started with Cleve Jones in 2004, because a friend introduced me to him and he started telling me the stories. He’s very candid, so he didn’t tell me the stories that would lionise Harvey or make him into a saint, but stories of a failed businessman who really messed up his relationships. And that humanised him in the kind of way that said to me, “Hey you can make a movie out of this!” Because if it’s just pure hagiography, who cares? You want to know that a real human being who’s kind of like you could achieve these things.Next were Danny Nicoletta and Anne Kronenberg – meeting all of his allies – and then I moved on to meeting his political foes. It was difficult at first because these people had been told that a movie was going to be made for two decades, but it never happened. They’ve been sharing these stories, but they aren’t easy stories. It’s entertaining, beautiful and moving for us, but for them it’s incredibly painful. So once that dam broke and they did trust me enough to share, then a lot of people came out of the woodwork. I was just trying to build a history and get a sense of a man who I could never meet – and you can get that by talking to the people who he shaped, because they were so young back then.Gus, you’ve been living with this project for quite a lot longer.Gus van Sant: Well, I was involved in the other project, which was in 1992. Oliver Stone had attached himself to a project that producers Neil Meron and Craig Zaden had begun with Randy Shilts’ book The Mayor of Castro Street. It’s a pretty grand book – it’s a grand story and there’s a cast of lots of characters, with tens of thousands of people marching in the streets. It’s the birth of the “out” part of gay history, and at the centre is Harvey becoming a more out person, and his rallying cry to come out. And then Oliver joined on and it was like the jackpot: Oliver Stone, major Academy Award-winning films from Platoon to Wall Street. JFK was about to come out, and he was developing this script – it was edgy and hard-hitting and it was backed by $40 million from Warner Bros. And Robin Williams was going to play the role.Then when JFK came out, Oliver decided he wasn’t going to do it. I don’t know what his other projects were – he might have had 10 other things in development at Ixtlan, his production company. So the studio was in an awkward place because they’d had one of the biggest guys. They did go to Ron Howard, because he told me, and Coppola, Spielberg – well, I would have if I was them. Then one day I was meeting with Rob Epstein socially – we’d met on the festival circuit in ’84 – and he told me Oliver had just dropped out of the film. I didn’t know there was a film – I didn’t even know there was a book! I’d seen Rob’s film about Harvey, and he was saying, “Oliver dropped out and they’re looking for a director – you should do it!” And when I told Warner Bros I might be interested in being considered, I was all of a sudden pushed in.GVS: Oliver was a big supporter of my work, and I think that what was going on was that Oliver was looking at me as a compatriot, someone he respected as a director, whereas at Warner Bros, the executives and the producers, were looking at my demographic. I’d made Drugstore Cowboy, which made $5 million, and My Own Private Idaho, which made $15 million, which was pretty good, but I was a low-budget filmmaker. I hadn’t made a big-budget film, and in Hollywood there’s a sort of man and boys situation. You’re a man, you make $80 million movies! As if it’s harder to make an $80 million movie. Well, I guess businesswise it is because you have more executives to argue with.DLB: Well, the meals are better!GVS: Yeah! But making a $3 million film is a different business. So I lasted about one draft. I didn’t really have the support, not for any real reason, but my ideas were like, “This doesn’t look like a gay movie because they don’t look gay, they don’t kiss, nothing happens to signify that they are gay.” And I was met with, “You don’t understand why this is an important thing.” They just wanted me to do Oliver’s script, which was really asking the question: why did Dan White shoot these guys? That was really the theme. Harvey was the guy he shot, and he happened to be from the Castro, but Harvey wasn’t the central character – it was about the overall begging question, which is a big begging question. So that’s where I was.Are the studio – and the public – more ready for a film like this now, with its more emotional approach?GVS: Yeah I think there’s a lot of that. The media has gone through lots of things that make it a less foreign thing to have your lead character be gay. I think Ellen helped changed that.DLB: I think society has opened, but we’re now in a post-Aids, gay rights era. We’re talking about rights again instead of survival. And so that’s starting to sound more like Harvey’s era. So it feels like it’s a part of the dialog of today. And in that way I think the public is ready to discuss this again.How did you feel about the parallels between Prop 8 last November and 1978’s Prop 6?GVS: There was no indication that was going to happen, at least not while we were shooting. And also, Barack Obama wasn’t the candidate, and Sarah Palin didn’t exist. All this stuff happened during our editing period: the world began to resemble some things in our movie. Obama, because he used the word “hope” so much, started to resemble Harvey and especially his hope speech. And Sarah Palin because she just looked like Anita Bryant.DLB: And sounded like her! But there were clues when I started writing. Because it was 2004, so you had the re-election campaign of George W Bush and the Karl Rove strategy with the language of it sounding so much like Anita Bryant and the “save our children” campaign, bolstering their base through fuelling this fight between evangelicals and the gay community. We started hearing the same lines that I was looking at in my research!You’re working together on a film of Tom Wolf’s 1968 book about Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. This subject is also getting the doc approach, and I know you’ve been in contact with Alex Gibney about his project.GVS: He’s a lot further ahead with his film than we are. He’s incredible, and his filmmaking’s incredible. But Lance is writing our script, and I haven’t seen it.DLB: Yeah, I’ve got to go now – I’ve got to get back to work! I have a draft, I just haven’t had a chance to work on it in like two weeks.Have you taken the same approach as with Milk, interviewing the real people?DLB: Yeah. You have to kind of act like there’s not a book, at least for a bit, and just discover the story yourself. But the book is wonderful, a great thing to guide you. When we finally get done with these press interviews for Milk, hopefully I can find two hours to read it head-to-toe with no break – to read it like it’s the movie. It’s that far along, but then we’ll see what Gus says.Milk opens in UK on Friday and in Australia on 29th January. It’s out now in the US.

Pictures)There are few horror sequels that live up to their predecessors, and even fewer third installments that manage to prove their worth. Of the latter, there is one that stands tall and surpasses expectations, despite the fact that the movie that spawned it is widely considered one of the greatest horror movies of all time, not to mention one of the few that was ever nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.We’re talking, of course, about The Exorcist III, written and directed by William Peter Blatty (author of the original Exorcist novel and screenplay) and set 17 years after the end of the first film, completely ignoring everything that happened in the famously panned Exorcist II: The Heretic.&nbsp;In contrast to that critical and commercial failure, The Exorcist III successfully pays respect to its originator without drowning in nostalgia and features legendary actors at the top of their game, all while&nbsp;delivering a top notch mystery and quite possibly the best jump scare in horror history.To celebrate the film’s 30th anniversary, grab your crucifix and comically oversized scissors and hear us out while we explain why The Exorcist III deserves to be held up as a horror classic, just like the original.IT FEATURES POWERHOUSE PERFORMANCES FROM A LEGENDARY CAST(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)At the&nbsp;center of The Exorcist III&nbsp;is a series of grisly murders eerily similar to the those of a serial killer who died 15 years prior to the events of the film. It’s a surprisingly intimate and grounded plot, considering the franchise’s previous reliance on supernatural phenomena. Our main entry point into this story is Lieutenant William Kinderman, a minor character from the first Exorcist, here played by George C. Scott. Right out of the gate, The Exorcist III places a bigger focus on characters and realistic dialogue than&nbsp;typical horror film conventions.Scott’s Kinderman spends just as much time thinking about and working on the murders as he does bantering with his good friend, Father Dyer (Ed Flanders). William Peter Blatty’s dialogue feels lived-in and, enhanced by Flanders’ calm and warm delivery and Scott’s perfectly sarcastic, curmudgeonly line readings, makes&nbsp;viewers feel as if they’re eavesdropping on real conversations between old friends. Even as the film’s plot grows increasingly dark and spiritual, the actors make the story feel like part of daily life, as if it all actually happened.THE&nbsp;VILLAIN IS&nbsp;HANNIBAL-ESQUE(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Even when&nbsp;The Exorcist III introduces its villain, who may or may not be the re-animated corpse of a priest possessed by the aforementioned serial killer,&nbsp;the film&nbsp;keeps it grounded by focusing on what’s been said and how it’s said, rather than what actually happens. Brad Dourif&nbsp;conjures up a masterful performance as the so-called Gemini Killer, menacing his way through vile, gnarly monologues a year before Anthony Hopkins enraptured audiences with the same methods in The Silence of the Lambs.Indeed, the short but crucial&nbsp;time Dourif spends on screen is reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter’s presence in Silence, but Dourif separates his performance from Hopkins by playing more into the violence his character represents. He is nearly lyrical in his voice, transforming from casual and even funny to homicidal in mere seconds. The director’s cut of the film goes even further, offering&nbsp;not one but two uniquely different yet equally enthralling performances by Dourif. While&nbsp;he alternates with&nbsp;Jason Miller, who reprises the Father Karras role from the first Exorcist here,&nbsp;in his scenes from the theatrical cut, really playing into the violence that lurks within Gemini, the director’s cut presents a much more restrained performance that keeps the audience guessing whether they’re seeing an actual serial killer or a mere madman who’s been psychologically affected by a near-death experience.IT EXPLORES RELIGION AND MORALITY IN AN INCREASINGLY SECULAR WORLD(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)If the first Exorcist was a film about reconnecting with religion in the face of adversity, then The Exorcist III is all about turning one’s back on spirituality, about the way madness becomes an invitation to evil. Indeed, Kinderman spends as much time talking to his friend Dyer about the movies he loves as he does questioning the existence of a loving, Christian God in the face of suffering, disease, and murder.The film is constantly looking at characters who have experienced severe trauma and who have gone through crises of faith during the events of the first Exorcist, and explores the Catholic guilt they’re struggling with. Kinderman often wonders if he’s done enough — enough to save Father Karras 15 years ago, enough to stop the killings he’s investigating, enough to protect his family and friends.For most of its runtime, The Exorcist III remains somewhat ambiguous as to whether there’s anything supernatural going on. The director’s cut in particular leaves the question of the Gemini Killer’s identity a secret, and it completely redefines the film’s ending, depending on how you view it. Is this an act of the devil, or simply human evil? To that end, the film’s ending becomes not about embracing religion again, but about a man who — in the face of utter defeat — decides not to wait for a higher power to come down and help him, but to take back control, even if it costs him everything. Evil exists, the movie argues, but it’s up to us to keep that evil at bay, because there may just not&nbsp;be an equal force of good to counteract it.IT FEATURES ONE OF THE BEST JUMP SCARES EVER PUT ON FILMIn a surprising move for a 1990s horror film, The Exorcist III features relatively little gore, and it still manages to be utterly terrifying. The film takes more of a David Fincher-styled approach to horror, using noir tropes and filmmaking sensibilities to manipulate&nbsp;the audience’s imagination and build and maintain tension. The characters in the film&nbsp;discuss every graphic detail of the murder scenes, but we never really see them. In one monologue, the Gemini Killer explains that the human head can still process what it sees for 20 seconds after it’s been decapitated, and he uses that time to show his victims their own lifeless bodies. It’s both horrific and effective, without spilling a drop of blood on screen.And yet,&nbsp;none of this compares to the single scene that has arguably become more well known than the film itself — the hospital jump scare.&nbsp;Most of the film’s legacy lies with this single scene, which is widely considered one of the best jump scares in history, and for good reason. Throughout the film, Blatty keeps his filmmaking restrained, with few camera movements. He lingers on seemingly inconsequential backgrounds, emphasizing the emptiness surrounding the characters, as he does in this scene, keeping the camera trained on a nondescript hospital hallway. Blatty raises the tension through stillness rather than with sound, making the audience wait just long enough before finally breaking the silence and releasing the tension with a shocking jump scare that works no matter how many times you see it. It’s the same approach that The Conjuring films have employed, only done decades earlier, and it remains one of the most effective scares ever produced.There are many reasons why The Exorcist is still considered one of the greatest horror films of all time, and there are valid reasons why The Exorcist III doesn’t reach the same heights. But there is no denying the sheer ambition in William Peter Blatty’s film, and the choices he made&nbsp;managed to turn an intimate, small-scale story into a horror classic in its own right.Where You Can Watch It NowFandangoNOW (rent/own), Amazon Prime (streaming),&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;(rent/own), Peacock (free with ads), tubi (free with ads), Vudu&nbsp;(rent/own)The Exorcist III&nbsp;was released on August 17, 1990.#1The Exorcist III (1990) 59%#1Adjusted Score: 61.379% Critics Consensus: The Exorcist III is a talky, literary sequel with some scary moments that rival anything from the original.Synopsis: The second sequel to the landmark 1973 horror film The Exorcist, this horror outing has little to do with the...

It might have been on a Law and Order rerun, or maybe it was when he announced on The Tonight Show that he’s running for president!After much speculation that Thompson would declare his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination via his website or in New Hampshire, the former Tennessee senator and noted character actor dropped the candidacy bomb on Jay Leno’s show — and the audience burst into applause. Although some political pundits questioned his choice of venue — a few feel that The Tonight Show is not a serious political setting — it worked pretty well for Arnold Schwarzenegger, seeing how he ended up being the governor of California and all.Thompson joins the ranks of the Governator, Clint Eastwood, and, oh yeah … former President Ronald Reagan (looking Fresh at a career-spanning 70 percent on the Tomatometer, baby!) as familiar Hollywood faces trying their hand at the world of politics. And although Thompson’s profile in the acting game may not be as high as the others in the bunch, he’s a recognizable character actor who often plays gruff authority figures; Thompson’s fans can easily imagine him in a presidential role.Thompson’s Hollywood résumé is full of well-known films, such as In The Line of Fire (currently at 97 percent on the Tomatometer), Cape Fear (77 percent), and Die Hard 2: Die Harder (64 percent), and some not-terribly-beloved movies like Baby’s Day Out (23 percent) and Iron Eagle 3: Aces (at a robust zero percent). Senator Thompson has most recently been in the spotlight as the district attorney on Law and Order, and is one of only four actors to play the same character in all of the Law and Order series.Only time will tell if Thompson’s campaign will catch fire like the plane in Die Hard 2, but RT will keep you posted along the way.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Photos, monster, serial, archives, movies, Shudder, Video, Elton, Nominations, cinemax","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"fred-thompson-announces-candidacy-for-the-republican-presidential-nomination"},{"id":"47614206875554","title":"Three Great Character Actors Gone in One Sad Weekend","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Three Great Character Actors Gone in One Sad Weekendby Scott Weinberg | February 28, 2006 |  CommentsThe traditional logic that says \"famous people always die in threes\" was backed up with a vengeance this past weekend as we lost a trio of talented, prolific, and well-admired character actors. Don Knotts, Darren McGavin, and Dennis Weaver all passed away over the weekend, which is sad news for movie fans the world over. We take solace in the fact that each man was more than 80 years of age when he died, and also that they all left behind a whole lot of movie-land memories.Although best known as Barney Fife on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and as Ralph Furley on \"Three’s Company,\" Don Knotts was certainly no stranger to the silver screen. Following his debut in 1958’s \"No Time for Sergeants,\" Don went on to appear in a string of comedies with titles like \"The Incredible Mr. Limpet\" (1964), \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\" (1966), and \"The Reluctant Astronaut\" (1967). Mr. Knotts appeared in a string of Disney comedies in the 1970s, including \"The Apple Dumpling Gang\" (1975), \"Gus\" (1976), and \"Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\" (1977). He also contributed a memorable supporting turn in 1998’s \"Pleasantville\" and just last year delivered a rather amusing voice performance in Disney’s \"Chicken Little.\" The lovable comedian passed away at the age of 82.Also best known for his work on the small screen (especially as \"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\"), celebrated character actor Darren McGavin put together an impressive big-screen reumé as the decades ticked by. Veteran of dozens of TV productions, Mr. McGavin is probably most beloved by moviegoers as the befuddled father figure in 1984’s \"A Christmas Story,\" although he also added a rascally spark to films like \"The Natural\" (1984), \"Raw Deal\" (1986), \"Dead Heat\" (1988), and \"Billy Madison\" (1995). Mr. McGavin was a few months shy of his 84th birthday when he passed away.After working mainly in Westerns throughout the 1950s and ’60s, Dennis Weaver had a career jolt in 1971 by starring in a TV movie that was written by Richard Matheson and directed by a first-timer named Steven Spielberg. \"Duel\" has since gone on to become a certifiable cult classic, thanks in large part to Mr. Weaver’s stellar performance as a mild-mannered nobody who’s pursued across the desert by an evil giant truck. Although the actor chose to stick mainly with television fare, he also did some fine work in films like \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), \"The Gallant Hours\" (1960), and \"Duel at Diablo\" (1966). Mr. Weaver was also 83 when he died.(The pic is from \"Hot Lead and Cold Feet\" (1978), one of two Disney comedies in which Don Knotts and Darren McGavin co-starred. The other was \"No Deposit, No Return\" (1976).

Sure, not every prediction came true; Jaws 19 has yet to be released, teenagers aren’t pulling&nbsp;their pants pockets inside out, and the Cubs still&nbsp;haven’t won the World Series (though they’re in the National League Championship Series at the moment). We couldn’t help but wonder: what did film critics of 1989 think of the futuristic Hill Valley? We dug deep into the archives to find out.&nbsp;“The different visions of alternate times and realities are imaginatively staged with intricate sets and slick visual techniques. The best of them is a Hill Valley dominated by Biff, who has used his ill-gotten information about the outcome of sporting events to amass a fortune. He’s become a nightmarish (more nightmarish?) version of Donald Trump, converting the town into a neon-lit casino town ruled by greed and power.” — Gary Thompson, Philadelphia Daily News, Nov. 22, 1989&nbsp;“I also liked the portrait of what 2015 might be like; among other predictable things, Jaws 19 is playing at the local movie theater.” — David Sterritt, Christian Science Monitor, Dec. 4, 1989&nbsp;“The future brings a Black &amp; Decker hydrator oven that in seconds turns a three-inch disk into a hubcap-size pizza, and A.T.&amp; T. provides video phone calls complete with vital statistics about the person who’s calling.” — Janet Maslin, New York Times, Nov. 22, 1989&nbsp;“A theme-park-like future awaits. Conceived by an army of set designers, special effects wizards and costumers, the suburban paradise of 1985 California has become a popsicle-colored landscape filled with mellow moppets and refugees from the post-apocalypse of The Road Warrior. Don’t worry, you can still pick up your USA Today on any street corner.” — Rita Kempley, Washington Post, Nov. 22, 1989“From the standpoint of the preview audience, the neatest thing about Back to the Future Part II are those super-bad future-shoes worn by Michael J. Fox when he drops in on his hometown in the year 2015.

Based on true events and told in documentary fashion, the movie uses a collage of digital media to portray the heinous crime up-close and personal, giving audience members every reason to look away but also, by doing so, asking us why it’s taken so long to cringe.De Palma’s film presents the conflict through every facet available to us, the civilian viewers. His patchwork story expertly addresses the Iraq conflict on its own terms, using the war’s own visual language: a soldier’s video diary is interwoven with a French documentary about military check points, which gets mixed in with Arab TV broadcasts, security camera footage from the army base, internet blogs by wives of the enlisted, webcam chats, recordings of judicial inquisitions, clips posted online by terrorists, YouTube rants, and a slew of still images (which ultimately give real-life footnotes to the fictionalized events). The complex style of Redacted feels like a Google search for “Iraq, war crimes.” This hyper-abundance of accessible media shows that the horrifying war is not just taking place on the ground in Iraq, but also, literally, in the terrain of cyberspace; a place where everyone with a homepage is a resident, and where the rules of engagement are still being written.Yet despite this daring strategy, the response to Redacted has been ambivalent. Critics, who currently give the film a 57 percent Tomatometer rating, point to flaws in the dramatic logic and a few misjudged performances. But similar problems plague most movies, and these mistakes do not detract from the emotional impact of Redacted or tarnish the film’s craftsmanship in any way. When was the last time you saw a movie with a fifteen-minute shot, handheld, at night, that exposes the true nature of every main character? To disparage Redacted for technical reasons is to miss — or, perhaps, to willfully avoid — its rich, textured, and honest depiction of how the Iraq war is being waged for an audience.Checkpoint tedium in RedactedIn short, De Palma has made a movie that could only exist in the 21st century, about a war that could only be waged in the 21st century. Whatever missteps in direction he has taken do not indicate a flagging talent but instead reveal that, in this warp speed wireless world, the direction has yet to be defined. If we don’t fully understand Redacted — in other words, if it’s a difficult film for us to read — then that’s because the narrative language remains incomplete. But by risking a new filmmaking vocabulary, De Palma has begun to create the cinetax.Rotten Tomatoes recently spoke with Brian De Palma about modern warfare, surfing the web, and how video games might just be the vanguard of storytelling.People who attend Redacted expecting to see a “Brian De Palma film” are going to be surprised by how different it is from your previous work — I certainly was. What about this subject matter made you alter your style so significantly?Brian De Palma: I discovered the form while I was researching the material. I was approached by HDNet to make one of their 5 million dollar movies, on anything I wanted. The only requirement was that it be shot in high definition, and I thought that was great, if I could figure out something that would work best in that medium. When I read about this incident that was so similar to the events in Casualties of War (1989) I did some research on the internet and I came up with all these unique forms where people were expressing themselves in relationship to this incident, and the war in general. That became the shape of the movie. It was a unique way of presenting the material in a format that was interesting to me because it’s a whole new way of creating a storyline in this kind of fragmented mock-documentary. My initial idea was to use as much real material as possible, but of course the lawyers told me I couldn’t use it because it was too close to the real case, so I was forced to fictionalize everything. I relied very much on the characters in Casualties of War, not knowing much about the actual soldiers except for the prime instigator. There wasn’t much information about them. They were all being prosecuted while I was making this movie.RedactedRedacted rings very strongly of truth, so even if you had to change the facts, it’s one of those stories that’s very familiar to people who get up every morning and read the headlines. But it goes much further than that, with all the different points of view that you include, each with its own voice. How did you develop this tapestry?De Palma: It all emerged from my research. My first task was to get the news stories about the actual case, but since I couldn’t use the real news stories I had to fabricate ones using international correspondents who were in Amman, where we shot. So I basically duplicated the original news stories. That was the beginning. Then I read somewhere about this Los Angeles-based Spanish-American filmmaker making a movie from his war diaries to get into NYU Film School — that was based on something I stumbled upon on the web. I realized that this could provide my principle narrative. And, of course, that idea also comes out of the documentaries I looked at where there were soldiers with cameras recording what’s going on, because everyone has a camera over there. I saw all that in the documentaries. Then the attitudes, and the feelings, and frustrations, and the passion about the war, all those were expressed in the soldiers’ blogs, and in many independent documentaries that I looked at. So the principal narrative form came from Salazar’s personal diary.Then I had all this information I had to convey about what happens at check points, because this particular unit was on a checkpoint and that’s where they saw the girl going in and out every day. There were many, many news stories about accidents at check points and how many people were killed all the time. So I had to present all that information, and I also wanted to slow the movie down. Being deployed in Iraq is incredibly boring most of the time, but then it’s punctuated by incredible, crazy violence from out of nowhere. I had to slow the movie down. That’s why I created the mock French documentary — very elegant, Handel music playing from Barry Lyndon — it slows everything down, and it gets all the statistics across about what happens when people go in and out of check points.The pacing of the movie was extremely effective, with how you gradually build tension for the frantic violence that happens later on. It sounds like your research process was a micro version of what historians will have to do when they look back on this conflict years from now, in terms of synthesizing a gigantic amount of very specific information.De Palma: That’s what surprises me about the people who are shocked by Redacted, or the portrayal of the soldiers, or the pictures at the end of the film — all this material is out there! It’s like they assume I dreamt this up. It’s all there. The problem is, it’s not in your mainstream media, so nobody knows about it. But if you get on your Google search engine and put any of these things in, you’ll come up with all the same devices that I used, including something like the rant of the protestor. That’s one of the few things we were able to buy, actually. That was somebody’s rant. We actually bought the rights to that, and I just rewrote it to be played, and the best person to do it was Abigail Savage. But that’s an actual rant.RedactedIt’s shocking because it’s so familiar, but it’s the stuff that you subconsciously try to forget about, you don’t want to pay attention to it.De Palma: I think not many people are doing the kind of research that I was doing. They’re watching, you know, what happens to Britney when she takes her daughter to some play group. Those are the kind of things that dominate the web, and YouTube, and whatever. You have to dig a little deeper. But all of this stuff is out there.There have been other films recently about the Iraq conflict, such as Jarhead and The Kingdom, but you’ve very intentionally and very effectively adopted a completely different perspective from those: the documentary perspective. Do you feel like a documentary style, for the nature of this war, is the best method for examining it?De Palma: That’s something that I discovered. It’s not like I had a plan. In the process of researching I came up with all these unique ways of expression that are completely indigenous to the web. Nobody’s ever seen this onscreen before. I have another idea to put in this form, but things have changed in the last six months since I wrote it! There are even newer forms that people have not seen yet. There’s all of this new media going on. It’s very interesting to tell these types of contemporary stories in this form.Straight-forward narrative filmmaking essentially would have been Casualties of War, but there’s no point in doing that again. I was quite happy with the different forms that I came up with when I researched the material. And who knows; this may be one experimental film that comes and goes, and we move on to whatever. But I feel that there’s something here, in Redacted, and I want to experiment with it more, because it’s the way that I’ve noticed my daughters take in information. They’re sixteen and eleven, and they sit on their beds with their computers on their stomachs and they browse from thing to thing to thing to thing to thing. They don’t go to the theatre and sit down and watch O’Neil for five hours. That’s not how they’re getting their stories told to them. So, I don’t know where it’s going, but it’s certainly changing.The uncomfortable reactions to the movie must be coming from not only the disturbing subject matter, but also from the fact that it’s a new language. A normal theatergoing audience can’t quite comprehend it yet.De Palma: Exactly correct. To me it’s almost atonal. Suddenly you’re playing atonal music and people don’t know what to make of it. That’s what I noticed when I screened it at the beginning, is people had nothing to say afterwards. Basically they were struck dumb. They couldn’t process the material. Then the first thing, of course, when you don’t understand something, you attack it. “It’s not this, it’s not this, it’s not this.” I’ll never forget the first time I saw Barry Lyndon, I just wasn’t ready to process the way Stanley Kubrick did the movie, and I reacted very strongly against it. The way he told this particular story, with this particular technique. But over the years it’s become one of my favorite movies of Kubrick’s. Once it gets you into the temporal sense, and the pictorial sense, of the period, of the piece, it all makes perfect sense to you. But when you first see it, you go, “Why all these endless shots, why these zoom-ins — what’s going on here?”Like Redacted, Barry Lyndon is also a movie where the filmmaker imposed very stringent technical limitations on himself.De Palma: Exactly correct.Is there any other reason besides your admiration for Barry Lyndon for why you wanted to use the same music in your movie?De Palma: I think what was so instructive about Barry Lyndon was how Kubrick slowed down time; using very classical, measured music, he used very elaborate pull-backs. Of course I didn’t have the beautiful pictorials that he did. You make the audience study the frame; something that I think people have completely forgotten about.RedactedI’d like to dig a little bit deeper, if we can, into what you discovered about the language of digital storytelling. It’s such a new phenomenon, and I think Redacted is one of the few films that really prods at the edges of what’s possible — ultra long takes, handheld consumer cameras, relationships developed over the internet, everyone allowed a voice — it’s fascinating. And the other thing about digital media, which is why this war is a perfect topic for it, is the immediacy and the responsiveness of it. You can produce images like a reflex. That’s the raw nerve that this film strikes.De Palma: It’s a great new way to deal with narrative forms. It’s like things you discover in video games; the way they tell their stories. And of course video games emulate films a lot, and television shows, with their little story sequences within the games. But there was a really big breakthrough when they started to have games where you could approach the world from any place. It didn’t go linearly. It was more like a mosaic. You could discover the story from the north, the south, the east, the west, and I said, “Wow.”I remember when I saw my first video game where it was played from a point-of-view shot. It was Colony and this must have been twenty years ago. I was knocked out by it. I said, “Oh my God.” The players were perceiving all of this space through a point-of-view shot. And of course that’s one of the main building blocks of moviemaking; it’s totally cinematic, it doesn’t exist in any other art form. I’m always fascinated by what the video games are doing. I truly believe that the creative forces in my generation, instead of being filmmakers, they wanted to be game programmers. They’re literally creating spaces and stories. They’re constantly discovering new forms. Every six months there’s a new game where they push the envelope into something else. And this is also very true of the internet. The other day I discovered BloggerTV, where you have two guys talking about a subject, like an iChat, and it’s any topic they want to talk about, like talking heads on television, except it’s a discussion about a specific subject instead of people screaming at each. In any event, all this stuff is changing every day. And as I think about doing another film in this form, I’m constantly amazed at the new things that crop up.Is it a coincidence that you’ve been influenced by video games, and quite often the “video game mentality” of modern warfare is cited? Is that something you brought into the film, this idea of soldiers being trained by virtual simulation and how that might affect their actions on the battlefield?De Palma: Yeah, people say that, but the reality of on-the-ground has nothing to do with a videogame. As soon as soldiers get over to Iraq, they get it real fast. You can play every one of the most violent videogames in the world, and it doesn’t give you a clue about what it’s like to really be deployed in Iraq. A comparison is ridiculous.RedactedAs far as the actors whom you chose to portray the soldiers, none of them will be recognizable faces to an audience, but I thought all of their performances were convincing. Private Flake was an incredibly frightening character.De Palma: It’s interesting that you say that, because that’s one of the main criticisms I get all the time, “Oh, these actors are overacting; they’re a bunch of amateurs.” Ridiculous! I mean, they’re acting in relationship to what situation they’re in. When they’re in barrage, they behave like warriors at the post, because that’s what they’re supposed to look like; that’s how the director wanted them to look, and the actors take on a personae and an acting style appropriate for that form. When they’re being filmed by Salazar, they’re mugging and confused and spontaneous, which is exactly what it’s like if you’re taking a home video. When people react against Redacted so strongly, they don’t understand the context of what the actors are doing. People are used to movies where the actors are always the same because the point of view never shifts. But when you change the form, the acting has to adjust.So instead of a classical “character arc” you were going for a more prismatic study of people.De Palma: Yes, but there’s still very much a sense of character progression. Flake is a little tweaked when he gets over to Iraq, but you can see him sort of changing as the movie goes forth. People just don’t understand how the form affects character presentation.My immediate reaction after seeing the film, and what I did, was to view it a second time. In thinking about why that was, I got the notion that it was almost too much to absorb in one sitting — to learn how to view the film, and then to appreciate it at the same time — and so it resists a sense a resolution.De Palma: The resolution is very much how I feel. I very much identify with McCoy; I feel frustration at not being able to stop the war, of being a participant in it, but being unable to do anything about it, just like McCoy can’t do anything about the girl being raped. He carries that guilt with him. The other thing we’ll be living with for decades is all of these soldiers coming back from Iraq harboring what they’ve been through. It’s going to be like Vietnam but ten times worse. And it’s going to go on for decades. I live near a V.A. hospital in California and I see these guys all the time, wandering around with that aimless stare on their faces, and of course everyone forgets about them. This is going to be going on for decades.Redacted is in limited release this Friday.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"competition, San","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"brian-de-palma-on-redacted-the-rt-interview"},{"id":"47614251397048","title":"\"Shaun\" Gang Warms Up for \"Hot Fuzz\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Shaun\" Gang Warms Up for \"Hot Fuzz\"by Scott Weinberg | March 1, 2006 |  CommentsComingSoon.net pointed us towards a press release at the Working Title Films website, and the good word is this: \"Shaun of the Dead\" veterans Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost will soon be reuniting soon (with one heck of a supporting cast) to produce a cop comedy entitled \"Hot Fuzz.\"\"Working Title is delighted to announce its next production, \"Hot Fuzz,\" an action comedy from Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, co-creators of the hugely successful romzomcom, \"Shaun of the Dead.\"A Working Title production in association with Big Talk Productions, \"Hot Fuzz\" is directed by Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg.A comedy about a London cop who is seconded to deepest, darkest Somerset, the film is from an original screenplay by Wright and Pegg. \"Hot Fuzz\" will be produced by Nira Park (\"Shaun of the Dead\"), Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner and the executive producer is Natascha Wharton.Pegg leads a stellar British cast including Nick Frost (\"Shaun of the Dead\"), Jim Broadbent (\"Moulin Rouge\"), Timothy Dalton (\"The Living Daylights\"), Steve Coogan (\"Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story\") and Martin Freeman (\"The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy\").Says producer Nira Park, \"We’re delighted to once again be joining creative forces with Working Title on this very exciting and very British film.

Both the Chicago Cubs and Cleveland Indians have suffered historic championship droughts — the Indians last won in 1948, while the Cubs’ postseason futility extends all the way back to 1908, and the last time they even made&nbsp;the World Series was 1945. We could contrive a prediction based on advanced stats (though we’re better versed in the Tomatometer than we are in wins above replacement), or we could delve into the superstitions (the Curse of the Billy Goat, the Curse of Rocky Colavito) to determine which franchise is more jinxed. Instead, we’re going to look at the movies that prominently feature both teams in order to forecast the ultimate victor.“I Wish I Could Go Back to the Beginning of the Season, Put Some Money on the Cubs!”At first glance, the Cubs would seem to have the more impressive cinematic legacy. Even non-baseball fans who came of age in the 1980s are likely to remember Ferris catching a foul ball at Wrigley Field in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, or Marty’s astonished reaction to news of a Cubs’ world championship in Back the Future Part II. But let’s delve a little deeper into those scenes, shall we? After years of speculation, Baseball Prospectus writer Larry Granillo concluded that the game that Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane attended was an 11-inning loss to the Braves. And the joke in Back to the Future Part II&nbsp;is that the Cubs are so inept they’d never&nbsp;win the World Series (unless, of course, they were opposed by a nameless American League team with a Miami area code and a jovial alligator mascot).Other examples of the Cubs’ celluloid legacy are similarly discouraging. The team’s earliest appearance on film was the creatively titled World Series Baseball Game, a 1906 documentary about their loss to crosstown rivals the White Sox. The tale of a 12-year-old who joins the Cubs after an arm injury gives him a magical fastball, Rookie of the Year&nbsp;(1993), was pleasant, but it didn’t exactly set the box office or critical community on fire. And in The Break-Up, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston meet at a Cubs game; as you may have guessed from the title, though, they don’t live happily ever after.“They’ve Got Uniforms and Everything! It’s Really Great!”Here’s the reason the Indians are winning the World Series: Major League. This classic tale of a ragtag team of misfits and oddballs remains one of the most beloved of all sports movies. During the dark days of the late 1980s, the Indians were one of the worst teams in all of baseball, and not even stars like Joe Carter, Cory Snider, or Albert Belle could lift them above a .500 winning percentage. Sure, Major League&nbsp;had to create the likes of Pedro Cerrano, Ricky “Wild Thing” Vaughn, and Willie Mays Hayes, but those fictional players were easy to root for, and most importantly, they gave Ohioans a glimmer of&nbsp;hope. The Tribe’s silver screen legacy is slim, but if you ask any random&nbsp;bro in his 30s or 40s to name his favorite sports movies, chances are Major League&nbsp;is near the top of the list.(And let’s just pretend Major League II&nbsp;never happened.)Our Prediction: Cleveland Wins 4-2Sorry, Cubs fans, but based upon our incredibly scientific formula — one that pits the number of cinematic high schoolers playing hooky at the Friendly Confines against the speed of a Ricky Vaughn fastball — it appears you’re gonna have to wait a little longer for that World Series trophy. Let’s just hope it’s not another century.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"live, Nat, Skip, Moore, TruTV, Kimmy, Globe, biography, Month, comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rotten-tomatoes-predicts-the-world-series"},{"id":"47614254454714","title":"New Chucky and The Rock Series Planned","content":"TV Talkvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})New Chucky and The Rock Series PlannedSyfy gives a straight-to-series order for Chucky, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler return as Golden Globes hosts, Dwayne Johnson's new TV show \"Young Rock,\" and more of the day's top TV news.by Whitney Friedlander | January 11, 2020 |  CommentsNBCUniversal’s Saturday lineup at the winter Television Critics Association press tour came with lots of exciting news for critics: The Chucky TV series is happening on Syfy!

One big one is that Syfy has given a straight-to-series order for Chucky, a television show about the cherubic homicidal doll from the Child’s Play movies.According to the press release, the plot follows what happens “after a vintage Chucky doll turns up at a suburban yard sale,” causing “an idyllic American town is thrown into chaos as a series of horrifying murders begin to expose the town’s hypocrisies and secrets.” Plus, it promises “the arrival of enemies — and allies — from Chucky’s past [who threaten] to expose the truth behind the killings, as well as the demon doll’s untold origins as a seemingly ordinary child who somehow became this notorious monster.”Don Mancini, who wrote the 1988 film Child’s Play, created and will show-run this series.

Telegdy told journalists that this investigation is still on-going but he said that “we will put new practices into place, if necessary.”Telegdy was also asked if new vetting policies were put in place after sketch show Saturday Night Live hired and then eventually fired Shane Gillis. The comedian lost his job after journalist Seth Simons and others brought to light his history of saying racist comments on his podcast.The executive said that, while he does think SNL boss Lorne Michaels acted quickly, the incident “was a learning moment for a lot of people.”Still, he added that ““vetting people is very triggering for people who live in a world of free speech and comedy … that it is an enormously fine line and a gray area.”The latest NBC controversies follow other behind-the-scenes drama in recent years, including the ousting of Today show host Matt Lauer due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and NBC News’&nbsp;refusal to air Ronan Farrow’s reporting on Harvey Weinstein that went on to win a Pulitzer Prize and helped spawn the #MeToo movement.PEACOCK ON THE HORIZON(Photo by NBCUniversal)The news that reboots and other iterations of classic shows like Saved by the Bell and Punky Brewster are being developed for upcoming streaming service Peacock instead of NBC has raised eyebrows — and irked quite a few who don’t want to deal with another streamer. Telegdy said this was a studio decision, but “would I do Saved By the Bell again? Hell yeah!”Telegdy also said his programming will appear on Peacock, saying “of course we’ve been working in partnership with them, because it’s called Peacock for a reason.”JIMMY FALLON’S NEW SHOW, NEW AMSTERDAM RENEWAL NEWS, AND MORE(Photo by Andrew Lipovsky/NBC)In the meantime, NBC does have plenty of new and returning shows for you to watch. Telegdy announced Saturday that Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon will also host the network’s new series That’s My Jam. Based on musical segments from Fallon’s late-night show, the comedy variety series will allow celebrities to compete with each other through song and dance. It will premiere during the Tokyo Olympics.NBC renewed New Amsterdam for three seasons, keeping the medical drama on the air at least through the 2022-23 television season, and renewed its successful holiday special event series Ellen’s Greatest Night of Giveaways, from executive producer Ellen DeGeneres, for a new season.The network also ordered&nbsp;10-part global event series The New World from BBC Studios Natural History Unit, which is set to air in 2024.&nbsp;The series&nbsp;will scale across North America, Central America, and South America to explore the vast landscapes, remote wilderness and mysterious creatures&nbsp;of the region.Syfy announced that it is developing limited series The League of Pan, which picks up where Peter Pan left off and follows a group of misfit youths who refuse to grow up. Dominion’s Brian McCauley Johnson is writing.THIS IS US … WANTING MORE(Photo by Ron Batzdorff/NBC)NBC’s press day also included a panel for its tear-jerker family drama This Is Us, where creator Dan Fogelman and the stars provided some teasers.Co-star Sterling K. Brown said the mid-season premiere, which airs January 14, will continue to delve into his character Randall’s “mental health and how he takes care of himself — what’s right and what’s wrong about how he takes care of himself and how he could potentially do a better job of that.” Fogelman added that it will also kick off what those involved with the show call trilogy episodes, meaning that it will connect with subsequent episodes that will deal with Randall’s&nbsp;twin siblings, sister Kate (Chrissy Metz) and brother Kevin (Justin Hartley).As for internet fan theories that the show in its entirety exists in the mind of one of the characters, similar to the reveal at the end of St. Elsewhere, or that it’s actually being told How I Met Your Mother–style with one character retelling the journey to others?“I don’t think we’re going to pull the wool out of what the narrative thread of the story is,” Fogelman said.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Geographic, Extras, 93rd, foreign, Universe, Kimmy, Trophy, globes, Arrangement, psycho, mission:, diversity","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-chucky-and-the-rock-series-planned-more-tv-news"},{"id":"47614235936688","title":"Five Lessons Hollywood Learned from Tim Burton’s Batman (1989)","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Five Lessons Hollywood Learned from Tim Burton's Batman (1989)To mark the 30th anniversary of its release on June 23, 1989, here are five ways Burton’s visionary film about \"a man dressed as a bat\" changed everyone's approach to comic book movies.by Tim Lowery | June 23, 2019 |  CommentsIn the summer of 1989, Batman was everywhere, with its revamped emblem plastered on billboards, T-shirts and bumper stickers, in the windows of toy and comics stores — and hell, even on the drinks at Taco Bell. Likewise, seemingly everyone wanted to see it: Tim Burton’s dark reboot boasted a box-office gross of more than $411 million, making about 11 times its $35 million budget, and earning a cool $100 mil in just 11 days. The PG-13 pic’s appeal was massive, piquing the interest of kiddos (look at that cool new Batmobile!), comic-book nerds, everyday Joes, and even cineastes interested to see how its young director would follow up his goofy (Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure) and gothically gonzo (Beetlejuice) comedies.Yet, despite being Certified Fresh at 71%, Batman is critically bested by its sequel, Batman Returns (78%), its campy ’60s predecessor, Batman: The Movie (78%), The Lego Batman Movie (90%) and, you guessed it, every installment in Christopher Nolan’s trilogy. (It did manage to top Joel Schumacher’s twofer, so… there’s that.) What’s more, Burton himself confessed to Empire in 1992: “I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It’s okay, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.”Let’s agree to disagree. An occasionally messy masterpiece? Sure. But as Batman enters its dirty thirties, here is why we think it still dazzles — and what future franchises can glean from its success.You Don’t Need a Huge Star in the LeadStrictly speaking, Michael Keaton was a star at this point, as the stand-up-turned-actor had held leads in comedies like Mr. Mom and Johnny Dangerously, flexed dramatic chops in Clean and Sober, and wowed in unhinged glory as titular role in Burton’s previous effort, Beetlejuice. But was he near the level of stardom of, say, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, or Kevin Costner, who were all considered to don the Batsuit? Hardly. In fact, fans of the beloved character were so miffed by Keaton’s casting that droves of complaints were mailed to Warner Bros. The seemingly odd choice — he hardly had the build of a superhero, let alone the action-star demeanor some at the studio envisioned — paid off, with Keaton grounding billionaire Bruce Wayne with an everydude charisma and shifting into low-voiced seriousness as Batman, a move informed by Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns (and later used by Christian Bale).Yet Keaton wasn’t the film’s top billing — that distinction belonged to Jack Nicholson, who took home a tidy $6 million payday, as well as an estimated $60 million bite of the box-office, and whose contract included demands like not having to shoot during Lakers home games. And in many ways, Nicholson’s villain is very much the star of this show, with the actor zig-zagging around Gotham as a candy-colored Pop-Art terrorist, delivering tasteless zingers (“This town needs an enema!”) and reveling in that psychotic laugh.Audiences Respond to Darker, More Adult Comic-Book FareBack before franchises being grim or deep or serious or important was pretty much de rigueur, Batman was something of a shock — a popcorny shock, but a shock nonetheless. Compared to the frothy 1960s TV show that bore its name — most moviegoers were likely not familiar with the edgier Batman comics and graphic novels of the 1980s — Batman was a decidedly bleak onscreen left-turn. In creating Gotham City, designers Nigel Phelps and Anton Furst, collaborating with Burton, concocted a cityscape that screamed seedy New York, with trash-strewn streets billowing with portentous steam and intimidating skyscrapers stacked atop each other, like in an Andreas Feininger photograph. The characters, too, reeked of urban decay, with sickly-looking corrupt cops (William Hootkins’s Eckhardt), prostitutes, spiky-haired punks, a maimed muse (played by Jerry Hall) and an un-kiddie-friendly scene where a young Wayne watches his parents bite the dust.Outside-the-Box Directors Should Tackle Mainstream Material(Photo by Michael Germana/Everett Collection)We shudder to think what would have become of Batman without Burton behind the helm. (For one thing, Keaton would have definitely been nixed, as producers were much keener on a stereotypically macho lead.) Part of the joy of watching it three decades later is how it comes off like the creation of an art-school kid with a blockbuster canvas. There’s a stirring opening-title sequence, nods to the Batman of the ’60s and some still-nifty action sequences, for sure. But it’s the director’s gothic fingerprints — the shoutout to Francis Bacon’s grisly painting Figure with Meat, the mood of Alan Moore’s graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, which the director called “the first comic that I ever loved” — that stick with you after the closing credits. Now, years later, Hollywood happily gives huge superhero movies to exciting directors outside the blockbusterverse.Music MattersEarlier this month, on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Mark Ronson explained that he was the youngest intern ever at Rolling Stone, when, at age 12, he’d alert the art department about the best-selling albums. Topping the charts during his tenure? Prince’s Batman soundtrack, which held that spot for a whopping six consecutive weeks. That’s how big of a deal it was. Onscreen, Prince’s “Partyman” and “Trust” add some funky levity and spectacle to scenes where the Joker literally gasses Gothamites to death. (Originally, the project was supposed to be a collaboration between Prince, handling Joker’s bits, and Michael Jackson, doing romantic numbers.) And that wasn’t all: The film inspired another entire soundtrack composed solely of Danny Elfman’s rousing score.But So Does MerchIn fact, Batman raked in more than $500 million in merchandise sales — that’s higher than its blazing box-office gross — with cereals, pinball machines, piggy banks, toy cars, and a trillion other things. Three years later, Batman Returns would double down, tossing in pre-release commercials for the likes of McDonald’s and Diet Coke, living up to the credo, to misquote Nicholson’s Joker, to “make art until someone buys.”Batman&nbsp;was released on June 23, 1989.Like this?

Utterly horrible! And yet, fascinating...by Michael Adams | January 30, 2010 |  CommentsWhat makes a film so appalling that it transitions from ordinary ineptitude into the sublime; beyond cult status (and all reason) and into that surreal place where you really can’t believe what you’re watching? RT’s regular contributor Michael Adams has a pretty good idea: as part of his new bookShowgirls, Teen Wolves and Astro Zombies, he spent an entire year seeking out the greatest atrocities cinema has ever unleashed, watching more than 400 bad movies in a quest to to find the worst film ever made. Along the way, he spoke with such bad movie aficionados as John Landis, Joe Dante, Eli Roth, John Waters and the Mystery Science crew, while himself appearing in George Romero’s Survival of the Dead. Here then are 25 of his picks for those films that, awful as they may be, you simply cannot turn away from…&nbsp;Showgirls (1995)  23%(Photo by United Artists courtesy Everett Collection)Following their smash-hit Basic Instinct, director Paul Verhoeven and writer Joe Eszterhas tried to shock cinemagoers with this sensational look at the sleazy world of Las Vegas strips clubs and showgirl casino spectaculars. Audiences and critics were shocked all right. They were shocked at Eszterhas’ ludicrously “hard-hitting” dialogue about who has nice breasts, who is a whore, who finds it hard to adjust to no longer being ejaculated on. They were shocked at Verhoeven thinking we’d be turned on by Elizabeth Berkley and Kyle MacLachlan making love in a neon-lit pool like they’d been set on the spin cycle. Most of all they were shocked that this supposedly erotic drama generated nothing but guffaws.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Battlefield Earth (2000)  3%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)After his post-Pulp Fiction comeback, John Travolta made himself a laughing stock in this partial adaptation of his guru L. Ron Hubbard’s sci-fi novel. Set in the year 3000, a millennium after the Psychlo master race invades Earth and enslaves humanity, this has Travolta as a 10-foot-tall alien who gets around in dreadlocks, nose plugs and KISS boots. Even more over-the-top is his performance, which is all mwu-ha-ha-ing and an almost Shakespearean declamation of eeeeeeevil! Barry Pepper’s terrible, too, bringing Christian Bale levels of intensity to his cave warrior. What also makes this badly watchable is that director Roger Christian shoots every scene on a weird askew angle.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Glen or Glenda? (1953)  36%Ed Wood Jr.’s feature debut is a favorite of David Lynch, who actually sampled some of its sound effects in his 1977 debut Eraserhead. You can see the similarities; the two movies inhabit a shared surreal space. With Wood indulging his transvestite leanings in the lead role(s) and battling his literal devils, Bela Lugosi as a God-like puppetmaster, and acres of stock footage with dissonant Rumsfeld-esque narration, this cross-dressing, sex-changing melo-docu-drama is brain-scramblingly weird.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959)  68%Crowned as the “worst movie ever made” back in the 1980 book The Golden Turkey Awards, this is the movies’ most famous Z-grade clunker. Despite a discernible lack of talent and resources, auteur Ed Wood Jr. staged an alien invasion epic. It’s impossible not to be amazed and somehow charmed that he tried to fulfill this ambition with an amateur cast, unrelated footage of his now-dead friend Bela Lugosi, an unconvincing stand-in for the former Dracula star, model-kit flying saucers, a cardboard cemetery, and an airplane cockpit comprised of a couple chairs and a shower curtain… among other celebrated inadequacies.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Robot Monster (1953)  36%While Ed Wood’s aliens looked suspiciously like fey middle-aged men in silver jumpsuits, Phil Tucker’s ET invaders were even less likely, unless, that is, NASA’s suppressing knowledge that our cosmic neighbors are gorilla-robots who wear diving helmets and wield genocidal bubble machines. Originally released in 3-D, Robot Monsteractually made a small fortune relative to its paltry budget. Viewed today, it’s hilarious, but, like Plan 9, compelling for its bizarre plotting and dialogue so dreadful it actually becomes like poetry.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Howling II (1985)  31%Forget the scares and deliberate laughs of Joe Dante’s 1981 original. This sequel, from Aussie director Philippe Mora, was shot in Soviet-controlled Prague and is a hilariously bad confection of erotic horror and New Wave “style.” Christopher Lee, years off his blockbuster comeback, stars as an occult investigator who has to take on Sybil Danning’s werewolf Queen Stirba and her minions. What’s worse? The cotton-candy special make-up effects, the “acting” of co-stars Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe, or the seemingly endlessly repeated electro-bleating of the theme song by Babel? It’s a big call. Whichever way you go, don’t switch off before the very “special” end credits featuring Sybil Danning’s assets — on repeat loop.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Black Gestapo (1975) You don’t need a PhD in History to instantly realize that there are two words in the title that just don’t belong together. Blaxploitation offered up some crazy stuff (a bloodsucking brother in Blacula, a huge killer penis in Welcome Home, Brother Charles) but having African-American militants style themselves into urban Nazis is just beyond the, er, pale. The story of Colonel Kojah and his stormtroopers avenging the ‘hood against The Man and then succumbing to corruption suffers the usual exploitation-movie problems in the pacing and production departments, but it’s just too bizarre to ignore.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Frankenstein Island (1981) Jerry Warren made some dreadfully boring movies, often by taking foreign genre flicks and cutting in a few scenes of bad actors talking about the plot against bare walls. No one need suffer through The Incredible Petrified World or The Wild World of Batwoman. But&nbsp;Frankenstein Island, Warren’s last film, is a different matter altogether. Here are a few of the elements: mind-controlled zombie guards who dress like the Unabomber, vampires created via magical pitchfork, hybrid-alien cave girls who smoke skull bongs, giant vegetables and man wrestling, John Carradine appearing as a superimposed Godhead, and Katherine Victor, who introduces herself with, “I’m Sheila Frankenstein… Actually, it’s Van Helsing, I prefer my married name.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Road House (1989)  39%You can keep Ghost and Dirty Dancing. After Point Break, this is the late Patrick Swayze’s best movie, even though it’s not, at least by the usual standards, a “good” film. Who in their right mind could possibly believe a story about a world-famous bouncer who’s also a pacifist philosopher? Who cares! Swayze as high-kicking, throat-tearing Dalton is cheer-along fantastic. He’s given awesome support from Sam Elliott and Ben Gazzara.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Maniac (1934)  89%Made by pioneering exploitation huckster Dwain Esper, this is a crazy movie about going crazy. It features a ham actor assisting a mad scientist involved in the typical revival experiments before he kills the boffin and impersonates him with his “superior” acting skills and a glued-on beard. Complete with eyeball-eating moments, a girlfight with syringes, and a walled-up cat, this also boasts dialogue like, “Oh! Stealing through my body! Creeping though my veins! Pouring in my blood! Oh, DARTS OF FIRE IN MY BRAIN! STABBING ME! I CAN’T STAND IT! I WON’T!” Even better? It tries to pass itself off as a documentary about the real problems of mental illness.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Giant Claw (1957) From director Fred F. Sears, who made Rock Around the Clock andEarth vs. the Flying Saucers, this epic about a giant bird from a parallel dimension attacking Earth might have passed muster if producer Sam Katzman had followed the plan for Ray Harryhausen to do the effects. Instead, the cheapo mogul opted for a puppet on strings, so it appears as if mid-1950s jet pilots and hot rodders are being attacked by a mutated Gonzo from The Muppet Show. The dialogue is also brilliantly cheesy, making this one of the funniest Z-grade flicks of the 1950s.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Terror of Tiny Town (1938) This all-midget western was homaged by punk band The Dead Kennedys and in the M*A*S*H television series. A Poverty Row production from director Sam Newfield — who made 14 other movies that year — it’s like a pint-sized version of Deadwood as evil little bastard Bat Haines tries to steal love interest Nancy from heroic Buck Lawson by stirring up a clan war. Midgets walk into full-sized saloons and ride ponies and sing songs and do derring but the weirdest thing is how, given the conventional story and lack of normal-sized actors, you quickly adjust to the tiny cast.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Satan's Sadists (1969) Aided and abetted by producer Sam Sherman, Al Adamson carved out an incredibly prolific career as an exploitation filmmaker from 1969 to 1978. Unfortunately, many of Al’s movies were mash-ups comprising footage from unrelated films, and as such, they’re crunchingly dull, despite awesome titles like Horror of the Blood Monsters and Blood of Ghastly Horror. But this biker flick, about the title gang in pursuit of a Vietnam veteran and a waitress across the desert, lives up to its brilliantly sleazy title and trailer. A lot of credit has to go to lead villain Russ Tamblyn. Here he’s a long way from the Oscar nomination he once enjoyed, but still hugely watchable as a badass.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Death Bed: The Bed That Eats (1977) Begun in 1971 by Detroit would-be filmmaker George Barry, this oddball horror flick was finished in 1977 but then failed to land any sort of distribution. Three decades after he started it, Barry discovered by accident that someone had pirated a print of Death Bed and that it had been given an illegal video release in the UK that had resulted in a cult audience. An official 2003 release ensued and now we can all be feasted upon by the four-poster from Hades. The title says it all, and we get to see the chuckling boudoir centerpiece suck assorted hippies into its golden gastric juices, where they’re efficiently skeletonized.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Ben &amp; Arthur (2003) If Tommy Wiseau’s The Room is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich’sBen &amp; Arthur is its gay equivalent. Where Wiseau used 35mm and spent millions to achieve at least some production value, writer-director-producer-star Mraovich might as well have shot his story of homosexual persecution and fightback on a cell phone with a budget of about $5.67. Every scene, every line, every hissy fit is simultaneously hilariously amateur and hysterically fever-pitched. This is a cult sensation waiting to be born.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Shark Attack 3: Megalodon (2004)  33%While Jaws: The Revenge, Tentacles and Aquanoids are all worthy so-bad-they’re-amusing schlockers, this tale of a giant prehistoric shark chowing down on the citizenry takes the piscatorial prize for laugh-out-loud inanity. Forget the dodgy CGI of Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopusbecause you won’t believe what the makers of this Israeli-South African co-production try to get away with, especially when their oversized mama megalodon swallows jetskiers and life-rafts of survivors whole. Torchwood star John Barrowman looks like he’s having a great time, not least when he ad-libs “the line” at 66 minutes in.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Roller Blade Seven (1991) The late acid casualty Donald G. Jackson and his protégé, the self-styled martial arts Zen master Scott Shaw, crafted this Z-grade rarity out of a passionate belief that there was an audience for surrealist, soft-core sci-fi rollerskating movies co-starring the likes of Frank Stallone, Karen Black and Joe Estevez. An inexplicable montage of kung-faux, topless bondage, horned demons, skating punks and swordplay carried out across parallel time zones, The Roller Blade Seven makes Eraserhead look positively straight-forward. It might just be art.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Ishtar (1987)  37%&nbsp;By the standards of later mega-flops, like Cut-throat Island, The Adventures of Pluto Nash or Warren Beatty’s own Town and Country,Ishtar‘s box office wasn’t that shameful. But at the time this overblown comedy became synonymous with financial failure, and was thus also universally perceived as a dud movie to boot. Thing is, it’s actually not that bad, and pretty funny in parts, not least for Dustin Hoffman playing stud while Beatty takes the role of an insecure schmo. The brain-dead songs conjured by the duo and some of the schtick in their desert adventure sticks, even if this uneven comic adventure eventually unravels into a bit of a mess.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Troll 2 (1990)  5%This in-name only sequel to the 1986 horror has a family moving into the town of Nilbog (say it backwards, people, to discover this movie’s original title) and encountering a tribe of little monsters in fright masks and potato sacks who do the radical-vegetarian bidding of a hag whose modus operandi is liquefying her victims into plant goo. Or something. Cheerfully idiotic, with universally terrible performances,Troll 2 was recently celebrated in an entertaining documentary calledBest Worst Movie.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966)  0%A serious contender for the “worst-worst” movie ever made, Manos is also in the running for “best-worst” because it’s defiantly odd and amateur and it achieves a strange, dream-like quality. A lost family is trapped in the realm of the Master, who has a harem of kinda-sorta-vampire wives and a satyr-like minion named Torgo. The production history — it was made by Harold P. Warren, a Texas fertilizer salesman, as a result of a bet with Oscar-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant — is almost as weirdly fascinating as the movie itself.Watch Trailer&nbsp;For Your Height Only (For Y'ur Height Only) (1981) Made in the Philippines, this spy parody stars Weng Weng, a 2’9? midget, as the kick-ass — or make that, kick-balls — agent Double O. A bizarre James Bond riff, over-dubbed by expatriates, the film has him facing off against his nemesis, Mr. Giant, who plans to rule the world with his, er, “N-bomb”. Weng Weng followed up with The Impossible Kid, in which he works for Interpol, and made numerous other films, some of which are still being uncovered by cult-movie investigatorAndrew Leavold.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Batman &amp; Robin (1997)  12%You’ve got to see this one to see what $125m being spent at the rate of a million-a-minute looks like as it’s flushed down the can. The confluence of talent, where they’d been and where they’d go, from Arnold Schwarzenegger and George Clooney to director Joel Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman, makes this fascinatingly awful. The production values, like some neon-lit theme park, are astoundingly gauche, but that’s nothing compared to that script, whose clunky chorus comprises Arnie’s clunking out “comically” cold puns as Mr. Freeze.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Mommie Dearest (1981)  48%Faye Dunaway does Joan Crawford, with the volume (and eyebrows) turned up to 11. This outrageously campy biopic, based on the best-selling biography by Crawford’s daughter Christina, is justifiably famous for its excesses, particularly the “No wire hangers!” scene. But it’s also genuinely compelling, and Dunaway’s performance is gripping and not a little terrifying.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Oscar (1966)  13%This attempt at showing up the seamy underside of the film industry is in itself testament to the overblown excesses of Hollywood before theEasy Riders and Raging Bulls shook things up. But that doesn’t mean the story of Frankie Fane, amoral gigolo who claws his way to the top of the A-list, isn’t enormously entertaining. Seething, sleazy and sensational, it’s consistently guffaw-worthy, not least for Tony Bennett’s disastrous performance as Hymie, Fane’s version ofEntourage‘s Turtle, and a glittering parade of stars doing cameos as themselves.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Giant Spider Invasion (1975) What more besides the title do you need to know? How about that the spiders are actually from another dimension? How about that a goodly percentage of their victims are sleazy brain-dead rednecks? How about that the “hero” spider was created by draping a huge arachnid suit over a VW and driving it around while people inside the vehicle waved the beast’s big “legs” for added “realism”? And on it goes. Great fun, even if it can’t quite match the incredible poster.Watch Trailer&nbsp;","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"nature, travel, YouTube, E!, remakes, Pop, Fox, Country, Horror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"25-movies-so-bad-theyre-unmissable"},{"id":"47614233173934","title":"Eight 1980s Kids’ Movies That Are Actually Pretty F—ed Up","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Eight 1980s Kids' Movies That Are Actually Pretty F---ed UpEveryone loves '80s nostalgia but some of the decade's biggest family films still give us nightmares.by Nathan Rabin | August 22, 2018 |  CommentsAh, the 1980s. While most of the entertainment world is presently content to bask in the nostalgia of the era, it’s worth remembering not everything children saw back then left them with warm, fuzzy memories. It was a decade full of beloved blockbusters and cult oddities that haunted the dreams of pint-sized audiences and/or ignited their libidos, and many of them were executive produced by Steven Spielberg, who, as this list illustrates, may be responsible for nearly as many bad dreams and formative fears as fellow king of pop entertainment Stephen King. With that in mind, here are a handful of classic 1980s movies aimed at young audiences that disturbed, unsettled, or outright terrified us with surprisingly dark and adult content.1. The Transformers - The Movie (1986)  63%(Photo by De Laurentiis Entertainment Group courtesy Everett Collection)1986’s The Transformers: the Movie&nbsp;boasts a few distinctions. It’s known for a totally ’80s soundtrack that includes such beloved Reagan-era staples as “Weird Al” Yankovic’s brilliant Devo pastiche “Dare to be Stupid” and Stan Bush’s “The Touch,” which Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) famously covered in Boogie Nights.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;also known as the final film of Orson Welles, who&nbsp;voiced a planet-sized robot that devours other planets, which may or may not have been a comment on his late-in-life girth.But Transformers: The Movie is perhaps most famous for traumatizing an entire generation of kids by killing off a slew of popular heroes from the television show and toy line, including heroic, iconic leader Optimus Prime. Young fans of the series would stare in horror as fan favorites like Ratchet, Prowl, and Ironhide were gunned down in rapid succession early in the film, while Ultra Magnus met an especially untimely end, still others were consumed by Welles’ Unicron, and prominent love-to-hate-him villain Starscream was turned to ash by a newly minted Galvatron. Think&nbsp;Game of Thrones’ “Red Wedding,” but for kids. Unsurprisingly, it was the executives at toy company Hasbro,&nbsp;rather than the filmmakers, who determined which characters would die and which would live,&nbsp;as a cynical means to&nbsp;persuade kids to spend their allowances on all the&nbsp;new&nbsp;heroes introduced in the film.2. Gremlins (1984)  85%(Photo by Warner Bros.)The PG-13 rating came about partially as a response to two Steven Spielberg blockbusters that were deemed too intense&nbsp;and frightening for children, but were also absolutely irresistible to the 10-and-under set. If you were a pre-pubescent boy in 1984, like I was, Gremlins and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom were almost assuredly too dark and violent to be appropriate viewing, but everyone saw them anyway.There’s a distinct element of meta-commentary at work in Gremlins in particular. Joe Dante’s instant classic was a ghoulish, darkly comic, and often violent satire of the creature feature genre,&nbsp;pitting the painfully adorable, teddy bear-like Gizmo (voiced by Howie Mandel) against a horde of monsters as hideous and repellent as Gizmo is cute. If their revolting looks weren’t enough, let’s not forget that the gremlins rampaged through the city and&nbsp;killed people (we never looked at motorized stair lifts the same again) before they ultimately met an explosive end in a movie theater. Throw in Phoebe Cates’ famously morbid monologue — you know, the one about learning Santa Claus wasn’t real when her father broke his neck and died shimmying down her chimney dressed as the holly, jolly man in red — and you have a 1980s kids’ film that was probably more disturbing than parents expected, but oddly unique enough to become a celebrated holiday classic.3. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)  84%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)In the most notorious scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indy, his love interest&nbsp;“Willie” Scott (Kate Capshaw), and 11-year-old rapscallion and miniature con man Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) look on in horror as evil cult leader Mola Ram (Amrish Puri) tears the still-beating heart out of the chest of a human sacrifice and presents it to his enraptured followers as a trophy. This sequence alone would render Temple of Doom deeply unfit for its target demographic of adventure-loving, Harrison Ford-idolizing children even if it wasn’t immediately followed by the poor victim, who somehow managed to survive the ordeal, being plunged into a fiery pit to be burned alive.That’s far from the only kid-unfriendly content in this waking fever dream of a colonialist nightmare, though:&nbsp;Child slave labor? Check. Killer crocs? Check. Eyeball soup and chilled monkey brains for dessert? Check.&nbsp;Temple of Doom depicts India as an exotic but also brutal and bloodthirsty realm filled with casual cruelty and blood-crazed cultists. Its depiction of torture and sacrifice helped make it the black sheep of the Indiana Jones saga until The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came along, but it was still a huge box office hit, and it certainly thrilled younger audiences as much as it terrified them.4. Return to Oz (1985)  54%Walter Murch enjoys an impeccable reputation as one of our greatest and most important film editors and sound designers, thanks to his groundbreaking work on masterpieces like The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, and Apocalypse Now, among others.&nbsp;Murch only directed one feature film himself, though: 1985’s Return to Oz, a sequel of sorts to the 1939 Judy Garland classic that amped up the gothic elements of the frequently nightmare-inducing family favorite (who can forget the flying monkeys?) to intense new levels.The film begins with its plucky heroine (Fairuza Balk, playing a subtly punk-goth Dorothy) deeply depressed following the events of The Wizard of Oz. Her aunt and uncle take her to a doctor who specializes in primitive electro-shock therapy, but before he can work his sinister magic, she ends up back in the Land of Oz. Only, things aren’t quite as she left them: pals like the Cowardly Lion and the Tin Man have been turned to stone, and the once verdant and vibrant kingdom has crumbled into a barren wasteland. She and her strange new friends are pursued by&nbsp;malevolent forces that include the Wheelers, frightening creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet who are as horrifying as anything in an R-rated fright flick, and an evil princess who keeps a collection of sentient, interchangeable, disembodied heads on permanent display.Like many films of this ilk, Return to Oz was a box office flop, harshly criticized at the time of its release for being an eyeball-melting acid trip of a movie, and later heralded as a cult classic for possessing those very qualities.5. Back to the Future (1985)  96%(Photo by Universal Pictures)Robert Zemeckis’ masterpiece Back to the Future is so rightfully revered as a quintessential piece of Reagan-era pop Americana that it’s easy to overlook its darker themes. Robert Zemeckis was able to Trojan-horse an awful lot of raunchy, boundary-pushing sexuality and pitch-black, dirty comedy inside ostensibly family-friendly blockbusters that parents were happy to rent over and over and over again for their kids, in no small part because they had so much to offer adult audiences as well.When it comes right down to it, Back to the Future is the story of a lovable young time-traveler’s heroic attempts to fend off his incredibly hot-to-trot future mother’s feverish sexual advances. Factor in an attempted sexual assault and a subplot involving terrorists&nbsp;out to slaughter the hero’s beloved, daffy mentor, and you have a perfect piece of commercial entertainment with a barely concealed heart of darkness.6. Labyrinth (1986)  73%Like Steven Spielberg, Jim Henson earned so much goodwill with families that he could get way with almost anything. The Muppets and Sesame Street made&nbsp;him an enduring international icon of child-like imagination and play, but he longed to tell stories bigger, darker, and more adult than the ones that made him one of the best-loved television creators of all time. With 1986’s Labyrinth, Henson ventured once again (after 1982’s&nbsp;The Dark Cyrstal) into the world of fantasy and allegory with a trippy, kaleidoscopic coming-of-age story.A still relatively unknown young Jennifer Connelly stars as a&nbsp;teen who loses some of her doe-eyed innocence — but attains no small&nbsp;amount of worldly wisdom — when she ventures into a realm beyond the imagination, at once frightening and beguiling, to rescue her kidnapped baby brother.&nbsp;Labyrinth has all manner of dark elements — groping, disembodied hands, pyromaniac monsters with detachable body parts, a creepy seduction subplot complete with nonconsensual drugging — but its reputation as a corrupter of children is attributable largely to David Bowie’s portrayal of Jareth the Goblin King, whose sinister, very adult sensuality and famously ample codpiece helped kick-start the sexual curiosity of multiple generations of entranced young people.7. Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)  97%(Photo by Buena Vista courtesy Everett Collection)Back to the Future director&nbsp;Robert Zemeckis was also the man behind&nbsp;1987’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a tough, Film Noir-leaning cartoon/live-action twist on&nbsp;Chinatown that casts Bob Hoskins as a tormented alcoholic trying to solve the murder of a kinky cartoon mogul and&nbsp;refrain from getting involved with an animated bombshell.If Who Framed Roger Rabbit’s misunderstood femme fatale Jessica Rabbit (who, voiced by Kathleen Turner, isn’t bad, “just drawn that way”) is way too sexy, not just for a children’s film put out by a division of Disney, but for film as a medium, its villain is likewise too terrifying for a movie targeted at kids. Christopher Lloyd is utterly unnerving every moment he’s onscreen&nbsp;as Judge Doom, a sort of one-man cartoon apocalypse, but when he becomes his true self during the film’s harrowing climax, he’s pure nightmare fuel, a viscerally unnerving image of unhinged evil.Despite its incredible success, Who Framed Roger Rabbit never spawned a sequel, only a couple of spin-off shorts. But, like others on this list, it has inspired something of a cult following because of its singular peculiarities and its willingness to test the bounds of children’s entertainment.8. Back to the Future Part II (1989)  66%(Photo by Universal Pictures)Yup, another Zemeckis movie. We did mention his work in the 1980s was full of subversive humor and innuendo, and both audiences and critics were eating it up. So when it came time to satiate the angry demands of the market and make a sequel to his time-hopping 1985 smash Back to the Future, the prickly auteur evidently felt empowered to go even further with the black comedy and sweaty Oedipal tension.&nbsp;Instead of a darkly comic take on Eisenhower and Reagan’s America, we got a dystopian take on a future-distorted present, in which Thomas F. Wilson’s shady gambling kingpin Biff Tannen lords over a grim Hooverville that makes the brutal alternate reality of It’s a Wonderful Life look positively rosy by comparison. Doc Brown is in a mental hospital, Marty’s dad is dead, and Marty’s poor mom is married to Biff and outfitted in tight, low-cut cocktail garb.Though it got mixed reviews at the time of its release, the darker, bleaker sequel has become a huge cult film in part because its cynicism feels more of a piece with our despairing current age than Back to the Future’s subversive take on the kinky goings-on behind the white-picket perfection of&nbsp;’50s and ’80s faux-innocence.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Holiday, Stephen, Crackle, E!, Netflix, HBO, police, Apple, LGBTQ, TV, science","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"disturbing-1980s-kids-movies"},{"id":"47614252666809","title":"Chucky Vs.

In addition, we’ve got the complete series of a classic sitcom and a couple of noteworthy releases from the Criterion Collection, including a Jacques Tati compilation. Read on for details:Deliver Us from Evil 29%Scott Derrickson has recently chalked up a number of scary movies as writer and/or director, including 2005’s The Exorcism of Emily Rose, 2012’s Sinister, and Devil’s Knot, which premiered earlier this year. Sinister is his best reviewed work thus far, and his latest offering, Deliver Us from Evil, posed no threat to that title. Eric Bana stars as a police officer named Ralph Sarchie who begins investigating a series of mysterious crimes that all seem to be linked. As he digs deeper, he uncovers the supernatural cause of the city’s strange occurrences and teams up with a local priest to fight it. Critics agreed that Derrickson got some mileage out of his knack for chilly atmosphere, but also felt the film unwisely relied on overly familiar scare tactics, resulting in a mediocre 28 percent Tomatometer score. Special features include a commentary track, a profile of the real life Ralph Sarchie, whose experiences inspired the film, and a few making-of featurettes.Begin Again 83%Back in 2007, director (and former bassist for Irish band The Frames) John Carney scored a surprise indie hit with Once, a thoughtful, melancholy drama about two musicians who share a brief time together. This year, he brought us Begin Again, another story about a pair of musical souls who meet, connect, and make music, but with a lighter touch. Keira Knightley is struggling and newly single songwriter Gretta, who impresses record exec Dan (Mark Ruffalo) so much that he signs her to his label. Faced with opposition from his partner (Mos Def), Dan suggests he and Gretta record her album independently, and the two begin an unlikely friendship. Begin Again was Certified Fresh by the critics at 82 percent; though many felt the film didn’t quite hit the high notes of Once, they were charmed by the chemistry between Knightley and Ruffalo. The only two special features available are a making-of doc and a few music videos, including co-star Adam Levine’s rendition of one of the film’s songs, “Lost Stars.”Also available this week:Life of Crime (66 percent), starring Jennifer Aniston and Will Forte in an ensemble caper comedy about a kidnapping gone awry when the corrupt land developer being squeezed decides he’d rather not pay the ransom.Zach Braff’s famously crowd-funded Wish I Was Here (46 percent), starring Braff and Kate Hudson in a dramedy about a thirtysomething man coming to grips with his adult life.James Franco’s Child of God (37 percent), starring Scott Haze and Tim Blake Nelson in an adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel about a Tennessee man whose life misfortune isolates him from society.Good People (12 percent), starring James Franco and Kate Hudson in a thriller about a couple in debt who discover a bag of cash and keep it, running afoul of the thief who stole it in the first place.The Prince (0 percent), starring Bruce Willis and John Cusack in a thriller about a retired assassin who jumps back into action when his daughter is kidnapped by his old rival.Shout! Factory is releasing the Complete Series of WKRP in Cincinnati for all you fans of classic sitcoms. The Emmy-nominated series, which ran from 1978-1982 and followed the eccentric staff at a struggling radio station, aired successfully in syndication for years after its cancellation.And lastly, two rereleases from the Criterion Collection: George Sluizer’s 1988 thriller The Vanishing (100 percent) is available in a new DVD and Blu-ray; and a DVD and Blu-ray box set of The Complete Jacques Tati, which contains all six of the French director’s films, including Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday (100 percent) and Playtime (100 percent), as well as seven of his short films and a ton of special features.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"based, Fire, Travel, Seed, Grant, Rom-Com, festivals, true, telelvision, scary, America, chucky, Musicals","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"new-on-dvd-and-blu-ray-deliver-us-from-evil-begin-again-and-more"},{"id":"47614271934404","title":"Strathairn Signs Up for New Line’s \"Fracture\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Strathairn Signs Up for New Line's \"Fracture\"by Scott Weinberg | January 31, 2006 |  CommentsMovie geeks all over the place have admired character actor David Strathairn for several years now, but with his mega-praised performance in \"Good Night, and Good Luck.\" in plain view, it looks the the guy will be getting some meatier roles sometime soon.

From promising releases by new voices to&nbsp;experimental efforts&nbsp;from storied filmmakers – or perhaps the next indie darling to go the distance for end-of-year accolades – we will break it all down for you here each week.For the foreseeable future, the specialty box office and all theatrical releases will be on hold as we all make efforts to socially distance ourselves and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus. With that in mind, we have reshaped our Indie Fresh List to reflect the specialty box office releases that are newly available on&nbsp;streaming services and VOD. This week in our Fresh picks we have a gritty London crime thriller, a quarter-life crisis comedy, and a thought-provoking documentary about an artist and the man who stole her work. In our Spotlight section, we have the final installment of Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan’s comedy travel series.Streaming This WeekendVillain (2020)  71%Known for his gruff cockney voice and intimidating stature, veteran character actor Craig Fairbrass has been a recognizable face in action films for over three decades. Keeping with that formula, Fairbrass takes the lead role in&nbsp;Villain, a gritty London crime thriller about an ex-con trying to stay out of trouble and save his criminal brother from ruin. In his feature directorial debut, actor-turned-director Phillip Barantini captures an authentic version of modern-day London “with more depth of character than the usual crime thriller, [which] finds some surprising resonance in between the usual scenes of vicious threats and gruesome violence,” according to&nbsp;Rich Cline of Shadows on the Wall.Available to rent or buy May 22 on&nbsp;FandangoNOW&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vudu.The Painter and the Thief (2020)  96%&nbsp;If there was a Stockholm Syndrome for theft, some might argue that artist Barbora Kyusilkova was afflicted with it. When two of her paintings were stolen from an art gallery, she decided to approach and eventually befriend one of the men accused of stealing it. Despite the original sin that brought them together, the artist and the criminal formed an unexpected friendship, with Kyusilkova eventually asking the thief to sit for a portrait. A Sundance award-winner, Benjamin Ree’s gripping documentary is “a&nbsp;remarkable, transformative story, in which the director explores the relationship between the subjects, gets to deeper truths and is a soul-stirring, life-affirming watch,” writes&nbsp;Leslie Combemale&nbsp;of&nbsp;AWFJ Women on Film.Available to rent or buy on May 22 on&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes&nbsp;&amp; Neon Virtual Cinema.Buffaloed (2020)  79%In Buffaloed we follow a twenty-something played by Zoey Deutch who is struggling to get enough cash to leave her hometown. An acceptance letter to her dream school signals her ticket out of town until her hopes are dashed when she realizes she can’t afford the tuition. Hellbent on stacking enough cash to get out town, she is suddenly caught of in a web of shady dealings and left with only one choice: scam the scammers. “Buffaloed moves at breakneck speed, led with aplomb by Deutch, who is absolutely magnetic onscreen as the fast-talking, fourth-wall-breaking Peg,” writes&nbsp;Hoai-Tran Bui of Slashfilm.&nbsp;Available to rent or buy on&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.Available Now on VOD – Spotlight PickThe Trip to Greece (2020)  87%In the final installment of the beloved Trip&nbsp;series starring Ron Brydon and Steve Coogan, the duo travel to all the idyllic locations of the Greek isles.

The patter between Coogan and Brydon, framed by director&nbsp;Michael Winterbottom‘s intimate lens, “is so unforced and natural and not just because this is their fourth go-round. They make you feel as if they are personally connected and enjoy each other’s company,” writes Bob Bloom of Journal and Courier.&nbsp;The Trip to Greece&nbsp;is available to stream now on&nbsp;IFC Film Unlimited&nbsp;and available to rent or buy on&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;iTunes, and&nbsp;Google Play.Along with… Swallow (2020) , about an affluent housewife who develops a deadly case of pica — the urge to swallow inanimate objects.

After 24 whirlwind days in the world of James Bond, I’ve come to the final movie thus far in the franchise, Quantum of Solace. It’s been a remarkable experience, and I’m actually kind of sad it’s over, but all good things must come to an end. Brace yourselves, and be warned that while I’ve kept this writeup spoiler-free, you may still want to refrain from reading it until after you’ve seen Quantum of Solace.I’ve mentioned here and there over the course of this series that watching all of these Bond films has helped me to understand the film universe of 007 on a much deeper level. There are things that I’ve come to expect from a James Bond movie, regardless of who the actor was and during what era the movie was produced. These things are the tried and true elements of the Bond persona, and while one may argue this persona has strayed heavily from its source material, one cannot deny that the silver screen Bond has established a sort of mythology all his own. I think some of you can see where I’m going with this.Casino Royale effectively upended this mythology and sought to establish a new identity for 007. Not only was he rewritten to be darker and more ruthless, but the transformation was made complete by the controversial casting of a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Daniel Craig, arguably less dashing than his predecessors but with a rugged face more suited for the brutal killer Bond would become. At the same time, Casino Royale retained a bit of charm, a pinch of humor, and enough of the familiar conventions that I had come to know and love as distinctly “James Bond.”With all of this in mind, I also had certain expectations when I finally took my seat to watch Quantum of Solace, but again, my expectations were thoroughly challenged. I don’t want to get into specific details, because I’m not a film critic, and I don’t want to ruin anything for anyone who has yet to see the film. But while I generally liked the movie, I enjoyed it for very different reasons than Casino Royale, and truthfully speaking, I was left with somewhat of a bittersweet aftertaste.First of all, QoS is action packed. And I mean wall-to-wall, relentless, grimy, cathartic action. The very beginning of the movie plunges the audience into a high octane car chase, the pre-credit spectacle, and the remainder pauses only briefly to expand the plot. It wasn’t always easy to tell what was going on, what with the jittery camera work, but every knuckle to the jaw resounded with a visceral crunch, every gunshot popped with fury, and every fall to the ground vibrated through my back. Bond is just as ferocious, thrusting his body into countless perilous situations and emerging victoriously with an intense glare on his face and a smattering&nbsp;of dirt caked onto his clothes.However, aside from a couple of allusions to the Bond franchise (including an obvious homage to Goldfinger), the movie suffers from a lack of signature Bond elements. Though the gadgets, one-liners, massive lairs, Q, and Moneypenny were also absent in Casino Royale, that film still felt like a Bond film because of the nature of its characters and the structure of the story. Quantum of Solace, on the other hand, sports a relatively straightforward script and, despite the promise of a continuing revenge plot, one gets the sense its plot points exist solely to provide context for the explosive action sequences. Bond is also more stoic than ever, with precious few lines of dialogue and little development of his character beyond “I’m pissed off, and someone’s gonna pay!” Whether or not it’s more faithful to Ian Fleming’s novels is moot; because the 007 of the silver screen had been established for forty years, I think it’s somewhat understandable for some fans to be distraught over this.But this is the double-edged sword. I gained a greater appreciation for Casino Royale after having watched all of its predecessors; this is not necessary to enjoy Quantum of Solace. It’s a hard-hitting action movie that doesn’t require one to be a die-hard Bond fan to indulge in its visceral thrills, so I think fans of action flicks in general will be able to appreciate it on some level, despite it having a thinner plot and no deep connection to the previous installments. This is pure adrenaline, and if that’s all you’re after, it may suffice. If you want more than that, you’ll probably be disappointed, and those simply looking forward to James Bond wreaking havoc will have a better time.I’ve enjoyed being able to experience all these films with you all, and I never expected to engage you as much as I did in discussing these films. From Dr. No to Quantum of Solace, a whole new universe was opened up to me, and I now have an affection for these films I never would have had before.

Part 21: Howard the DuckMarvel amuck.by RT Staff | June 24, 2011 |  CommentsEnter Marvel Movie Madness, wherein Rotten Tomatoes watches all of the significant Marvel movies ever made. Full Marvel Movie Madness list here. Tune in! We give you our thoughts, and you give us yours.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244241[/rtimage]Part 21: Howard the Duck (1986, 16% @ 32 reviews)Directed by Willard Huyck, starring Lea Thompson, Jeffrey Jones, Tim Robbins, Ed GaleLuke: Well, I guess everyone’s going to violently disagree here, so I’ll come right out with it. This is the kind of movie that reminds me why I never trust critics’ opinions on anything. If you think Howard the Duck is one of the worst things ever made, then frankly you either haven’t seen enough movies or have no sense of humor. I mean, sure, the script grimly bastardizes Steve Gerber’s comic character in favor of a silly sci-fi adventure — an ideal Howard adaptation probably should have been animated and directed by, I don’t know, Ralph Bakshi or Terry Zwigoff, to capture the character’s caustic existentialism. But whatever; how many big-budget PG blockbusters marketed under the marquee of George Lucas have been this f***ing weird? What I like about Howard is the uncomfortable friction between source material and family-friendly adventure intent — no matter how they tried to dampen them, traces of Gerber’s rude, ill-mannered anti-hero remain. Yeah, the duck puns are inoffensively lame, but consider that in the first five minutes we get a boozing, cigar-chomping misanthrope in the lead and a totally unwarranted frontal flash of duck breasts (upholding the classic gratuitous ’80s shot tradition), before soon discovering that Howard rocks a mini duck condom in his wallet, gets a job cleaning the jizz from the tanks at a sleazy sex spa, and then all-but gets it on with Lea Thompson in one seriously strange bedroom scene. What would little kids reared on the Lucas brand name of Star Wars and the previous tame Ewok movies have wondered?On top of that, Jeffrey Jones is completely gross and hilarious as the evil scientist possessed by an ill-tempered intergalactic demon — “I no longer neeeeeeeeeeed humaaaaaaaaaaan fooooooooooooood,” he wheezes, sweating like a Mr. Rooney from Hell — in a performance that essentially set the standard for Vincent D’Onofrio’s similar turn in Men In Black a decade later (and Jones’ ILM stop-motion alien incarnation at the end is pretty damn freaky-great, too). And if Howard’s puppet/animatronic form looked dodgy to 1986 audiences, he looks relatively charming and real compared to the sorts of crappy CG characters that would later replace him. It’s all a matter of time and perspective. Oh yeah, and Tim Robbins is dorky-funny, the music’s by John freakin’ Barry (and Thomas Dolby, doing synth-pop punk songs for all-girl band Cherry Bomb), while Lea Thompson’s Sistine Chapel of crimped Cyndi Lauper hair is a work of pop-girl art. She and the duck make quite the cute couple. And there’s nothing wrong with that at all. I’m guessing that, had this movie not been released under the aegis of Lucas (when the knives were obviously drawn at that point) and instead been made by a unknown entity, it might have gone down as an offbeat cult item instead of the critical whipping post it (unfarily) is.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244242[/rtimage]Jeff: While I can’t share your (apparently considerable) enthusiasm for Howard the Duck, Luke, I have to admit that this movie is nowhere near as bad as its reputation. I watched it in the theater as a 12-year-old Marvel fanatic, as the front half of a double bill with Flight of the Navigator, and I hadn’t seen it since; I remembered it as being pretty lame, but not the worst thing I’d ever seen, and it more or less lived up (or down) to my memories.As a showcase for what ILM could do circa 1986, Howard isn’t bad, and Jeffrey Jones’ performance is a wondrous work of majestic, ham-scented art. But generally, it’s just kind of harmlessly silly — the kind of movie where you can’t have a bar fight without a person (or an anthropomorphic duck — whatever) being sent sliding down the bar, and where street toughs giggle and trade punny quips instead of doing anything really menacing.The big problem with Howard — for me, anyway — is that it’s so disconnected from the clever, subversive spirit of the books. As you pointed out, Luke, we do get to see flashes of the “real” Howard, but they’re sort of randomly scattered throughout the movie, and the way he’s written really doesn’t have much of anything to do with who he is in the comics.So why bother adapting Howard the Duck if you aren’t going to do it in a way that fans of the character will recognize or appreciate? It isn’t like Ghost Rider, where you can piss off the fans and still have enough flaming action to draw blockbuster crowds. Here, you’re just left with a talking, cigar-smoking (and really pretty unpleasant-looking) duck. I don’t think it’s one of the worst movies of all time, but it’s definitely a bizarre disappointment.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244243[/rtimage]Tim: I couldn’t disagree with you guys more: Howard the Duck is worse than its reputation suggests. I’ve been known to revisit critical duds from time to time, and usually I can find something to admire (or, in the case of Heaven’s Gate, a whole lot to admire). But sorry, nothing doing with Howard the Duck; it’s just awful. It’s too sophomoric and silly for adults, and too sleazy for kids. It takes a ridiculous scenario and makes the very least of it; it’s the kind of movie where everyone acts as wacky as possible to cover up the fact that they have to sell an incredibly unfunny script. There’s so much off-putting stuff here, from the groan-worthy one-liners to the dull action to the the sheer repulsiveness of Howard. Seriously, this movie left me slack-jawed. I’ve read time and again that the original comics were subversive and smart, but there’s hardly a glimmer of that here — the whole thing feels like a smuttier Mac and Me, or some other dispiriting 1980s relic.Jeff: I can’t argue any of the points you’re making about the movie — especially about the wacky actin’ — but in this particular case, they didn’t bother me as much as they bothered you. Maybe it’s because so much of the Marvel stuff we’ve watched for this series so far has been slickly crass, or at best, mind-numbingly competent; although Howard the Duck is certainly a failure, at least it’s an unusual one. I didn’t come away from it feeling sad and unclean the way I did after watching, say, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer or The Punisher.Luke: Ah, Tim, you issued all the praise I needed to say right here: “the whole thing feels like a smuttier Mac and Me.”Tim: I agree with you in theory, Jeff — there are plenty of unsuccessful movies that I enjoy for their sheer weirdness. But said weirdness should feel organic, and unfortunately, I don’t get that vibe here — it just feels like a big-budget movie that went seriously amuck..categories{float:left;background:#e7e5e6;width:670px;margin:0;padding:0;border:1px solid #d6d6d6}#thumbs{width:610px;float:left;overflow:hidden}#thumbs div{width:3050px;height:140px;float:left}#thumbs div a{display:block;float:left;width:80px;text-align:center;font:11px Arial,Verdana,sans-serif;color:#717171;text-decoration:none;line-height:14px}#thumbs img{cursor:hand;cursor:pointer;float:left;display:block;border:0;margin:8px 10px 2px 10px;padding:0}.b-left,.b-right{float:left;background:url(http://content6.flixster.com/site/10/25/65/10256544_ori.gif) no-repeat #fff;border:0;width:25px;height:26px;overflow:hidden;margin:28px 2px;text-indent:-300px}.b-right{background-image:url(http://content7.flixster.com/site/10/25/65/10256545_ori.gif)}.b-left:hover,.b-right:hover{background-position:0 -26px}.link-intro{float:right;margin:10px 5px}More Marvel Movie Madness:ThorHulkThe Incredible HulkFantasticFour (1994)FantasticFourFantastic Four:Rise of the Silver…BladeBlade IIBlade: TrinityX-MenX2: X-Men UnitedX-Men 3: The Last StandX-Men:First ClassX-Men Origins: WolverineGhost RiderGhost Rider: Spirit of…The Punisher (1989)The Punisher (2004)Punisher:War ZoneMan-ThingRed SonjaHoward the DuckSpider-ManSpider-Man 2Spider-Man 3TheAmazing Spider-ManKick-AssMen in BlackMen inBlack 2Men inBlack 3DaredevilElektraIron ManIron Man 2Captain America (1944)Captain America (1990)Captain America: The First AvengerMarvel’s The Avengersback to the main pagevar timer1;function scrollDiv(e,t){document.getElementById(e).scrollLeft-=t,timer1=setTimeout('scrollDiv(\"'+e+'\", '+t+\")\",10)}","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"007, Anna, 2020, sequels, Paramount, dark, Biopics, obituary, Arrowverse, Awards, SDCC, Nickelodeon, Fox, richard","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"marvel-movie-madness-part-21-howard-the-duck"},{"id":"47614283058122","title":"Japanese Community Protests \"Geisha\" Girls","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Japanese Community Protests \"Geisha\" Girlsby Gareth J. Von Kallenbach | November 29, 2005 |  CommentsProtest is brewing by the Japanese community prior to the release of producer Steven Spielberg‘s screen adaptation of \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" Chief among the complaints is the casting of Chinese, Malaysian, and Asian actors and actresses in the roles of Japanese characters, and primarily with Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi in the lead.Based on reported production information the film also features Michelle Yeoh of Malaysia, Gong Li of China, and Kenneth Tsang of Hong Kong, China — all portraying Japanese characters. Group member Jessica Burkard of a local group in Seattle has said there is \"complete and utter outrage\" in the Japanese community over this, and they, like other groups of Japanese descent, are calling for and planning a boycott of the film.Knowing the history between China and Japan, the group finds it \"highly insulting\" that the filmmakers would cast Chinese talents in the parts of Japanese characters. Burkard explained that you would not cast people of African American or Hispanic heritage as Caucasians. \"The perception is that we (Chinese and Japanese) look alike, and are the same, well we do not and are not the same and filmmakers should not make sweeping generalizations that are insensitive to our culture and heritage.\"This is not the first time that Spielberg has worked on a film based on Japan, as his \"Empire of the Sun\" and, to a lesser extent, \"1941\" looked at the war as both as drama and a comedy. Burkard went on to say that they have been in contact with other groups on a local, national, and international basis who share the same concerns and plan to boycott the film as well.Thanks to Gareth at Skewed &amp; Reviewed for this report.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"singing, Sneak, Sematary, Sony","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"japanese-community-protests-geisha-girls"},{"id":"47614317446108","title":"On DVD This Week: Neighbors 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Neighbors 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | September 19, 2016 |  CommentsThis week on home video, we’ve got a pair of summer sequels, a civil war rebellion led by Matthew McConaughey, a couple of notable anniversary reissues and more.

After my first day of first grade, my parents asked me who was in my class, and to describe them. I dutifully rattled off various names and attributes before noting that one classmate “had spaceman ears.” Now, I barely watched television as a kid (much less Star Trek, so I’m still a bit surprised that I would refer to someone with pointy ears in such a way. I barely remember anything else about said classmate (I think he’s a techno DJ in New Hampshire these days), but what I’m getting at, I guess, is that somehow Star Trek so deeply permeated the culture that even a little kid with no firsthand knowledge of it knew a Spock lookalike when he saw one.The casting of Leonard Nimoy as the logical, emotion-impaired Vulcan is one of the most serendipitous in television history. His affect is, for lack of a better word, otherworldly, even without those angular eyebrows and jutting lobes. It’s almost impossible to imagine anyone other than Nimoy in the role. And what a difficult role it is: one that requires a tight control over any hint of emotion, while simultaneously exuding the confidence of one who possesses a staggering body of knowledge — all the while being strangely endearing, and providing an essential counterweight to the more visceral McCoy and passionate Kirk in the Enterprise‘s hierarchical trinity.The problem with The Search for Spock is right there in the title: if the crew of the Enterprise is looking for the ol’ greenblood, that means he’s off-screen for most of the movie.[rtimage]MapID=1019863&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As ST:TSFS opens, the Enterprise is headed back for Earth after being heavily damaged by Khan; the ship is set to be decommissioned. Of course, the crew’s greatest loss was Spock, who was killed by radiation trying to fix the ship’s warp drive. But wait! Dr. McCoy is acting awfully funny; could it be that Vulcan mind-meld Spock dropped on him right before entering the reactor room? (Side note: the other major Star Trek memory from my youth was the vigorous playground debates among my third grade classmates as to whether the Vulcan neck pinch really worked.) Meanwhile, Kirk’s son David and Lt. Saavik (now played by Robin Curtis) have discovered an unspecified life form on the Genesis planet. They discover that Spock has been reborn, and is growing quickly, but the Genesis planet itself is highly unstable.Back on Earth, Spock’s father Sarek (Mark Lenard) swings by Kirk’s quarters to upbraid him for leaving Spock’s corpse on the Genesis planet. However, he lightens up a bit (at least, as much as Vulcans can) after mind-melding with Kirk. He discovers that Spock’s soul has inhabited Bones’ body, which could be detrimental to both of them. Kirk realizes that his only chance to save Spock is to travel to the Genesis planet, which has been declared off limits by Starfleet command. Never one to stand on ceremony, he and the gang utilize some subterfuge in order to commandeer the beat-up Enterprise.However, trouble awaits them. Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), a Klingon commander, is aching to get his hands on the Genesis device; like Khan, he sees its potential as a weapon. After pilfering some key information about its construction, he heads to the Genesis planet to learn more about the device and its destructive powers. His crew accidentally destroys a Starfleet vessel, and subsequently captures David, Saavik, and a rapidly maturing Spock, who is going through an intensely accelerated puberty.[rtimage]MapID=1019863&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Let me pause for a moment to address two things that have been bugging me as I watch the Trek movies. Number one is the way the Klingons are handled. As an outsider, I’ve always admired Star Trek‘s treatment of race; its vision of the future is one that’s refreshingly tolerant, with humans of all races working side-by-side with other life forms. So how do the Klingons fit in? Thus far, they’re dirty, devious, vile, and without nuance. I understand that a sci-fi series needs conflict in order to create dramatic tension, and I certainly don’t plan on becoming an advocate for Klingon rights. But as a non-initiate, I would like it if the films provided a little more backstory on this warrior race. Their motivations seem pretty murky to me.My second issue is that it seems to me that they broke the mold after Nimoy when it comes to other actors playing Vulcans. Nimoy so embodies Spock — and by proxy the Vulcan demeanor — that virtually anyone else who tries is doomed to come up short. As Sarek, Lenard comes the closest; he looks uncannily like Nimoy and captures many of the mannerisms that he brought to the role. Others don’t fare as well; as Lt. Saavik, Kirstie Alley mostly seemed drowsy, and Collins too chipper. It’s not simply a matter of acting chops; Alley has been excellent in other roles, and Collins has a number of movie, TV, and theater roles to her credit. Nor do I expect all Vulcans to behave exactly the same. It’s just that Nimoy made the character his, and in doing so, defined an entire alien race; everyone else seems to merely mimic his affectations.Back to the movie. The Enterprise arrives at the Genesis planet, and trades volleys with the Klingon warship. The Enterprise‘s controls are badly damaged, and Kruge decides to kill one of the captives on Genesis in order to further weaken the crew’s resolve (the victim is David, who volunteers in order to save Saavik and Spock). Kirk is obviously upset, but pulls it together long enough to double-cross the Klingons who plan to raid the Enterprise; he orders that the ship be programmed to self destruct, and he and the crew beam down to Genesis (the destruction of the Enterprise is one of the few moments of awe to be found in the film). There, Kirk and Kruge go mano-a-mano to the death as the Genesis planet collapses into chaos (no points for guessing who wins). Ultimately, the Enterprise crew commandeers the Klingon ship and heads to Vulcan, where Spock and Bones are disentangled. The end.[rtimage]MapID=1019863&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]My reaction to The Search for Spock was essentially ho-hum; perhaps the fact that Khan set such a high bar contributed to my general disinterest. It doesn’t work as a stand-alone entity; you have to have plenty of familiarity with Trek history (and Khan) to understand what’s going on. But I think a larger factor is the emphasis on event over character; I’m becoming enamored with the Enterprise crew, and I find my interest waning when they’re not all on board, solving problems together.Tomorrow I’m going whale-watching in the Bay Area with Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.

Anyway, someone’s doing a remake and Queen Latifah is going to star.Adam Shankman, a frequent Latifah collaborator, will be on board to produce (and maybe direct?) Brent Goldberg and David Wagner were hired to pen the adaptation back when it was supposed to be a vehicle for Wanda Sykes, but it belongs to the Queen now. This’ll be the third time Latifah and Shankman make a movie together. They did \"Bringing Down the House\" together, as well as this summer’s \"Hairspray.\"Apparently the remake will take place in the world of politics, with liberal Latifah’s bod being partially possessed by a conservative type.

But for now, the actor finds himself in the somewhat unusual position of promoting a sequel to a film he made in 1982; a film that critics at the time might not have guessed would spawn a franchise. In TRON Legacy, Bridges returns as information architect Kevin Flynn, the hot-shot game designer who created “the Grid” in the original TRON. We sat down with Bridges to talk about the films, and caught up with co-star Bruce Boxleitner, who played “TRON” in the first movie and reprises his character for the sequel.RT: It’s almost 30 years now since the first film. How do you go back and connect with Kevin Flynn after all this time?Jeff Bridges: Well, I mean the script has a lot to do with it. That’s kind of your main touchstone — and the fact that they had Steve Lisberger, the guy who wrote and directed the original, on board. They really looked to him to keep us on track, as far as being consistent with the characters and so forth. Just having him on board, I think, that helped me quite a bit with the character. And a lot of that kind of stuff you don’t have to think about too much, you know, ’cause I was that guy — he’s somewhere in there. It’s like when my brother and I played brothers in The Fabulous Baker Boys: if it was another actor and not Beau, you’d spend time trying to figure out, “How do we appear like we’re brothers?” But Beau and I didn’t think about that because we are brothers.So you and Flynn are one and the same?Yeah, I think there are elements of myself that kicked in pretty quick.Was it strange to see a younger version of yourself created by the animators?Well yeah, you know it kind of reminded me of… well, let’s say it’s not that unusual for me to see myself as a younger guy [on screen] anyway, so it wasn’t as surprising as someone might think. But it was interesting to see how they’re still honing that look. What did you think? Did it pass?Well it wasn’t exactly you, because I’ve seen plenty of your movies from that era — but then you know that he’s a creation of the program.So it’s forgiving, yeah.Right. It was interesting that the digital director kept insisting they go for an Against All Odds Jeff.Yeah, they asked me for all kinds of photographs and everything. I think the one they picked, that was kind of a good choice — about the right age.So you were happy with that look, the hair and everything? Your hair was a bit moppier in TRON.Well in TRON, I remember that they bleached and permed my hair, and it was terrible because I would go back and forth and do real world scenes and then we’d go into, you know, the Grid stuff, and that hat… have you ever had your hair permed or bleached?It stings.It kind of stings, yeah, and it gets hot — there’s heat, and so I had that helmet on, and all of my hair started to fall out; it was pretty crazy.Wow, that explains it. Wearing the new motion capture helmets, how did they compare to shooting the original TRON? Was there more blue screen back then?No, you know what it was in the original: the set was all black duvetyne, with white adhesive tape and vector lines, shot in 70mm black-and-white and then hand-tinted by a bunch of Korean women. In this one, one of the things that I thought was really effective was the way Joe [Kosinski, director] kind of blended the real sets with the CGI and the motion capture and all of that — it was a combination of all those things; it was really well done. It’s interesting to see how different filmmakers use the same tools, and how different the look is on each one, depending on where they’re coming from. Joe being an architect, he brought a lot of that sensibility to it.When you were making the original film, did you have any sense that you were involved in something that may have been ahead of its time?Oh yeah. Very much so. But it’s funny, I remember making it, and the minute it was out, probably the next day or two, you’d see that same technology on TV commercials — it moved so fast. Like, we’re using stuff the next generation after Avatar, and I wonder how long it’ll take for this to be passé? But I remember the first TRON looked like old stuff pretty quick.But it’s still something very unique.It’s unique, yeah, because it moved so fast, it was kind of like one of a kind — you really can’t see any other movies that were like that. I love the Wendy Carlos music in it, too; wasn’t that a beautiful score?It’s pretty great. The thing about that film is that it’s easy to remember the visuals and forget your performance, which is actually quite human — and humorous. Were you happy with how the sequel turned out in that sense?I think so. I haven’t seen how it’s all paced together but from what I’ve seen it’s working well, yeah.Garrett [Hedlund] seems to have some of what your character was in the original.Yeah, that was written in to the script; we wanted to have that in there.So, who’s the camper villain: David Warner or Michael Sheen?[laughs] Who’s the what? Oh, the camper villain. Well they’re both pretty out there. I wanted David Warner to be in this one as my — as Clu’s — butler. [laughs] He’s such a wonderful actor.Next, we chat with the original TRON, Bruce Boxleitner, about Legacy and working on the ’82 film.RT: It must be odd to be doing press for a sequel to a film that most would have thought wouldn’t have one.Bruce Boxleitner: I know. I’ll be interested to see how this one does. I thought that [reviewers] at the time [of the first TRON] — I don’t think a lot of them got it, because they were written by older guys, you know. The first movie, in retrospect, the kids that were putting those quarters into those game machines — they got it. The older generation didn’t quite get it, because it wasn’t theirs. You guys have all grown up in this technology. It’s part of your language. It wasn’t then. It was something new, and it was an arcade game, therefore it said “childish”, you know, and the first film had somewhat been dismissed.I’d always assumed it was a classic when I was kid — I had no idea the movie bombed.It wasn’t a screaming bomb but I think they had this expectation, the industry did. But you guys got it. This new movie is unique, in a way, because it’s made by fans — ask Joe Kosinski, ask [producer] Sean Bailey, what was one of their favorite movies when they were boys, and TRON was it. They got to grow up and make the movie again, with the tools that they have now. Steve Lisberger and his wife Bonnie, these were two kids that came out to Hollywood from Boston with this little idea: they wrote this script about this technology and it’s called “Neutron” or something like that, and now, so many years later, to see this… I’m so happy for them, you know, because it was their brainchild.What did you think when you were presented with the original screenplay for TRON?Well the original screenplay I didn’t quite understand, because of the language of “Tron” or “rom” or “Kram”, and all these terms, but I did see there was this kind of chase story; it wasn’t outer space but it was kind of Star Wars-y and it was a world we didn’t know, you know. And then when I finally did get to Hollywood I was out on location in Tucson, Arizona doing a Western, and I was sitting there on a horse reading the script because I needed to get back to the hotel that night, in Tucson, to call my agents to say “yes” or “no”. Today, if someone asked me that, I’d get on an airplane right now. But then, I almost like a young fool went, “I just don’t understand it — let’s pass.”In fairness, I guess you were sitting on a horse.I’m doing a Western! I’m dressed as young Wyatt Earp, with a big old mustache on, reading about bits and bytes and TRON and these discs. [laughs] And then I said, “Okay, that might be interesting.” But it wasn’t until I got to Hollywood and I met with Steven at the studio and he showed me some footage that they had — and by this time it was also known that Jeff Bridges was doing it, and I was really enjoying some of the films that he was doing and thought, “I would love to work with him.” But when I saw this cut footage — it was just kind of this generic guy running and jumping and throwing — in this beautiful colored world, I said “Yeah, I’ve got to do that.” Plus, it was Disney.And they were kind of taking a chance at that point.They were taking a big chance. You always hear how they were sort of conservative, kind of a dowdy studio, but I think this plays against that. I thought it was very daring of them to take this step with computer animation. We were very much a wild bunch. I remember Steven saying to me on Legacy, “Everyone was so well behaved on this one — you and Jeff used to be a couple of wild crazies who were always getting in some kind of mischief on the lot.”Oh, what kind?We were running around in those outfits going to lunch, and these women were shocked, you know, because we had our bare asses hanging out there. We got a memo from the studio that we had to wear bath robes if we went off side the stage. Those outfits were elaborate to get out of, so it was easier for us to just run over to the commissary — and there we were, basically in nothing.

From Star Wars and Jurassic World&nbsp;to The Karate Kid, Bill &amp; Ted, and Indiana Jones. These films faced the difficult task of living up to the legacies of their predecessors, reminding audiences why they were special in the first place, and offering stories fresh enough to entice audiences old and new.So when Disney decided to greenlight a sequel to the modest 1982 cult hit TRON nearly 30 years later and with a budget 10 times that of the original, it was a risky endeavor. Thankfully, the result was as much a visual marvel as the original, but with a deeper story about playing god that also commented on the nature of movie sequels, all while delivering one of the best movie soundtracks in decades. Grab your identity disk and hop on your light cycle, because TRON: Legacy&nbsp;turns 10 today, and we’re heading back to the Grid to explore why it’s&nbsp;a worthy successor to its cult classic predecessor.It’s Darker than the Original, but Just as Hopeful(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures)The original Tron arrived at the dawn of widespread home computing, at a time when one could wonder what it would be like to live inside the machine and marvel at the possibilities the future could bring. For the sequel, director Joseph Kosinski and writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz take a far more pessimistic approach to the “legacy” of&nbsp;the film’s title.&nbsp;Jeff Bridges reprises his role as programming wizard Kevin Flynn, who went on to become a successful CEO of a huge tech conglomerate and build a digital world he calls the Grid, only for his most sophisticated creation to run amok and turn the Grid into a dystopian nightmare. The Grid is not a technicolor wonder, but a perpetually dark and rainy hell where programs are forced to compete in brutal gladiatorial fights to the death for the amusement of the ruling class.And yet, there is still a lot of optimism in Tron: Legacy, and it comes in the form of Quorra (Olivia Wilde), a digital lifeform born inside the Grid who&nbsp;marvels at&nbsp;her&nbsp;world — and especially the world outside the Grid — with child-like wonder. If the original Tron looked at technology with awe at a time when the prospect of a digital world connecting everyone was a nice thought, the sequel recognizes that we now look at the Internet differently. It is a dark, pessimistic place easily abused by those in power, yes, but there is still spectacle and beauty to be found. The film’s narrative may be driven by a young man hoping to reconnect with his father, but&nbsp;it works just as hard&nbsp;to make the audience&nbsp;sympathize with a digital creation who longs to witness a real sunrise.The Soundtrack Is an Absolute BangerWe’re just going to say it: The TRON: Legacy&nbsp;soundtrack is one of the best pieces of movie music to grace theaters in decades. Scored entirely by legendary French electronic duo Daft Punk, it seamlessly combines more typical orchestral fanfare with the their signature synthwavey staccatos, and the result is both modern and sophisticated. There are moody synths and percussion moments like the theme of the movie’s villain, and much of the score sounds like it was recorded using sounds from an actual computer.But Daft Punk don’t let their reputation and background define their work on the film. Sure, they pull from their signature repertoire for the banger of a dance track that plays during their big cameo scene, but they also demonstrate a knack for big, emotional pieces that feel fully operatic, like an even moodier version of John Carpenter if he worked with an 85-piece orchestra. The whole album is a fantastic listen from beginning to end, and it likely saw heavy rotation in the collections of more than just film score nerds.The Film Is a Giant Allegory for Movie Sequels(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures)Though the plot of both Tron and Tron: Legacy are simple at their cores, they both keep their big allegories just barely hidden beneath the surface. The original film was about a world of anthropomorphic computer programs waiting for the day a human user would arrive and save them from the evil program ruling over them; when Flynn enters the Grid and does exactly that, he’s regarded as a god. Legacy&nbsp;centers on Flynn’s reunion with his son Sam (Garrett Hedlund), but the film utilizes that reunion to tell a story about Flynn the god and his creation, and likewise about a movie sequel and its predecessor.When&nbsp;Legacy reintroduces the audience to&nbsp;Flynn, he’s living in exile in the Grid, cast out from its society by Clu — a program created in young Flynn’s own image. Clu’s entire purpose was to realize Flynn’s vision of a perfect system; he’s a&nbsp;reflection of a young Flynn’s hubris and pride. So it makes sense that Clu would then try to purge everything he saw as imperfect — including his creator. In turn, Clu tries to be the creator of his own world by tearing everything down and building it back up&nbsp;to his liking,&nbsp;by eradicating the programs known as “isomorphic algorithms” — or just ISOs — and brainwashing everyone else into following him. Clu may be severely misguided, but his entire reason for existence was to&nbsp;carry out his creator’s very specific bidding.In many ways, this creator/creation relationship is a mirror of the father/son one between Flynn and Sam. In the first act, we see Sam refuse to take his rightful place at his father’s company’s board, pranking them instead by stealing new products and releasing them for free before pulling a Batman-like escape from the building complex. Like Sam, Tron: Legacy also had to make its own name in the shadow of its predecessor’s legend. Trying to please fans of the original while offering something to new audiences is a near impossible standard to meet, and the film itself seems to anticipate any blowback in the form of Clu — a creation that did everything its creator wanted and yet failed to please him.The Scenery-Chewing Is Delicious(Photo by ©Walt Disney Pictures)One of the biggest changes made in Tron: Legacy was Jeff Bridges’ portrayal of Flynn. In the original, he wasn’t a hero. He went into the Grid to find evidence of a colleague stealing his code, but he didn’t care for the programs. The fact that, mathematically, Sam should have already been born by the time of the first film but never appeared in it is a clever bit of retconning to make Flynn even more of an absentee jerk. But when we see him again in Tron: Legacy, he’s part Steve Jobs, part The Dude from The Big Lebowski. And who doesn’t love The Dude?Kevin Flynn turned from an ambitious programmer to a wise sage who won’t abide people “messing with my Zen thing,” who reminisces about “jamming” and appreciates the miracle of “bio-digital jazz.” Bridges is clearly having fun with the character and the legacy the audience has in their head.Meanwhile, Michael Sheen shows up for a short but very memorable role as the shadowy nightclub owner Zuse, a digital love child of Ziggy Stardust and Frank-N-Furter from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. who swings his cane traipses through the End of the Line club fight scene like a cackling vaudevillian. It’s as if he dropped in from the set of another film entirely, but somehow, it just works.It Manages to Recapture the Visual Marvel of the Original(Photo by Douglas Curran/©Walt Disney Pictures)The original Tron was praised for its groundbreaking use of computer-generated visuals, paving the way for everything from Pixar movies to Avengers: Endgame. Though Tron: Legacy suffers a bit from the uncanny valley effect when it comes to Clu, the film still manages to present a massive,&nbsp;vibrant world of its own.Remember the disc fights&nbsp;from the original&nbsp;Tron?&nbsp;The sequel reimagines them by amping everything up to 11 with high-flying acrobatics and pristine “derezzing” effects. Remember the&nbsp;then-revolutionary light cycle&nbsp;races? Legacy&nbsp;takes the concept three-dimensional with a huge set piece that twists and turns on a multi-level racetrack and even finds time to work in a dogfighting sequence that feels straight out of Star Wars.But the film also ventures beyond the Grid and depicts a sprawling, apocalyptic world with busy, shadowy streets and alleyways, vast deserts, and otherworldly mountains. Watching the light cycles for the first time may not be as groundbreaking as it was in 1982, but Tron: Legacy takes full advantage of the technological advancements of the past few decades to present a cutting-edge world you would want to live in.&nbsp;The film is&nbsp;glossy and designed to the teeth, and a decade after its release, it’s still one of the slickest, most visually spectacular films to look at.Tron: Legacy&nbsp;was released in theaters on December 17, 2010.Thumbnail image by&nbsp;©Walt Disney PicturesOn an Apple device?

Even kids who didn’t rush to see it in theaters in June of that year, or didn’t grow up wearing down the tape on their VHS copy of the film, can recite the movie’s most famous lines – “Sweep the leg!” – and recall its most indelible images. But more than iconic one-liners and memorable fights, what sticks with us about&nbsp;The Karate Kid&nbsp;are its key relationships, namely those between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and mentor Mr. Miyagi (the late Pat Morita) and Daniel and Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).So fierce and so memorable was the rivalry between Daniel and Johnny that more than three decades after the first&nbsp;Karate Kid&nbsp;movie was released, YouTube Originals re-ignited it for the streaming series&nbsp;Cobra Kai, the second season of which has just dropped online. Except now the tables had turned, and one-time-bully Johnny was the sympathetic anti-hero.As we gear up for another round with Daniel and Johnny – and if their coy responses to our questions indicate, a potential slew of cameos from fans’ favorite characters – we sat down with Macchio and Zabka to go back to the beginning.&nbsp;In this oral history of&nbsp;The Karate Kid, the two men recall the time they met as kids, their pre-Karate Kid&nbsp;experience with martial arts (“I had no technique, I had no idea”), working with Pat Morita, and the impact the movie would have on their teen years and their lives. From audition to their climactic on-screen showdown, this is Macchio and Zabka’s story of the time they became the world’s most famous karate kids.What follows is a history of The Karate Kid (1984) and reflection upon the film, drawn from a sit-down interview with Macchio and Zabka.ALSO WATCH:&nbsp;ORAL HISTORY OF&nbsp;COBRA KAI&nbsp;WITH RALPH MACCHIO AND WILLIAM ZABKA“As a kid, you’re jumping around and fighting imaginary bad guys, you know?”Ralph Macchio: “When I was about 10 or so, for Christmas I got a certificate for the local jiu-jitsu school of self defense — obviously, mom and dad said, ‘We gotta help this guy out a little bit,’ I don’t know — for me and my brother. So we went, and I took a handful of lessons. I liked it.”William Zabka: “My relationship with karate before Karate Kid was all in my imagination. As a kid growing up, I would just run around and do fake fights, and I’d be in the backyard with sticks, but I had no technique, I had no idea. I took no classes before Karate Kid. I was a wrestler in high school, so I was limber, and I had a lot of conditioning, so I was prepared to learn the training for karate, and martial arts but I didn’t know any real [moves]. It was all in my mind. As a kid, you’re jumping around and fighting imaginary bad guys, you know?”“I can’t guarantee you anything right now, but if I were you, I’d take some karate lessons.”Macchio: “My first conversation about being Daniel LaRusso was with our director John Avildsen, who I auditioned for, and … it’s the first time ever I ever read the words to that character. It’s Avildsen explaining the character, explaining what he’s going through, explaining the story leading up to my audition scene, which was the scene from the film where Daniel wakes up after the skeleton fight at the fence and Miyagi saves the day, and he’s asking all these questions.(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)That’s my earliest memory of the character. I didn’t have the part yet, but I did remember John Avildsen saying to me, ‘I can’t guarantee you anything right now, but if I were you, I’d take some karate lessons.’ Which doesn’t often happen. That was a pretty exciting moment. And then a couple more hoops to jump through, and here I am, I got to be Daniel LaRusso.”“Watch your mouth, asshole.”Zabka: “Through my manager, I got a phone call to come in, they want to talk to you. So I went to Columbia Pictures at that time, and drove through the gate and went to a bungalow. I just came directly from the gym, and I was in my tank top, probably wearing a headband or something. I went in and they said, ‘There’s this movie called Karate Kid. We think you’d be great for this part of Johnny. Go home and read it, and come back and audition tomorrow for John Avildsen.’So I went home and read the script, and Johnny’s this karate master and he’s a motorcycle gang leader. He’s the bad guy. I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I don’t know karate. I don’t know how ride motorcycles.’ But there was one scene in the script that I really connected to, and somehow I just connected to the character. I ran it through in my living room a bunch of times, and then the next day went and met John Avildsen. He was sitting in a chair. He had his camera. He always had his video camera filming everything. And it was a scene cut out of the movie, where I hand Daniel a death certificate at the water fountain. And he said, ‘What’s this for?’ And I go, ‘You gotta get your mommy to sign it so you could be in the tournament with the big boys.’ And he says, ‘I thought it was supposed to be no contact.’ And I say, ‘Accidents happen.’(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)And then I walk away, and he goes, ‘Hey, you think he might be wrong?’ And I go, ‘Who?’ And he goes, ‘Your instructor, your sensei, you think he might be wrong?’ And then my line is, ‘Watch your mouth, asshole.’ So on that line, that’s when I walked over to John Avildsen and grabbed him — which you don’t do — and I said, ‘Watch your mouth, asshole.’ And I pushed him back, and the room was still. And that’s where the scene was supposed to end, but everybody was still watching me, so I improv’d and went to the door. I said, ‘Read it and weep. I’ll see you in the tournament.’ And went out in the waiting room, and came in, took my headband off, which I was wearing, and I said, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry. That was Johnny. I’m Billy.’ He goes, ‘So how old are you?’ He got kind of interested, and he goes, ‘You’re a little taller than our karate kid.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, well, Bruce Lee was smaller than Kareem Abdul Jabbar.’ He goes, ‘Well, you got a point. All right, thanks, kid.’ And that was that.”“We were friendly, but we weren’t [best friends].”Macchio: “[Zabka and I] trained differently. We both trained with Pat Johnson, who did all the fight choreography. He’s the referee in The Karate Kid film. He would train myself and Pat Morita in a classic Okinawan style, and he would train Billy and the Cobra Kai guys in a more aggressive style of martial arts. Most of the scenes we did together we were either yelling at each other or I was getting my ass kicked. So we were friendly, but we weren’t [best friends]. I had the whole Miyagi side of the story, and the romance side of the story. The movie was always in three sections for me. We’ve become closer friends over the years and certainly when Pat passed away we became closer friends just through the loss of him and moving forward, and the fact that this film has stood the test of time. It’s a big part of not only American cinema, but also pop culture. And then here we are back again in tandem. So it’s been quite a journey.”Zabka: “My memory of working with Ralph was we were best friends instantly. I’m surprised to hear you say that we were separated. We have to talk after this.I think John Avildsen really created the chemistry by casting all the right people for this. He cast the right Tommy, Bobby, Dutch, and Jimmy. … It was almost like he created this little universe for us. We hung around all the time. We went to lunch every day. We rode motorcycles together, we trained together. We really got into a pack mentality. Ralph and I did our fight scene for the tournament every day we could for three months, so we were working together constantly. I mean, feet and fists were flying, so we had to take care of each other in that way. But the Cobra Kais, they were like my brothers, and they still are in real life.”“It’s like a strawberry shortcake and a cannoli.”Macchio: “Ali with an ‘i.’ That character is arguably what starts the rivalry, the feud, if you will. Like all good wars, a beautiful woman, and that’s the end of that. [Elisabeth Shue] was just coming out of the gate at that point. And John Avildsen would see me and Lisa — Lisa Shue was what we called her — and he would say, ‘You two have no place being together. It’s like a strawberry shortcake and a cannoli.’ That’s how he described LaRusso and Ali Mills. It was fun. It was the birth of those young characters, young love, high school, adolescence, all that stuff.”(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)Zabka: “We got along great. She was tough, she was athletic, she was a soccer player. Really physical, and she was just an all-natural girl and beautiful and cool, and we became friends. The only time I got connected in the whole movie with a punch or a kick [was during] the country club scene where Daniel comes in and gets the spaghetti on him, and then I laugh and Lisa punches me in the jaw. Every single time she connected, like, boom. Pat Johnson’s like, ‘No, step back and swing.’ But I think every single time she hit my jaw. In fact, when Daniel falls down in the spaghetti and I’m laughing, I’m half laughing at the fact that she just hit me. Yeah, she was great.”“What Pat Morita taught me more than anything is not to take things for granted, to revel in the opportunity that you have.”Macchio: “I mean, with Pat Morita, everything he brought — I was truly witnessing the right actor in the right role, never taking it for granted, feeling a great responsibility, meaning him feeling a great responsibility playing a Japanese-American in that film at that time. And I always bring this information to the table, that The Karate Kid is the first mainstream major motion picture that ever dealt with the World War II Japanese internment camps.The movie is so often thought of as pop culture, ‘Get him a body bag,’ crane kicks, waxing on, and catching flies with chopsticks, but it also has all these other deeper elements to it, which is why it’s, in my view, a great film. What he taught me more than anything is not to take things for granted, to revel in the opportunity that you have.There was an ease of working with him in those scenes. There’s something relaxed about it. He would talk to John Avildsen or myself about the headband, which was called the hachimaki. Using that, taking it out of his pocket [to] use it as a napkin, or a handkerchief to wipe [your brow], but then you’d also wear it, and then we’d put it on for training purposes. Daniel always wore it for that.(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)All those moments and experiencing him teaching us [about] that culture, and wanting to pay homage and respect to the Japanese-American culture — Okinawan in this case — taught me that those moments of ease that we had just fed into the chemistry that we had that I didn’t even know we had. It wasn’t like I was trying to have good chemistry with Pat Morita, or he was really trying hard to be a good actor with me. It just organically was that way. And what I learned from that is when that just happens organically, it usually will translate. It just is one of those meant-to-be partnerships that was really special — something I’ll have forever, and that we’ll all have forever. It’s really sweet, and I’m the lucky one. That’s how I look at it.”“Martin Kove came in character with a black belt on. For all I knew, he was the real deal.”Zabka: “I meet Martin Kove in character as Kreese. So I never met the actor Martin Kove. ‘Hi, I’m Martin. I’m playing your sensei.’ That was deliberate. Pat Johnson, who trained us for all the fight stuff, before Martin was cast, he played Kreese. And he trained me as Kreese, and he would be super intense and in your face and louder and bigger than even Marty was. He put the imprint of who Kreese was on me. And then when Martin Kove came in, it was in the dojo scene. …He came in character with a black belt on. For all I knew, he was the real deal.The scene where Ralph walks into the dojo, and I whisper to him that somebody’s here, I mean, you could see that they had more of a relationship than just sensei. There was a personal relationship that happened, that’s continuing now. But then when he says, ‘Sweep the leg.’ That moment, it was Marty Kove that caused that reaction in me, which was just to check him out. I mean, he was so intense and so big. A good actor’s going to draw out the best from you. So he filled the shoes and sucked it out of me. And only now [do] I know Marty. I think if I knew him as I know him now, then, I might’ve laughed in his face. No, I’m just kidding. Just kidding, Marty!”(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)“It was like a dance routine, and we had it down.”Macchio: “It was about a week we shot the All Valley Tournament. I remember it vividly. We spent part of the entire shoot, say, three months, just rehearsing those fight sequences and our final fight. It was like a ballet. I mean, it really was. We were trained so well. We’d be further apart. And as we’d get better and better, we had the pads on. And then we slowly but surely got closer and closer.There weren’t a lot of changes. Some last minute, ‘Oh, we need this to be a little this,’ but for the most part it was like a dance routine, and we had it down. It was a great moment for me, because I win. The character wins the fight. For Billy, his character loses the fight. But for us to perform that the first time, six cameras, John Avildsen, who had directed Rocky, among others. You were in the hands of the best. And we filled up the arena with the extras, and they saw it for the first time. And we did it for the first time in front of a crowd, and that is a big part of the base, the spine, of what that scene is. I mean, there’s all the other cuts. We got back and got pieces, but that was an amazing experience, just that. You could run into trouble with the amount of adrenaline, because you’re just so jacked up, but we were so well-trained. It was a tango, and it was awesome.”(Photo by ©Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection)Zabka: “It was electric. It changed from the rehearsals, where we were at one energy, to step … It’s like doing theater, I guess. You step out and there’s the audience, and it just brings you up to a whole other place that you didn’t expect to happen. So I remember doing it. I think we did the whole fight … I don’t remember shooting in blocks. We went from the beginning of the fight to the end of the fight. Like, the whole thing. It wasn’t like, ‘OK, here’s this kick. Here’s that piece.’ I mean, we went out and performed this whole fight. In the breaks, I remember when they would say, ‘Cut.’ And there was a scene where Pat Johnson says, ‘Take a knee.’ Because he’s hurt. And I’m sitting there, and the cameras were cut for a moment, and I can look up and see the fans. They’re like, ‘Boo, boo.’ And my mom was sitting in the audience, and she’s like, ‘my baby!’ And I’m like, ‘It’s OK, mom. It’s OK. I’m acting.’ Yeah, but it was awesome. The fans, the people, the energy.There were actually some real martial artists there, real karate schools, and a real mini tournament happening in the background to make it look authentic. There’s kids in pads sparring and all that. They had an actual tournament that day. It’s kind of like a fake one, but real. They had real kids sparring with each other in the background. So the environment was authentic to what a real karate tournament would’ve been like, and then we step out with our black belts. I remember walking out with my black belt, going, ‘I’m such a fraud right now. If they only knew.’ I’m walking in, and then they’re like, ‘Who’s that kid?’ I’m, like, the actor that has done this for three months, and I hope I don’t kick Ralph.”“All of a sudden there it was, and it was great.”Macchio: “‘You’re the Best Around’ was, I think, a Rocky 3 reject. … Bill Conti did the score for both Rocky and The Karate Kid — spectacular, the underscoring. But I think that was a song that didn’t make it into an earlier film. It might’ve been from the first Rocky.What I didn’t know was the music when Daniel is training in the water, trying to stand on one leg and the waves are pummeling him, I remember that day. Bill Conti was on set on the beach, and he was playing for Avildsen the type of classical music he was thinking of. And so I got a glimpse of that, which helps, because then when you’re doing the scene, you envision the sound of it, because the score is a big component in storytelling.”“I got my movie. We don’t need to shoot it.”Zabka: “Originally [the film ended with] the scene where Kreese chokes me out and Miyagi saves all of us. And then lights were out after we finished the tournament and John Avildsen said, ‘I got my movie. We don’t need to shoot it.’ And I guess called Jerry Weintraub, and said, ‘I don’t think we need to shoot that scene.’ He goes, ‘Alright, go home.’”Macchio: “What’s interesting is at that point, I think, if memory serves— and it does get foggy after decades and decades — but I believe at that point, they said, ‘Listen, if we ever do one, we can always open a sequel with that scene.’ And I don’t know why, but in my head, I remember hearing those words from, whether it was Avildsen, or Weintraub, that their thought was … they were ahead of the game as far as starting the sequel, assuming we were going to have a hit.”ALSO WATCH:&nbsp;ORAL HISTORY OF&nbsp;COBRA KAI&nbsp;WITH RALPH MACCHIO AND WILLIAM ZABKAThe Karate Kid&nbsp;was released in theaters June 22, 1984#1The Karate Kid (1984) 89%#1Adjusted Score: 92.019% Critics Consensus: Utterly predictable and wholly of its time, but warm, sincere, and difficult to resist, due in large part to Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio's relaxed chemistry.Synopsis: Newly arrived in California from New Jersey, teenager Daniel (Ralph Macchio) almost immediately runs afoul of karate-trained high school bullies....

In his mind, Craven was following the precedent set by Tobe Hooper in 1974 and John Carpenter in 1978 – The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween&nbsp;both featured hulking, unstoppable man-monsters. Craven even interviewed Kane Hodder – the man who would wear the hockey mask once Jason Voorhees took center stage in the Friday the 13th&nbsp;series – for the part.But a skinny, young actor named Robert Englund thought that most child abusers were weasels and creeps, not hulks. So he offered a different take on the lecherous Freddy Krueger, and not only would Nightmare take off because of it, but horror movies themselves would be changed forever.Released 35 years ago this week, A Nightmare on Elm Street took the concept of the bad guy as the marquee character – the one people not only came to see, but to actively cheer on – to whole new levels. The faceless, voiceless, mask-obscured killing machines that preceded Nightmare&nbsp;had to make way&nbsp;for a mugging, self-referential, hammy villain-hero.The Diva Who Shunned the MaskIn the end credits of Halloween, the character of Michael Myers isn’t even listed by name. He’s called “The Shape.” This is significant because Michael isn’t meant to&nbsp;“be”&nbsp;anyone. The whole point is that he just is, a silent menace in the periphery as the movie focuses on the guilt-ridden Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and high school good girl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). With his slow movement, white, expressionless face, and complete silence, Michael is a terrifying blank slate.A few years later, Friday the 13th&nbsp;would completely obscure its main villain until the very end – revealing at last that the murders were committed by a revenge-obsessed woman scarred by the apparent death of her son, Jason, many years before. When Jason himself took&nbsp;the spotlight in the next few installments, he, too, was a silent, expressionless entity who at first wears a nondescript bag over his head before he even gets his signature goalie mask (in Part III).And yet, by 1986’s Friday the 13th&nbsp;Part 6: Jason Lives, we saw&nbsp;the movie literally opening with a tongue-in-cheek James Bond parody:What happened? Freddy happened.A Nightmare on Elm Street had the same bland, suburban setting as Halloween&nbsp;and a similar gang of horny teens as the Friday films, but there was a key difference. Freddy wasn’t just scary, he was darkly witty. He was creative. He was, well, a thousand times more interesting than anyone he killed.Sure, people went to horror movies for the killer or the monster – this had been true since the 1950s. You went to see The Blob because you wanted to see the blob. But this was different. Audiences liked Freddy. He was the star, not just the threat, and things only got hammier as the franchise went along. It was because, rather than going with yet another “big man” monster, Craven and Englund delivered a performance. Freddy was a theatrical diva.Would any other slasher work so well in a Fresh Prince video?The other competitors had no choice but to follow suit. Although somewhat hamstrung by their lack of personality, Jason and Michael still went through increasingly bizarre and laughable incarnations in an effort to keep up with Freddy. This is why&nbsp;we eventually got cyborg space-Jason and Busta Rhymes electrocuting Michael Myers&nbsp;in the crotch after he shouts, “Trick or treat, motherf—er!”Post-Nightmare, movie slashers had to be more than just killers. They needed to be in the spotlight, not the shadows. One-liners, theatricality, and insane death scenarios all became requirements. We’d never have IT’s Pennywise or Scream’s Ghostface without Freddy.So to celebrate the mugging, one-liner-spewing dream-weaver on his 35th&nbsp;anniversary, let’s run down his greatest hits.The Five Best Freddy Kills1) A Nightmare on Elm Street: “Watch this.”Freddy’s first outing really sets the tone, and this scene has it all. Rather than simply stalking and killing Tina (Amanda Wyss), he toys with her, throwing out one-liners and a few party tricks&nbsp;as he leads her to an overly elaborate demise. Freddy is playing to the crowd.2) Nightmare On Elm Street 4: The Dream Master: “Wanna suck face?”Freddy kills an asthmatic girl by dropping this one-liner before literally sucking the air out of her lungs and leaving her a deflated corpse.3) Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare: “Let’s trip out.”Freddy’s satirical take&nbsp;on the “This is your brain…” PSAs from the ’80s and ’90s – complete with a cameo from former Freddy victim Johnny Depp – and an extended Super Mario Bros.-inspired kill is all the proof you need that he was a frustrated comedian.4) A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child: “Bon Appétit!”Dressing up as a chef and strapping a girl with an eating disorder into a high chair for the sole purpose of force-feeding her to death in front of her overbearing mother? Can you imagine Leatherface putting in this kind of multi-layered effort?5) A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors: “Welcome to prime time, b—h!”A scene that begins with former talk show host Dick Cavett turning into Freddy before killing Zsa Zsa Gabor can’t possibly get any more insane, can it? Oh, yes. Freddy literally pops out of the TV&nbsp;and pulls Jennifer (Penelope Sudrow) face-first into the set with his mechanical TV arms.

If you’re looking for a holiday-appropriate movie to watch with the family while all your turkey and stuffing is digesting, feel free to pick one (or more) of these Thanksgiving-centric flicks.Home for the Holidays — Written by \"Buckaroo Banzai\" scribe WD Richter and directed by the multi-talented Jodie Foster, \"Home for the Holidays\" is absolutely stuffed with great actors. Sort of a less slapsticky and more realistic version of \"Christmas Vacation,\" it’s about a stressed-out woman (Holly Hunter) who returns to the roost to enjoy(?) a manic Thanksgiving dinner with her entire extended family. Even if the movie stunk (which it so absolutely does not) it would be worth seeing for a cast that includes Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning, Robert Downey Jr., Dylan McDermott, Steve Guttenberg, Claire Danes, Austin Pendleton, David Strathairn, Cynthia Stevenson, and Amy Yasbeck. (Tell me that wouldn’t be a fun crew to eat turkey with.)Pieces of April — This endearing 2003 indie from Peter Hedges (\"About a Boy\") stars Katie Holmes as an estranged daughter who invites her skeptical family for a Thanksgiving feast at her tiny little apartment. One half of the film sees April’s family struggling to make it in time for dinner, and the other half deals with poor frazzled April as she desperately tries to build an edible turkey dinner. In addition to some of Ms. Holmes’ very best work, \"April\" also features fantastic performances from Oliver Platt, Patricia Clarkson, Derek Luke, and Sean Hayes.What’s Cooking? — From director Gurinder Chadha (\"Bend It Like Beckham\") comes this tale of four separate families, and the various preparations they make to have a solid Thanksgiving affair. Jewish, African-American, Vietnamese, and Latino families populate this holiday charmer, and the cast is another stellar ensemble: Dennis Haysbert, Alfre Woodard, Joan Chen, Mercedes Ruehl, Lainie Kazan, Maury Chaykin, Kyra Sedgwick, and Julianna Margulies keep the guest list colorful, and there’s plenty of wit, wisdom, and warmth (and even a few surprises) in this holiday treat.Hannah and Her Sisters — Opening and closing with a pair of Thanksgiving dinners, the heavily-ensembled Woody Allen comedy is still considered one of the director’s very best films. Winner of three Oscars (for screenplay and the performances by Michael Caine and Dianne Wiest) and a nominee for four more, \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" is a razor-sharp and hilariously insightful story about one extended family and the non-stop stress the relatives cause one another. Also on board are Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey, Carrie Fisher, Max von Sydow, Julie Kavner, Daniel Stern, Maureen O’Sullivan, Joanna Gleason, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Even the hardcore Woody-philes consider this one of his finest screenplays.Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles — If it’s me you’re asking, PT&amp;A is the #1 finest Thanksgiving movie ever made, mainly because it’s \"about\" nothing more than finding a way to make it home for the holidays. Steve Martin and the late, great John Candy star as a pair of astonishingly mismatched traveling partners who’ll stop at nothing to make it home in time for some turkey. (For my money, this is John Hughes‘ finest film, just barely ahead of the teenage trifecta of \"Sixteen Candles,\" \"The Breakfast Club,\" and \"Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\") Featuring tons of laughs, lots of great sights along the way, and a sweet-natured finale that always makes my eyeballs a little moist, \"Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles\" is a comedy classic for any season … but it really does work best in November. (If you’re watching this one with the family, please be sure to cover the kiddies’ ears when Mr. Martin arrives, unhappily, at a car rental kiosk. Trust me.) Also keep eyes peeled for hilarious little cameos by Kevin Bacon, Martin Ferrero, Dylan Baker, Michael McKean, Edie McClurg, and Ben Stein.So there’s my Turkey Day quintet. Sorry for leaving \"Son in Law\" off the list, but I was doing \"best Thanksgiving\" movies and not \"least awful Pauly Shore movies.\" (Maybe we can do that one on Pauly’s birthday.) Anyway, on behalf of everyone here at Rotten Tomatoes, I’d like to wish all our readers, and their friends &amp; relatives &amp; acquaintances &amp; pets &amp; non-annoying co-workers, a very safe &amp; happy holiday. And if I left out any of your favorite Thanksgiving movies (there really aren’t all that many!), feel free to leave ’em in the comments section. We’ll need five more for next year!","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"YouTube, Emmys, Academy, RT, space, Paquin, golden, Company","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"a-day-to-give-thanks-for-good-thanksgiving-movies"},{"id":"47614336341991","title":"Jared Leto Wants to go from Blade Runner to Tron","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jared Leto Wants to go from Blade Runner to Tronby Erik Davis | October 2, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Walt Disney Motion Pictures)Earlier this year it was reported that Jared Leto was among the names circling the third&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;movie, a project that’s been hot and cold at different&nbsp;times following the somewhat lukewarm reception of 2010’s&nbsp;Tron: Legacy&nbsp;(51% at Rotten Tomatoes; $400 million in worldwide grosses). While we still don’t have a firm release date or cast, Leto — out promoting&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049&nbsp;— says he’s definitely excited about jumping into the&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;universe and expanding upon it, much like he’s done with&nbsp;Blade Runner.“For me, when I was a kid, it was&nbsp;Blade Runner, it was&nbsp;Tron, it was&nbsp;The Shining,” Leto told Rotten Tomatoes. “It was these kind of elevated genre movies really blew my mind, as well as films like&nbsp;Clockwork Orange&nbsp;and Scorsese [movies] and the early work of Brian De Palma. But&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;is another one that I feel like is a world that we’re not done with yet. There’s so much more to explore and to see there. I would absolutely love to expand upon the world of&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;and see what we could do to bring that to life.”So What Would That Third&nbsp;Tron Movie Look Like?According to&nbsp;Legacy&nbsp;director Joseph Kosinski, the current idea revolves around an all-out invasion film, with parts of it taking place in the real world and other parts inside the Tron world.“What I’m excited about is the concept, which is an invasion movie from inside the machine coming out as opposed to one we’ve usually seen,” Kosinski told&nbsp;Collider&nbsp;earlier this year. “So we hinted at that at the end of&nbsp;Legacy&nbsp;with Quorra coming out, but the idea for&nbsp;Ascension&nbsp;was a movie that was, the first act was in the real world, the second act was in the world of Tron, or multiple worlds of Tron, and the third act was totally in the real world.”As for Leto’s role (assuming he remains onboard and the film becomes a reality), all we know is he’d be playing a character named Ares, according to the original&nbsp;report. In Greek mythology, Ares is the god of war, and so it would seem like Leto might be playing a villain — or, like he does in&nbsp;Blade Runner 2049, a character whose presence is both good and bad, depending on the situation.Do you want to see a third&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;movie?","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"HBO, Nickelodeon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"jared-leto-wants-to-go-from-blade-runner-to-tron"},{"id":"47614353637357","title":"Feud: Bette and Joan Fans Are Thrilled to Meet ‘Mommie Dearest’","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Feud: Bette and Joan Fans Are Thrilled to Meet 'Mommie Dearest'As the Crawford and Davis feud intensifies, fans speculate about which star will win an Emmy for the series.by Andrea Reiher | March 19, 2017 |  CommentsThe third episode of Feud: Bette and Joan was all about “Mommie Dearest,” but not exactly&nbsp;the Faye Dunaway movie based on Christina Crawford’s memoir.Rather, it focused on Bette Davis’ (Susan Sarandon) and Crawford’s (Jessica Lange) strained relationships with their respective daughters —&nbsp;though in doing so, it did have to touch on Christina and Joan’s allegedly horrible relationship, which is something the fans have been dying to get to on the show.First of all, we must point out that in honor of Davis’ pancake makeup look for What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, fans have taken to watching Feud while wearing those kind of creepy white facial masks, which is ah-mazing.Face masks during #feudfx just feels right. 💅🏼 https://t.co/TEfyQ934gf pic.twitter.com/p7w4KDM7EO— Vinny ❄️ (@rwiggumrules) March 20, 2017When you honor the legacy of #betteandjoan with face masks you need straws for your wine #FeudFX @FeudFX pic.twitter.com/WfXPCAS5PU— Katie Thomas (@KTtheUnabridged) March 20, 2017But back to the Mommie Dearest of it all: Suffice to say fans were pumped.Mommy dearest is real #FeudFX pic.twitter.com/XR7grFIY9r— Just Sway (@JSwayArt) March 20, 2017lol nice to see we're finally getting into \"Mommie Dearest\" territory!!😄 @FeudFX #FeudFX pic.twitter.com/mkeSHmpsD8— Lady Jane (@LadyJaneAsher) March 20, 2017Joan was messed up from the start smh #FeudFX pic.twitter.com/4IdeG6theu— Black-TV-Critic (@Black_TV_Critic) March 20, 2017Davis’ daughter B.D.

Find out everything about Apple originals (plus plenty more shows in the works) in this rundown of what TV the tech company has in production or development.by Jean Bentley | September 11, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Apple)Netflix, Amazon, and now Hulu&nbsp;have both become synonymous with prestige TV, but there’s one giant tech company not far behind the two streaming services —&nbsp;at least in theory. In the past year, Apple has made moves to compete with Netflix, Hulu, and premium cable channels (like HBO and Showtime) for the peak TV crown in 2019.With more TV series —&nbsp;and places to watch them —&nbsp;than ever, Apple is putting a reported $1 billion toward adding to the peak TV pile. While the company began its foray into scripted series with two current shows offered through Apple Music —&nbsp;the tech-themed Shark Tank–esque reality competition Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke: The Series —&nbsp;the competition really ramped up when it hired veteran TV executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht in June 2017. The duo formerly ran Sony Pictures Television, the studio that brought the world Breaking Bad and The Crown.Van Amburg and Erlicht&nbsp;have engaged in aggressive bidding wars for some of TV’s hottest projects,&nbsp;according to a New York Times report, and will likely surpass its reported budget in doing so. With&nbsp;more than a dozen projects currently in the works, it’s clear the company is ready to spend money to compete with TV’s current titans. (Planet of the Apps, which featured guest judges including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, didn’t get much critical acclaim when it debuted in June 2017. Carpool Karaoke: The Series, a spin-off of James Corden’s popular Late Late Show segment, has been ordered for a second season.)(Photo by Apple)Apple held a star-studded launch event at its Cupertino, Calif. headquarters in March to announce its new streaming product and original series offerings.&nbsp;Stars including Steven Spielberg, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steve Carell, Jason Momoa, Alfre Woodard, J.J. Abrams, Sara Bareilles, and even Big Bird were present for the Apple TV+ presentation. The service is scheduled to roll out&nbsp;its programming&nbsp;on Nov. 1.RELATED: “Everything To Know About Apple TV+“Below, we’ve rounded up a list of all the titles&nbsp;that are headed to or intended for the tech giant. Some&nbsp;are in development, while the others are series orders (and have even completed filming). Read on to find out who the players are and more about the shows.UPDATED (9/11/19):&nbsp;Apple’s latest event revealed pricing and launch date information for Apple TV+. Check out the updated list of everything we know below, including which shows will debut at launch, which are coming soon, and which are still in the works.Launching Nov. 1The Morning Show(Photo by Apple TV+)Talent: Witherspoon and Aniston are both set to star in and executive produce the drama, which was one of the first scripted series Apple announced. While Jay Carson (House of Cards) was originally signed on to write the project, he has since departed and Bates Motel boss Kerry Ehrin took over.&nbsp;Steve Carell&nbsp;will play the male lead.What it’s about: The morning show drama has already been ordered for two seasons and 20 episodes and will draw background from Brian Stelter’s book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: With the star power and bona fides of Big Little Lies star and producer Witherspoon and Friends vet Aniston, plus the creative power of Ehrin, it’s almost too big to fail. Then again, the drama surrounding Carson’s departure is never a good sign…See(Photo by Apple TV+)Talent: Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard star in the series, which was written by&nbsp;Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight&nbsp;and directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games).What it’s about:&nbsp;The show is set in a post-apocalyptic future where the human race has lost the sense of sight.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit:&nbsp;Momoa is a fan-favorite star, and with such high-caliber talent attached, this could go very, very well. (But since it’s got such an ambitious plot, there’s also plenty of opportunity for things to go very, very wrong.For All Mankind(Photo by Apple)Talent: Battlestar Galactica and Outlander creator Ronald D. Moore has teamed up with Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi (Fargo) for the still-untitled series.What it’s about: The drama, which has been ordered straight to series, explores what would have happened if the global space race had never ended.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Between BSG and Outlander, Moore certainly has both the cred and the goods to assume he’ll deliver on this one, too.Dickinson(Photo by Apple)Talent: Hailee Steinfeld and Jane Krakowski are set to star as young poet&nbsp;Emily Dickinson and her mother, respectively.What it’s about: The series is a half-hour comedy that “is set during Emily Dickinson’s era with a modern sensibility and tone. It takes viewers into the world of Emily, audaciously exploring the constraints of society, gender, and family from the perspective of a budding writer who doesn’t fit in to her own time through her imaginative point of view,” per Deadline.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: The star power is great, but the series logline is a little out there. We’ll have to wait and see to reserve judgement.Helpsters(Photo by Apple)Talent: Sesame Workshop is producing the series, which was announced at the Apple event by none other than Big Bird.What it’s about: The preschool-targeted series will be an educational program about coding.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: If Sesame Street can continue educating children a half a century after its original launch, there’s no reason to believe this new series won’t work.Snoopy in Space/Peanuts&nbsp;STEM Series(Photo by Courtesy of DHX Media)Talent: Charlie Brown, Lucy, Pigpen, Snoopy — you know, all your favorites from&nbsp;Charles M. Schulz’s Peanuts gang — will be the focus of this new series.What it’s about: The first series from Apple’s deal acquiring the rights to the famous characters will be a science- and math-oriented short featuring Snoopy as an astronaut.&nbsp;This and other new originals with be produced with DHX Media, a Canadian production company that owns a large portion of children’s content, also including&nbsp;Yo Gabba Gabba!&nbsp;and the Teletubbies.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: You can’t really go wrong with such beloved characters.Ghostwriter(Photo by Apple TV+)Talent:&nbsp;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran Brett DaltonWhat it’s about:&nbsp;According to the official description, this is a “reinvention” of the classic ’90s children’s series following “four kids who are brought together by a mysterious ghost in a neighborhood bookstore, and must team up to release fictional characters from works of literature.”Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit:&nbsp;While beloved to a very small group of people who grew up in the 1990s, the series doesn’t necessarily have much recognition outside that circle. We’ll have to wait until it debuts to find out whether the concept transfers to a new generation.Launching SoonM. Night Shyamalan Thriller, Servant(Photo by Apple)Talent: M. Night Shyamalan is executive producing and will direct the first episode of this series, from writer Tony Basgallop.What it’s about: As if the king of big twists would reveal anything about his psychological thriller! Good to note: The first season will consist of 10 half-hour episodes and has been ordered straight to series.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: This one, like Shayamalan’s movies, depends on execution. Will it be a Sixth Sense or a Lady in the Water? Only time will tell.Truth Be Told(Photo by Apple)Talent: Octavia Spencer is set to star in the drama, which is produced by Reese Witherspoon, created and written by Nichelle Tramble Spellman (The Good Wife, Justified), and based on true-crime novel by Kathleen Barber. Sarah Koenig, creator of the podcast phenomenon Serial, is consulting. Aaron Paul plays the male lead.What it’s about: Truth Be Told (formerly, “Are You Sleeping“) provides a unique glimpse into America’s obsession with true-crime podcasts and challenges its viewers to consider the consequences when the pursuit of justice is placed on a public stage. Spencer plays a disgraced journalist who returns to her hometown and revisits a case in which she played a pivotal role in her early career. Paul plays a man Spencer’s character helped put behind bars — but he could potentially be innocent of the crime.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: There’s a reason true-crime stories are so engrossing, and if this series can capture the source of that fascination, then&nbsp;it should&nbsp;thrive.Little America(Photo by Apple)Talent: Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, the husband-and-wife team behind indie hit The Big Sick, are developing this series for Apple.What it’s about: The anthology series is based on Epic Magazine’s series of the same name, described as “a small, collective portrait of America’s immigrants — and thereby a portrait of America itself.” Nanjiani announced at the Apple TV+ launch that the scripted series is being made solely by immigrants or children of immigrants, and will focus on everyday people.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit:&nbsp;Given the tender eye and charm they gave their feature film debut, the Oscar-nominated duo are probably a safe bet.Release Date TBDAmazing Stories(Photo by Apple)Talent: Steven Spielberg is on board to revive his ’80s anthology series. Bryan Fuller (American Gods) and Hart Hanson (Bones) were originally on board to run the show, which was ordered for 10 episodes, but both departed in February 2018.What it’s about: The sci-fi/horror/supernatural anthology series originally ran on NBC.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Despite the talent involved, the creative departures could mean there’s more behind-the-scenes drama —&nbsp;which can lead to on-screen discord —&nbsp;afoot. Plus, the series sounds more like a pulpy guilty pleasure than prestige awards bait. Still, it was the first new original series Apple teased at its big announcement, so there seems to be plenty of faith in the series.Little Voice(Photo by Apple)Talent: Tony-, Grammy-, and Emmy-nominated singer/songwriter/actress Sara Bareilles is writing the music (and could possibly star) in the J.J. Abrams-produced half-hour show, which received a straight-to-series order in June 2018.What it’s about: Based on the singer’s first album, The Hollywood Reporter described the series as “a love letter to the diverse musicality of New York” that “explores the universal journey of finding your authentic voice in your early 20s.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: In addition to Bareilles and Abrams, the series will be run by Bareilles’ Waitress collaborator Jessie Nelson (who will also write and direct the first episode). With Waitress, Bareilles’ six Grammy nominees, and Abrams’ pedigree, this series has all the elements needed for success.Oprah Docuseries(Photo by Apple)Talent: In addition to re-launching her book club for Apple TV+, Oprah Winfrey is producing multiple documentaries for the&nbsp;service.What it’s about:&nbsp;The first projects include a documentary on workplace abuse, and a series about mental health.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit:&nbsp;Anyone who’s known by single moniker has the star power to pretty much launch anything they want. Come on, it’s Oprah! She won’t let us down.Time Bandits(Photo by Stefania D'Alessandro/WireImage)Talent: Taika Waititi is set to co-write and direct the pilot for the project, which will also involve the film’s original writer/director, Terry Gilliam.What it’s about: While still in the development stages, the potential series is an adaptation of Gilliam’s 1981 fantasy film of the same name, about a young boy who joins a group of renegade time-traveling dwarves.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Well, the original film is Certified Fresh, and at least five of Waititi’s most recent projects are CF or Fresh on the Tomatometer too. The odds are definitely in his favor.Untitled Brie Larson CIA Project(Photo by Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection)Talent: Oscar winner and Marvel superhero Brie Larson is set to star.What it’s about: The new series is “a look at a young woman’s journey in the CIA told through the prism of her closest relationships,” per Variety. The series is based on the experiences of real-life undercover CIA operative Amaryllis Fox and her upcoming memoir Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Since 2010, Larson’s been a part of a whopping 11 Certified Fresh films, with an additional&nbsp;three films sitting at Fresh on the Tomatometer and just a few (okay, four) at Rotten. That’s a pretty stunning record. Let’s just hope the show is more of a Room than a Basmati Blues.Defending Jacob(Photo by Jef Hernandez/Everett Collection)Talent: Captain America himself, Chris Evans, is starring in and executive producing the new series.What it’s about: Based on the bestselling novel of the same name, this limited series follows assistant district attorney Andy Barber, who’s investigating the murder of a 14-year-old boy and discovers his son is a suspect.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: A fellow Hollywood Chris (Pine) had similar success executive producing and starring in the drama I Am the Night, so there’s no reason to think Evans couldn’t do the same.My Glory Was I Had Such Friends(Photo by Priscilla Grant/Everett Collection)Talent: Jennifer Garner and J.J. Abrams are staging an Alias reunion when the actress stars in the megaproducer’s latest TV project. She’ll also executive produce.What it’s about: The series is based on the 2017 memoir of the same name by Amy Silverstein, and according to its official description (via The Hollywood Reporter), “the drama showcases the power of friendship and the resilience of the human spirit as it follows an extraordinary group of women who supported Silverstein as she waited for a second life-saving heart transplant.”Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Alias ran for five seasons, and Garner and Abrams are both A-list movie stars (in front of and behind the camera). Chances for success are high.Charlie Day–Rob McElhenney Series, Mythic Quest(Photo by Apple)Talent: It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia stars and creators Charlie Day and Rob McElhenney are writing and executive producing a new half-hour comedy. The series will star McElhenney, F. Murray Abraham, David Hornsby, Danny Pudi, and more.What it’s about: The sitcom follows the diverse group of people who work together in a video game development studio.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Believe it or not, Sunny is one of the longest-running sitcoms of all time. Anyone who can crack the secret to that kind of longevity while still remaining culturally relevant and, most importantly, funny certainly has the potential to do it again.Foundation(Photo by Penguin Random House; Frederick M.

Goyer (Blade, Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy) and Josh Friedman (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Avatar 2) are developing an adaptation of the iconic novel series from famed sci-fi author Isaac Asimov for Skydance Television, the company behind Netflix’s ambitious Altered Carbon.What it’s about: The book series&nbsp;inspired plenty of the sci-fi you love, including Star Wars. It follows a mathematician who predicts the collapse of humanity, which is scattered on planets throughout the galaxy and ruled by the Galactic Empire. The first book was published in 1951, followed by sequels in the subsequent years and two more in the ’80s, along with two prequels.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: There have been numerous attempts to turn Foundation into a feature film or a TV series before (including by disaster-movie king Roland Emmerich and Westworld creator Jonathan Nolan). Needless to say, the subject matter is daunting and will require a deft approach to capturing the books’ rich world. It could go very, very wrong. But if done well, it could enjoy&nbsp;Game of Thrones–level success.Untitled Richard Gere Series(Photo by Carlos Alvarez/Getty Images)Talent: Richard Gere is set to star in and executive produce the drama series.What it’s about: Based on the Israeli series Nevelot, the show will follow two elderly Vietnam vets whose lives are changed when a woman they both loved 50 years prior is killed in a car accident.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Though he’s had a storied film career, this is Gere’s first foray into television — so it’ll definitely be worth checking out.Hilde Lysiak Series, Home Before Dark(Photo by Apple)Talent: The Florida Project’s Brooklynn Prince is set to play the lead in the upcoming series, which is executive produced by Crazy Rich Asians director Jon M. Chu. Jim Sturgess will play her father.What it’s about: Inspired by the real-life story of Hilde Lysiak, a 9-year-old investigative reporter who uncovered a murder in her Pennsylvania hometown and broke the news in a paper she started herself, the 10-episode mystery series “follows a young girl who moves from Brooklyn to the small lakeside town her father left behind. While there, her dogged pursuit of the truth leads her to unearth a cold case that everyone in town, including her own father, tried hard to bury,” per Deadline.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Prince received plenty of great reviews for her film debut, but that’s no guarantee of success in a crowded TV landscape.Damien Chazelle Project(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images))Talent: La La Land director Damien Chazelle is writing and directing every episode of this straight-to-series drama.What it’s about: No details about the series have been released, other than the fact that it’s the Oscar winner’s second foray into streaming TV (he’s also involved in Netflix’s musical drama The Eddy).Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Since there isn’t any information on what the show is even about, this isn’t a call that can be made quite yet. But Chazelle is batting two for two with his films&nbsp;Whiplash and La La Land, and his upcoming Neil Armstrong biopic&nbsp;First Man&nbsp;looks to be an awards contender.Central Park(Photo by Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images/for 21st Century Fox)Talent: Apple has ordered two seasons of the series, from Bob’s Burgers creator Loren Bouchard, actor Josh Gad&nbsp;(pictured), and Nora Smith, which will feature voice talent from Gad, Leslie Odom Jr., Titus Burgess, Kristen Bell, Stanley Tucci, Daveed Diggs, and Kathryn Hahn.What it’s about: The animated musical comedy follows a family of caretakers who live and work in Central Park and end up saving the park — and basically the world.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Bob’s Burgers is Emmy-nominated, so that pedigree&nbsp;plus the voice talent involved means there’s certainly the potential for critical acclaim.Swagger(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Kevin Durant Charity Foundation)Talent: NBA star Kevin Durant is producing the series along with Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Television, and Reggie Rock Blythewood (Shots Fired, Notorious) is writing.What it’s about: Based on the early life and career of Durant, Swagger will explore the world of Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball and the lives of the players, their families, and coaches.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: Like a jump ball, it’s up in the air. The series is still being developed.CallsTalent: This international series has no major Hollywood players attached, but comes from creator Timothée Hochet.What it’s about: The first international co-production for Apple is an English adaptation of the French short-form series of the same name, which allows “audiences to experience short stories through real-life audio sources and minimal visuals,” per Deadline.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit: This is a format the U.S. hasn’t really seen before, so there’s plenty of potential for a really innovative, groundbreaking series.HomeTalent: Documentarian Matt Tyrnauer (Valentino: The Last Emperor, pictured) will direct all 10 one-hour episodes of the first season.What it’s about: Home offers viewers a never-before-seen look inside the world’s most extraordinary homes and delves into the minds of the people who built them.Chances it’ll be a Certified Fresh hit:&nbsp;If Tyrnauer&nbsp;serves up the dishy stories behind those gated palaces,&nbsp;the series is sure to be more than simply gorgeous real estate porn.Like this?

Our latest installment covers The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, which editors Tim Ryan and Ryan Fujitani rewatched for some fresh perspective.The Fellowship of the Ring&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Two Towers |&nbsp;The Return&nbsp;of the KingAn Unexpected Journey&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Desolation of Smaug&nbsp;The Hobbit: The Desolation of SmaugRyan: The two biggest issues I had with An Unexpected Journey were the jarring visual effects and the propulsive-yet-somehow-mundane narrative arc, which mostly consisted of the heroic ensemble scurrying from one perilous threat only to wind up in another. Fortunately, The Desolation of Smaug found a way to make the former much more palatable and, thanks to some thrilling action set pieces, the latter more compelling, even if the plot followed a similar structure. The Hobbit still feels like a lesser franchise compared to LotR, of course, but even as Smaug juggled a few competing story threads that felt decidedly like rest stops en route to an epic conclusion, it also more fully realized the nascent threat of Sauron, which helped raise the stakes. I have a few minor quibbles with the film, but overall I found it a much more enjoyable watch than An Unexpected Journey, and I’d like to get your general thoughts on Smaug before I delve into the nitty-gritty.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim: Judged against The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit films (the first two, anyway) can’t help but feel less substantial. But what’s wrong with that? If you scale back your expectations, An Unexpected Journey and (especially) The Desolation of Smaug are perfectly serviceable — and frequently outstanding — moviemaking on a grand-scale. The characters aren’t as vivid and the battles between good and evil aren’t as weighty, but as pure spectacle, Smaug mostly delivers. Martin Freeman and Richard Armitage make for fine leads, and Ian McKellen brings gravitas by just showing up. The forest infested by giant spiders shows that Peter Jackson hasn’t lost his affinity for the creepy crawlies, and even though the barrel escape/orc battle may defy the laws of physics (and logic), it’s really exciting. The set design remains impeccable — the M.C. Escher-like twists of the elf lair, the creeky wooden man-made island town of Esgaroth, and the the tight stairs and vast rock sculptures that line the Lonely Mountain are vivid and picturesque. And the scene in which Bilbo enters Smaug’s vast treasure chamber emanates a sense of I’ve-got-a-bad-feeling-about-this dread that echoes the space slug scene in The Empire Strikes Back. Sure, it’s probably at least 20 minutes too long (I have a sneaking suspicion that when it’s all said and done, the three Hobbit movies could be trimmed into one killer three-hour feature). But stretched-to-the-limit Peter Jackson is still more imaginative that just about any other blockbuster director out there.Ryan: I remember some folks grumbling about the barrel scene when Smaug first came out, and I get that the physics are a little wonky, but like you, I thought it was pretty exciting. The action is visceral, inventive and easy to follow, if a tad cartoony, and the Mirkwood elves come off looking absolutely badass. But as long as we’re talking about that scene, I do feel the need to mention the level of violence in the film: there are a lot of decapitations and point-blank arrows to the face. I didn’t really have a problem with it, and in my opinion the orcs make for much more exciting action scenes than CGI trolls, CGI goblins, or CGI spiders, but I can’t deny I was surprised by the sheer brutality of it, however bloodless it might have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;You also make a great point about the production design and Peter Jackson’s craftsmanship in general. I still think a Guillermo del Toro version of The Hobbit would have been really interesting, but there’s an explicit familiarity in what we’ve seen so far in Journey and Smaug that feels like a warm blanket — a slightly timeworn blanket with a few rough patches here and there, but a warm one nonetheless — and it makes it difficult to imagine anyone else in the director’s chair.Having said all this, there were still a couple of things that bothered me about Smaug, which, to be clear, I thought was a far superior film to An Unexpected Journey. I could have done without the elf-dwarf romance between Tauriel and Kili, although I liked Evangeline Lilly; it felt completely unnecessary to me. The rest of the dwarves, save for Thorin and maybe Balin (the old, “voice of reason” dwarf), remain largely indistinguishable from each other. And there really isn’t anything substantive about the story, which essentially amounts to “a bunch of dwarves walk home… but there’s a dragon there!” I can see why Peter Jackson felt the need to shoehorn in the rise of Sauron. Honestly, I was much more intrigued by the history between the dwarves and the elves — briefly referenced in the film — and it seems we may get some of that in The Battle of the Five Armies, so I’m looking forward to the franchise ending with a bang.The Fellowship of the Ring&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Two Towers |&nbsp;The Return&nbsp;of the KingAn Unexpected Journey&nbsp;|&nbsp;The Desolation of Smaug","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"streaming, TNT, Ghostbusters, Sundance, renewals, anthology, Walt, Cinematographers, worst, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"watching-series-we-revisit-the-hobbit-and-the-lord-of-the-rings-movies"},{"id":"47614371372022","title":"Rank 10 Possible Tolkien Tales for The Lord of the Rings Series","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank 10 Possible Tolkien Tales for The Lord of the Rings SeriesThe forging of the One Ring is just one of the many tales Amazon could develop for its Lord of the Rings prequel.by Erik Amaya | November 14, 2017 |  CommentsAmazon will soon bring the history of Middle-earth to its subscribers with a Lord of the Rings prequel series detailing previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R.

After the Superman cartoons, characters like Batman, the original Captain Marvel, and Captain America joined the pulp heroes as movie serial stars, and Superman himself would finally be featured in his own serial in 1948. But more often than not, these films followed the established serial format with the 1948 Superman innovating only enough to use a piece of animation to denote the character’s flying ability. After the serials went extinct, the superheroes returned to comic books.In 1966, Batman: The Movie and its parent television show defined for generations what comics on screen should be: campy. And while that film is great on its own merits (and 77% Fresh on the Tomatometer), it made it difficult for movie producers to ever take a costumed superhero seriously until the mid ’70s.At that point, producer Ilya Salkind and his father Alexander optioned the rights to Superman from DC Comics. The plan was to make a lavish two-part film in the vein of their recent successes,&nbsp;The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers,&nbsp;with&nbsp;The Godfather author Mario Puzo writing a 500-page script comprising Superman and Superman II. The intent was to engage&nbsp;Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton and shoot both films concurrently in Italy. DC Comics&nbsp;had suggested stars like Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman for the title role. When writers Robert Benton, David Newman, and Leslie Newman came in to revise Puzo’s script, the project’s tongue was firmly in its cheek as scenes called for super-puns and a cameo by Telly Savalas in his then-famous television role as Kojak.But as fate would have it, forces intervened and the irreverent tone were dismissed when Richard Donner, fresh from his success on The Omen, took over as director after the production moved to England. Little did anyone know at the time, but Donner and his collaborators would go on to define the superhero genre as it exists today in ways both large and sublime. Here is a look at just five of the ways Superman: The Movie – released December 15, 1978 –&nbsp;laid out the superhero film blueprint.1. By Emphasizing The Origin(Photo by © Warner Bros. )While Superman’s origin story is one of the most fascinating elements about the character, productions like the 1948 Superman serial and the 1950s The Adventures of Superman television series rushed through the Krypton and Smallville aspects of the story to get mild-mannered Clark Kent into his Superman persona. Clearly, that’s where the action is and the kids want to see Superman rough up some crooks or bend a gun with his bare hands.But Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz – who wrote an uncredited draft of the film for the director – saw the value in examining Superman’s early life. The resulting film has a three-part structure featuring the most realized presentation of Krypton seen by audiences up to that point. Where the earlier productions presented a very generic sci-fi world of silver shoulder pads and headbands, Donner and production designer John Barry reframed Krypton as a world where humanoids lived in crystalline structures more grown than built. Costume designer Yvonne Blake fabricated the robes worn by Marlon Brando and the other performers which would glow when exposed to a lightsource perched on cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth’s camera.The lavish details of Krypton served a number of purposes. As the Salkinds paid Brando a then-absurd $3.7 million and 11.75% of the gross for just 12 days of shooting, Donner devised additional material for Brando to perform just in case. Secondly, the early Krypton scenes would also establish the conflict of Superman 2, necessitating Krypton make a last impression on the viewer.And as the Smallville material was also thematically important, Donner and his team embraced those scenes with equal passion. In doing so, Superman does not appear in his costume until minute 47 of the movie’s 142 runtime. It was a script decision which would have a lasting impact on the superhero genre as it emerged. Today, holding back the scene in which the hero first gets his or her costume until minute 47 (or thereabouts) is a standard plotting convention. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not seen in the Mark I Iron Man suit for a good 40 minutes in the first Iron Man – and it is nearly an hour before the more familiar Mark III suit debuts. Same goes for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in Batman Begins and Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) in Man of Steel. While not yet a screenwriting convention when Batman was released in 1989, 21st Century superhero films relish the origin story and hold back the character’s completed costume identity for a long time, a technique first realized in Superman.2. By Honoring The Spirit Of The Character(Photo by © Warner Bros. )As mentioned before, the conventional wisdom about superheroes, such as it was, was to treat the characters as figures of camp. Batman ’66&nbsp;was fondly remembered for that tone. Donner, who idealized Superman as a core pillar of Americana, refused to treat the character that way in favor of honoring the spirit of Superman comics.To be fair to the Salkinds and the producers of Batman ’66, both characters went through a campy phase in which the characters’ colors were brighter than ever before and their stories saw them face goofy sci-fi threats instead of intense street thugs. Those tales were also light on characterization, with Batman, Superman, and their associated casts resetting back to their established status quo at the end of every story. But by 1975, a younger crop of writers was treating the DC superheroes with a greater sense of gravitas and emotional fidelity. Though not an avid reader of Superman comics at any point in his life, Donner decided Superman needed a similar emotional truth to be credible on screen.That sense of emotional truth led to the single most important decision made in the entire production: casting Christopher Reeve in the title role. He wowed casting director Lynn Stalmaster, who kept suggesting him to Donner and the producers until the offered him an audition opposite The Omen’s Holly Palance. Though clearly perspiring at the armpits of an early Superman costume, Reeve instantly transformed into the stalwart servant of justice. The scene – the interview with Lois Lane seen in the finished film – also reveals a playful side, and Reeve perfectly embodied the way Superman has fun with his persona. He proved capable of the sort of intensity the comic-book Superman was facing at the time with equal precision.Though he looked the part, the Reeve Superman is not a 1:1 interpretation of any one creative direction of the character – from the comics to George Reeve’s portrayal on The Adventures of Superman – but it is the idealized personification of him as Donner sought to put on screen. Modern superhero films continue to choose spirit over exacting recreation, leading to performances like Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman and Chris Evans in his appearances as Captain America. Neither may look as exactly right as Reeve does, but they create a version of the characters which are still faithful.3. By Embracing the Real World (Verisimilitude! )(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Much like his choice to imbue Superman with an honest emotional range, Donner’s decision to give the film’s world verisimilitude was key to making the film work. While Batman: The Movie before it and Batman after it featured heightened realities of pop art madness or expressionist extremes, the bulk of Superman takes place in a Metropolis not so much designed as borrowed from New York in the late 1970s. While Batman’s lack of powers make him easier to believe in a cartoon world, Superman’s fanciful abilities almost require the world around him to be more mundane. And so the Daily Planet’s famous ornamental globe ends up relocated to the lobby as the New York Daily News‘s entrance doubles for the great metropolitan newspaper. The newsroom set was also inspired by the look of the Daily News’s offices. The grime and grit of New York at the time gives Metropolis an authenticity it would never have again, as subsequent Superman movies used backlots to realize city streets. A DC Comics city would not feel this lived in again until Chicago played Gotham City in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight cycle.By&nbsp;grounding the world Superman inhabits in the reality of late 1970s New York, the film’s more fanciful aspects feel closer to our world. To paraphrase the poster’s tagline, the film must make you believe that a man can fly. Selling that illusion was not just a feat of special-effects wizardry, but also the responsibility of the world to make it seem as natural as possible.As it happens, Richard Donner has a plaque of Superman flying a banner in his office. It reads “verisimilitude!” It is the philosophy which makes his better films work and the thing other filmmakers strive for when they say they want to make a “grounded” superhero movie. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, has more outlandish concepts like Asgard and the worlds of Guardians of the Galaxy, but in films like Ant-Man and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the setting retains the verisimilitude of the years in which they were made. Or, at least, verisimilitude is their starting point, making later scenes like the crash of the Helicarriers or the implosion of a San Francisco building seem more plausible.4. By Giving it a Poppy Sense Of Fun(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Once Clark Kent (Reeve) arrives in Metropolis, both the measured, articulate dialogue of the Krypton sequence and the bucolic feel of the Smallville section give way to the rapid-fire verbal sparring of the Daily Planet newsroom. Conducting that orchestra is Jackie Cooper as editor Perry White. The man would be at home in a movie like His Girl Friday with the sly quips coming at six-or-seven per minute. Characters talk over each other, confuse one another, and build to comedic crescendos. In a word, the whole thing “pops.”Consider Lex Luthor’s (Gene Hackman) initial scene in which he and Miss Teschmacher (Valerie Perrine) trade insults. The snappy&nbsp;dialogue comes from an older tradition, but it fits so well with the characters that it seems like the most natural way for people in Metropolis to relate to one another.That poppy sense of fun&nbsp;would be borrowed wholesale by the MCU, with Robert Downey Jr’s facility for quippy ad-libbing setting the pace. But you also see it in films like Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok. Both are so comfortable with their realities that they can poke fun at the self-seriousness that superheroes attained after The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen were released in the mid-1980s.Curiously, that tension between seriousness and comedic agility forms some of the conflict between Superman and Lex. In their first encounter, when Superman pushes the door to Lex’s bunker off its hinges, he responds with a wry “It’s open, come in,” and orders Otis (Ned Beatty) to “take the gentleman’s cape.” Though capable of having fun with his own Boy Scout persona in earlier scenes, Superman is having none of it and refuses to spar with Lex. The greatest criminal mind of the age, though, continues to try to engage him in that style of patter. It lasts until the moment Lex finally puts the kryptonite medallion around Superman’s neck, proving that the quipster is a legitimate threat to the Man of Steel and California.5. By Getting Romantic(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Sure, Lois Lane’s (Margot Kidder) interior monologue during the “Can You Read My Mind?” flying sequence may be one of the most cornball things every committed to film, but the romance between Lois and Superman – a thing de-emphasized in the serials and The Adventures of Superman – makes such a stunning return in Superman that just about every subsequent superhero movie felt honor-bound to include the character’s original romantic entanglement for good (Captain America: The First Avenger) or ill (Thor: The Dark World, Green Lantern). There are exceptions, of course: Batman paramour Julie Madison predated Vicki Vale in the comics by almost 10 years, but would not be seen on film until Batman &amp; Robin. But even in cases where the romance is not the one true pairing, most comic-book movies emphasize a romantic plot as key to the movie.In Superman’s case, Donner and Mankiewicz felt it was more central to the piece than any exterior foe Superman would face. Mankiewicz, in particular, wanted to make sure filmgoers “wanted to see these two kids get together.” It’s a will-they-or-won’t they chemistry. As Kidder later put it, Lois was as immune to most men as Superman is to bullets; therefore she treats Clark with a dismissive authority. But Superman literally sweeps her offer her feet and all of her sarcasm and bravado falls away. On screen, it leads to a powerful chemistry subsequent films desperately hoped to emulate, even in stories where a romance may not actually serve the movie. We’re looking at you, Batman Begins.Of course, there as so many more things to consider, like the iconic Superman theme by John Williams. Then there are the little moments which will always stand out: the man on the street who calls Superman’s costume a “bad outfit”; Lois’s stunned “You’ve got me? Whose got you?” when he rescues her from plummeting to her death a few moments later; and Lex’s angered scream of “Miss Teschmacher!” In building such a genuinely grounded platform from which Superman could soar, Donner and his partners designed the format from which all big budget superhero movies derive. Sure, they can react against the formula (Blade, Hellboy, The Dark Knight) or embrace it, but Superman will always serve as the baseline from which to examine how successfully they bring beloved comic-book superheroes to the screen.Superman: The Movie&nbsp;was released December 15, 1978#1Superman (1978) 94%#1Adjusted Score: 101.119% Critics Consensus: Superman deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Christopher Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon.Synopsis: Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel in a big-budget epic with Oscar-winning effects.

For those unfamiliar with the story, Gandolfini’s character has to deal with a major PR headache when a crew of criminals (led by John Travolta) hijacks a subway car. Denzel Washington will star as one of the police officers tasked with saving the day.Pelham joins a growing list of projects for Gandolfini, who also provides the voice of one of the Wild Things in Spike Jonze‘s upcoming Where the Wild Things Are; according to Variety, Gandolfini will be “producing an untitled drama that casts him as author Ernest Hemingway for director Philip Kaufman.”The article also says Gandolfini will be returning to the network that signed his checks during the Sopranos‘ run; his production deal with HBO will be bearing fruit in the form of ABCD Camp, a film starring Gandolfini as Sonny Vaccaro, “the godfather of grassroots basketball whose camp launched the careers of dozens of NBA superstars.”Source: Variety","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"crime, movies, Writers, Rock, Star, Guide, CW, universal, Cosplay, Awards, PBS, Esquire, dc, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"gandolfini-joins-pelham-one-two-three-remake"},{"id":"47614376365049","title":"Craig Robinson, Adam Scott, and Amber West Reveal 8 Scary/Funny Things About Ghosted","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Craig Robinson, Adam Scott, and Amber West Reveal 8 Scary/Funny Things About GhostedCovert agencies, succubi, ghost-busting gadgets, and more materialize in the Fox comedy.by Fred Topel | September 29, 2017 |  CommentsYou put Craig Robinson&nbsp;and Adam Scott in a TV show and it doesn’t have to be a big idea — they’ll make it funny. Their previous shows were about an office and a park&nbsp;— Office Park, anyone? Their new show, Ghosted, is a little more complicated.Robinson plays Leroy, a former cop now working as a mall security guard. Scott plays Max, a former scientist discredited for his theory on aliens. The Bureau Underground recruits them to join the agency, which knows ghosts, aliens, and other supernatural entities are real. They’re Men in Black without the suits.Robinson, Scott, and costar Amber Stevens West spoke with Rotten Tomatoes before the premiere of Ghosted. Here are eight things they uncovered about the Bureau Underground’s haunting and hilarious cases you’ll see on Ghosted.1. IT’S GENUINELY SCARYGhosted&nbsp;counts on Robinson and Scott to bring the funny, and they’re happy to oblige, but they want you to know they take the ghosts and monsters seriously.“It is hard because you have 21 1/2 minutes, and we want it to be actually kind of scary,” Scott said. “We don’t want it to be corny or spooky. I think we keep going back to the fact that The Twilight Zone was a half-hour show, and they managed to do a lot there. They managed to introduce, tell a story, and have a resolution in a small amount of time.”Max and Leroy are genuinely scared to see these creatures for the first time, but even the agents who’ve been on the case for years get chills. West plays Annie, a Bureau Underground veteran.“I think things are still spooky and still scary, just like they would be for any person who encounters something that’s unpredictable,” West said. “I think it’s what keeps the job fun. You never really know how something else is going to react to this situation. She enjoys that part of it as well.”2. THEY JOKE LIKE TOUGH GUYSWhen people get scared, they make jokes. That doesn’t mean Max and Leroy are buffoons. Heroes still make jokes to diffuse tension. When humor is a defense mechanism, the audience wins.“I’d be lying if I said I’d never thought of being an action hero,” Robinson said. “[Ghosted is like] a good action movie with jokes.”Think: movies like 48 Hours, Lethal Weapon, or Stakeout, where the heroes mess with each other, but they get the job done.“Action-comedy for sure, that’s kind of what inspires all of us,” Scott said. “We all love action-comedies from the ’80s. Craig’s been in two of the great ones in the last two years, Pineapple Express and This Is the End— both those movies really got that balance really, really well.”Robinson and Scott feel like they’re in an ’80s movie, but one more like&nbsp;Ghostbusters&nbsp;or&nbsp;Aliens.&nbsp;Max and Leroy live out their movie fantasies.“Don’t you put yourself in the movie character’s position?” Robinson asked. “I do it all the time, imagine what I would’ve said or done.”3. ONLY ONE OF THE STARS GOT SLAPPED FOR REALOn their first undercover mission, Leroy and Max play photocopier repairmen. Max takes the improv a little too seriously and slaps Leroy good. Robinson admitted the slap was real.“I was like, ‘Just go for it, man. Make it real,’” Robinson said.There was another scene where Leroy returns the favor, but his slap was movie magic.“Then a few days later, it was my turn to slap him, and they found the right angle,” Robinson said.Scott added, “So I got to slap the sh– out of him, and he did not get to touch me.”4. LEROY IS A LADIES’ MAN TO THE WRONG KIND OF LADYAliens, ghosts, and more are coming for season&nbsp;1 of Ghosted. Robinson shared some of the first few creatures Max and Leroy encounter.“A succubus, a 19th century ghost, a sea creature, like [that] lives at the bottom of the sea,” Robinson said.The succubus gets too close for Leroy.“I fall in love with the succubus — spoiler alert,” Robinson said. “I do fall under her spell.”Annie may have the solution when it comes to each ghost.“She’s pretty smart when it comes to figuring out the mystery behind why the ghost is there, the monster or the creature, whatever it is,” West said. “The show rides this line of — ‘surrealism’ maybe is the word&nbsp;— where it’s a very grounded real world. It takes place in a very real world, but it’s this undiscovered unknown part of it; with that, the sky’s the limit. We can have so much fun and capture and chase any sort of paranormal being that we want.”5. STUNT WORK IS SCARYWith action heroes, Robinson and Scott find themselves doing their own stunts. And it doesn’t have to be a fight scene or a high fall to be dangerous.“There’s a crazy stunt in the next episode,” Scott said. “There’s something coming up in an episode where Craig and I get dragged through the forest on the ground by an unseen force. They rigged up this rig that’s going to pull us through the forest, and I don’t know how we’re going to do it without profoundly getting injured.”Robinson isn’t worried though.“It’s like you ride on a skateboard almost, but through the woods,” Robinson said. “They build a skateboard for your whole body. I think they’re pretty good about making sure everything is super safe.”6. ANNIE’S GADGETS MAKE THEM FEEL A LITTLE SAFERIf you’ve got to go up against the undead, it feels a little safer carrying a big gun. Where do they get those wonderful toys? The Bureau Underground equips Max and Leroy with plenty of ghost-busting weapons. Annie is the Q who makes them all.“She’s a weapons and tech specialist,” West said. “She’s the one building all the really fun and interesting things that are going to destroy or kill or capture whatever monster it is of the week.”Whenever there’s a scene in Annie’s office, you might want to freeze frame and take a look around.“My character has her own office that’s all full of crazy weaponry and fun alien memorabilia,” West said. “I think my office is the coolest of everyone’s on set. I’m very proud of Annie’s little space. I just can’t wait to learn how to play with all this stuff.”7.&nbsp;EASTER EGGS MAY POP UP AND GO “BOO!”Since Ghosted is inspired by the action-comedies and supernatural fantasy that was at its peak the ’80s, the show is not above paying direct homage to specific films from the surrounding decades. Scott has some hints for the Easter Eggs in the pilot, but after that you’re on your own.“I think at the end of the pilot, there’s some Close Encounters in there,” Scott said. “Even the music in the moment that Max sees the spaceship, there’s a slight little coda of music that’s a tip of the hat to ’80s Spielberg movies, particularly Close Encounters — which is ’70s, but still.”8. LEROY AND MAX ARE NOT THE ONLY FUNNY ONESWhen you’ve got Craig Robinson and Adam Scott making jokes, it can be tough competition for the rest of the cast. West said she and her costars get some good ones too.“I get my fair share of jokes,” West said. “There’s a lot of fun that I get to have with the character Barry, Adeel [Akhar]’s character. The two of us are kind of paired together a lot and the dynamic between us is quite funny. I get my fair share.”Ghosted is essentially a workplace comedy. The workplace just happens to be an underground ghostbusting agency, and Max and Leroy are the new guys.“I think she’s just indifferent [to them] right now in the very beginning,” West said. “[Max] was a believer but unsure of its truth, and now he’s here and he’s a believer, so I’m excited about someone else who is aware of what we’re doing. But at the same time, he needs to put in his work and prove that he belongs here, because Annie takes the job really seriously and she’s been there for a long time. She’s an important member of the Bureau Underground. Both Adam and Craig need to prove themselves, so I think Annie’s very much like, We’ll see what happens. They seem fine.”Ghosted premieres Sunday, October 1 at 8:30 p.m. on Fox.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"women, Access, motion, awards, Mudbound, in, 21st, strong","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"craig-robinson-adam-scott-amber-west-offer-ghosted-revelations"},{"id":"47614392302594","title":"6 Horror Legends That Inspired Feature Films","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})6 Horror Legends That Inspired Feature FilmsWhether you like your men Wicker or Slender, these terrifying tall tales and urban legends have made the leap into Hollywood pop culture.by Jacqueline Coley | April 18, 2019 |  CommentsThe Curse of La Llorona hits theaters this week, giving us our first&nbsp;major studio adaptation of the eponymous Mexican folktale also known as “the weeping woman.” Horror master Guillermo del Toro borrowed heavily from the Mexican legend for his 2013 film Mama, but this James Wan-produced scare-fest centers solely on the spirit who, it is said, tragically killed her children, committed suicide, and vowed to terrorize&nbsp;mothers as her eternal retribution.The movie joins a long list of horror films based on legends (among them, one literally called&nbsp;Urban Legends… don’t pretend you don’t remember it). If you like your horror based on a kinda-maybe-sort-coulda-been true story – or at least the story your buddies and grandma used to scare you with – look no further than these wicked legend-based horror movies that came before&nbsp;La Llorona.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wicker ManOrigin: Pagan MythologyAdaptations:&nbsp;The Wicker Man&nbsp;(1973), The Wicker Man&nbsp;(2006)Which Wicker Man&nbsp;should you watch?&nbsp;The original 1973 film&nbsp;starring the late Christopher Lee – that treasure trove of haunting imagery with its dagger-to-your-heart ending? Or the Nicolas Cage&nbsp;“not the bees!” version? Either or, depending on whether you’ve got a hunger for shivers or… for munchies. Both films relied heavily on the Druid (Celtic Pagan) practice of burning a Wicker statue in effigy – which might not have actually been a practice at all. The idea of making a sacrifice by burning a giant effigy was first documented in a single sentence by Julius Caesar circa 50 BC, but modern scholars have become increasingly skeptical. Still, the image remains scary AF.Origin: Irish FolkloreMemorable Adaptations: The&nbsp;Leprechaun&nbsp;FranchiseThe 20th-century leprechaun, as seen on a box of Lucky Charms, is a far cry from the devilish and sometimes benevolent creature you will find in Irish folklore. Tricksters and hoarders of jewels, leprechauns are the supposed offspring of demon (evil spirit) and fairy (angelic spirit) couplings.&nbsp;Because of their equal capacity for good and evil, Celtic mythology is littered with examples of both just and wicked deeds committed by the magical creatures. Warwick Davis originated the role in the legendary B-movie&nbsp;Leprechaun series and continued with it until the&nbsp;franchise rebooted in 2014. According to Davis, the In the Hood&nbsp;installments were&nbsp;the most successful of the direct-to-video efforts. If you’ve witnessed Davis rapping in the finale of&nbsp;Leprechaun in the Hood,&nbsp;you will understand why.La Llorona (The Weeping Woman)Origin: Mexican FolkloreMemorable Adaptations: Mama, The Curse of La LloronaAt some point in every mythology, there’s a tale of female, particularly maternal, vengeance — think Dionysus or Medea (the Greek myth, not the Tyler Perry version). Even the original Friday the 13th&nbsp;can be traced back to a mother scorned. In The Curse of La Llorona, a mother drowns her children in a jealous rage to seek revenge on her cheating husband. Reckoning with what she did, she commits suicide, only to be denied entry to the afterlife, cursed to roam the earth weeping, drowning children, and tormenting mothers for all her days. It’s a&nbsp;true word-of-mouth legend, unable to be traced back to any known story or event, and director Michael Chaves told us, “It can be difficult to manage the nuances of it being an oral tradition.&nbsp;It’s hard to pin down what is the right version. So you [go] through all of it to find [the] core experience that so many people grew up on, [what was] told to them as kids. That’s what we wanted to bring on screen.”The Bell WitchOrigin:&nbsp;Southern American FolkloreMemorable Adaptations:&nbsp;The Blair Witch Project,&nbsp;Book of Shadows – Blair Witch 2,&nbsp;Blair WitchAs the legend goes, the Bell family was visited by a spirit in early 1817, bringing reports of spooky black dogs and shadowy figures. If the strangeness stopped there, we might not have included it on our list, but after the first Bell Witch hauntings, there have been countless reported reappearances with similar details often coming from unrelated parties miles apart.&nbsp;What to do with such a creepy story? Make a movie, of course – and cheaply. The makers of&nbsp;The Blair Witch Project&nbsp;used the spooky lore, low-budget scares, and perhaps the savviest early internet marketing campaign to create one of the most lucrative movies ever.The Amityville&nbsp;HorrorOrigin: American folklore&nbsp;Memorable Adaptations: The Amityville Horror FranchiseAmityville lies somewhere between folklore and urban legend, but the inexplicable twists and turns surrounding the early&nbsp;’70s&nbsp;supernatural events that inspired the Amityville&nbsp;movies&nbsp;have cemented them as the granddaddy of lore-based horror cinema. Spanning 23 films over 40 years,&nbsp;The Amityville Horror series chronicles&nbsp;the 1974 haunting first investigated by famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, though many debate the accuracy of the Warrens’ story. As the original story goes, Ronald DeFeo Jr. shot and killed six members of his family at home in Amityville, New York, and since then, strange occurrences&nbsp;– mostly focused around the&nbsp;Lutz family that hired the Warrens – have plagued the house where it all went down.Slender manOrigin: Creepy-pasta/American folkloreMemorable Adaptations: Beware the Slenderman, Slender ManThis one might be a stretch (forgive us), but&nbsp;Slender Man has morphed into modern-day folklore. The Slender Man is a work of pure fiction&nbsp;about a tall and, well, slender spirit that calls others to murder in his name. One of the first documented instances of digital folklore, originating in online message boards, the Slender Man was blamed for directing teenagers to commit suicide, murder, and commit assault on each other indiscriminately. The most notorious&nbsp;incident was&nbsp;the Waukesha, Wisconsin stabbing,&nbsp;in which a pair of 12-year-olds meticulously planned the murder of a friend by stabbing; the victim did thankfully survive, but the incident made national headlines. Of all the tales on our list, the legend of Slender Man is the only one accused in court of turning&nbsp;pre-teens&nbsp;into murderers.The Curse of La Llorona is in theaters April 22.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"worst, Mary, Christmas, Kaling, french, Tarantino, The, Comedy, political, on, true, cancelled, sequels, of, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"6-horror-legends-that-inspired-feature-films"},{"id":"47614381483004","title":"Tony Scott Directing Don Aronow Biopic","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tony Scott Directing Don Aronow BiopicDramatizing the life and death of the Speedboat King.by Jeff Giles | October 17, 2007 |  CommentsTony Scott and Fox 2000 are teaming up to bring the life of Don Aronow to the screen.Who’s Don Aronow, you ask?

With more time at home, there’s no better opportunity to&nbsp;finally&nbsp;watch these titles&nbsp;that helped define cinema as we know it.(Photo by Universal Pictures)The current situation of social distancing has many of us thinking of ways to maximize the time we spend at home. We’re also eating several times a day and annoying&nbsp;our pets, but being productive&nbsp;does cross our minds from time to time. Puzzles, long-abandoned books, craft projects, and New Year’s resolutions have suddenly jumped to the top of our to-do lists. In the RT comments, many of you have shared how you’re catching up on classic films, and we happen to agree that now is the perfect time to increase&nbsp;your classic film viewing.Concentrating on films released before 1980 (both well-known titles and hidden gems), we’re producing new guides to&nbsp;essential classic films curated by theme, filmmaker, actor, genre, or style – all for your classic catch-up needs. Want to see our picks for the best French farces? How about a curated list of Fresh picks from Alfred Hitchcock, Peter Sellers, or Billy Wilder? As well as curating watchlists, we’re breaking down the films, telling you where you can watch them, and giving you some more recent and/or well-known films the classics might remind you of so you can gauge which movies are right for you.This week in the Classic Film Catch-Up, we’re breaking out with heist films. Long cons, strong-arm jobs, and bank heists from professionals and amateurs alike have a long history&nbsp;in film, and that history has given us some of our most celebrated performances and cinematic stories. From Melville and Friedkin to Kubrick and&nbsp; Soderbergh,&nbsp;many beloved filmmakers have made a mark on the heist flick genre,&nbsp;which came of age in the late ’60s and early ’70s. In truth, we could make a list solely comprised of films from&nbsp;that time period, and it would still be quite spectacular, but we did include a few from decades prior.With hundreds of titles to choose from, iconic films like The Great Escape, Ocean’s Eleven, and lesser-known gems like The Silent Partner failed to earn a spot on our list, but are still definitely worthy of a revisit. For our list below, though, we tried to find diversity within the genre, intermixing confidence schemes with&nbsp;bank jobs and&nbsp;heist comedies with gritty noirs. Each entry is unique, but they work within a shared formula: get a crew, plan the job, and do some nefarious things to take something without anyone finding out.&nbsp;Read below to see our list of classic heist films.Got another&nbsp;favorite heist&nbsp;classic you’d add to our list?

Trying to get enough money for his lover’s sex-reassignment&nbsp;surgery, Sonny Wortzik&nbsp;(Pacino) tries to rob a bank, and everything after that goes from bad to worse in what many consider to be one of the best films from the ’70s. One of the highest-grossing movies of its year and a critical hit, Dog Day Afternoon was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Actor, which Pacino didn’t win. Twenty years later,&nbsp;he would finally take home a golden statuette for The Scent of Woman, but his turn here alongside his The Godfather co-star John Cazale&nbsp;gives us, according to critic Roger Ebert,&nbsp;“one of the most interesting modern movie characters.” Check it out for the verbal sparring and Pacino’s acting,&nbsp;and its&nbsp;re-watchability is unmatched – you’ll find new favorite moments each time you see it.Watch it if&nbsp;you like:&nbsp;Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead, A Simple Plan, Reservoir Dogs,&nbsp;Fargo.Where to watch: Rent or buy&nbsp;on FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.The Sting (1973)  94%&nbsp;What is it?&nbsp;A young conman attempts to pull off a large-scale confidence scheme against the man who killed his partner, aided by a veteran fraudster.Why you need to see it:&nbsp;It’s a movie with&nbsp;Robert Redford&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paul Newman&nbsp;–&nbsp;do you really need anything else? If by chance you do,&nbsp;The Sting is a must-see ‘con film’ and one of the best examples of a perfectly balanced heist comedy.&nbsp;Redford and Newman’s undeniable chemistry is the main draw here, but the&nbsp;mini-course&nbsp;on the language of large-scale confidence schemes serves as a welcome bonus. The original Ocean’s Eleven, The Italian Job, and Going in Style all have modern-day remakes that were received to varying critical and commercial success but, this Depression-era masterpiece from&nbsp;George Roy Hill&nbsp;is thought to be inimitable. (Check out&nbsp;the laughable The Sting II if you need further proof).&nbsp;A box-office smash which re-teamed Redford and Newman just four years after the iconic&nbsp;Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, the film took&nbsp;home&nbsp;six more Oscars, including Best Picture.Watch it if you like:&nbsp;Ocean’s Eleven, Matchstick Men, The&nbsp;Man From U.N.C.L.E., Logan Lucky, American Hustle, Now You See Me.Where to watch: Stream now on the Starz app. Rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and iTunes.The French Connection (1971)  98%&nbsp;What is it? A group of narcotics detectives track and try to intercept a large supply of heroin.Why you need to see it: On a&nbsp;list of quintessential ’70s cop films, The French Connection&nbsp;would invariably&nbsp;rank high, so we understand if you’re surprised to see it here on a list of heist films. Yes, the film follows a group of detectives as they try to get the ‘bad guys,’ but with the exception of the players (among them leads&nbsp;Gene Hackman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Roy Scheider) all the elements of a heist are there: A group of professionals come together and concoct an elaborate&nbsp;plan&nbsp;to ‘steal something’ from someone without them knowing – that’s a heist movie any way you slice it. Bonnie &amp; Clyde&nbsp;is thought to be the first film of the ‘New Hollywood’ movement – a period in American cinema which ushered in a new crop of dynamic young filmmakers and during which the modern-day blockbuster was born – but The French Connection&nbsp;solidified this new shift in filmmaking and film marketing. Featuring one of the best car chases in the history of film,&nbsp;William Friedkin‘s cop thriller is gritty, fast-paced, and completely unlike any police drama that came before it. Hackman is electrifying as the short-tempered, boozy bigot ‘Popeye’ Doyle, and was the rightful winner of the Best Actor prize in 1972, which came alongside four more wins for the film, including Best Picture.Watch it if you like:&nbsp;The Italian Job, Heat,&nbsp;L.A.

Perhaps a bit too camp and brash for its time, the British heist comedy was not universally loved upon release. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby dubbed the film “technically sophisticated and emotionally retarded.” Putting aside the dated language, the film does lean into action over plot, but that does not diminish the enjoyment of watching Caine and his cockney band of thieves race around Italy in the iconic MINI Coopers. The film is worth a watch for those car chases alone.Watch it if you like:&nbsp;Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Bullitt, Gone in 60 Seconds, Fast Five, Inside Man.&nbsp;Where to watch: Stream now on&nbsp;Amazon Prime Video, The Criterion Channel.&nbsp;Rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;&nbsp;iTunes.The Killing (1956)  98%&nbsp;What is it?&nbsp;A long-time crook has a simple plan: one last job before he settles down with his lady love. But what was supposed to be a simple job&nbsp;finds&nbsp;the two lovers caught up in a web of deception and murder.Why you need to see it:&nbsp;Though not the first to do it,&nbsp;The Killing married itself to non-linear storytelling in a way that was wholly unique at the time; and it was a commitment that would also turn out to be a bit too revolutionary and decades ahead audience’s tastes.&nbsp;Stanley Kubrick‘s&nbsp;third feature – but his first with a professional crew – was a headache for Paramount from the moment it was shot. Hated by test audiences, the film barely received an American release and was a commercial flop. However, contemporary critics recognized Kubrick’s audacious skill with dialogue and camera movement and heralded the film as a masterwork, and its director as one to watch. It has since earned cult-like status, and its influences can be seen in the work of Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, and the Coen brothers. A taut noir, the black-and-white drama commits to the realism of pulling off the ‘perfect job.’ How the subsequent events unravel for our lead con-artist after the job is done is where we find the film’s brilliance.Watch it if you&nbsp;like:&nbsp;Reservoir Dogs, The Killer, Chinatown, Thief, The Getaway, The Layer Cake.Where to watch:&nbsp;Rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.Topkapi (1964)  90%(Photo by Everett Collection)What is it?&nbsp;A woman and her ex-lover plot to steal a priceless dagger in Istanbul with the help of a simple-minded small-time crook.Why you need to see it:&nbsp;Jules Dassin‘s&nbsp;Topkapi&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of the best cinematic clap-backs ever filmed.&nbsp;In 1955, Dassin’s&nbsp;Rififi&nbsp;– which won him a Best Director prize at Cannes –&nbsp;set the blueprint for modern-day heist films and soon became the&nbsp;subject&nbsp;of several parodies, including Mario Monicelli’s Big Deal on Madonna Street. Tired of being the butt of the joke, Dassin released&nbsp;Topkapi&nbsp;in 1964 and, in doing so, ultimately got the last laugh as his genre send-up dwarfed all previous attempts. The comedy of the bumbling thieves who might just be inept enough to pull off an intricate robbery&nbsp;is only second in hilarity to the scene-stealing performance of&nbsp;Peter Ustinov&nbsp;who plays Simpson, a low-level crook caught in the wake of the larger crime.Watch it if you&nbsp;like: Casino Royale,&nbsp;American Vandal, Dr. Strangelove, The Whole Nine Yards, The&nbsp;Man From U.N.C.L.E.Where to watch:&nbsp;Stream now on&nbsp;Amazon Prime Video.

After breaking out of prison, a&nbsp;career criminal plans ‘one last job’ to secure his retirement while a dogged police detective is in hot pursuit.Why you need to see it:&nbsp;The godfather of French New Wave,&nbsp;Jean-Pierre Melville was tenacious when it came to authenticity on screen. From props to accents to his documentary style of filmmaking, his attention to detail and reality is present in every frame of Le Deuxieme Souffle. Melville’s commitment would inspire the neorealism of directors François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Agnes Varda. Sporting a high body count for its time,&nbsp;Le Deuxieme Souffle was a film that let the gangsters be gangsters. Thrilling, and dripping with suspense and violence, the film gives the audience a constant sense of unease as the characters descend deeper into the French underworld. “An intimate epic,” according to Martin Scorsese, the film was a key inspiration for his Oscar-nominated Jimmy Hoffa epic&nbsp;The Irishman.&nbsp;Watch it if you&nbsp;like:&nbsp;The Irishman, Miller’s Crossing, Road to Perdition, Hell or High Water.&nbsp;Where to watch:&nbsp;Stream now on&nbsp;The Criterion Channel&nbsp;app. Rent or buy&nbsp;on&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.High Sierra (1941)  90%What is it? A seasoned ex-con must lead a group of untried criminals in the robbery of a desert resort.Why you need to see it:&nbsp;The first pairing of several between&nbsp;Humphrey Bogart and director&nbsp;John Huston, High Sierra&nbsp;is a thoughtful bridge between the brash ’40s gangster flicks and the minimalistic crime-noirs of the ’50s.&nbsp;Huston and Bogart would go on to collaborate on The Maltese Falcon, Key Largo,&nbsp;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and The African Queen; never was the power of Bogart’s appeal more on display than when framed by Huston’s lens. High Sierra&nbsp;is a&nbsp;heist film that utilizes early noir elements before they were popularized in the 1950s, and it’s distinguished by its&nbsp;smart twists as well as&nbsp;Bogart’s complex turn as Roy Earle. He is also perfectly complemented by Ida Lupino’s portrayal of the temptress gangster’s moll.Watch it if you&nbsp;like: The Maltese Falcon, The Fugitive, White Heat, The Town, The Usual Suspects.&nbsp;Where to watch:&nbsp;Stream now on&nbsp;The Criterion Channel&nbsp;app. Rent or buy&nbsp;on FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Vudu,&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;Google Play, and&nbsp;iTunes.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"streaming, Comic, Masterpiece, Pop, Century, scorecard, in, Searchlight","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"classic-film-catch-up-eight-heist-flicks-that-will-steal-your-movie-loving-heart"},{"id":"47614426243086","title":"Biehn and Cameron Back Together on \"Avatar\"?","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Biehn and Cameron Back Together on \"Avatar\"?by Scott Weinberg | March 27, 2007 |  CommentsThey worked pretty darn well together on \"The Terminator,\" \"Aliens,\" and \"The Abyss\" — so maybe filmmaker James Cameron and actor Michael Biehn are about to get the old magic brewing on \"Avatar.\" (Or maybe not.)Seems that Biehn and Cameron had a pair of successful meetings a little while back, but no contracts have been offered/signed just yet.

Well, according to many of the critics and industry folks who saw it at last week’s premiere, it might just come close. Early social reactions&nbsp;saw the majority&nbsp;of critics praising the film and Emily Blunt in particular, for her turn in the iconic blue coat. Germain Lussier of i09 was typical of the praise thrown her way and the movie’s way when he tweeted: “Mary Poppins Returns is an exquisitely made film with delightful music, excellent performances (especially by Emily Blunt) &amp; contagious optimism.” But, could the movie – like&nbsp;its predecessor – be an Oscar contender?There is no Tomatometer score as of yet – reviews will release soon on December 12th, and as you know, anything can happen –&nbsp;but reading the tea leaves,&nbsp;Mary Poppins Returns looks to be a perfectly timed holiday hit, and one that has shot to the top of many Oscar prognosticators’ lists. And not just for Blunt.&nbsp;Variety‘s awards editor Kristopher Tapley set the tone a few weeks back following a very early screening, going&nbsp;as far as to say,&nbsp;“Mary Poppins Returns will be a massive hit, which will drive the point home all the more: Audiences want a movie like this right now. Critics, even the most cynical of them (whether they admit it or not), want a movie like this right now. Surely, Oscar voters want a movie like this right now.”As we enter December, with Golden Globe nominations just days away&nbsp;and Oscar ballots almost on their way to voters, let’s take a look at the competitive awards categories for Mary Poppins Returns and why&nbsp;this unlikely late-season entry could just shake things up.It’s the Film We Need Right Now(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)We hate the “thing we need right now” hot-take framing as much as you do, but in this case, there’s some truth to it. Like a high-flying kite – scratch that: a balloon –&nbsp;Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;has brought a huge dollop of joy to a pretty dour awards-season field. Of all the major contenders – think&nbsp;Roma, If Beale Street Could Talk, Vice, The Favourite, or Green Book –&nbsp;Poppins is the most unapologetically joyful film, which might be exactly what audiences and voters are drawn to in the dying days of 2018. Despairing at the state of the world? Then perhaps you want to see Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda singing and dancing&nbsp;around London more than another dark examination of the nature of humankind. Just saying.&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Rob Marshall seems to have tapped into something that’s hard to quantify yet wholly disarming, especially for adults. As Dame Angela Lansbury says towards the end of the film, most grownups “forget what it’s like… to be a child.” Don’t think that’s enough to convince voters? It’s the same kind of infectious optimism that La La Land inspired in Academy voters back in 2016.Below the Line, Poppins is TopsRyan FujitaniLooking for&nbsp;nomination sure bets? Look straight to below-the-line categories like costumes, make-up, visual effects, and production design. But you already knew that from the trailers. Having seen the film, we would add Best Editing and the sound categories to that list. One sequence that takes place on the surface of a porcelain bowl highlights the best elements of all of the aforementioned trades: careful sound mixing and effects seamlessly integrate the&nbsp;characters into a delicate ceramic and animated world, while Sandy Powell’s costumes for the sequence are a mix of materials and appear as a blend of soft fabrics and watercolor paints that would crumple upon touching.&nbsp;Powell could go up against her contemporary rival Colleen Atwood for&nbsp;Fantastic&nbsp;Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Black Panther&nbsp;costume designer Ruth E. Carter, and, in an interesting wrinkle, herself; Powell has a second bite at the Oscar apple with her equally impressive work on Yorgos Lanthimos’&nbsp;The Favourite.To achieve the vivid 2-D animation sequences that are a particular highlight of the porcelain bowl scene, Marshall went to painstaking lengths.&nbsp;These days, Disney animators work&nbsp;primarily in the digital format — the studio’s last hand-drawn animation was back in 2004, long before most of the current crop of animators joined the company. It required calling former animators out of retirement to achieve the signature mix of live action and 2-D animation, while implementing innovations for both formats. Marshall had to merge two animation mediums that were never intended to coexist; the results could earn the movie consideration in the effects categories.“Shallow” May No Longer Be a Lock for Best Original Song(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Lady Gaga&nbsp;and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow” from A Star is Born&nbsp;has seemingly been a lock for the Best Original Song Oscar for months. A bona fide chart-topper that has been streamed over 10 million times since its September 27th release, it has long looked unstoppable. But last week “The Place Where Lost Things Go,” sung by Blunt, and “Trip a Little Light Fantastic,” sung by Miranda, were released, marking them as the two songs Disney seems to be backing for&nbsp;the category – and they may just cause an upset.As in recent years, the “hit” may not prove to be the eventual winner come ceremony time. Back when Sam Smith won for Spectre’s&nbsp;“Writing’s on the Wall,” he beat The Weeknd’s “Earned It” from Fifty Shades of Grey –&nbsp;which people had actually, you know, heard of. Everyone remembers La La Land being favored with “City of Stars,” but do you remember that in the same year it beat out Trolls’ infectious four-time platinum smash “Can’t Stop The Feeling” by Justin Timberlake? Keeping with the trend, last year the quiet and sentimental “Remember Me” from Coco won over The Greatest Showman’s&nbsp;“This is Me,” a song that is still charting as part of the film’s soundtrack more than a year after the movie exited cinemas. So don’t be surprised if Blunt’s “The Place Where Lost Things Go” topples the Gaga-liath “Shallow.”Acting Nods and (Maybe) A Best Picture Chance&nbsp;(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)For acting, it’s all down to Miranda and Blunt.&nbsp;They get the lion’s share of screen time and perform the narrative heavy lifting. At the Globes, Miranda has more than a decent shot of a nomination, with the categories being split between Comedy and Drama, but it’s unlikely he will prove a challenge to Christian Bale and Viggo Mortensen.&nbsp;Blunt fares slightly better in the Best&nbsp;Actress – Musical or Comedy race. It will likely be a three-way race&nbsp;between Blunt,&nbsp;Constance Wu for Crazy Rich Asians, and Olivia Colman for The Favourite, and while most think Colman is a shoo-in, Blunt has a history with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association that shouldn’t be dismissed&nbsp;(she is a five-time nominee and one-time winner).&nbsp;Even Mary Poppins herself would have a hard time magicking an Oscar nomination for Miranda, but Blunt has the pedigree and delivers a performance that may squeeze her into contention&nbsp;before the Academy announces its nominees.For Best Picture, things will likely come down to how many nominees we get. At least five percent of first-place votes must go to a particular film in order for it to contend for Best Picture as one of the final nominees. With the race still wide open, it’s not unreasonable to think the Academy could have a strong preference for more than five films;&nbsp;Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;will stand a strong chance if the&nbsp;Best Picture field stretches to eight or ten nominees.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"TV, Channel, Globe, robots, Mystery, globes, diversity, awards, on, stand-up, rt","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"mary-poppins-pops-into-the-oscar-race"},{"id":"47614433470481","title":"On DVD This Week: Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Ted 2, and More","content":"RT on DVDvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})On DVD This Week: Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Ted 2, and Moreby Ryan Fujitani | December 14, 2015 |  CommentsThis week on home video,&nbsp;we’ve got Ethan Hunt’s latest impossible mission, a Seth MacFarlane comedy sequel, the second chapter in a post-apocalyptic franchise, and a failed superhero reboot.

Beautifully spare aesthetics. Lingering silences. Themes of alienation and eroticism. In a career that spanned over 50 years, Antonioni made more than 30 short- and feature-length films, many of which have become canonized as classics integral to film history and European art cinema.In his early career Antonioni dabbled in the Italian neo-realism of his peers, documenting fishermen near his native Ferrara; his Il Grido (1957) chronicles the desperation of a working class mechanic in love. But the bulk of the auteur’s films would trend upwardly into the social elite, exploring relationships between woman and man, and man and modernity, with the director’s eye for architecture lending powerful imagery to stories of human frailty.It is often tempting to ask filmmakers, especially those that like to challenge their audiences, to explain themselves and the ideas behind their work. A former film journalist himself, Antonioni seemed to encourage moviegoers to find the secrets and messages in his films themselves, and imbued his work with such significance — metaphorical imagery, tone, thematic questions of the human condition — that he certainly helped elevate cinema into the realm of high art.Gianfranco Mangozzi’s 1966 documentary Antonioni: Documents and Testimonials (“the first documentary about Antonioni to receive his approval”) introduces the auteur thusly:“Antonioni is a poised, reserved and demanding northern Italian. Like his movies, he’s quite unfathomable at first. He doesn’t believe that any director’s statement about himself or his work, will help in the understanding of the work itself; the path traveled by a director to realize a movie is filled with doubts, mistakes, faults, and the strangest thing we might ask him to do, is to talk about it.”One of Antonioni’s best known films is L’Avventura, an existential drama about a search for a missing woman that melts into an affair between her friend and her lover. Shot memorably on the volcanic archipelago island of Lisca Bianca, L’Avventura features deliberate pacing, themes of upper class ennui, and an unconventional narrative that devolves from mystery into romance halfway through the film — all of which led famously to audience booing at the film’s Cannes Festival debut in 1960.On Criterion’s L’Avventura disk, Italian actress (and Antonioni muse) Monica Vitti recalls leaving the infamous Cannes screening in tears, only to be buoyed the next day by an open letter of support from international journalists and filmmakers (including director Roberto Rossellini and legendary Variety critic Gene “Mosk” Moskowitz). Despite its detractors, L’Avventura won that year’s Special Jury Prize and has since been recognized as essential and groundbreaking in its use of imagery and composition in film language.&nbsp;&nbsp;The film trilogy that began with L’Avventura continued with La Notte (1961) and L’Eclisse (1962), unrelated stories that shared Antonioni’s signature style and examined similar themes of isolation among men and women. All three films starred Vitti, whose most famous roles came from her fruitful pairing with Antonioni. Vitti also starred in the director’s subsequent Il Deserto Rosso (1964), thought to be the unofficial fourth film in the series.&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonioni found international success with a subsequent set of English language films. Blow-Up (1966) follows a London fashion photographer (David Hemmings) whose superficial life of photo shoots and sex orgies takes a serious turn when he photographs what may be a murder. His obsession with uncovering the truth of the event becomes maddening, and Antonioni breaks with convention to make the viewer complicit in the ambiguity. As in many of his films, Antonioni leaves his ending unexplained.The success of Blow-Up was not repeated with his next film, Zabriskie Point (1970). Widely remembered as Antonioni’s biggest failure, the film about America’s counter-culture boasted songs by Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, and the Rolling Stones but grossed only a small fraction of its $7 million production cost. It’s worth noting that Zabriskie, though flawed in its simple assessment of anti-establishment youth, kept true to many of the director’s trademark styles in forgoing traditional story structure to tell a story of disaffection.At 57 percent on the Tomatometer, Zabriskie Point is the lowest-scoring of Antonioni’s films made during his golden era (the 1960s and 1970s). His next film, The Passenger (1975), would be the last bright spot before Antonioni’s arguable decline in the years to follow. The film stars Jack Nicholson as a weary journalist who rashly adopts the identity of a dead man, and continues to keep the man’s gun-running appointments while inexplicably accompanied by a student (Maria Schneider) who becomes his lover. Re-released in 2005 by Sony Pictures Classics, The Passenger has scored a 91 percent Tomatometer.For this writer, it all comes back to L’Avventura. A truly revolutionary exercise in filmmaking, the picture gave life to Antonioni’s assertion of a new cinematic language, one in which objects and architecture — a volcanic island, an archway, a crumbling church tower — provide not just symbolic, but literal spaces for people to inhabit. Antonioni’s masterly compositions carefully place his characters in relation to these rigid structures; his rebellious use of long takes and moments of silence draw attention to every unspoken degree of change in each person and their relation to each other. To read L’Avventura with care is to learn to read movies, to reach beyond simple images on a screen and grasp ideas, concepts, and lamentations that are impossible to speak.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Masterpiece, Guild","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"remembering-michelangelo-antonioni"},{"id":"47614428098575","title":"One-Armed Push-ups All Around in Honor of Jack Palance","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})One-Armed Push-ups All Around in Honor of Jack Palanceby Alex Vo | November 10, 2006 |  CommentsJack Palance, who made a career out of bullying good guys and portraying stern, craggy-faced menaces, died Friday. Surrounded by family at his California ranch, he passed away from natural causes at the age of 87.Before breaking into Hollywood, Palance attended the University of North Carolina on a football scholarship. Well over six feet and 200 pounds, he became a prizefighter. He fought for two years, but nothing was accomplished other than having his nose broken, which would serve him well for his numerous villain roles. Afterwards, he had a stint in the Army Air Corps and worked variously as a short-order cook, lifeguard, waiter, and hot dog vendor.In 1950, Palance’s luck turned and he made a distinguished film debut as a villain named Blackie in Elia Kazan‘s \"Panic in the Streets.\" From that pulp masterpiece, Palance’s output never let up steam. Across his fifty year acting legacy, he portrayed, on average, two roles a year, not including his numerous guest appearances on television.1950’s \"Panic in the Streets\" (91 %)It was only two years after \"Panic in the Streets\" that Palance received his first Oscar nomination, and only one year after that he would receive his second. The first Oscar nom was for 1952’s \"Sudden Fear\" a noir thriller in which Palance played an actor trying to seduce perennial noir damsel-in-distress Joan Crawford. The second nom was for his Jack Wilson, an evil gunslinger in 1953’s \"Shane.\" At 100% Tomatometer, it was a critical and commercial smash, and it cemented Palance’s main Hollywood image: serious, imposing, and an able go-to guy for Westerns.1952’s \"Sudden Fear;\" 1953’s \"Shane\"After this early artistic peak, his roles and movies became so varied that he covered virtually every genre. He continued to do Westerns, such as 1966’s \"The Professionals\" (100% on the Tomatometer) and \"Young Guns\". As Carl Grissom, he was there when comic books finally made it into Hollywood with Tim Burton‘s \"Batman.\" Action buffs could see him in the buddy flicks \"Tango and Cash\" and \"Cops and Robbersons.\" And with \"Marquis de Sade: Justine,\" he’s one of the few to make major actors to make his mark in camp erotic horror.Even art house buffs would eventually have a run in with Palance, who played Jeremy Prokosch in Jean-Luc Godard‘s \"Contempt.\" At 94% Tomatometer, it remains one of Godard’s most accessible and celebrated films, and a unique opportunity to see Palance act alongside Brigitte Bardot, Fritz Lang, and Godard himself.1964’s \"Contempt;\" 1991’s \"City Slickers\"At the age of 72, nearly forty years after his last Oscar nomination, Palance won it in 1992 for his role in \"City Slickers\" as Curly Washburn, a spoof of his tough Westerner image. Upon accepting his award, he demonstrated his physical savvy by dropping to the stage and doing one-armed push-ups.\"That’s nothing, really,\" he said.Though Palance had a way with words, it also came up in unexpected ways: he published a book of poetry called \"The Forest of Love,\" published by Summerhouse Press. And at one point, Palance famously called \"most of the stuff\" he did \"garbage,\" and even more famously said of the directors he’s worked with, \"most of them shouldn’t even be directing traffic.\"","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"cancelled, TV, docuseries, richard, SXSW, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"onearmed-pushups-all-around-in-honor-of-jack-palance"},{"id":"47614404950023","title":"\"Buffy\" Gal to Have a \"Black Christmas\"","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})\"Buffy\" Gal to Have a \"Black Christmas\"by Scott Weinberg | January 16, 2006 |  CommentsThe lovely Ms. Michelle Trachtenberg, last seen as an \"Ice Princess\" and best known for her work on \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" has signed to star in Glen Morgan‘s \"Black Christmas,\" which, as any horror fan could tell you, is a remake of a well-regarded Bob Clark chiller from 1974.According to Production Weekly, \"Michelle Trachtenberg is set to topline the horror remake \"Black Christmas,\" along with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Katie Cassidy and Oliver Hudson.

He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1955’s Marty, in which he played a lonely Italian butcher; had early breakthrough roles in From Here to Eternity (1953) and Johnny Guitar (1954); and would become a household name with his portrayal of Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the hit TV series McHale’s Navy, which ran from 1962-66.Borgnine’s many other memorable performances included turns in Robert Aldrich’s classic The Dirty Dozen, Sam Peckinpah’s The Wild Bunch, ’70s disaster epic The Poseidon Adventure and John Carpenter’s Escape from New York. In his later career Borgnine became a fixture in TV roles, even connecting with a whole new generation as the voice of Mermaid Man on SpongeBob Squarepants. He was nominated for an Emmy, at age 92, for his role in the final season of E.R. in 2009.We actually thought he’d be around forever.

Gates | January 18, 2016 |  CommentsIn an early episode of of the first season of Agent Carter, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) donned a blonde wig and sparkling dress in order to go undercover at a glitzy party. For the rest of the season, however, costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton&nbsp;stuck with more everyday clothing for the show’s stars. With the action in season two packing up and moving from New York City to Los Angeles, Old Hollywood glamour finds its way back into the show.Glamour Is In The DetailsA lot of research goes into the costuming of the show, with many of the costumes either being vintage pieces from the era or recreations from vintage materials. Wynn Everett, who joins the cast this season as glamorous actress-scientist Whitney Frost (inspired by Hedy Lamarr) revealed, “The way they&nbsp;have done this show, from the costumes to the hair to the makeup, they are so determined to stick to detail. Underneath everything we’re wearing [vintage] undergarments. One day I was like, ‘I’m just gonna wear my own undergarments,’ and I walked on set and the costume department was like, ‘Wynn, go back and put on the right bra and the right hose!’&nbsp;They just are so incredibly detail oriented.”In The 1940s Everything&nbsp;Was&nbsp;ChicJoining the cast this season is Reggie Austin as scientist Jason Wilkes, who is a big fan of his wardrobe, saying&nbsp;it’s “just out of control. Everybody gets to wear awesome things. The ’40s were a great time to wear clothes. Everyone gets to wear some really cool, chic get ups. So yeah it’s nice.”Lesley Boone, who plays Rose, chimed in, “I mean, it’s so much fun. I feel like an actor. Everybody’s dressed up, everybody’s in the ’40s, there are all these cars. You really feel like you’re doing something, not just sitting around on set and waiting.” Enver Gjokaj (Agent Sousa) added, “When I started off acting, this is what I thought acting was going to be. And it wasn’t. But this show, it’s hanging out, ’40s car walks by, tons of extras in costume, and you look up and down the street and you’re in the ’40s. It’s wonderful.”Casual Friday Can Be Every DayOne inspiration for the men this season, including Agent Sousa, was Frank Sinatra and Montgomery Clift in From Here To Eternity. For this season, Gjokaj says, “Daniel has a bit of a West Coast vibe going on. And he’s running the West Coast SSR, so he’s kind of, he’s the boss now. I think he gets to set whether or not there’s casual Fridays.”Shooting In Old Hollywood Locations Brings The Magic BackMoving the action of season two from New York City to Los Angeles allowed the show to shoot in some of Los Angeles’ most iconic locations, including the Griffith Observatory, most famously used in Rebel Without A Cause. Star Hayley Atwell said that in prepping for this season, she watched the film, “knowing that we were going to shoot there, and I just wanted to see it on film again. It felt iconic, and a lot of these places Peggy probably will know about as well, so there’s this excitement of when, you know, like for me, 10 years ago when I first came out here and saw the Hollywood sign for the first time. You just think it’s so exciting, that first hit of it. And I think Peggy, who’s doesn’t really have much interest in the Hollywood world, per se, but I think it’s very much in her psyche because it’s part of the culture of her day, to have that kind of Golden Age of Hollywood.”Glamour Comes With A Dark SideIn this world of Old Hollywood, appearances are everything, but as Atwell points out during this era in Los Angeles’s history, “of course there’s an undercurrent of darkness, and that’s a lot to do with the gangsters and the serial killers that were kind of rife back then. It seemed to be these famous cases, and we’ve touched upon those a little bit. And I think it kind of add more of a film noir feel to it, and does make the whole thing a little bit more filmic.”New to the cast, Kurtwood Smith, who plays War Department veteran Verson Masters, added, “I think it has a very noir feeling&nbsp;this year.”Showrunners Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters confirmed they watched Noir Summer on Turner Classic Movies while working on the season and found particular inspiration from Gloria Grahame in The Big Heat. They also confided that modern noir like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential were also a big influence, with Fazekas elaborating, “L.A. Confidential was a big touchstone for us even last season.”Butters added, “When you’re talking about telling stories in the ’40s,&nbsp;a lot of the film noir of the ’40s takes place in L.A. And obviously, we shoot in L.A. So it had been something that we had talked about a lot. And we started to build the story around that because what’s great about that is, you have the glamour and glitz of Hollywood and you have crime and corruption right next to each other. We just started to say ‘Well, how would we get Peggy to L.A.?'”The two-hour season premiere of Marvel’s Agent Carter airs on January 19th at 9PM on ABC.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"71st, BBC, spider-man, BBC, festival, Studios, globe, Channel, Golden, natural, Searchlight, History, Calendar, bond","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"how-agent-carter-will-capture-hollywood-glam-in-season-two"},{"id":"47614443923479","title":"Heroes and Villains Join the Death Race Squad","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Heroes and Villains Join the Death Race SquadProduction begins in a few weeks, too.by Scott Weinberg | July 31, 2007 |  CommentsWe already knew that Jason Statham was toplining the new Death Race 2000 remake, but director Paul W.S.

Also, our DVD Pick of the week spotlights the latest from a legend of the French New Wave.TIFF Acquisition Roundup: Nothing is Private, The VisitorAccording to the trades, this Toronto Film Festival it’s been a relatively light on the distribution deal front. But several of the fest’s more talked-about movies recently got purchased, and will hopefully find their way to a theater near you soon.One of Toronto’s most controversial selections is the Alan Ball (Six Feet Under)-helmed Nothing is Private, starring Aaron Eckhart, Toni Collette, and newcomer Summer Bishil. It’s the dark story of an Arab-American teenager who suffers abuse from her family members and her neighbor, a racist Army reserve officer. Warner Independent and Netflix’s Red Envelope Entertainment picked up the movie for about $1.25 million.Tom McCarthy on the set of The Station AgentTom McCarthy‘s The Visitor was picked up by Overture Films, a new indie distributor, for $1 million. The Visitor is McCarthy’s follow-up to 2003’s The Station Agent; it tells the story of a middle-aged man who acts as the liaison between a Syrian musician he has befriended and the man’s family.In addition, the Weinstein Co. announced the pre-festival purchase of The King of the Hill, a Spanish thriller about a man and a woman lost in a remote rural area. And Lumina Films nabbed Heavy Metal in Baghdad, a documentary about a hard rock bandFor RT’s complete coverage of the Toronto International Film Festival, click here.RTIndie DVD Pick of the Week: Private Fears in Public PlacesThe latest from Left Bank filmmaker Alain Resnais (Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Year at Marienbad) was quite the festival attraction. For American audiences, the bonus of watching Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded‘s Merovingian) act forlorn and speak in his native tongue is a pretty solid incentive to commit to this two-hour French confection. Involving a cast of strangely whimsical, emotionally awkward people, Private Fears in Public Places tracks these lonely city dwellers in their respective stations in society as they bump into each other and occasionally find warmth together against the backdrop of a wintry Paris. It’s a beautiful film, the sort you can sink into. At 78 percent on the Tomatometer, Private Fears in Public Places shows the 85-year-old Resnais is clearly still fresh. “Resnais and his superb cast have poured their hearts into this film adaptation and anyone seeking mature entertainment should search for this gem,” writes Ted Murphy at Murphy’s Movie Reviews.Sara Schieron contributed to this article.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"APB, hollywood, The, Box, Hallmark, toy, Action","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"rtindie-tiff-acquisitions-include-controversial-political-films"},{"id":"47614449623066","title":"Charlton Heston: 1924-2008","content":"var mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Charlton Heston: 1924-2008Rest in peace, Mr. Heston.by Jeff Giles | April 7, 2008 |  CommentsCharlton Heston has passed away at the age of 84.The Oscar-winning star of dozens of films, including Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments, and Planet of the Apes, died at home after a struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.

Heston embodied a noble, heroic ideal — small wonder he was the man who injected a sense of gravitas, as well as intelligence and fallibility, to big, bold Biblical epics and historical dramas. And if the kind of grandiosity Heston brought to every role — even Wayne’s World 2! — might seem old-fashioned in these ironic times, there’s still something thrilling in seeing an actor of such rugged intensity giving every role his all. In remembrance of Heston, Rotten Tomatoes has compiled a short list of some of Heston’s most famous and memorable performances.The Ten Commandments (1956, 96 percent)With the influx of foreign, arthouse, and indie films in the mid-1950s film market — not to mention the looming threat of television — Hollywood’s answer to attracting audiences involved grand spectacle. Even given the life expectancy of bodies during biblical times, the 34-year-old Heston was strikingly young to play Moses, the legendary leader of the Jews. Yet no other could have outdone his booming voice and security inspiring authority. This is one of the more “pure” of the Biblical epics of the late 1950s early 1960s, for while there’s plenty of political commentary to be found within its dialogue and carefully located intimacies, its greatest strength is its ability to inspire the awe famously associated with Biblical tale. Heston’s Moses certainly contributes. For those less familiar with Cecille DeMille‘s last directing project, The Ten Commandments is one of those films that’s ironically had a longer life due to endless televised repetition.Touch of Evil (1958, 94 percent)One of the last of the classic film noirs, Orson Welles‘ Certified Fresh Touch of Evil featured one of Heston’s most driven performances. Heston plays Vargas, a newlywed Mexican g-man who investigates a bombing in a U.S. boarder town; he quickly runs up against the corrupt lawman Hank Quinlan (Welles), who appears to be railroading several Mexicans for the crime. Noirs don’t come much more noir than Touch of Evil, a stark, sinister, gritty, formally daring masterpiece. Though Touch of Evil had a troubled history — the film was taken out of Welles’ hands and recut — it was a favorite of Heston’s. “It was a remarkable experience for me, a great learning experience, one of the most valuable I’ve had in my whole film career,” he said.Ben Hur (1959, 88 percent)The downside (or upshot, depending) to the Studio Era was the Production Code, which required that certain subject matter not be broached in studio productions, no matter the relevance or box office draw. One such subject was violence, which is peppered (liberally for 1959) into Ben Hur. This tale of politics and racial tension during Christ’s ministerial rise features sword fighting, swashbuckling, and one of the most famously overplayed sequences in film: The epic chariot race, in which cinematographer Robert Surtees lit Heston in this scene to look like Apollo himself in the Coliseum. Violence notwithstanding, the most controversial elements of the film were the contributions made by notorious (and uncredited) screenwriter Gore Vidal. Suggestions of sexuality (distinct from today’s more common mores), the blacklist (of which Vidal was critical) and backhanded politics were intelligently apportioned but in heed of the Production Code, buried in subtext. Loaded with legendary dialogue (“The world is more than we know”), this multiple Oscar winner is another springtime repeat that’s impressive regardless of how you spend your Easter Sunday.Planet of the Apes (1968, 88 percent)In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Heston starred in a series of dystopian sci-fi flicks (The Omega Man, 61 percent, and Soylent Green, 73 percent) with more heft than your average futuristic fantasy. Time has taken some of the edge off these films (Phil Hartman unforgettably lampooned the later, portentously intoning, “Soylent Green is made out of PEEEE-POOOLLLLEEE!”), but the Certified Fresh civil-rights allegory Planet of the Apes remains influential — and was elevated by Heston’s intense performance. Heston plays an astronaut who lands on a planet run by sophisticated simians that have enslaved humans. The movie has one of the most iconic endings of 1960s cinema, as well as Heston’s oft-quoted line, “Take your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape!”And if you need any further proof of Heston’s greatness, we recommend you watch the following clip.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"docuseries","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"charlton-hestons-most-memorable-performances"},{"id":"47614487490606","title":"2021 Producers Guild Awards Nominations: The Full List","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})2021 Producers Guild Awards Nominations: The Full ListBorat 2, Judas and the Black Messiah, and Sound of Metal enter the Best Picture race, while favorites The Crown, Schitt's Creek, and The Queen's Gambit lead TV.by Jacqueline Coley | March 8, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by ©20th Century Fox courtesy Everett Collection)The Producers Guild of America announced their annual nominations this morning and though favorites like Regina King’s&nbsp;One Night in Miami&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom&nbsp;were among the nominees, they were joined by&nbsp;slightly surprising&nbsp;nods for&nbsp;Sound of Metal&nbsp;and&nbsp;Borat: Subesequent Moviefilm.

Also, Fox has issued the following press release regarding the lava-hotly-anticipated movie:Homer Simpson announced the much-anticipated feature film based on the hit television series The Simpsons will premiere in theaters worldwide July 27, 2007. The announcement was made in a specially-prepared teaser trailer that appears on prints of Ice Age: The Meltdown, which opened in theaters March 31. The teaser also aired on Sunday’s (April 2nd) episode of the hit TV series on FOX, which has just been picked up for its 18th and 19th seasons.Starring in the animated film are series regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Pamela Hayden, and Tress MacNeille. Guest starring in the movie are Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, and Albert Brooks.Producing the feature are The Simpsons series executive producer James L. Brooks, creator Matt Groening, current showrunner Al Jean, Mike Scully and Richard Sakai. The script is written by Groening, Brooks, Jean, Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder, and Jon Vitti – all series veterans. David Silverman (Monsters Inc.), the series’ supervising animation director, is helming the feature.\"This was enormously challenging, because it involved filling 120 blank pages with an actual story and words people say,\" said producer James L. Brooks.\"We’re very excited about the performances in this movie. Come next Oscars, we think it’s going to be Milhouse’s night,\" said producer Matt Groening.\"I can absolutely guarantee that this film will far exceed the wildest expectations of every Simpsons fan,\" said producer Al Jean. \"Start lining up at the theater now, preferably in costume.\"\"The movie is a result of the very singular vision of eleven people,\" said producer Mike Scully.\"We have all watched The Simpsons evolve from a groundbreaking television series into a global cultural phenomenon and everyone at Fox is excited about its leap to the big screen,\" said Chris Meledandri, President of Twentieth Century Fox Animation.Now in its 17th season, The Simpsons is the longest-running comedy series in the history of television. The critically praised series has been bestowed with numerous honors, including a Peabody Award, 21 Emmy Awards, 21 Annie Awards, four Genesis Awards, eight International Monitor Awards, two People’s Choice Awards, three British Comedy Awards, three Writers Guild Awards, and a Television Critics Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.","section":"Critics Consensus","tags":"Winter, Central, Drama, travel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/20131743/Ballistic-Ecks-Sever-Zeros.jpg","slug":"fox-issues-official-word-on-the-simpsons-movie"},{"id":"47614483898413","title":"Edgar Wright Shares 10 Of His Favorite Music Documentaries","content":"Newsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Edgar Wright Shares 10 Of His Favorite Music Documentaries\"Turn these up to 11,\" says the man behind the acclaimed (and Certified Fresh) new documentary The Sparks Brothers.by Edgar Wright | June 17, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Adrienne Pitts)I am a sucker for a great music documentary. If one is in front of me, I will watch it. And indeed I can watch films about pretty much any act or artist, whether I care for them or not. Sometimes the best of the bunch are about bands, singers, or genres that are not strictly my cup of tea. Sometimes they may revolve around someone I’ve never heard of. The skill is in the storytelling, and I watch music documentaries to be educated about the life of an artist and/or the cultural context of their work. Like the greatest narrative movies, the best documentaries can be funny, shocking, profound, thought-provoking, and sometimes life-changing. Out of a very long list, here’s 10 of my favourite music documentaries that I’ve enjoyed on multiple occasions. Turn these up to 11. – Edgar Wright, June 2021Edgar Wright’s Guide to Music DocumentariesThe Filth and the Fury (2000) 95%Julian Temple’s 2000 film on the short life and fast times of the Sex Pistols is, I think, the best music documentary of all time. Temple weaves in a dizzying amount of archive to give context to the hard times and bland culture from which the Sex Pistols emerged like a four-headed monster. It’s so brilliantly edited and conceived on every level, and all the talking heads (shot mostly in silhouette like people in witness protection) are brilliant — especially John Lydon and Steve Jones, who are unfailingly candid, profound, profane, and funny.The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988) 90%Penelope Spheeris’ snapshot of the music and excesses of the hair metal scene of 1980s Los Angeles is unforgettable. I haven’t seen it in a long time, but two images are burned into my brain. One is drunken WASP guitarist Chris Holmes sitting in an inflatable chair in his swimming pool being interviewed with his mother present and pouring a whole bottle of vodka over his head. The other is Paul Stanley from KISS being interviewed on a high angle over his bed, surrounded by half naked women. This documentary is rightly infamous, and while you might not want to be a part of this scene, it’s difficult not to get a contact high from the sheer ridiculousness of it all.Dig! (2004) 89%A great music documentary requires no previous knowledge of the subject, and I think a lot of people who became obsessed with Ondi Timoner’s 2003 film didn’t know a lot about the ups and downs of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and its mercurial frontman Anton Newcombe. This document of the rivalry between cult band The Brian Jonestown Massacre and their more popular colleagues The Dandy Warhols is a fascinating and highly quotable watch. It became something of the indie rock Spinal Tap as it was subject of much fevered discussion by every person who was in a band at the time.20 Feet From Stardom (2013) 99%A brilliant document of the unsung heroes of the rock and pop world: the backing singers. We all know the parts. Indeed they may be the only bits of the songs that one sings along to. But for the most part, session and back-up singers don’t get the glory of being front-of-stage. This film shines the spotlight on the women behind the songs we love: Darlene Love, Claudia Lennear, Lisa Fischer, Tata Vega, and Judith Hill. Most memorably of all, we hear Merry Clayton’s isolated vocal from The Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter,” and it’s spine-tinglingly powerful.Stop Making Sense (1984) 100%Okay maybe this is really a concert film, but it is a documentary of a band at the peak of their powers, and it also just happens to be the best concert film of all time. Jonathan Demme presents the band in such a formal fashion, building up first from singer David Byrne’s solo on stage to a full nine-piece ensemble, that the results are hypnotic. It draws you in rather than presenting a great concert at arm’s length. I think every concert film since has tried to copy or subvert this approach. It’s a magical movie.Anvil! The Story of Anvil (2009) 98%Both This Is Spinal Tap! and the UK’s Bad News skewered the music documentary in the ’80s with pitch-perfect sketches of a rock band on the road. But here, Canadian rockers Anvil are very real. Former fan and roadie Sacha Gervasi (now a successful writer and director in Hollywood) reunites with the band 20 years on and shows their path back to the stage and an adoring audience. It’s impossible not to admire the journey of frontman Steve “Lips” Kudlow&nbsp;as he goes from delivering meals for children’s charities to being back in his natural habitat: commanding the crowd at a rock festival. Showing the tough but often funny path back from rock bottom, Anvil is an inspiring watch.Bros: After the Screaming Stops (2018) 100%London pop trio Bros had an 18-month hot flash of success when they were the biggest thing since sliced bread. I wasn’t a fan back then — several of my female school friends were — but it was impossible to escape their songs and not get swept up in the teen hysteria. Then, as quickly as it had begun, it was over. This charming and hilarious documentary picks up 28 years after Bros’ chart-topping heyday and shows the fractious relationship between the band’s core members, identical twins Matt and Luke Goss. While their outlook on life is sometimes unintentionally funny, there’s a lot of real laughs too, not least an epic tangent about the banning of childhood game Conkers. There is also a real heart to the film, and it’s difficult not to be moved as they overcome tragedies and their differences to return to the arena for a comeback show. Highly entertaining.Dont Look Back (1967) 100%Many music documentaries try to recapture a time and a place, and a huge percentage of those that do are all working hard to evoke one particular decade – the 1960s. D.A. Pennebaker just happened to be in the right place at the right time when he covered Bob Dylan’s 1965 concert tour in England. Rather than try and capture the zeitgeist, Pennebaker just trained his camera on Bob Dylan and watched the scene whirl around him. An essential music documentary on every level.David Bowie: Five Years (2013)Frances Whatley’s trio of Bowie documentaries – comprising this, The Last Five Years, and Finding Fame&nbsp;– are brilliantly comprehensive films detailing the greatest chameleon in rock. What’s extraordinary in this case is even though the documentary does not feature a new interview with David Bowie, his journey is told beautifully through many key collaborators whose insights are revealing and thrilling. As a fan, seeing musicians and producers such as Rick Wakemen, Tony Visconti, Carlos Alomar, Earl Slick, Gale Ann Dorsey, Nile Rodgers, and others break down the songs was just magical.Gentle and Soft: The Story of the Blue Jean Committee Part 1A wildcard for my 10th&nbsp;choice. This episode of Documentary Now! is the finest musical mockumentary since all-time classic Spinal Tap. Fred Armisen and Bill Hader brilliantly skewer the overly reverent approach seen in many a classic rock doc. It tells the saga of soft rock band The Blue Jean Committee and is clearly taking loving potshots at The Eagles and Chicago along the way. Having the likes of Cameron Crowe, Daryl Hall, Kenny Loggins, and Michael McDonald as themselves doing the talking head duties for a wholly fictitious band is the icing on the cake.Edgar Wright’s own music doc,&nbsp;The Sparks Brothers, is in theaters&nbsp;on&nbsp;June 18, 2021.Thumbnail image: ©Cinecom/courtesy Everett Collection, Adrienne Pitts, ©RADiUS-TWC/Courtesy Everett CollectionOn an Apple device?
