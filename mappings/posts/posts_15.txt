Looking back at a few of my favorites from 2017, here are some recommendations you can watch (or re-watch) with viewers of various ages. Enjoy, and here’s to a great 2018!Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (Captain Underpants) (2017)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild rude humor throughout.I was so surprised by how fun this movie was – and I’m familiar with the wildly popular Dav Pilkey book series that inspired it. (My 8-year-old son is a huge fan.) But whether or not you or your kids have read a single page of George and Harold’s adventures, you’ll have a complete blast here. The animation is colorful and lively, the writing is consistently clever and the energy is brisk – so much so that you may have to watch Captain Underpants&nbsp;again to catch some of the gags you missed. Kevin Hart and Thomas Middleditch provide the voices of best friends who accidentally transform their mean elementary-school principal (Ed Helms) into the comic-book superhero of their dreams: The goofy, tighty-whitey wearing Captain Underpants. There’s quite a bit of potty humor here, but it’s amusingly self-aware. And there are valuable themes about&nbsp;being kind to people who are friendless or who’ve been bullied. A great choice for all ages. Tra-la-laaa!Wonder (2017)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;thematic elements including bullying, and some mild language.This was also a pleasant surprise, given that it looks painfully mawkish. Instead, Stephen Chbosky’s film (based on the R.J. Palacio Young Adult novel) is inspiring but restrained, with strong performances from an excellent cast and a worthwhile message about being openhearted and decent to others. Room&nbsp;star Jacob Tremblay continues to impress as a&nbsp;bright, sweet 10-year-old named Auggie who was born with a genetic abnormality that’s required multiple facial surgeries and treatments to fix. He’s been homeschooled all his life, but his mom and dad (Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson) eventually decide to send him to a Brooklyn middle school so he’ll know how the outside world works. Kids are initially cruel or dismissive of him, but he eventually makes friends. Along his journey, we also learn the truth about what life has been like for others in Auggie’s orbit. My son whispered to me at the start of the film that he thought Auggie’s appearance was weird; when it was over, he exclaimed, “I loved it!” A great choice for all ages.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)  76%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;adventure action, suggestive content and some language.This is in theaters now, so you may already have seen it. If not, go find it as a family before school resumes for 2018. It has big laughs, high-energy action sequences, and lively interactions from its strong cast. The kinda-sorta sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams adventure comedy finds four disparate high school students being sucked into an old video game set in the jungle. There, they find themselves in the bodies of characters that are completely different from who they are in real life. So the nerd ends up with the hulking muscles of Dwayne Johnson, while the beautiful mean girl winds up with the ample, bearded (and male) frame of Jack Black. (Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan also star.) Some of the set pieces involving ferocious animals might be too intense for younger kids, and there’s some body (and potty) humor that might seem a little grown-up. There’s also a bit of language scattered throughout. But I laughed the whole time, and I suspect you will, too. Jumanji&nbsp;consistently reinforces the importance of teamwork. And if your kids are into gaming, they’ll enjoy how aware the characters are of the video game setting and strategies. Suitable for viewers around 8 and older.War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)  94%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of sci-fi violence and action, thematic elements, and some disturbing images.This is on my top-10 list of the year’s best films; it’s also my favorite blockbuster of 2017. Director Matt Reeves’ final movie in the most recent Planet of the Apes&nbsp;trilogy features a dazzling mix of powerful action sequences and resonant emotion, with a mesmerizing motion-capture performance from the great Andy Serkis as the ape leader Caesar. But even though the film&nbsp;features apes on horseback – many of whom can talk, and some of whom are funny – it definitely isn’t for the entire family.&nbsp;As the title suggests, the apes are at war with humans over control of the planet. That means massive battle scenes, which are rendered through incredible special effects. Woody Harrelson is chilling as the humans’ leader, the cruel (and probably crazy) Colonel, making quiet, intimate moments just as startling as the louder, larger ones. Apes are held prisoner&nbsp;and whipped, beaten, and forced into hard labor.&nbsp;And the bold, percussive score from master composer Michael Giacchino contributes greatly to the general sensation of dread and suspense. But for more mature kids – around 11 and older – it’s a spectacular, thrilling time.Lady Bird (2017)  99%Rating:&nbsp;R, for&nbsp;language, sexual content, brief graphic nudity and teen partying.Yes, it’s rated R, but just hear me out on this. Lady Bird is an excellent choice for the teenagers in your house – especially teen girls – and maybe even viewers around 12 if they’re ready for material that’s a little more mature. It’s definitely one of the year’s best films, and it may even end up winning the Academy Award for best picture in a couple of months. Writer and actress Greta Gerwig makes her smart and insightful directing debut with this semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age story. Two-time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan does some of her best work yet as a high-school senior named Christine who insists that everyone call her Lady Bird. She can’t wait to fly far away from the mundane trappings of suburban Sacramento, California, for the bright lights and intellectual heights of New York City. But first, she must find out who she is and what kind of place she hopes to occupy in the world. There’s frank talk about sex, and we see Lady Bird awkwardly lose her virginity.&nbsp;There’s also teen partying – drinking and smoking – as well as language throughout. But Lady Bird&nbsp;is so funny, sweet and true, I can’t recommend it enough for the young people in your life who are struggling to navigate their own adolescent angst.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"IFC, e., Adventures, awards, A24, Walt, Company, politics, Black, Holiday, globe, dark, Disney, motion, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/29125958/Best-of-2017-PG.jpg","slug":"5-of-the-best-2017-films-you-can-watch-with-the-whole-family"},{"id":"47508902254395","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Boo 2!

A Madea Halloween and Wonderstruck?by Christy Lemire | October 20, 2017 |  CommentsGeostorm, the biggest movie in theaters this week, wasn’t screened ahead of time for critics, so we can’t tell you much about whether it’s appropriate for your kids if you’re in the mood for a disaster flick. What we&nbsp;can tell you about is Tyler Perry’s latest Madea outing and the rare kid-friendly Todd Haynes movie, as well as one of the biggest hits of the summer on DVD. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween (2017)  4%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sexual references, drug content, language and some horror images.It’s a Madea movie – and a sequel to a Madea movie, at that – so if you’ve ever seen any of them over the years, you know exactly what you’re in store for here. Multimedia titan Tyler Perry once again dons the silvery wig, floral frock and oversized glasses to play his most beloved character, the thoroughly inappropriate Madea. This time, she and her geriatric posse must venture into the woods when rebellious Catholic schoolgirl Tiffany (Diamond White), the daughter of Madea’s nephew Brian (also Perry), attends a Halloween party at a haunted lake. There’s some traditional horror imagery — a creepy girl with stringy dark hair, a guy in a mask wielding a chainsaw – but practically no gore. What makes this movie unsuitable for young viewers is the racy sexual talk, the language, and the many drug references. Madea’s brother, Joe (Perry, again), speaks frequently and fondly about his time as a pimp. The characters all bicker with each other constantly, which features a lot of profanity (although, amusingly, it’s clear that many of the damns have been dubbed into darns). And the high school and college students at the party, all dressed in naughty costumes, talk about who is going to hook up with whom. It isn’t terribly scary or funny, but if your kids are strangely compelled to see it, I suppose this is OK for viewers around 13 and older.Wonderstruck (2017)  68%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements and smoking.This is the rare film from master director&nbsp;Todd Haynes (Far From Heaven, Carol)&nbsp;that’s actually suitable for kids. And it stars two young actors who are pretty great: Millicent Simmonds and Oakes Fegley. Wonderstruck hops back and forth over 50 years to trace their characters’ connection. In 1927, a deaf girl named Rose (Simmonds) ventures from her comfortable home in Hoboken, New Jersey, to New York City to track down the silent film star (Julianne Moore) with whom she’s obsessed. In 1977, a Minnesota kid named Ben (Fegley), who’s also hearing impaired, runs away to Manhattan in search of the father he’s never known. In both timelines, the city is bustling and full of danger. The ‘70s New York is especially evocative of the grime and grit of the pre-Disneyfied era. And overall, the film has a lingering melancholy of loneliness and lost parents. But it’s also about finding friendship in unexpected places, and both kids show an impressive amount of independence and bravery. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.New on DVD&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  92%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments.With a box-office haul of nearly $880 million worldwide, this latest incarnation of the Spider-Man legend was a huge hit with viewers of all ages this summer. And justifiably so – it’s a total blast, and the most kid-friendly, live-action version of the character yet. There’s a lightness and a playfulness here that are sometimes missing in comic book movies – especially the darker and more self-serious ones featuring Batman and Superman. But Tom Holland brings a boyish enthusiasm to the role that’s infectious, glimmers of which we saw during his brief appearance in last summer’s Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;fits nicely into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it also stands comfortably on its own. It picks up right where Civil War leaves off, actually, with nerdy high schooler Peter Parker still reveling in the opportunity to hang with the big boys (and girls). But he also must keep his superhero identity a secret – including from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and best friend, Ned (scene-stealing newcomer Jacob Batalon) – even as he longs to continue fighting crime. There are some big battle scenes and action set pieces here, as there always are in this genre, including one spectacularly tense one aboard the Staten Island Ferry and another inside the Washington Monument. Innocent folks are frequently in peril, but Spider-Man always swings in to save the day. There’s also some language scattered throughout, some crass name-calling and light bullying. And there’s a quick (and hilarious) reference to porn, but younger viewers won’t get it.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Vudu, Certified, adaptation, aapi, Larson","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/20112421/Boo-2-Madea-Halloween-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-boo-2-a-madea-halloween-and-wonderstruck"},{"id":"47508903816003","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Leap! and All Saints?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Leap! and All Saints?by Christy Lemire | August 25, 2017 |  CommentsOf all the movies opening or expanding in wide release this week, only two are suitable for chidren: one is an animated film about a ballerina, and the other is an inspirational story based on true events. In other words, you’re probably pretty safe taking your kids to either one, even if one is likely to be more enjoyable for you. Read on for Christy’s take on both.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Leap! (2017)  42%Rating: PG, for some impolite humor, and action.A French orphan dreams of being a ballerina in this family-friendly – if mediocre&nbsp; — animated adventure. Elle Fanning provides the voice of Felicie, a plucky 11-year-old who escapes her dreary, rural trappings in the late 1800s and makes her way to Paris to study dance. Along for the ride is her best friend, a wannabe inventor named Victor (Nat Wolff), who’s secretly in love with her. Both find themselves in marginal danger as they scamper about the city streets. Felicie lies about her identity, pretending she’s a mean rich girl to sneak into the prestigious Opera Ballet School. And the girl’s mom (voiced by Kate McKinnon) is an over-the-top villainess who’ll stop at nothing to destroy Felicie, including chasing her at perilous heights across Paris. There’s nothing really harmful here, and I guess the themes of being true to yourself, chasing your dreams, and persevering are worthwhile. But there’s very little in Leap!&nbsp;that truly soars.All Saints (2017)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements.This faith-based film is inspired by the true story of a group of refugees from war-torn Myanmar who helped revive a bankrupt church in rural Tennessee. That’s a mouthful, and it may sound like there’s a lot going on here. But much of what makes director Steve Gomer’s film work is the understated way he approaches dramatic and potentially devastating situations. John Corbett stars as the pastor sent to All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, Tennessee, on a temporary assignment to oversee its sale. A big-box store is set to take over the land. But with the arrival of dozens of Karen farmers, who have no money and no place to go, the pastor sees an opportunity to turn the land into crops, give these folks a job and a home, and save the church. It’s an inspiring story of community and perseverance. And while All Saints&nbsp;is unmistakably a movie about faith, prayer, and signs from God, its religious element isn’t heavy-handed, which might make it more accessible for people of all beliefs (or lack thereof). The church members are tested both physically and spiritually. There’s discussion of the atrocities the refugees suffered before fleeing for the United States. And in one scene, the newcomers clash with police over a misunderstanding and a language barrier, but it’s quickly resolved. I’d say this is a fine and even worthwhile film for viewers around age 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language, and brief suggestive content.You probably saw the sequel to the 2014 surprise smash this summer – after all, it’s made nearly $863 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest grossing film of the year so far. In case you haven’t, though, and you’d like to check it out, I’d say it’s suitable for viewers around 10 and older. Once again, the Guardians get caught up in another galactic adventure – and bicker with each other, of course. Along the way to saving the day, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) – or Star-Lord, as he prefers to be called – learns the true identity of his long-lost father. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) are along for the ride, as well as the tiny Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). And similar to Diesel’s Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, the Guardians&nbsp;sequel is all about #family. There’s a ton of big, shiny, comic book-movie violence and action here: fights, chases, swordplay and gunfire of the outer-space variety. There’s also a lot of language – mainly from the saucy Rocket. Star-Lord and Gamora enjoy some more romantic tension. And there’s some grown-up humor that’ll probably go over kids’ heads. I brought my son with me to a screening and he did fine – but he’s also seen a lot of Marvel movies in his 7½ years. The themes of loyalty, perseverance, and creating your own family are valuable. And kids will love the insanely adorable Baby Groot. You will too, actually.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Biopics, Fox, San, ESPN, witnail, One, Crackle, movies, CMT, 20th, renewals, Masterpiece, crossover","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/25105301/Leap-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-leap-and-all-saints"},{"id":"47508902260542","title":"How Family-Friendly Are ‘Til Death Do Us Part and Our Souls At Night","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are 'Til Death Do Us Part and Our Souls At Nightby Christy Lemire | September 29, 2017 |  CommentsMost of the biggest movies opening this week are rated R, but there’s at least one wide release and one new film simultaneously hitting Netflix that promise slightly less adult-oriented entertainment. Read on for details on a domestic violence thriller and a drama about love late in life, as well as couple of DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;'Til Death Do Us Part (2017) Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic elements involving domestic abuse, violence, some sexuality and language.This is essentially a remake of the 1991 Julia Roberts thriller Sleeping With the Enemy, with an African-American cast. Annie Ilonzeh stars as a beautiful woman living a comfortable life with her handsome, doting husband (Stephen Bishop). But increasingly, he shows his controlling and jealous sides – and he eventually abuses her, mentally and physically, even though she’s pregnant with his child. She runs away to start a new life and thinks she’s found happiness – until one day when her husband tracks her down and arrives at her door. This is a pretty mature film with dramatic, disturbing images of domestic violence. There’s quite a bit of language and – in the couple’s happier times – some sexual images and discussions. There’s also a major car crash, a shooting and general melodramatic insanity. At the same time, director Chris Stokes’ film also has the good intention of encouraging domestic violence victims to seek help. Suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.Our Souls at Night (2017)  89%Rating: Unrated but contains adult situations and discussions and drunkenness.Fifty years after co-starring for the first time in Barefoot in the Park, Jane Fonda and Robert Redford reunite once again in this sweet story about finding love later in life. Their characters — widowed neighbors living in the same small, Colorado town — enter into an arrangement in which they sleep together nightly to fight loneliness. That’s it – just sleep. For a long time, their relationship remains platonic as they drift off discussing everything from mundane daily activities to long-held wishes and regrets. Eventually, though, their connection becomes more intimate, which director Ritesh Batra depicts tastefully with some chaste hotel-room kissing. Fonda’s character’s troubled son (Matthias Schoenaerts) also enters the picture as a drunk and sometimes neglectful dad to his own 7-year-old son. There’s a brief bit of conflict. But for the most part, Our Souls at Night&nbsp;– which is opening theatrically in limited release and available everywhere on Netflix – is a nice, well-acted picture that provides a solid showcase for its veteran superstars. Fine for ages 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  15%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13,&nbsp;for violence and intense sequences of sci-fi action, language, and some innuendo.It made over $605 million worldwide this summer — and that’s why they keep on making these Transformers&nbsp;movies, even though they’re terrible. Tweens and older should be fine watching it, however, even though Michael Bay’s latest somehow manages to be more incoherent than its predecessors. Once again, the planet is in peril, and only Mark Wahlberg playing a guy named Cade Yeager can save it. Giant robots smash into each other and their alien planet, Cybertron, might smash into Earth to drain it of all its energy. Bay’s film is, as always, a massive, cacophonous spectacle. There’s a ton of violence here, beginning with a battle set during the time of King Arthur. In the present day, the robot combat causes a ton of destruction, as always — and explosions. So many explosions. There’s quite a bit of language throughout as various characters insult each other and freak out about the possibility of the world ending. And there’s some mildly racy humor as Wahlberg’s character exchanges allegedly snappy banter with a brilliant and suggestively dressed professor (Laura Haddock), but kids probably won’t get it. My son (who’s nearly 8) saw it in IMAX 3D and he was fine, but kids who feel uncomfortable during sensory-overload movies like this might have difficulty watching it. And at well over two hours, the latest Transformers will probably be a tough sit for many young viewers.47 Meters Down (2017)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of intense, peril, bloody images, and brief strong language.Tweens and older should be fine watching this unabashed B-movie about beautiful young women in danger of becoming shark food. In fact, they’ll probably love it. 47 Meters Down&nbsp;is lean and mean, and it has some decent scares as well as some impressive underwater camerawork. Mandy Moore and Claire Holt co-star as sisters on a diving trip in Mexico in which they climb into a cage to swim with great whites. But the cable tying them to the boat snaps, plunging them to the bottom of the ocean, where myriad dangers abound. This is a pretty intense little movie. People suffer shark bites and one character dies. It’s dark and scary down there, and the women are constantly aware that they could die at any moment. Understandably, they frequently panic – which depletes their oxygen supply faster, which makes them panic even more. There’s also quite a bit of cursing and a little bit of kissing.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Nominations, cancelled, toy, Us, Fox, Universe, Century, Animation, biography, X-Men, Pixar, Comic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/29103128/Our-Souls-At-Night-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-til-death-do-us-part-and-our-souls-at-night"},{"id":"47508902241079","title":"3 Movies like Coco That Deal with Death and Loss from a Kid’s Perspective","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})3 Movies like Coco That Deal with Death and Loss from a Kid's Perspectiveby Christy Lemire | November 22, 2017 |  CommentsEven though Pixar’s latest effort,&nbsp;Coco, is another heartwarming animated tale aimed at family audiences, it does deal with often difficult subjects to discuss with kids, like death, grief, and memory loss. By most accounts, though,&nbsp;Coco is great, so don’t be afraid to see it with your children. But if you’re looking for some alternate recommendations, Christy Lemire has you covered.THE MOVIECoco (2017)  97%Rating: PG, for thematic elements.The latest animated extravaganza from Disney/Pixar is a visual delight, brimming with color, energy and magical creatures. But much of the film from director Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) also takes place in the Land of the Dead, which is full of talking, singing skeletons as well as spirit animals that can, at times, seem menacing. It’s all beautiful and often quite funny. But danger abounds as well as deeply sad moments about memory loss and death. Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez), a 12-year-old boy from a Mexican family full of shoemakers, dreams of becoming a musician like his idol, movie and singing star Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt). But his family has forbidden music in the house for generations because of a long-ago betrayal. On Dia de los Muertos – the traditional Day of the Dead – Miguel travels to the Land of the Dead to fulfill his destiny and learn his true identity. The skeletons are, for the most part, warm and friendly. Miguel’s ancestors, who’ve been watching over him, welcome him and help him get back home. But very young kids might find them frightening, as well as a giant, winged spirit animal that’s after Miguel. Scenes in which elderly relatives appear feeble, forgetful and on the brink of death might seem confusing to small children, but they also offer the opportunity to talk about the importance of honoring the cultural contributions of our ancestors. Fine for viewers around 5 or 6 and older.THE RECOMMENDATIONSIf you’re looking for other films that deal with themes of loss, death, and the great beyond to share with your family, there are lots of great choices, including:ParaNorman (2012)  89%Rating:&nbsp;PG,&nbsp;for scary action and images, thematic elements, some rude humor and language.The stop-motion animation films from LAIKA (Coraline, Kubo and the Two Strings) are painstakingly rendered and endlessly inventive. But they often have an off-kilter sense of humor and darker themes, which might work best for more mature kids. Here, in the studio’s second film, an 11-year-old misfit named Norman (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) must use his ability to communicate with the dead to save his small New England town from a zombie invasion. But the place already was cursed, thanks to a centuries-old witch-hunt. Monsters abound, which clearly will be too frightening for very little kids. Children are almost constantly in peril and there are lots of dark shadows and jump scares. The creatures are grotesque – some have body parts that fall off — but that’s usually played for laughs. But Norman also has the opportunity to connect with his recently deceased grandmother (the great Elaine Stritch), who lingers in purgatory and serves as his friend and guide.&nbsp;It’s a touching relationship. ParaNorman&nbsp;also has valuable themes about understanding, tolerance and overcoming bullying. Fine for viewers around 8 and older.Frankenweenie (2012)  87%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements, scary images and action.Another stop-motion animated film, this time from the delightfully twisted mind of Tim Burton. Following the accidental death of his beloved dog, Sparky, 10-year-old Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) figures out how to bring his buddy back to life using his vast science knowledge. Sparky isn’t quite the same, though, and his reincarnation leads to an invasion of monstrous creatures. Burton’s film is gorgeous in crisp black-and-white, and the meticulous details are dazzling. Frankenweenie&nbsp;might be too scary for very young children; technically and thematically, it represents the best of what Burton has had to offer over his lengthy career. But it’s also a sweet story about the&nbsp;powerful bond between a boy and his dog, one that goes on even after death — a heartrending subject, to be sure, but one that Burton infuses with his trademark mix of lively energy and macabre laughs. The film also features a sympathetic, protective portrayal of an outsider and an affectionate skewering of the sanctity of suburbia.&nbsp;Fine for kids around 7 and older.My Girl (1991)  53%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13.Have tissues handy: My Girl is a tearjerker, no matter how old you are. It’s also a sweet coming-of-age movie that’s a good fit for both girls and boys. Director Howard Zieff’s film is much better than&nbsp;its 50% Tomatometer score&nbsp;would suggest, thanks to its strong cast. Anna Chlumsky stars as Vada, a perky and bright pre-teen girl who’s obsessed with death in 1972. Her father (Dan Aykroyd) is a mortician, her mother died giving birth to her, and she’s a hypochondriac. (And, as in Coco, Vada has a grandmother who’s suffering from Alzheimer’s.) Her best friendship with a boy named Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) helps provide her with the comfort and stability that she needs, especially when Dad gets remarried to his new cosmetician (Jamie Lee Curtis). But a shocking, accidental death changes everything. Vada, a tomboy, is coming to terms with puberty, so there’s also some sort-of grown-up talk about body changes. My Girl may seem overly earnest, but it’s also a well-intentioned and direct film about moving through loss and grief toward understanding and redemption.&nbsp;Fine for viewers around 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"language, Awards, Pirates, Competition, docudrama, Originals, america, Arrowverse, MSNBC, Netflix, a","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22160539/Coco-PG.jpg","slug":"3-movies-like-coco-that-deal-with-death-and-loss-from-a-kids-perspective"},{"id":"47508902256444","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Happy Death Day and Goodbye Christopher Robin?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Happy Death Day and Goodbye Christopher Robin?by Christy Lemire | October 13, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s a chance your kids may be in the mood for some chills at the movie theater this weekend, and the PG-13-rated&nbsp;Happy Death Day might seem like just the ticket. Here’s what you’ll want to know if you plan on making an outing of it, or if you plan on seeing the fact-based origin story of Winnie the Pooh.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Happy Death Day (2017)  72%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;violence/terror, crude sexual content, language, some drug material and partial nudity.It’s a slasher-flick take on the Groundhog&nbsp;Day&nbsp;model. Vapid sorority girl Tree (Jessica Rothe) is stuck living the same&nbsp;day&nbsp;over and over again – and getting killed by a stalker in a creepy mask at the end. She must not only outsmart her killer but also learn this person’s identity – and maybe become a better person along the way. Despite its repeated, violent deaths, director Christopher Landon’s film isn’t as gory as a lot of horror movies, but there’s still a lot of grown-up stuff here. When we first meet Tree, she’s waking up hungover in a dorm room with a fellow student (Israel Broussard) whose name she can’t remember. There’s a ton of sexual talk, language, and partying. The sorority sisters are frequently mean to each other. Also, Tree is having an affair with her married professor. But even though the formula feels familiar, the execution is a lot of fun. Fine for viewers around 13 and older.Goodbye Christopher Robin (2017)  63%Rating:&nbsp;PG for&nbsp;thematic elements, some bullying, war images and brief language.Winnie the Pooh gets the origin-story treatment in this tastefully-made, well-acted period drama. Christopher Robin was indeed a real person and the inspiration behind the Pooh-niverse: His father, A.A. Milne, was the author who created all those beloved characters and their adventures in the Hundred-Acre Wood. Director Simon Curtis’ film shows us innocent moments of playtime with stuffed animals, but doesn’t shy away from the emotional turmoil young Christopher Robin (Will Tilston) endured. His father, Milne (Domhnall Gleeson), suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder after fighting in World War I (although, of course, they didn’t call it that back then), frequently causing him to lash out. His mother, Daphne (Margot Robbie), was a party girl who hated country life and often abandoned her family to return to London. And as Winnie the Pooh’s fame grew, so did the young boy’s, which became overwhelming for him. Later, as a boarding school student (when he’s played by Alex Lawther), he becomes the target of bullies. Goodbye Christopher Robin also shows flashbacks to the war violence Milne endured, which might be hard to watch. Ultimately it’s heartwarming, but there’s some tough stuff on the way there. Suitable for viewers around 8 or 9 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"kaiju, Access, media, superhero, italian, america, E3, Stephen, Plus, APB, American, VICE, Fall, Witch, Ice","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/13122938/Happy-Death-Day-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-happy-death-day-and-goodbye-christopher-robin"},{"id":"47508902263615","title":"How Family-Friendly Are The LEGO Ninjago Movie and Battle of the Sexes","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are The LEGO Ninjago Movie and Battle of the Sexesby Christy Lemire | September 22, 2017 |  CommentsThe latest entry in the LEGO movie universe is clearly aimed at kids — no surprise there — but Christy also offers her take on the based-on-true-events tale of a groundbreaking tennis match, opening in limited release, and a documentary on one of the world’s biggest pop stars, currently streamable on Netflix. She also re-examines one of the biggest blockbuster hits of the summer, newly available on DVD. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Lego Ninjago Movie (2017)  56%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some mild action and rude humor.The third movie in the Lego Cinematic Universe isn’t nearly as zippy, funny, or visually inventive as its predecessors. And if you and your kids are fans of the TV show Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu, you may be disappointed to find how little the film version resembles it. But The Lego Ninjago Movie&nbsp;is the only week’s new release that the whole family can enjoy together, so if you’re planning to see it, you’ll probably have a decent time. The animated comedy follows the adventures of a group of high school students who are secretly ninjas. Specifically, it follows their leader, the green ninja Lloyd Garmadon (voiced by Dave Franco), as he struggles to reconnect with his estranged father, the evil Lord Garmadon (Justin Theroux) – a villain who just happens to keep invading Ninjago City. Fred Armisen, Kumail Nanjiani, Abbi Jacobson, Michael Pena, and Zach Woods provide the voices of the other ninjas, but they don’t get much to do; Jackie Chan plays their wise leader, Master Wu. The antics are zany, and the martial-arts battles and big action sequences are played for laughs. There’s nothing scary or inappropriate here, and ultimately, the story is very family-affirming. Fine for all ages.Battle of the Sexes (2017)  84%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some sexual content and partial nudity.Emma Stone and Steve Carell star in the true story about tennis legends Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, who played each other in a highly watched 1973 match known as the “Battle of the Sexes.” The groundbreaking King was the world’s top-ranked tennis player at the time; Riggs, a self-professed chauvinist pig, challenged her to a match in hopes of proving that men were superior athletes. At the same time, though, the married King began a romance with her hairdresser (Andrea Riseborough), exploring previously untapped lesbian urges that could derail her career if exposed. The film from directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (Little Miss Sunshine) focuses intimately and tenderly on King’s affair; we see a lot of kissing and cuddling in hotel rooms and the suggestion that the two women have had sex. There’s also a slight bit of nudity. Because this was the ‘70s, nearly everyone smokes. And overall, the sexist attitudes many men in the tennis world had toward female players (and women in general) may be shocking for younger viewers to hear – but maybe that’s also a potential teaching moment, to show how antiquated and wrong such thinking is. Suitable for ages 10 or 11 and older.Gaga: Five Foot Two (2017)  73%Rating: Unrated, but contains language throughout, some nudity, smoking and discussion of drug use.Your kids may love Lady Gaga, but they may not be ready just yet for this intimate look at the pop superstar. Director Chris Moukarbel’s documentary, which is also available on Netflix, follows Gaga as she records and promotes her very personal “Joanne” album and prepares for her halftime performance during Super Bowl LI. But we also see her struggling with constant physical pain and lamenting the collapse of her romance with actor Taylor Kinney, whom she’d planned to marry. Gaga cries a lot in the film, making herself vulnerable time and time again. She also curses and smokes throughout the film, and we see her topless several times as she changes clothes backstage or just hangs out with friends. It’s a fascinating profile, with Gaga emerging as a woman and an artist who’s confidently, defiantly herself, even as she’s willing to reveal human frailties. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Wonder Woman (2017)  93%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of violence and action, and some suggestive content.This movie was a massive hit this summer, making nearly $820 million worldwide, and understandably so. It’s a thrillingly executed, surprisingly emotional blockbuster that has a lot to offer viewers of various ages – but perhaps not young kids. It’s great, but it’s also extremely violent. In telling the origin story of Diana Prince (a hugely charismatic Gal Gadot), the Amazon warrior who’d become a superhero, director Patty Jenkins has pulled off a tricky balance of humor, heart and high-tech spectacle that’s genuinely inspiring. But Wonder Woman&nbsp;also features several long, graphic action sequences. There’s a ton of gunfire, swordplay, and hand-to-hand combat. Many characters die, and while there isn’t a lot of blood (hence the PG-13 rating), the movie definitely doesn’t shy away from showing the actual deaths. We see people in peril – including women and children — during World War I battles. In one scene, a room full of bad guys perish from poisonous gas. There’s also the suggestion of a sex scene between Diana and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), the American spy she rescues from a crash landing, but all we see is kissing in a hotel room. At over two hours, Wonder Woman&nbsp;also might be too long for many kids. Diana is heroic and brave, idealistic and pure, and she’s usually the smartest and most capable person in the room or on the battlefield. That’s all worthwhile. But I suspect this would be too much just yet for viewers younger than 8 or 9.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sundance, cancelled, Century, caribbean, jones, Geo, Spike","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/22122023/Lego-Ninjago-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-lego-ninjago-movie-and-battle-of-the-sexes"},{"id":"47508902245177","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Daddy’s Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Daddy's Home 2 and Murder on the Orient Express?by Christy Lemire | November 10, 2017 |  CommentsBoth of the big films out this week skirt that PG-13 line between more adult-oriented films and stuff aimed squarely at kids, so if you’re thinking of taking the family to the Will Ferrell/Mark Wahlberg comedy or Kenneth Branagh ensemble murder mystery, here’s what you’ll want to know.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Daddy's Home 2 (2017)  21%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for suggestive material and some language.It’s the sequel to the 2015 comedy Daddy’s Home, which I’m not sure anybody needed, but here it is anyway. Similar to last week’s A Bad Moms Christmas, in which the moms’ moms invaded, this time the dads’ dads show up to celebrate the holidays. Madcap hilarity ensues. Mel Gibson plays Mark Wahlberg’s randy father and John Lithgow plays Will Ferrell’s cuddly pop. There are mature gags involving flirtations with women, and Gibson’s character tells some off-color jokes that younger viewers won’t get. While there are several children in the supporting cast, they’re often the butt of jokes or recipients of terrible (and crass) advice, and a couple of the youngsters get drunk on eggnog. One character has a shoplifting habit. There’s also quite a bit of language scattered throughout. And several moments of slapsticky humor are actually quite violent. It’s not very good, but it’s probably OK for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.Murder On The Orient Express (2017)  60%Rating: PG-13, for violence and thematic elements.Well there’s the word “murder” in the title, so clearly someone gets killed here. But even more fundamentally, director and star Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie mystery will probably be too grown-up for younger viewers, who might find it slow and hard to follow. Branagh leads an all-star cast (Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Daisy Ridley, Penelope Cruz) as the world-famous detective Hercule Poirot. When a passenger on the Orient Express train is murdered, Poirot must solve the crime by investigating the handful of other people on board. There’s a lot of adult discussion of motive, as well as graphic description of the killing itself. There are also some physical altercations between several of the characters. Many characters smoke. And the subject matter in general is probably not suitable for viewers younger than 10 or 11.New on DVD&nbsp;Cars 3 (2017)  69%Rating:&nbsp;GKids of all ages can enjoy this third film in the animated Cars&nbsp;franchise, and they probably have done so already.&nbsp;It’s totally harmless and not even remotely as complicated or challenging as the best of the Pixar universe. Cars 3 once again centers on Lightning McQueen (voiced as always by Owen Wilson), who’s now finding that, as a veteran racer, he’s not nearly as fast as his newer, more high-tech competitors. He works with a younger, female trainer named Cruz (Cristela Alonzo), who had long dreamed of racing herself. Basically, it’s about middle-age angst, which should be super fun for the kids in your family. Lightning suffers a couple of bad crashes, and he and Cruz find themselves in danger when they accidentally enter themselves in a demolition derby. But there’s nothing inappropriate here.The Glass Castle (2017)  52%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;mature thematic content involving family dysfunction, and for some language and smoking.Mature tweens and older are the right audience for this drama, based on Jeannette Walls’ best-selling memoir about her horrific youth. Director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton Short Term 12 doesn’t shy away from showing us the squalor, poverty and hunger she and her siblings endured. The film flashes back and forth between Jeannette’s life as an up-and-coming New York journalist in 1989 (when Brie Larson plays her) and her uncertain childhood (when Ella Anderson plays her). The kids’ alcoholic father (Woody Harrelson) and flighty artist mother (Naomi Watts) wanted the family to live off the grid, which meant multiple moves from town to town, no school, and often no food. Jeannette frequently suffers physical and mental abuse. In one scene, she severely burns herself on the stove because her mother can’t be bothered to feed her; in another, she nearly drowns in a public pool when her father throws her into the deep end to teach her how to swim. All of these perils are in the name of making her (and the other kids) stronger, of giving them independence and character. But it’s harrowing to watch. The film also includes scenes of abandonment and neglect, as well as a moment when the father encourages teenage Jeannette to visit the apartment of an older man who tries to sexually assault her. Ultimately, The Glass Castle&nbsp;is about forgiveness and redemption, but it’s a long and painful haul to get there.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"critic, a, park","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/10111551/Daddys-Home2-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-daddys-home-2-and-murder-on-the-orient-express"},{"id":"47508903867210","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Spider-Man: Homecoming?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Spider-Man: Homecoming?by Christy Lemire | July 7, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is the latest big screen iteration of your friendly neighborhood wall-crawler, and kids who have grown up watching the MCU movies will certainly want to hit the theaters for it. It is, however, rated PG-13, and Christy fills us in on what you’ll need to know about it before you take the young ones to see it. Read on for details on that and a recent Holocaust drama newly available on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)  92%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;sci-fi action violence, some language and brief suggestive comments.Spidey is back for an all-new adventure, and it might be the most kid-friendly, live-action incarnation of the character yet. There’s a lightness and a playfulness here that’s sometimes missing in comic book movies – especially the darker and more self-serious ones featuring Batman and Superman. But Tom Holland brings a boyish enthusiasm to the role that’s infectious, glimmers of which we saw during his brief appearance in last summer’s Captain America: Civil War. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;fits nicely into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it also stands comfortably on its own. It picks up right where Civil War&nbsp;leaves off, actually, with nerdy high schooler Peter Parker still reveling in the opportunity to hang with the big boys (and girls). But he also must keep his superhero identity a secret – including from his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and best friend, Ned (scene-stealing newcomer Jacob Batalon) – even as he longs to continue fighting crime. There are some big battle scenes and action set pieces here, as there always are in this genre, including one spectacularly tense one aboard the Staten Island Ferry. Innocent folks are frequently in peril, but Spider-Man always swings in to save the day. There’s also some language scattered throughout, some crass name-calling and light bullying. And there’s a quick (and hilarious) reference to porn, but younger viewers won’t get it. I brought my 7 ½-year-old son to a screening and he absolutely loved this movie (as did I). Totally great for kids around 7 or 8 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Zookeeper's Wife (2017)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic elements, disturbing images, violence, brief sexuality, nudity and smoking.Jessica Chastain hangs out with lots of cuddly and adorable zoo animals, but don’t be fooled: This isn’t a kids’ movie. Viewers around age 12 and older will probably be fine watching this true story about a couple who saved the lives of hundreds of Jews during the Holocaust by hiding them in the basement of the Warsaw zoo. Chastain’s Antonina Zabinski and her husband, Jan (Johan Heldenbergh), risked their lives and that of their young son by sneaking people out of the Warsaw ghetto and helping them find new lives. Director Niki Caro’s film is often extremely hard to watch. We see Nazi soldiers shoot people and animals to death. We witness Jews being herded onto trains on their way to concentration camps. One young woman is raped (we don’t see the assault, but it’s implied). A zoologist from Berlin (Daniel Bruhl), who initially pretends to be the couple’s ally, eventually reveals himself as a Nazi and tries to force himself on Antonina. There’s a ton of World War II violence, including shootouts, bombings and mass destruction. But The Zookeeper’s Wife&nbsp;is also a well-acted, inspiring story of heroism, courage and sacrifice.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"hispanic, talk, lee, News, all-time, globes, GLAAD, werewolf, New, Mindy, Tyler, Academy, Fox, competition","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/06170025/Spider-Man-Homecoming-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-spider-man-homecoming"},{"id":"47508903872331","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Despicable Me 3?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Despicable Me 3?by Christy Lemire | June 30, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s only one new wide release out this week that’s anywhere near appropriate for family viewing, and that’s the latest in the&nbsp;Despicable Me franchise. It’s probably mostly fine for your kids, but read on for Christy’s take on it, as well as a look at the recent&nbsp;Power Rangers movie that just arrived on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Despicable Me 3 (2017)  58%Rating: PG, for action and rude humor.Gru and the Minions are back for yet another wildly colorful animated adventure. If you’ve seen the previous two Despicable Me movies – and really, how could you avoid them? – you’re in for a lot more of the same. This time, Gru (voiced as always by Steve Carell) finds out he has a long-lost, identical twin brother named Dru (also voiced by Carell). But whereas Gru wants to live a quiet life with new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and their young daughters — Margo, Edith and Agnes – Dru wants to drag him back into the excitement of super villainy. Together, the two team up to fight an ‘80s child star turned bad guy, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), who has stolen a giant pink diamond to use as a giant laser. And they have to do it without the (dubious) help of the Minions, who’ve been thrown in prison. Suffice it to say, there’s a lot going on here. But it’s all so zany and high-energy, kids will probably be laughing too hard to realize how convoluted the plot is. Despicable Me 3&nbsp;features the usual crass humor as its predecessors: tiny, yellow Minion butts, fart guns, gibberishy jokes about boobs, that sort of thing. At one point, the girls wander into a dive bar, but it’s populated with harmless, amusing lowlifes. There are big, noisy chase scenes and action sequences, as well as some mass urban destruction in Hollywood, but everything turns out fine in the end. Suitable for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Saban's Power Rangers (2017)  50%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language, and for some crude humor.Kids around 9 or 10 and older should be fine watching this latest incarnation of the Power Rangers saga, an update on the the cheesy TV series you may have grown up watching in the early 1990s. Essentially, it’s a superhero version of The Breakfast Club, with five disparate high school students finding colorful crystal coins in an abandoned mine that give them unexpected powers. But they also find themselves in the middle of a battle for the planet that’s millions of years old. In the process, the fictional small town of Angel Grove gets decimated. There’s quite a bit of big, noisy violence here, as well as some more intimate, hand-to-hand combat sequences with monsters that look like a bunch of boulders stacked on top of each other. There’s also language throughout, some suggestive humor off the top involving a cow’s bodily fluids, and a police chase and car crash. And the villain, former Power Ranger Rita Repulsa (a campy Elizabeth Banks), may seem scary to little kids, particularly at the beginning of the film when she looks especially witch-like and hasn’t regained her full power and splendor. That’s the only thing that my 7-year-old son found disturbing: an especially violent scene in an alley at night involving Rita and a hobo who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it’s brief.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Warner, Podcast, actors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/30115432/Despicable-Me-3-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-despicable-me-3"},{"id":"47508903863113","title":"War for the Planet of the Apes Is Good, but It’s Not for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})War for the Planet of the Apes Is Good, but It's Not for Kidsby Christy Lemire | July 14, 2017 |  CommentsThe latest entry in the Planet of the Apes franchise barrels its way into theaters this week, and by most accounts, it’s a fantastic film. But if you’re looking to catch up with Caesar and his battle with humanity, you may want to leave your kids at home. Christy explains why, then offers her thoughts on a few DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes (2017)  94%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;sequences of sci-fi violence and action, thematic elements, and some disturbing images.The latest film in the epic Planet of the Apes saga is beautifully acted, exquisitely crafted and unexpectedly emotional. It’s the best blockbuster of the summer and it might end up being one of the best movies of the year. But while it features apes on horseback – many of whom can talk, and some of whom are funny – this definitely isn’t a film for the entire family. Director Matt Reeves’ movie – the third in a reboot trilogy, following Rise of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;– is extremely intense and violent, with protracted battle sequences and multiple deaths. Caesar (Andy Serkis in yet another powerful, detailed performance-capture role) wants to lead his apes to safety, but they all end up in a brutal struggle against the humans, led by the sadistic Colonel (Woody Harrelson). Bullets and arrows fly and many people and apes die, including key characters. Several of the apes are held prisoner for an extended time and are whipped, beaten and forced into hard labor. While it features massive explosions and destruction, War is also disturbing in some of its quieter, darker imagery. And the bold, percussive score from the great composer Michael Giacchino adds to the overall feeling of danger and suspense. But for more mature kids – around 11 and older – it’s a spectacular, thrilling time at the movies.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious (2017)  67%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for prolonged sequences of violence and destruction, suggestive content, and language.If you and your kids have seen any of the previous movies in the Fast and Furious&nbsp;franchise, you know what you’re in for here. This eighth film in the series is just as nutty as its predecessors in terms of giant action set pieces, but it’s also extremely violent in ways large and small, making it suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older. It’s got everything from hand-to-hand combat, gunfights, shootings and stabbings to cars dropping out of windows in the middle of New York City and a submarine emerging from the ice in middle-of-nowhere Russia. And for one extended sequence aboard an airplane, a baby in a car seat is in danger. Oh, and there’s a plot, too: A hacker (Charlize Theron) forces Dom (Vin Diesel) to turn against his F&amp;F fam and help her with a nuclear terrorism plot. Not that it matters. Massive, fiery destruction ensues. Director F. Gary Gray’s film also features quite a bit of language scattered throughout and the requisite amount of gyrating, scantily clad ladies. It’s all about family, as always, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s suitable for everyone in your family.The Lost City of Z (2017)  86%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;violence, disturbing images, brief strong language and some nudity.Kids around 12 or 13 and older should be fine watching this historical drama, and they might be interested in its many adventurous elements. But the deliberately languid pacing, which is a trademark of writer-director James Gray’s style, will make it a tough sit for younger viewers. Charlie Hunnam stars in this true story of Percy Fawcett, an explorer who set out in the 1920s to prove the existence of a long-lost South American civilization. He made several journeys to the Amazon, all of which were treacherous and potentially deadly. But Fawcett kept going back for more – and even brought along his teenage son at one point — as new clues tantalized him and stoked his obsession. There are plenty of guns and shootings, including hunting, with smoking and language throughout. The natives frequently seem threatening. And the ending is a bit ambiguous, which could lead to some confusion.Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017)  40%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for&nbsp;some mild action and rude humor.If you’re looking for a movie the whole family can watch together, the all-new Smurfs animated adventure is a solid pick. It’s better than you might expect – despite what the Tomatometer suggested when it came out theatrically. Smurfette (voiced by Demi Lovato) wonders what her purpose is in life while every other Smurf’s abilities are clear from their names alone: Brainy, Hefty, Jokey, etc. When she and her friends learn there’s another entire village of Smurfs, they set off to find them – and to warn that Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) is after them to drain them of their power. This is a vibrant and lively film with a valuable central message about female identity and empowerment. It’s also about strong women supporting each other, as Smurfette finds and connects with a tribe of female Smurfs (voiced by Julia Roberts, Ellie Kemper and Michelle Rodriguez, among others). The humor is mostly light and playful and often extremely slapsticky. Kids will enjoy the cute and clever creatures. Gargamel flies into full-on, villainous rampages a couple times, accompanied by dramatic music and lighting, which might seem slightly scary for extremely young kids. Mostly, though, he’s a buffoon whose bumbling schemes are played for laughs.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"adaptation, Cinematographers, talk, Tomatazos, John, political, Marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/14103340/War-for-Planet-Apes-PG.jpg","slug":"war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-is-good-but-its-not-for-kids"},{"id":"47508903845703","title":"If Your Kids Insist on Watching The Emoji Movie, Here’s What You Should Know","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})If Your Kids Insist on Watching The Emoji Movie, Here's What You Should Knowby Christy Lemire | July 28, 2017 |  CommentsYes, there’s a decent chance your kids have seen the colorful, zany ads for The Emoji Movie, and with little else playing for the little ones in movie theaters, you may find yourself standing in line for tickets to see it. Christy offers some advice for those of you who are thinking about doing this, and she also has an alternative to offer. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Emoji Movie (2017)  7%Rating: PG, for rude humor.Sure, you could take your kids to see The Emoji Movie, but should you? Its 3 percent Tomatometer score –- a truly impressive feat to achieve –- should tell you everything you need to know about it. Still, kids are kids, and they’ll probably be drawn to the colorful characters and their wacky antics. And of course, because one of the main characters is the Poop emoji (voiced by Patrick Stewart, of all people), there’s plenty of potty humor. Basically, the movie explores what it would be like if the emojis inside your smartphone were sentient beings with personalities -– albeit, one-note personalities dictated by the emotions they express. But ultimately, its message is the same trite one so many animated movies offer: Find your own voice and be true to yourself. Not a terrible concept, but not an especially novel one, either. At various points, the characters find themselves in the midst of danger and destruction. There’s a bit of kissing as well as a scene in a dive bar. Overall, it’s harmless for children -– but soul crushing for adults.An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power (2017)  80%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for thematic elements and some troubling images.Eleven years after the release of the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore is back, still fighting climate change with the same passion he’s shown for decades. This sequel has a bit less punch than its predecessor, and it’s so worshipful of the former vice president that it often plays like an infomercial. But the topic is unfortunately more relevant than ever -– especially with President Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord earlier this summer -– and Gore’s dedication is undeniable. As he travels on his worldwide lecture circuit, Gore shows dramatic videos revealing the increasing power of natural disasters because of the effects of global warming. Countless people find themselves homeless and in harm’s way. And Gore gets fired up as he addresses large crowds on the subject, his intensity often turning to anger. But both the sequel and the original could be useful teaching tools for young people, especially if they have an interest in science. Fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older –- if you can convince them that they won’t be bored.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Ghost in the Shell (2017)  43%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, suggestive content and some disturbing images.This movie truly earns its rating; I’d say it’s really only suitable for more mature kids who are 13 and older. Scarlett Johansson stars in a live-action version of the influential 1995 Japanese anime film about a futuristic society in which a young woman’s brain is placed in a synthetic body. Johansson’s Major is a trained killing machine, but she’s haunted by glimmers of memories of her human past, many of which are frightening. This is an extremely violent movie with punishing fight sequences, extended gun battles and major explosions. The world in which the characters live is dark and gloomy (despite bursts of high-tech color) and it’s full of danger. Much of the imagery is extremely creepy, such as the sight of a robot geisha being shot in the face. Also, there are many scenes in which it appears that Major is fighting while completely naked, but it’s actually just the way her flesh-colored “shell” was designed. And there’s a scene in a club with strippers, but we don’t see much.The Boss Baby (2017)  53%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some mild rude humor.Your own babies around 5 or 6 and older should be fine watching this animated comedy, even though it’s truly bizarre. A 7-year-old boy named Tim (voiced by Miles Christopher Bakshi) is living a perfectly happy, suburban life with his mom (Lisa Kudrow) and dad (Jimmy Kimmel). Then one day, a baby brother arrives –- and he’s wearing a suit, carrying a briefcase, tossing cash around and talking with the voice of Alec Baldwin. He’s an infant and a grown-up at the same time, and he’s here on a mission involving puppies and a rocket ship…? Anyway, it’s very confusing, but ultimately harmless. Tim has an active imagination, which leads to some wildly colorful fantasy sequences, but they’re more playful than scary. There are the obligatory diaper and potty jokes, and we see some naked baby butts. A trip to Las Vegas involves some slightly racy humor that kids won’t get. And a mad scientist holds Tim and the baby captive, briefly, but they ultimately save the day.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"versus, Nat, emmy, Calendar, book, stoner, wars, cults, Century, TV+, ITV, 4/20, news, Series, on","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/28111136/Emoji-PG.jpg","slug":"if-your-kids-insist-on-watching-the-emoji-movie-heres-what-you-should-know"},{"id":"47508906089313","title":"How Family-Friendly is A Dog’s Purpose?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is A Dog's Purpose?by Christy Lemire | January 27, 2017 |  CommentsThe only movie in wide release this week that your kids might want to see happens to be about adorable dogs dying over and over again… and it’s been marred by some bad press lately. Read on to see whether it might all be too much for younger viewers, and get Christy’s take on a couple of DVD releases.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;A Dog's Purpose (2017)  35%Rating: PG, for thematic elements and some peril.This movie is terrible, but it’s also terribly effective. There’s no way you won’t cry, multiple times, at the shamelessly heart-tugging sight of adorable dogs dying over and over again. Director Lasse Hallstrom’s film is supposed to be inspirational, though. It’s a hokey story about a dog named Bailey (voiced by a perky Josh Gad) whose spirit is repeatedly reincarnated over several decades. He finds himself inside a German shepherd police dog and a corgi who befriends a college student, among others. Yes, this is a concept that requires you to make giant leaps in faith. But the script is also full of melodramatic situations and barely-drawn characters. Younger viewers may not perceive all that, but they’ll probably find the sight of dogs in danger and dying rather disturbing. One version of Bailey gets shot and another is abandoned in the cold, dark night. There is eventual uplift, though, and the possibility of redemption. I brought my 7-year-old son with me to a screening and he didn’t find anything frightening. “I liked all of it,” he said. So there you go.NEW ON DVDInferno (2016)  23%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of action and violence, disturbing images, some language, thematic elements and brief sensuality.This is one of those instances in which PG-13 really does mean that viewers under 13 shouldn’t see it. Inferno is mostly silly, but it can be extremely scary and intense at times. The third film based on Dan Brown’s best-selling novels about symbols and sinister secrets isn’t much better than its predecessors – The Da Vinci Code&nbsp;and Angels &amp; Demons&nbsp;– but it is more disturbing in its imagery. Ron Howard once again directs Tom Hanks as Harvard professor Robert Langdon, whose mission this time is to stop a high-tech plague from killing billions of people worldwide. Along the way, he finds himself plagued by hellish visions of bodies burning and writhing in pain and surging rivers of blood. Several characters also get shot or stabbed to death in their pursuit of Langdon and his latest sidekick, a brilliant young doctor (Felicity Jones). There’s also a bit of language and a brief love scene.The Light Between Oceans (2016)  61%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material and some sexual content.Viewers around 13 and older will probably be fine watching this heavy-duty, emotionally cathartic romantic drama. It’s beautifully shot and strongly acted. Derek Cianfrance’s adaptation of the M.L. Stedman novel follows the tumultuous relationship between a stoic lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender) and his energetic, young wife (Alicia Vikander) living on a remote island off the coast of Western Australia just after World War I. While they are initially happy, their attempts at starting a family end in two miscarriages. But when an infant washes ashore in a small boat after a storm – along with her deceased father – the couple believes they’ve received one last shot at happiness. It isn’t that easy, though. The Light Between Oceans&nbsp;deals with the mature themes of birth and death, guilt and truth. Vikander’s character is understandably devastated both physically and psychologically after her loss, but she’s also the one to pressure her husband into lying and pretending the baby is theirs. There are a couple of brief sex scenes, although they feature barely any nudity. And toward the end, the baby – now a 5-year-old girl – goes missing and appears to be in danger.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Poppins, batman, Logo, Bros., Television, TV+, Pirates, Originals, sitcom, Paramount, superman, Dates, Britbox, 21st","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/27114638/Dogs-Purpose-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-a-dogs-purpose"},{"id":"47508903838534","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Dark Tower?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Dark Tower?by Christy Lemire | August 4, 2017 |  CommentsThere isn’t anything new in theaters this week that’s aimed squarely at kids, but on first glance, the Stephen King adaptation The Dark Tower may look a bit like a kid-friendly fantasy adventure… albeit an intense one. Christy tells you what you need to know about it if you plan on taking the family to see it, plus offers her assessment on a couple of newly released DVDs. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Dark Tower (2017)  16%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;thematic material including sequences of gun violence and action.The long-awaited big-screen version of the revered Stephen King series will be too much for young viewers, yet not enough for everyone else. It’s about portals and time travel and monsters and gun battles, but while the original mythology is dense, director Nikolaj Arcel’s adaptation of it feels truncated and rushed. Idris Elba stars as the legendary Gunslinger, who’s long been searching for the devilish Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) to keep him from destroying the Dark Tower, which stands in the middle of the universe to protect against evil forces. Only the psychically gifted Jake (Tom Taylor), a misfit Manhattan kid who’s had visions of such destruction, can save us all. While the visual effects often look muddled, the violence within them is unmistakable: vicious beasts that attack out of nowhere; fiery, hellish images of mass suffering; prolonged gun fights that result in many casualties. Children are abducted from around the world and placed in torturous devices to do The Man in Black’s bidding. Both Jake and the Gunslinger must deal with the deaths of people who are important to them. And McConaughey’s character also has psychic powers, which he usually uses to kill people. Overall, it’s not very good, but it is intense. OK for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Circle (2017)  15%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for a sexual situation, brief strong language and some thematic elements including drug use.Tweens and up should be fine watching this thriller about the evils of the internet – although by the time they see it, they’ll probably think it’s lame and outdated. This cautionary tale, based on Dave Eggers’ bestseller, covers much of the same ground as countless technological thrillers before it. The film from director James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now) is glossy but ultimately feels choppy. Emma Watson stars as a wide-eyed new employee at a shiny social media behemoth called The Circle. It’s sort of like an extreme version of Google, and it’s similarly situated smack in the middle of the Bay Area. Watson’s Mae is super excited to leave her small town and take an entry-level job there, and quickly succumbs to the corporate culture of sharing everything, all the time, as the company’s gregarious CEO (Tom Hanks) instructs. But when she agrees to take part in a live experiment that destroys all notions of personal privacy, bad things happen. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, including Hanks’ use of the one F-word you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. Mae accidentally broadcasts an embarrassing sexual situation involving her mother (Glenne Headly) and her father (Bill Paxton), who suffers from multiple sclerosis. A character dies. And there’s just general tension as Mae gets closer to the truth about the company’s intentions.Going in Style (2017)  47%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for&nbsp;drug content, language and some suggestive material.Viewers around 10 or 11 and older will be OK watching director Zach Braff’s remake of the 1979 comedy which starred George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg as elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank. This time, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin play elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank – but instead of doing it for kicks, as the characters did in the original, these guys do it out of revenge. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, as well as gunfire – some real, some blanks. Arkin’s character engages in some hot and heavy frolicking with Ann-Margret’s character, a pretty, flirty grocery store clerk. Part of the scheme involves a medical marijuana dealer, which leads to these old-timers getting high and having the munchies. And of course, at the center of all these antics is a massive, federal crime. Going in Style&nbsp;offers some decent laughs here and there, and the three stars are such pros and have such lovely chemistry with each other, they’re enjoyable to watch – even if the movie itself is forgettable.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pride, Plus, scene, TV, crossover, John","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/04132451/The-Dark-Tower-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-dark-tower"},{"id":"47508903885646","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Mummy?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Mummy?by Christy Lemire | June 9, 2017 |  CommentsThere’s a new Tom Cruise action movie out this week, and since this one is meant to kick off an entire franchise, it’s been sanitized just enough to earn a PG-13 rating. That said, there may still be some things in the film that might be too intense for your kids, and Christy has the scoop on that.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Mummy (2017)  16%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for violence, action and scary images, and for some suggestive content and partial nudity.Tom Cruise’s reboot of The Mummy&nbsp;is actually the beginning of a whole new Universal universe – a series of high-tech re-dos of classic monster movies. So you have that to look forward to for years to come. This time, Cruise stars as a highly trained soldier who secretly steals antiquities during missions alongside his wisecracking friend and partner (Jake Johnson). One day, he accidentally unearths an ancient tomb – and helps revive an evil Egyptian princess (Sofia Boutella) who’d been buried for centuries. There’s quite a bit of startling, gnarly imagery here, as well as sexually suggestive material. A flashback to the events that sealed the princess’ fate reveals that she murdered her family (which we don’t see, but the blood splatters suggest what she’s done). In the present day, she kills several people by draining the life from them with a kiss – but then they’re reborn as her ferocious, undead army. She causes quite a bit of chaos and destruction, including an intense plane crash and a massive sandstorm that engulfs London. She’s also barely clothed most of the time. And there are several fistfights, stabbings and explosions. In general, the enormous, noisy spectacle of director Alex Kurtzman’s film may be too much for younger viewers to handle. I’d say this is appropriate for kids around 10 or 11 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast (2017)  71%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for some action, violence, peril, and frightening images.Kids around 6 and up should be fine watching this elaborate, live-action retelling of the beloved 1991 animated Disney musical. In fact, they’ll probably adore it. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens star as the titular beauty and the beast. She’s a smart young woman who’s sick of being stuck in her provincial French town; he’s a surly, cursed prince who’s sick of being stuck in his massive castle. Could these two crazy kids possibly find love? Director Bill Condon’s film is visually dazzling, adding luxurious flair to all the big musical numbers you know and love (plus a few new tunes that aren’t quite so great). Children will delight in the household items coming to life and bursting into song – the clock, candelabra, teapot and cup, for example. But there are also dangers to be found in the woods leading up to the beast’s castle. It’s dark and full of ravenous wolves, which might be scary for the littlest viewers. Belle’s father (Kevin Kline) is in peril several times. The arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans) whips the villagers into a frenzy, leading them in a mob to kill the beast. And of course, because this is a Disney movie, there are dead parents. But for the most part, your kids will probably love this, and they’ll be singing the songs around the house for days afterward.A United Kingdom (2017)  84%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some language including racial epithets and a scene of sensuality.Tweens and older should be OK watching this inspiring tale of perseverance, loyalty and love. David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike star in this true story based on an interracial marriage that caused an international uproar. Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the former king of Botswana (then called Bechuanaland, and a British protectorate) who dared to marry Pike’s Ruth Williams, a white British woman, in 1947 London. He brought her home to Africa to make her the queen of his people, but neither of them could have predicted the massive repercussions such an intimate decision could have caused. This is a well-acted and well-made but restrained drama. The couple endures racial slurs as well as rejection from both of their families. Director Amma Asante also shows us the kind of segregation that was prevalent at the time, especially as apartheid was beginning to take hold in neighboring South Africa. There’s also a bit of language and the suggestion that the couple has sex on their wedding night.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Rey, VH1, target, Academy, of, obituary, Movies, Originals, tv, play","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/09103914/The-Mummy-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-mummy"},{"id":"47508903876428","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Transformers: The Last Knight?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Transformers: The Last Knight?by Christy Lemire | June 23, 2017 |  CommentsThere is only one franchise big enough, bad enough, and explodey enough to scare away all other wide releases, for fear of getting caught up in its black fumes and brotastic posturing. That franchise is, of course, the&nbsp;Transformers franchise, and if your kids succeed in suckering you to go see the latest installment, here’s what you should know about it, for their sake.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)  15%Rating: PG-13, for&nbsp;violence and intense sequences of sci-fi action, language, and some innuendo.No, you’re not losing your mind. There is indeed a fifth Transformers&nbsp;movie. Once again, the planet is in peril, and only Mark Wahlberg playing a guy named Cade Yeager can save it. Trying to explain the plot is pointless. Transformers: The Last Knight&nbsp;manages to be more incoherent than its predecessors. Plus, you probably don’t care. Suffice it to say, it’s about giant robots smashing into each other. It’s also about their alien planet, Cybertron, potentially smashing into Earth to drain it of all its energy. Michael Bay’s film is, as always, a massive, cacophonous spectacle. There’s a ton of violence here, beginning with a battle set during the time of King Arthur. In the present day, the robot combat causes a ton of destruction, as always — and explosions.&nbsp;&nbsp;So many explosions. There’s quite a bit of language throughout as various characters insult each other and freak out about the possibility of the world ending. And there’s some mildly racy humor as Wahlberg’s character exchanges allegedly snappy banter with a brilliant and suggestively dressed professor (Laura Haddock), but kids probably won’t get it. I took my 7 ½-year-old son to an IMAX 3-D screening and he was fine, but kids who feel uncomfortable during sensory-overload movies like this might have difficulty watching it. And at well over two hours, the new Transformers will probably be a tough sit for many young viewers. Fine for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"21st, The, Christmas, Mudbound, Election, Women's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/23102933/Transformers-Last-Knight-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-transformers-the-last-knight"},{"id":"47508906079070","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Great Wall?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Great Wall?by Christy Lemire | February 17, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is Zhang Yimou’s epic period action film starring Matt Damon, and it’s exactly the kind of “good guys vs. monsters” PG-13 spectacle intended to draw wide-eyed younger audiences. That said, how young is too young to see the movie? Read on for details on The Great Wall, plus a Best Picture-nominated sci-fi mystery on DVD.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Great Wall (2017)  35%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of fantasy action violence.So apparently, the Great Wall of China was built all those centuries ago… to keep out ravenous hordes of marauding monsters? Such is the alternative history this 3-D action epic offers. The Great Wall&nbsp;is the most expensive movie ever made entirely in China (with a reported budget around $150 million), and it shows. Chinese master Zhang Yimou’s first English-language film is massive, with elaborate production design, an enormous cast and high-tech special effects. At the center of it all is Matt Damon as an Irish mercenary who learns to be a part of something larger than himself when he joins an elite force of Chinese warriors to fend off these hideous creatures. And here’s where The Great Wall&nbsp;will be way too intense for younger kids. The monsters look like a speedier, angrier version of the “Jurassic Park” dinosaurs, with gnashing teeth reminiscent of the “Alien” franchise. Zhang shows them to us at a distance, moving as an organized pack, but also up close and personal as they rip individual soldiers to shreds. He creates sweeping battle scenes, full of swords, arrows and explosives. Even though it’s all computer-generated imagery, it’s scary and gory. I’d say kids around 11 or 12 and older will be OK here.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Arrival (2016)  94%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Older kids – especially those with a taste for science fiction – will find this slow-burn drama compelling. But they might be a little confused by the movie’s time-hopping narrative structure; then again, you might be, too. Nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director for Denis Villeneuve, Arrival&nbsp;is an inventive take on the alien-invasion thriller. Amy Adams plays a linguist trying to understand the aliens’ intricate language; Jeremy Renner plays the biologist hoping to study their complex makeup. The images are beautiful and haunting at the same time, with a mix of mystery and wonder. There’s a bit of language and a few intense situations. And part of the film’s drama comes from the death of a little girl who’d been suffering from a disease. But for the most part, Arrival&nbsp;defies your expectations of this ordinarily panicky, heart-pounding genre. It’s beautifully shot and ultimately, surprisingly, hopeful.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"hollywood, stand-up, drama, and, indie, Interview, The, marvel, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/17114556/Great-Wall-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-great-wall"},{"id":"47508904976219","title":"How Family-Friendly is Kong: Skull Island?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Kong: Skull Island?by Christy Lemire | March 10, 2017 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is a giant monster throwback featuring a certain great ape, but is he too fearsome for little kids? Christy offers parents a rundown of what they should look out for in the blockbuster, then talks about Disney’s latest triumph, Moana.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island (2017)  75%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language.If you like your monster movies big and dumb, you will love Kong: Skull Island. And I mean that as a total compliment. This action epic from director Jordan Vogt-Roberts has the spirit of a classic Ray Harryhausen film with the benefit of high-tech special effects. A team of explorers visits an uncharted island in the South Pacific in 1973 and finds more danger than they ever could have imagined. They include an expert tracker (Tom Hiddleston), a war photographer (Brie Larson), the head of a shadowy government agency (John Goodman), and a military team with a no-nonsense leader (Samuel L. Jackson). But you’re not here for the people. You’re here to see King Kong, who rules the island as a fearsome, deadly, but ultimately gentle giant. This is not a spoiler: If you’ve ever seen any incarnation of King Kong, you know he’s misunderstood. But he might be super-scary for very little kids, especially as he battles the many other oversized monsters that happen to call this island home. (What’s in the water surrounding this place anyway?) I brought my 7-year-old son and he thought Kong&nbsp;was a blast. It is pretty intense, though, with a lot of violence, gunfire, monster action and helicopter destruction, and not everyone makes it out alive. There’s also quite a bit of language, including the one F-bomb you get in a PG-13 movie, courtesy of John C. Reilly. I’d say this is OK for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Moana (2016)  95%Rating: PG, for peril, some scary images and brief thematic elements.If, for some reason, your kids haven’t already seen Moana, now is the perfect time to show it to them. It’s a great choice for the whole family — a two-time Academy Award nominee for best animated film and best original song for the girl-power anthem “How Far I’ll Go.” The latest musical extravaganza from Walt Disney Animation Studios features newcomer Auli’I Cravalho as the title character, a Polynesian teen who’s next in line to lead her tribe. But she has dreams of leaving the island and traveling the high seas, despite her parents’ wishes for her to stay put. She teams up with the demigod Maui (Dwayne Johnson) to return a magical stone to its rightful place, but the two run into a series of obstacles and enemies along the way. Most of Moana is upbeat and delightful. Even some of the villains are downright adorable, including an armada of pirate coconuts with mean, painted faces. But the ultimate enemy is a giant lava monster that rages and hurls fire balls at anyone who comes near. It’s dark and hulking and may be too scary for the littlest viewers. Moana also must deal with the death of a beloved relative, but it’s handled gracefully. But there’s so much here that’s worthwhile for boys and girls alike. Moana&nbsp;is about a strong, curvy girl who’s assertive and independent but also kind and loyal. She puts herself in danger for the well being of her people and, in the process, finds her voice and the confidence to serve as a leader.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Network, movies, transformers, OWN, Exclusive, Mindy, war, composers, dogs, Academy, street, 21st, Elton","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/10110223/Kong-Skull-Island-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-kong-skull-island"},{"id":"47508906086239","title":"How Family-Friendly are The LEGO Batman Movie and A United Kingdom?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are The LEGO Batman Movie and A United Kingdom?by Christy Lemire | February 10, 2017 |  CommentsJohn Wick: Chapter 2 and Fifty Shades Darker are obviously not for children, while The LEGO Batman Movie most certainly is. With that in mind Christy lets us know what we can expect from the latter, as well as the based-on-true-events drama A United Kingdom and a handful of new DVD releases.&nbsp;Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Lego Batman Movie (2017)  90%Rating: PG, for rude humor and some action.Everything is awesome, again, but now Batman is front and center for this high-energy, self-referential animated extravaganza. This spin-off of 2014’s The Lego Movie&nbsp;finds Batman (voiced once again with wonderfully gravelly arrogance by Will Arnett) fighting to remain relevant as Gotham’s hero. He’s also struggling with an existential crisis, as the arrival of sidekick Robin (Michael Cera) forces him to accept the possibility that he might actually need a family. The humor is rapid-fire but never mean, and while there’s violence and destruction throughout, it’s silly and playful. This is a movie in which characters make “pew pew pew” noises while they’re firing at each other with plastic guns. Many villains show up from both comic books and other pop-culture realms, but they’re depicted in such a goofy way that they’re never scary. And ultimately, the themes of allowing people into your life to help you and creating your own sense of family are worthwhile. Fine for all ages.A United Kingdom (2017)  84%Rating: PG-13, for some language including racial epithets and a scene of sensuality.David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike star in this true story based on an interracial marriage that caused an international uproar.

There’s a bit of language and the suggestion that the couple has sex on their wedding night. But it’s also an inspiring story of perseverance, loyalty and love. I’d say this is fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Loving (2016)  88%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements.Ruth Negga deservedly earned an Academy Award nomination for best actress for her elegant, nuanced work in this inspiring drama. She and Joel Edgerton star in writer-director Jeff Nichols’ film, which is based on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving. They were an interracial couple at a time and place – 1958 Virginia – where such a union was unusual. He was white, she was black, and they had a baby on way. While the two married legally in Washington DC, they found themselves persecuted back home in rural Virginia, where the practice was still against the law. Their fight to keep their family together, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, changed the laws regarding interracial marriage nationwide. Along the way, though, they were forced from their home, jailed and separated. This is a quietly intense movie with some disturbing language and dialogue, as well as a scene of a child getting hit by a car. But it’s beautifully written, shot and acted, making it appropriate – and recommended – for viewers around 12 and older.Trolls (2016)  75%Rating: PG, for some mild rude humor.There’s a Troll that poops cupcakes and another who farts glitter – but even that’s kind of cute. Otherwise, this candy-colored animated musical is totally fine for all ages. The Trolls sing and dance and hug, then sing and dance and hug some more. They’re a clan full of cuddly critters who enjoy expressing their constant happiness through song. If you’re a parent, you may find this incessant cheeriness super annoying. Kids will love it, though, whether or not they’ve ever heard of the high-haired Troll dolls that inspired the movie. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake lead an all-star voice cast in this adventure in which the Trolls try to avoid being captured and devoured by a group of grumpy ogres known as the Bergens. You see, the Bergens believe if they eat a Troll, they won’t be so miserable anymore. It’s basically a parable about the importance of finding the happiness that lies within us all – which is kind of a simplistic message, but not a terrible one for kids to hear. The Trolls are frequently in danger, and while the Bergens are grotesque, they’re never truly frightening.&nbsp;Almost Christmas (2016)  49%Rating: PG-13, for suggestive material, drug content and language.It’s almost Valentine’s Day, but if this Christmas comedy cries out to you instead, it’ll probably be fine for the kids in your house who are around 10 and older. This is your annual wacky, dysfunctional-family holiday movie. Danny Glover, Mo’Nique, Gabrielle Union, Romany Malco, Kimberly Elise, and JB Smoove are among the large ensemble cast, playing members of a family gathering for their first Christmas after the death of their beloved matriarch. Long-held resentments explode and madcap hilarity ensues. Director David E. Talbert’s film is actually better written and acted than most films of this sentimental genre, though. There’s quite a bit of language – most of which comes from the hilariously brash Mo’Nique — and some grown-up situations involving infidelity and drug abuse. But ultimately, its themes of forgiveness and reconciliation are worthwhile.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"OneApp, Ellie, The, Pictures, Tarantino","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/10114629/Lego-Batman-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-the-lego-batman-movie-and-a-united-kingdom"},{"id":"47508904975194","title":"How Family-Friendly is Beauty and the Beast?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Beauty and the Beast?by Christy Lemire | March 17, 2017 |  CommentsThis week, Disney is releasing a live-action remake of its beloved animated musical&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast — you’ve probably heard about this — and Christy lets us know whether the more realistic trappings make the film too intense for younger viewers who might have been fine with the original. Read on for the details, as well as Christy’s take on a couple of new rentals.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast (2017)  71%Rating: PG, for some action, violence, peril, and frightening images.The tale as old as time gets a high-tech, live-action retelling while staying mostly true to the beloved 1991 animated musical. Emma Watson and Dan Stevens star as the titular beauty and the beast. She’s a smart young woman who’s sick of being stuck in her provincial French town; he’s a surly, cursed prince who’s sick of being stuck in his massive castle. Could these two crazy kids possibly find love? Director Bill Condon’s film is visually dazzling, adding luxurious flair to all the big musical numbers you know and love (plus a few new ones that aren’t quite so great). Kids will delight in the household items coming to life and bursting into song – the clock, candelabra, teapot, and cup, for example. But there are also dangers to be found in the woods leading up to the beast’s castle. It’s dark and full of ravenous wolves, which might be scary for very little kids. Belle’s father (Kevin Kline) is in peril several times. The arrogant Gaston (Luke Evans) whips the villagers into a frenzy, leading them in a mob to kill the east. And of course, because this is a Disney movie, there are dead parents. But for the most part, your kids will probably love this, and they’ll leave the theater singing. Fine for kids around 6 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Passengers (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sexuality, nudity, and action/peril.Critics mostly savaged this sci-fi romance when it came out last year, and I’m not entirely sure why. It works, for a while at least. And it would probably be OK for your kids if they’re around 10 and older. I brought my 7-year-old son with me when it screened, and some of it was probably too grown-up for him. “It was kind of boring,” he said. And there are some long, quiet stretches of loneliness. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star as the only two people awake aboard a spaceship headed for a colony on a distant planet. Thousands of other passengers are still in a 120-year state of hibernation. How will they survive? It’s a cool concept with some twists — and some problematic ethics. Director Morten Tyldum’s film is glossy and clever as it depicts life on the ship. It has some amusing elements, mainly courtesy of Michael Sheen as an android bartender. But it turns screechy and silly in the third act when it morphs into an over-the-top sci-fi thriller. There’s some language scattered throughout, as well as the suggestion that Pratt and Lawrence’s characters have sex. We see them lead up to the act, featuring some nudity from behind, as well as the requisite basking in the afterglow. We also see Pratt naked from behind, both in the shower and wandering around the ship. And the two characters find themselves in major peril at the film’s fiery climax.Collateral Beauty (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.This was one of the stranger movies to come out last year – and one of the biggest misfires. Still, it’s sort of worth seeing, just to gawk at how spectacularly wrong it all goes. Collateral Beauty may look like a feel-good, life-affirming drama, but it’s actually much more complicated than that. Will Smith stars as a former hotshot ad executive who’s now reeling from a major family tragedy. His business partners – played by Kate Winslet, Edward Norton, and Michael Pena – scheme to make him look crazy so they can sell the agency, which is floundering in his absence. Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, and Helen Mirren play the struggling actors who manipulate him by portraying the notions of Love, Time, and Death, respectively. Along the way, all the characters learn to deal with their own problems. What are the odds? Director David Frankel’s film deals with some very mature themes of loss and grief. There’s also quite a bit of language throughout, including the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. But this film is just so bizarre and hard to follow, your kids will probably be thoroughly confused. Then again, so will you.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, Series, social","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/16175603/Beauty-Beast-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-beauty-and-the-beast"},{"id":"47508904969047","title":"How Family-Friendly are Going in Style and Smurfs: The Lost Village?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Going in Style and Smurfs: The Lost Village?by Christy Lemire | April 7, 2017 |  CommentsThis week, Zach Braff’s remake of Going in Style opens side-by-side with the latest&nbsp;Smurfs movie&nbsp;— and clearly, your 6-year-old is going to be more interested in a heist movie starring a trio of octogenarians than an animated feature about friendly Belgian gremlins. With that in mind, Christy Lemire offers a parent’s perspective on both of them, along with a new movie on DVD you should probably avoid, but isn’t terribly offensive for your kids if you happen to have horrible taste in movies and decide to watch it anyway.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Going in Style (2017)  47%Rating: PG-13, for drug content, language and some suggestive material.Director Zach Braff has remade the 1979 comedy of the same name starring George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg as elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank. This time, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Alan Arkin play elderly, lifelong friends who rob a bank – but instead of doing it for kicks, as was the case in the original, they do it out of revenge. There’s quite a bit of language throughout, as well as gunfire – some real, some blanks. Arkin’s character engages in some hot and heavy frolicking with Ann-Margret’s character, a pretty, flirty grocery store clerk. Part of the scheme involves a medical marijuana dealer, which leads to these old-timers getting high and having the munchies. And of course, at the center of all these antics is a massive, federal crime. Going in Style&nbsp;offers some decent laughs here and there, and the three stars are such pros and have such lovely chemistry with each other, they’re enjoyable to watch – even if the movie itself is forgettable. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 10 or 11 and older.Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017)  40%Rating: PG, for some mild action and rude humor.The Smurfs are back, this time in an all-new animated adventure. Smurfette (voiced by Demi Lovato) wonders what her purpose is in life while every other Smurf’s abilities are clear from their names alone: Brainy, Hefty, Jokey, etc. When she and her friends learn there’s another whole village of Smurfs, they set off to find them – and to warn them that Gargamel (Rainn Wilson) is after them to drain them of their power. This is a vibrant and lively film with a valuable central message about female identity and empowerment. It’s also about strong women supporting each other, as Smurfette finds and connects with a tribe of female Smurfs (voiced by Julia Roberts, Ellie Kemper and Michelle Rodriguez, among others). The humor is mostly light and playful and often extremely slapsticky. Kids will enjoy the cute and clever creatures. Gargamel flies into full-on, villainous rampages a couple of times, accompanied by dramatic music and lighting, which might seem slightly scary for extremely young kids. But mostly he’s a buffoon whose bumbling schemes are played for laughs. This is better than it looks (and the Tomatometer might suggest). If you’re looking for a movie the whole family can watch, this will be fine.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Book Of Love (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content, language and drug material.Viewers around 12 or 13 and older will be OK watching this ridiculous and contrived comedy, but surely there must be something better out there for you all to rent. Jason Sudeikis stars as an uptight architect who works through the loss of his pregnant wife (Jessica Biel) in a car accident by befriending an orphaned teen and helping her build a raft to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Biel appears mostly in flashbacks as a quirky, colorful figure, while Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones is the feisty ragamuffin who helps him grieve, or see the good in the world again, or something. Director and co-writer Bill Purple deals with some heavy themes with his first feature: death and remorse, abuse and abject poverty. We see the crash that kills Biel’s character from a couple different angles; later, we see Williams’ character receiving cruel treatment from the uncle who’s grudgingly agreed to be her guardian. There’s also a lot of language and a couple of scenes in which Sudeikis’ character either smokes or eats marijuana in a stew. Who knew you could do that?","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"stop, Paramount, universal, romantic, cops, Walt, Academy, Purge, TV, Martial, Hulu, Disney, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/07103005/Smurfs-Going-In-Style-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-going-in-style-and-smurfs-the-lost-village"},{"id":"47508904973145","title":"How Family-Friendly is Power Rangers?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Power Rangers?by Christy Lemire | March 24, 2017 |  CommentsYou may have fond memories of watching the various Power Rangers shows growing up, but now that they’re on the big screen in a brand new adaptation for modern audiences, the new Power Rangers may not be entirely suitable for kids. Read on for Christy’s take on the new action flick, as well as a couple of rentals.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Saban's Power Rangers (2017)  50%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, language, and for some crude humor.Yes, there is yet another incarnation of the Power Rangers saga. This time, it’s a live-action movie, as opposed to the cheesy TV cartoons you may have grown up watching in the early 1990s. It’s essentially a superhero version of The Breakfast Club, with five disparate high school students finding colorful crystal coins in an abandoned mine that give them unexpected powers. But they also find themselves in the middle of a battle for the planet that’s millions of years old. In the process, the fictional small town of Angel Grove gets decimated. There’s quite a bit of big, noisy violence here, as well as some more intimate, hand-to-hand combat sequences with monsters that look like a bunch of boulders stacked on top of each other. There’s also language throughout, some suggestive humor off the top involving a cow’s bodily fluids, and a police chase and car crash. And the villain, former Power Ranger Rita Repulsa (a campy Elizabeth Banks), may seem scary to little kids, particularly at the beginning of the film when she looks especially witch-like and hasn’t regained her full power and splendor. That’s the only thing that my 7-year-old son found disturbing: an especially violent scene in an alley at night involving Rita and a hobo who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it’s brief. This is probably fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Assassin's Creed (2016)  18%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, thematic elements and brief strong language.Kids around 13 and older should be fine watching this, but I wouldn’t show it to anyone much younger. It’s yet another movie based on a video game – and once again, it doesn’t get that transition right, despite heftier production values and a more pedigreed cast than usual. Michael Fassbender stars as Cal, who’s being executed for murder in the present day at the film’s start. But then he wakes up and he finds he’s in a lab where he’ll have to tap into his genetic ability to live someone else’s memories – specifically, those of his ancestor, who was part of a secret society known as the Assassins. His mission: Travel back to Spain 500 years ago. His goal: Find the elusive Apple of Eden, an artifact that has something to do with controlling free will. Or something. Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Brendan Gleeson, and Charlotte Rampling co-star. Why any of these esteemed actors said yes to this is truly mind-boggling. The film from Justin Kurzel, who also directed Fassbender in 2015’s Macbeth, has a similarly gritty, gloomy aesthetic – and it’s just relentlessly violent. As I often say, it’s right there on the edge of what you can get away with in a PG-13 movie. Assassin’s Creed&nbsp;features copious killings and stabbings as well as a ton of brutal, hand-to-hand combat. It is very bloody. There’s also a frightening sci-fi element as Cal mentally goes back in time. Younger viewers will find the plot super baffling; then again, so will most adults.Sing (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for some rude humor and mild peril.Viewers of all ages will enjoy the latest animated comedy from Illumination Entertainment, the folks behind the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and The Secret Life of Pets. And as in Illumination’s previous movies, there’s nothing even slightly scary or inappropriate here. Once again, an array of colorful creatures enjoys adventures in the big city. Matthew McConaughey provides the voice of a koala who owns a historic theater that’s in danger of closing. He gets the idea to stage a singing competition to drum up interest – think of it as Animal Idol – with performers including a harried, housewife pig (Reese Witherspoon), a reluctant criminal gorilla (Taron Egerton), a crooning mouse (Seth MacFarlane) and a punk-rock porcupine (Scarlett Johansson). The animals find themselves in danger, briefly, when a glass case filled with water (and squid) explodes, flooding the dilapidated theater and causing it to crumble. And the gorilla is part of a bank-robbing gang, but we never see the actual crimes. Mostly, Sing&nbsp;is about being true to yourself and finding your voice – literally. And ultimately, it’s about teaming up with a diverse group of folks for a good cause.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"cinemax, 78th, Central, 2015, casting, Classic, Sundance, Funimation, dark, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/24113552/Power-Rangers-PG1.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-power-rangers"},{"id":"47508904966997","title":"How Family-Friendly Is Born in China?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is Born in China?by Christy Lemire | April 21, 2017 |  CommentsWe’ve already talked about The Lost City of Z, which opened in limited release this week, and the only big movie this week clearly intended for children is the latest Earth Day documentary from Disneynature. It’s completely suitable for all audiences, but if you’re concerned about anything, you can check for Christy’s reaction below.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Disneynature: Born In China (2017)  85%Rating:&nbsp;GEvery year around Earth Day, Disneynature releases a documentary about animals in the wilderness: African Cats, Bears, Monkey Kingdom, etc. This year’s offering focuses on several animal species throughout China as they’re born, grow up within their families, and learn to survive. John Krasinski narrates the adventures of a baby panda, a golden monkey, and a mother snow leopard protecting her cubs. It’s shot spectacularly, as is always the case with these films. We see beautifully intimate images of these families in their remote, natural habitats, as well as breathtaking views of varied terrain across the nation. More than ever in the series, though, Born in China&nbsp;seems geared specifically toward young children. The baby animals all get cute names and funny backstories, and Krasinski punctuates their antics with playful asides. There’s very little danger or violence here. Threatening predators pop up and quickly disappear, and there are a couple instances of animals fighting each other, but they’re brief. I’d say this is suitable for the whole family.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Founder (2017)  81%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Your kids may enjoy eating at McDonald’s, and they may see the poster for this movie with its familiar golden arches and think it looks like something they’d want to sink their teeth into. It’s not. The Founder&nbsp;is the story of Ray Kroc (a charismatic Michael Keaton), long credited as the founder of the McDonald’s global fast-food empire. But director John Lee Hancock’s film details the ways in which Kroc wrangled the business away from brothers Mac and Dick McDonald (John Carroll Lynch and Nick Offerman), who originally launched the chain from a tiny Southern California burger stand. There’s quite a bit of language and arguing throughout the film, as well as an extramarital affair. The subject matter will probably seem boring to young viewers, but pre-teens might connect with the energy of the movie and its tale of ingenuity. If you’re interested in watching this at home, and you have kids around 11 or 12 and older who are watching it, too, they’ll probably be fine.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"DC, history, comic, space, italian, Grammys, Awards, spider-man, Television, parents","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/21132607/Born-in-China-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-born-in-china"},{"id":"47508904977244","title":"Don’t Be Fooled – Logan Isn’t for Kids","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Don't Be Fooled - Logan Isn't for Kidsby Christy Lemire | March 3, 2017 |  CommentsKids who may be familiar with the mostly innocuous X-Men movies up to this point may tug on your sleeve to take them to see&nbsp;Logan. Unfortunately for them, it might just be more than they can handle.&nbsp;Read on for details on Hugh Jackman’s last outing as Wolverine, as well as a YA novel adaptation and a faith-based weepie.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Logan (2017)  93%Rating: R, for strong brutal violence and language throughout, and for brief nudity.Your kids probably really want to see Logan, and who can blame them? It looks awesome, and it is awesome. But it’s also awesomely violent. They really luxuriate in their R-rating here, allowing Hugh Jackman’s title character to make the most of the damage he can do with those Adamantium claws. You would not believe the wide variety of body parts they can pierce in the blink of an eye. This is Jackman’s final outing as the iconic X-Men character, and while director James Mangold’s film is tinged with a gritty melancholy, it’s also repeatedly, explosively thrilling. An ailing Logan wants to leave the drama of his life as Wolverine behind, but he gets dragged back into action when he’s asked to care for a little girl (Dafne Keen) with whom he’s got a surprising amount in common. Young viewers may ask if they can see this, especially if they’re comic book fans or if they’ve seen previous X-Men&nbsp;movies. Say: “No.” This takes the blood and gore to a whole new level. Teenagers can handle this, but it’s not appropriate for anyone younger.Before I Fall (2017)  64%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic content involving drinking, sexuality, bullying, some violent images, and language — all involving teens.It’s Groundhog Day meets Heathers&nbsp;in this angsty but well-acted high school drama. Zoey Deutch stars as a popular high school senior who wakes up the morning after a raging party to find she’s living the previous day all over again. Then it happens the next morning, and the next. And it keeps happening, over and over, regardless of the slight tweaks she makes to jar herself loose from this time loop. In the process, she learns to see her mean-girl friends more clearly and treasure what’s truly important in life. Director Ry Russo-Young’s film features a ton of language and frank talk about sex. Teens also get super drunk at the party Deutch’s character and her friends attend, and they bully an awkward girl who shows up uninvited. And there’s a major car accident that serves as an important plot point, which we see again and again from various perspectives. Probably fine for viewers around 13 and older.The Shack (2017)  21%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material including some violence.This weepy religious film is based on a New York Times best seller about a father (Sam Worthington) who goes on a spiritual journey following the tragic loss of his young daughter (Amelie Eve). The little girl is kidnapped and killed during a family camping trip, leaving him bereft and faithless and eroding his relationships with his wife (Radha Mitchell) and two other kids (Megan Charpentier and Gage Munroe). Then one day, a mysterious note in his mailbox leads him back to the scene of the crime – and to an idyllic shack in the woods where he meets God (Octavia Spencer), Jesus (Aviv Alush) and the Holy Spirit (Sumire Matsubara). Thematically alone, this is too much for young viewers to handle. We see visions of the young girl being carried away, and we witness the father’s pain and remorse. There’s also a scene in which another kid nearly drowns and requires CPR. It’s pretty grown-up stuff. And at over two hours, the running time alone will make this a tough sit for kids. I’d say it’s appropriate for viewers around 11 or 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Doctor Strange (2016)  89%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi violence and action throughout, and an intense crash sequence.Kids around 8 or 10 and older will love this movie, especially if they’re familiar with the Marvel franchise – but they don’t have to be to have a good time. The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe centers on Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a once-brilliant surgeon who suffers a serious car accident and reinvents himself through mysticism and magic. Under the tutelage of the powerful Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Doctor Strange becomes a warrior in a battle between good and evil that takes place across various dimensions. It’s as trippy as it sounds, with some seriously psychedelic imagery. But Doctor Strange also features the sort of pummeling hand-to-hand combat, weapons play, and urban destruction you’ve come to expect in these effects-laden comic-book blockbusters. The crash that injures Doctor Strange is pretty gnarly. There’s some language but also a cheeky sense of humor throughout. And the ultimate, evil force Strange must face might look too frightening for younger viewers. It’s intense but also a lot of fun.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"See, Awards, drama, Crackle, Larson, A&E, deadpool, series, independent, Teen, Women's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/03113743/Logan-PG.jpg","slug":"dont-be-fooled-logan-isnt-for-kids"},{"id":"47508906097509","title":"How Family-Friendly are Assassin’s Creed, Passengers, Sing, and A Monster Calls?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Assassin's Creed, Passengers, Sing, and A Monster Calls?by Christy Lemire | December 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, we get another animated film aimed squarely at the kid demographic, but there are also a couple of other big movies — including one based on a popular video game series and one starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence — that might interest younger viewers. Read on to see how closely they skirt the edge of that R rating.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Assassin's Creed (2016)  18%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, thematic elements and brief strong language.Hey, guess what? There’s another movie based on a video game – and this one doesn’t get that transition right, either, despite heftier production values and a more pedigreed cast than its predecessors.

There’s also a frightening sci-fi element as Cal mentally goes back in time. Younger viewers will find the plot super baffling; then again, so will most adults. I’ve never played the game so I have no idea whether this movie is an accurate reflection of what it’s about. Simply as a movie, though, I’d say it’s really only appropriate for viewers 13 and older.Passengers (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sexuality, nudity and action/peril.Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star as the only two people awake aboard a spaceship headed for a colony on a distant planet. Thousands of other passengers are still in a 120-year state of hibernation. How will they survive? It’s a cool concept with some twists — and some problematic ethics. Director Morten Tyldum’s film is glossy and clever as it depicts life on the ship. It has some amusing elements, mainly courtesy of Michael Sheen as an android bartender. But it turns screechy and silly in the third act when it evolves into an over-the-top sci-fi thriller.

We also see Pratt naked from behind, both in the shower and wandering around the ship. And the two characters find themselves in major peril at the film’s fiery climax. I brought my son, who’s 7, with me; in retrospect, some of it was too grown-up for him. As for his thoughts on the movie: “It was kind of boring,” he said. And it’s true, there are some long, quiet stretches of loneliness. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 10 and older.Sing (2016)  72%Rating: PG, for some rude humor and mild peril.The latest animated comedy from Illumination Entertainment, the people behind the Despicable Me&nbsp;movies and The Secret Life of Pets, once again finds colorful creatures enjoying adventures in the big city.

And ultimately, it’s about teaming up with a diverse array of folks for a cause. A fun choice for the whole family over the holiday weekend.A Monster Calls (2017)  86%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content and some scary images.Bring tissues. Spanish director J.A. Bayona’s imaginative fantasy film is daringly beautiful and achingly sad. Felicity Jones stars as the divorced mom of a lonely, 12-year-old son (Lewis MacDougall). She’s dying of cancer, and the boy channels his fear through his wild drawings of fantastical creatures. One night, the tree behind his house uproots itself and comes to life, with Liam Neeson richly providing the voice of this monster. The stories he tells the boy are wondrous, with an inspired mix of animation styles. And the tree itself is vividly detailed and tactile – but he’ll also be quite scary for very young viewers. He means well and he can be cheeky, but he’s also intimidating. And A Monster Calls deals quite plainly with the prospect of a parent’s death. The mom’s illness reaches such a severe state that she has to be hospitalized, forcing the boy to live with his stern grandmother (Sigourney Weaver). But the movie also is about forgiveness and growing up, as well as the healing power of creativity. Probably fine for viewers around 8 and older. Adults will be a mess regardless of age.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Storks (2016)  65%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for mild action and some thematic elements.The whole family can enjoy this animated comedy, although watching it together could lead to some awkward conversations about where babies come from. That had to happen at some point, though, right? The idea is that storks don’t deliver babies anymore; now, they deliver packages for an Amazon-like behemoth called Cornerstore.com. But when the baby-making section of the factory accidentally starts up again, it’s up to a stork named Junior (voiced by Andy Samberg) and a clumsy human named Tulip (Katie Crown) to deliver the infant before their blowhard of a boss (Kelsey Grammer) finds out she exists. Storks&nbsp;is zippy and zany but it also has some unexpected heart. Much of that comes from the relationship between the lonely boy who wished for a little brother, which started this whole madcap sequence of events, and the parents (Ty Burrell and Jennifer Aniston) who are too busy with their real-estate business to spend time with him. Kids will love the colorful aesthetic and the fast-paced energy. There are also a couple of running bits that are truly absurd and insane, which they’ll probably find extremely entertaining.Sully (2016)  85%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for some peril and brief, strong language.Viewers around 9 or 10 and older should be fine watching the latest from Clint Eastwood, based on the true story of the Miracle on the Hudson. Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the veteran pilot who famously landed a US Airways plane in the middle of the Hudson River when both engines cut out after takeoff, saving all 155 people on board. Eastwood’s direction is lean and efficient and he creates a surprising amount of tension given that he’s telling a recent story with an ending we all know. The emergency landing itself is as stressful as you’d expect, with people on board sobbing and saying goodbye to each other and their loved ones as they fear they’re about to die. Once the plane lands safely, several passengers are in danger of drowning in the frigid river. There’s also some language scattered throughout. But the movie itself is brisk and well made, and a worthwhile story of heroism, teamwork and perseverance.The Magnificent Seven (2016)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for extended and intense sequences of Western violence, and for historical smoking, some language and suggestive material.Kids around 13 and older should be fine watching this remake of the 1960 John Sturges Western The Magnificent Seven&nbsp;– itself a remake of the 1954 Akira Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai– although I’d show them either of those original films first. Once again, a ragtag band of men comes together to protect a small town from invading bad guys. The setting this time is Northern California, and the main villain is a robber baron (Peter Sarsgaard) searching for gold. Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, and Byung-hun Lee play some of the tough guys and gunslingers who’ve signed on to stop him and his men. Director Antoine Fuqua’s film has a modern quality in its multicultural cast, but it mostly stays true to Western conventions. Expect prolonged scenes of intense violence, with shootouts, stabbings and battles on horseback. The carnage comes early and often, including an opening sequence in which Sarsgaard’s character coldly kills several townspeople to assert his dominance. There’s a bit of language and a ton of smoking.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"your, Hulu, sitcom, Warner, Holiday, comic, Superheroe, Reviews, Peek, nightmare, Access, adaptation, Christmas, of","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/22114243/Assassins-Creed-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-assassins-creed-passengers-sing-and-a-monster-calls"},{"id":"47508907590510","title":"10 Family-Friendly Movies to Watch for Halloween","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Family-Friendly Movies to Watch for HalloweenSome spooky Samhain selections to share with your spawn.by Christy Lemire | October 26, 2016 |  CommentsHalloween is coming. Perhaps you were aware of that. What better way to celebrate the holiday than with some family-friendly horror movies? Take a break from stressing out over costumes and shopping for candy with any of these great choices. Or you could just watch all eight Harry Potter movies, in order, all over again. Enjoy!&nbsp;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)  89%My husband and I took our son, Nicolas, to see this at the New Beverly Cinema, the Los Angeles repertory theater Quentin Tarantino owns, when he was a little over 6 years old. He laughed the whole way through – and he especially enjoyed the Invisible Man, voiced by Vincent Price. Abbott and Costello’s classic brand of slapstick comedy is perfect for kids, and the clever integration of Universal’s iconic movie monsters into their zany world will amuse grown-ups, as well.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Beetlejuice (1988)  85%This entire list could consist of nothing but Tim Burton movies, in theory – at least, his earlier ones. But I’m limiting myself to just a handful, and this one’s a must. Beetlejuice finds Burton in his sweet spot with a mix that’s weird and whimsical, giddy and ghoulish. The macabre details, the off-kilter humor, the Danny Elfman score: They all blend brilliantly to create one of Burton’s absolute best works. And Michael Keaton is in peak form as the title character: a fast-talking, flatulent spirit who’s been hired to scare a family of yuppies out of their new house.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;The Blob (1958)  68%This is just straight-up silly – a pure, unabashed B-movie with a ridiculous premise and cheesy special effects. If your kids are savvy moviegoers (like mine is), and they’ve grown up enjoying blockbusters with the highest of high-tech computer-generated visuals, they’ll be struck by how cheap and simplistic The Blob&nbsp;looks by comparison. But that’s what makes it such a blast to watch. A meteor crashes to Earth and emits a reddish, gooey ooze that starts sucking the life out of people, increasing in size with each new victim. Pandemonium ensues. It’s a hoot. And it gave Steve McQueen his first starring role.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon&nbsp;Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005)  84%We’re back with Burton again, this time in stop-motion animation mode. The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) is also a great — and popular — Halloween choice along these lines, but I’ve got a soft spot for the melancholy sweetness of this one. With an all-star voice cast led by Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, the film follows the romantic troubles of a shy young man torn between the woman his parents have arranged for him to marry and the woman who rises from the Land of the Dead and accidentally becomes his wife. It’s as gorgeous as it is poignant.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%This may not seem like the most traditional pick. But if you’ll recall, a crucial scene in E.T.&nbsp;takes place on Halloween night: when the boys smuggle their alien friend out of the house by pretending he’s Gertie, dressed as a ghost for trick-or-treating. As always, Steven Spielberg works wonders with perspective here, as an awestruck E.T. surveys the landscape of ghouls and goblins and struggles to make sense of it all. And come on – this is one of Spielberg’s greatest films ever. Any excuse to watch it will do.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;Frankenweenie (2012)  87%Tim Burton reminds us of why we love Tim Burton with this feature-length version of the 1984 short that revealed early glimmers of the veteran director’s darkly humorous style. The story of a little boy who brings his beloved, deceased dog back to life felt like the purest expression of Burton’s ethos that we’d seen in a while. His love of classic monster movies is infectious. And it’s just gorgeous in crisp black and white. I recently showed this to my son and I cried all over again, and he made fun of me for crying, so a good Friday night was had by all.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Ghostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%You could watch either version – the original or this summer’s remake with a cast of stellar comediennes. But I’d steer you and (more importantly) your kids toward this one first, for cultural perspective, if nothing else. You know what it’s about: It’s Ghostbusters. A group of scientists try to explain and eliminate a paranormal invasion that’s terrorized New York City. A comedy classic starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson, but one with some genuine scares and thrills, too.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%A really fun big-screen version of the R.L. Stine Goosebumps&nbsp;books, starring Jack Black as the real-life author. If your kids love the books, they’ll have a blast watching this – but even if they’re not familiar with the series (as my son wasn’t when he saw the movie), they’re still in for some thrills. A teenager moves to a new town and finds his next-door neighbor is the creepy and reclusive Stine. Soon afterward, the monsters trapped inside Stine’s bound books spring to life and wreak havoc. Some of the images here may be a bit too scary for very young kids, but the tone is mostly playful.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Netflix&nbsp;It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)  94%THE Halloween classic, of course. You’ve probably seen it a million times and can recite Linus’ Great Pumpkin speech right along with him. But if it’s been a while, or if your kids have never seen it, this is a great one to watch together – regardless of their age. Charlie Brown’s trick-or-treating lament – “I got a rock” – never gets old. And Linus’ unshakable faith that the Great Pumpkin not only exists but also will rise up and bring presents to all the good boys and girls has a charming innocence.Watch Trailer&nbsp;|&nbsp;Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW&nbsp;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)  95%Another dazzling example of stop-motion animation – in the same year, as Corpse Bride, no less – from the geniuses at Aardman. Mild-mannered Wallace and his trusty dog, Gromit, come to the rescue when a mutant rabbit attacks a village right before its annual vegetable competition. Winner of the Academy Award for best animated feature, Curse of the Were-Rabbit is irresistibly sweet and slyly subversive. A great choice for viewers of all ages and an excellent entry into the Wallace &amp; Gromit world.Watch Trailer | Available on: Amazon, FandangoNOW","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"BBC, versus, movies, Fox, HBO, book, Polls, movie, Reviews, Studios, Classic, jurassic, GIFs, Oscars, Prime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/26144503/Family-Friendly-Halloween.jpg","slug":"10-family-friendly-movies-to-watch-for-halloween"},{"id":"47508906094435","title":"How Family-Friendly are Monster Trucks and The Book of Love?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Monster Trucks and The Book of Love?by Christy Lemire | January 13, 2017 |  CommentsThere are a couple of choices available to you in theaters if you plan on a family movie night, including a kid-friendly monster fantasy and an inspirational tale of grief, and Christy lets us know what to expect from them. Read on for details.NOW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Monster Trucks (2017)  32%Rating: PG, for action, peril, brief scary images and some rude humor.It’s a truck… fueled by a monster! Hence the name. And if you have very young kids who are into either of these things, they may have a decent time watching this family-friendly action comedy. Your mileage may vary – after all, it’s January. Lucas Till stars as a teenager living in small-town North Dakota who discovers a friendly, oil-guzzling monster. While a scientist studies the creature’s two other buddies in a lab, Till’s character, Tripp, protects his new pal (whom he names Creech) and even lets him power his truck. But bad guys are on their way – and they have guns. Grown-ups might find the adventures, which include car chases and crashes, rather lame and flimsy. And there’s a bit of chaste romance between Tripp and a young woman (Jane Levy) with a knack for science. But somewhere in here is a message about fighting greedy oil executives, protecting animals and treasuring the environment. And of course: teamwork. Fine for kids around 6 or 7 and older.The Book Of Love (2017)  8%Rating: PG-13, for thematic content, language and drug material.An uptight architect works through the loss of his pregnant wife in a car accident by befriending an orphaned teen and helping her build a raft to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. Yes, this movie is as ridiculous and contrived as it sounds. Jason Sudeikis stars, with Jessica Biel playing his quirky, colorful wife mostly in flashbacks. Maisie Williams from Game of Thrones&nbsp;is the feisty ragamuffin who helps him grieve, or see the good in the world once more, or something. Director and co-writer Bill Purple deals with some heavy themes with his first feature: death and remorse, abuse and abject poverty. We see the crash that kills Biel’s character from a couple different angles; later, we see Williams’ character receiving cruel treatment from the uncle who’s grudgingly agreed to be her guardian. There’s also a lot of language and a couple of scenes in which Sudeikis’ character either smokes or eats marijuana in a stew. (Who knew you could do that?) I’d say this would be OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older, but surely there are better offerings available on VOD.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Max Steel (2016)  0%Rating: PG-13, for some sci-fi action violence.Kids around 9 or 10 years old are probably fine watching this sci-fi action comedy, but I’d find something else for them to do. Anything else. Based on the Max Steel games and toys by Mattel, this is theoretically aimed at tweens and teens, but it’s borderline incomprehensible regardless of your age. Max McGrath (Ben Winchell) moves back to his father’s hometown with his widowed mother (Maria Bello). There, he begins to piece together the details of the accident that killed his scientist father. But Max finds strange things are happening to him, too – like, he can shoot strings of liquid, blue-tinted energy from his fingertips and make objects explode. Thankfully, a cheeky, drone-like alien named Steel (voiced by Josh Brener) arrives to explain his newfound powers and show him what the two can achieve when they join forces. When they do, they become a superhero known as… wait for it… Max Steel, complete with head-to-toe body armor, super strength and flying abilities. He’s Iron Teen. But if only it were that simple. Max is in constant peril, with armed bad guys trying to capture him and harness his energy. There’s also a giant, evil, tornado-like creature with a mean face and glowing red eyes that might be an alien. But even without those nuisances, Max is frequently in pain as energy surges through his body, giving him terrible headaches and making him panic. There are also several intense flashbacks that gradually reveal what really happened to his dad.Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged intense disaster sequences and related disturbing images, and brief strong language.It’s intense, but viewers around 10 and older should be fine watching this action drama inspired by real events. Director Peter Berg’s film is about the April 2010 explosion on&nbsp;the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which left 11 men dead and dumped 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. We get to know the crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez, and Kurt Russell lead the ensemble cast) and see the arduous, complicated work they do. Then Berg steadily builds suspense leading up to the volatile disaster itself. This is a riveting, well-made, and strongly acted film, but it’s also really tense and difficult to watch for much of the time. Men get pummeled with oil and thrown across rooms by the sheer force of the blasts. Several of them leap from the rig into the fiery water, hoping to survive, but others plummet to their deaths. One character gets hit with shattered glass all over his face and body; another suffers a severe leg injury. And at the end, the credits reveal the names and photographs of the victims, which is stirring. There’s also quite a bit of language: These are blue-collar guys who are boisterously joking with each other and, later, reacting to a disastrous situation. But it’s a worthwhile story in terms of educating young people about the environmental impact of this massive spill, and it has important themes of courage and teamwork.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Amazon, Logo, new, 71st, YouTube, Emmys, cancelled, lee, TV, latino, Reviews, drama, 4/20, nbcuniversal, high","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/13144422/Monster-Trucks-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-monster-trucks-and-the-book-of-love"},{"id":"47508906099558","title":"How Family-Friendly are Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Collateral Beauty?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Collateral Beauty?by Christy Lemire | December 16, 2016 |  CommentsThe much-anticipated Star Wars standalone film, Rogue One, is out this week, but it’s rated PG-13 and it’s a little darker than its predecessors. Christy lets us know whether or not there’s anything unsuitable for the youngest&nbsp;Star Wars fans. Also, she gives us the lowdown on the Will Smith tearkerker&nbsp;Collateral Beauty and a handful of DVD releases. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)  84%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of sci-fi violence and action.There’s a new Star Wars movie! There’s a new Star Wars&nbsp;movie! Your kids are probably pumped about this, so you should know what’s in it – and know that it’s darker than you might expect. Rogue One, which takes place between Episodes III and IV in the series, follows the mission to steal the plans for the Death Star, which – as we know – the rebels blow up in the original Star Wars. Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, daughter of an Empire scientist who strikes out on her own and joins the Rebellion. She’s a strong and brave young woman, in the tradition of Leia and Rey. But she also sees many horrors along the way. (Possible spoilers ahead!) Director Gareth Edwards’ film isn’t afraid to kill characters we’ve come to care about, and the film vividly shows what happens when the Death Star trains its lasers on planets for a series of test runs. And some characters have no qualms about coldly killing each other, which we see. I brought my Star Wars-obsessed son, who’s now 7, with me to a screening and he wasn’t afraid of anything here. He loved it. But Rogue One&nbsp;is a serious war picture much of the time, with massive battle sequences, which could make it too intense for the youngest viewers in your family.Collateral Beauty (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.This may look like a feel-good, life-affirming holiday movie. It’s actually very strange and I’m going to have a hard time describing it, but here goes. Will Smith stars as a former hotshot ad executive who’s now reeling from a major family tragedy. His business partners – played by Kate Winslet, Edward Norton, and Michael Pena – scheme to make him look crazy so they can sell the agency, which is floundering in his absence. Keira Knightley, Jacob Latimore, and Helen Mirren play the struggling actors who manipulate him by portraying the notions of Love, Time, and Death, respectively. Along the way, all the characters learn to deal with their own problems. What are the odds? Director David Frankel’s film deals with some very mature themes of loss and grief. There’s also quite a bit of language throughout, including the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. Plus, this film is just so bizarre and hard to follow, your kids will probably be thoroughly confused (as will you).NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Suicide Squad (2016)  26%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and action throughout, disturbing behavior, suggestive content and language.Don’t let the candy-colored marketing scheme fool you: This is really only OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and older. Suicide Squad&nbsp;is right there on the edge of what you can include in an action movie without earning an R rating. This latest comic book blockbuster extravaganza based on DC Comics characters is just relentlessly violent. It’s about a group of incarcerated super villains who are offered reduced sentences if they’ll help the federal government take down even worse bad guys than they are. They include the expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), the crazy-sexy Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who blasts fire from his fingertips. It’s extremely dark thematically in terms of who these characters are, what they’ve done and what they can do. There’s relentless gunfire, as well as stabbings, brutal fistfights, zombie invasions, and witch sorcery from the powerful Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). It’s also quite difficult to follow much of the time — both in terms of the story and the visuals — with so many characters and so much of the action taking place at night. And of course there is The Joker (Jared Leto), for whom wreaking havoc is his raison d’etre.Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)  64%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for intense sequences of fantasy action/violence and peril.Kids around 9 or 10 and older are probably fine watching the latest flight of fancy from director Tim Burton. It follows the adventures of a teenager named Jake (Asa Butterfield) who travels back in time to visit an orphanage full of kids with magical abilities. The material would seem tailor-made for Burton’s tastes. The “peculiars,” as they’re known, can set fire to things just by touching them, or float away, or spit bees from their mouths, to list just a few. But there are some deeply frightening images here, too, including the sight of dead people whose eyes have been plucked from their skulls, leaving them with dark, haunting holes. The murderous villains, meanwhile, have eyes that shine an eerie, bright white. We also see the repeated sight of Nazi planes dropping bombs on the orphanage during World War II. There’s some fun to be had here, too, as well as some moments of beauty and wonder. But the story, based on the Young Adult novel by Ransom Riggs, features a densely packed mythology that’s often hard to follow. My son — who wasn’t quite 7 when he saw this and never gets scared in movies – found the sight of the hollow-eyed people frightening. And, like me, he often thought the convoluted plot was confusing.Ben-Hur (2016)  25%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for sequences of violence and disturbing images.Viewers around 12 or 13 should be fine watching this high-tech telling of the classic, biblical-era tale. It’s about half as long as the 1959 Charlton Heston version, but it’s crammed with violent action sequences. Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston), a prince of Judea, is wrongly imprisoned and sentenced to slavery when his adopted brother, Messala (Toby Kebbell), a Roman officer on the rise, accuses him of treason. Ben-Hur must find a way back to rescue his mother and sister, get revenge and restore his name. Along the way, he spends years being whipped as a galley slave and there’s a ton of graphic swordplay. Men all around him drown, get pierced with arrows, and are set on fire. Of course, Ben-Hur must compete against Messala in a climactic chariot race in which riders get tossed in the air and trampled by horses. And he keeps running into Jesus Christ (Rodrigo Santoro), including during the crucifixion, which (as you can imagine), is traumatic and bloody. But you also may find that Ben-Hur is worthwhile as a story of redemption, spirituality and forgiveness.Southside With You (2016)  92%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for brief strong language, smoking, a violent image and a drug reference.President Obama’s administration is coming to a close in a few weeks, but you can revisit his early days with the first lady in this walking-and-talking romance. It recreates the first date between Barack and Michelle Obama, back when they were in their mid-20s with dreams of changing the world. Parker Sawyers plays the future president when he was still just a charismatic law student, with Tika Sumpter co-starring as the future first lady, his superior at the Chicago law firm where he worked during the summer of 1989. The two spend the day together on the city’s South side – hence the title – visiting an art exhibit, attending a community meeting, seeing a movie (Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing) and finally sharing a climactic ice cream cone. There’s a bit of language. The young Obama smokes cigarettes pretty much non-stop and jokes about smoking too much pot in college. We also see a snippet of the riot scene in Lee’s classic film as the couple is watching it in a theater. But this is really lovely, intimate and beautifully acted. I’d say it’s fine for viewers around age 10 and older, especially if they’re interested in history or politics.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Sony, Games, Pictures, e.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16122533/Rogue-One-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-and-collateral-beauty"},{"id":"47508906103656","title":"Family-Friendly Choices on DVD This Week: The BFG and Pete’s Dragon","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Family-Friendly Choices on DVD This Week: The BFG and Pete's Dragonby Christy Lemire | December 2, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the most prominent new releases this week are either rated R or they weren’t screened for critics, so instead, Christy dips into the DVD releases to make a couple of recommendations for family movie night.&nbsp;Read on for details.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The BFG (2016)  74%Rating: PG, for action/peril, some scary moments and brief rude humor.Kids of all ages should be fine watching Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel. It’s visually dazzling, with seamless special effects that blend computer-generated giants with real-life actors. Mark Rylance stars as the title character – the Big Friendly Giant – who teams up with a spirited, 10-year-old orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill). Together, they try to stop other giants from eating people with the help of the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton) and the British military. Sophie is in near-constant danger of being smushed, stomped on or outright devoured by the hulking inhabitants of Giant Country. And while the BFG himself is gentle and kind, the other giants – who are much larger than he is – are grotesque and menacing, and might seem scary for the youngest viewers. Also, The BFG’s job is to capture dreams (and sometimes nightmares) to place in Londoners’ heads while they’re sleeping, so some of that imagery might be a bit creepy for little kids. And there’s a running gag involving flatulence that builds to an amusingly explosive climax.Pete's Dragon (2016)  88%Rating:&nbsp;PG, for action, peril and brief language.Viewers around 6 and older will delight in this family film, which is sort of a remake of the 1977 movie of the same name in that it’s about a boy named Pete who has a dragon. Orphaned at a very young age, Pete (Oakes Fegley) has been raised in the forest by his only friend: a furry, green dragon he named Elliot. When a forest ranger (Bryce Dallas Howard) discovers him at age 11 and brings him home, he struggles to adjust to civilization, all the while trying to protect his magical friend from loggers who want to capture him for their own glory. Director David Lowery has created a film set in in the 1970s that feels as if it was made then, too. He’s unrushed in his pacing and uses wordless sequences efficiently to tell his story. And the relationship between Pete and Elliot is lovely – full of frolic and joy as well as quiet, intimate moments. But as I mentioned at the start, Pete is an orphan in the classic Disney tradition; in the film’s first few minutes, we see him lose his parents in a car accident that he survives, then wander alone in the woods until he meets Elliot. The sense of loneliness and loss is powerful here and might be too much for very young viewers. Also, a group of loggers take down the dragon using tranquilizer guns and chain him to a flatbed truck, which could be disturbing.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"news, NYCC, criterion, festival, blaxploitation, james, halloween, lord, thriller, international, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/02120425/BFG-PG.jpg","slug":"family-friendly-choices-on-dvd-this-week-the-bfg-and-petes-dragon"},{"id":"47508906110828","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Doctor Strange, Trolls, and Loving?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Doctor Strange, Trolls, and Loving?by Christy Lemire | November 4, 2016 |  CommentsIt’s pretty clear that the new animated film Trolls is meant for kids, but there are a couple of PG-13 offerings this week — including the latest Marvel blockbuster and an important historical drama — that might be worth looking into. Christy lets us know what to look out for.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Doctor Strange (2016)  89%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi violence and action throughout, and an intense crash sequence.The latest installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe centers on a character your kids may not have heard of prior to the release of this film: Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a once-brilliant surgeon who suffers a serious car accident and reinvents himself through mysticism and magic. Under the tutelage of the powerful Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Doctor Strange becomes a warrior in a battle between good and evil that takes place across various dimensions. It’s as trippy as it sounds, with some seriously psychedelic imagery. But Doctor Strange&nbsp;also features the sort of pummeling hand-to-hand combat, weapons play and urban destruction you’ve come to expect in these effects-laden Marvel blockbusters. The crash that injures Doctor Strange is pretty gnarly. There’s some language but also a cheeky sense of humor throughout. And the ultimate, evil force Strange must face might look too frightening for younger viewers. It’s intense but also a lot of fun. I’d say this is OK for kids around 8-10 and older – especially if they’re familiar with the Marvel franchise.Trolls (2016)  75%Rating: PG, for some mild rude humor.They sing and dance and hug and sing and dance and hug. They’re a candy-colored clan full of cuddly critters who enjoy expressing their constant happiness through song. What’s not to like? Well, if you’re a parent, you may find this incessant cheeriness super annoying. Kids will love it, though, whether or not they’ve ever heard of the high-haired Troll dolls that inspired the movie. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake lead an all-star voice cast in this animated, musical adventure in which the Trolls try to avoid being captured and devoured by a group of grumpy ogres known as the Bergens. You see, the Bergens believe if they eat a Troll, they won’t be so miserable anymore. It’s basically a parable about the importance of finding the happiness that lies within us all – which is kind of a simplistic message, but not a terrible one for kids to hear. The Trolls are frequently in danger, and while the Bergens are grotesque, they’re never truly frightening. The only vaguely inappropriate thing here is a Troll that poops cupcakes and another who farts glitter – but even that’s kinda cute. Fine for all ages.Loving (2016)  88%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements.This is a serious, grown-up movie, but its subject matter is important and inspiring, which makes it worthwhile for the older kids in your house. Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga star in writer-director Jeff Nichols’ drama based on the true story of Richard and Mildred Loving. They were an interracial couple at a time and place – 1958 Virginia – where such a union was unusual. He was white, she was black, and they had a baby on way. While the two married legally in Washington DC, they found themselves persecuted back home in rural Virginia, where the practice was still against the law. Their fight to keep their family together, which went all the way to the Supreme Court, changed the laws regarding interracial marriage nationwide. Along the way, though, they were forced from their home, jailed and separated. This is a quietly intense movie with some disturbing language and dialogue, as well as a scene of a child getting hit by a car. But it’s beautifully written, shot and acted, making it appropriate – and recommended – for viewers around 12 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond (2016)  86%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Kids around 8 and older will be fine watching the latest installment in the rebooted Star Trek universe. Justin Lin takes over directing duties from J.J. Abrams this time, as Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban), and the rest of the crew of the USS Enterprise go on a mission through a dangerous nebula to rescue a stranded ship. What they find instead is a massive attack by a villain (Idris Elba) who needs a crucial artifact on board the Enterprise to enact his dastardly, interplanetary plan. This movie is a blast, filled with thrilling special-effects set pieces: chases through the skies and on land, gravity-defying stunts, and a race against the clock. Elba’s character, Krall, may seem a bit scary for younger viewers with his menacing mask. And the siege he mounts on the Enterprise is incredibly tense. Characters are temporarily separated from each other and frequently are in peril; one suffers a major, bloody injury that requires serious medical attention. There are legitimate stakes, but compared to a lot of blockbusters from this past summer which got bogged down in self-serious mythology, this one’s just breezy, zippy fun.The Ivory Game (2016)  77%Rating:&nbsp;N/AAvailable on Netflix, this is a disturbing but urgent documentary about the multibillion-dollar ivory trafficking industry. Directors Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson and their crew went undercover for 16 months to investigate the poaching of African elephants and the smuggling of their tusks to China, where ivory sales are legal but shady, black-market dealings still exist. Although it’s a non-fiction film, The Ivory Game plays with the gripping pacing and glossy production values of an international thriller. There’s a great deal of imagery that’s difficult to watch, no matter how old you are, including the sight of slain carcasses and fellow elephant loved ones surrounding them silently to mourn their loss. The statistics alone are staggering: An African elephant is killed every 15 minutes, and at that rate they could be extinct altogether in the next 15 years. It’s a tough, tense watch. But young people should see this film to learn about a crisis that may seem far away and inaccessible. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"monster","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/04121609/Trolls-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-doctor-strange-trolls-and-loving"},{"id":"47508907605878","title":"How Family-Friendly Is The Light Between Oceans?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Is The Light Between Oceans?by Christy Lemire | September 2, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is a weepie with a handful of awards-caliber stars, but it’s a melodrama with some heavy themes.&nbsp;Read on to see if it might all be a bit much for your little ones.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Light Between Oceans (2016)  61%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material and some sexual content.If you’re in the mood for a heavy-duty, emotionally cathartic romantic drama, The Light Between Oceans is for you. Derek Cianfrance’s adaptation of the M.L. Stedman novel follows the tumultuous relationship between a stoic lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender) and his vivacious, young wife (Alicia Vikander) living on a remote island off the coast of Western Australia just after World War I. While they are initially happy, their attempts at starting a family end in two miscarriages. But when an infant washes ashore in a small boat after a storm – along with her deceased father – the couple believes they’ve received one last shot at happiness. Clearly, it can’t be that easy, though. The Light Between Oceans&nbsp;deals with the mature themes of birth and death, guilt and truth. Vikander’s character is understandably devastated by her loss both physically and psychologically, but she’s also the one to pressure her husband into lying and pretending the baby is theirs. There are a couple of brief sex scenes, although they feature barely any nudity. And toward the end, the baby – now a 5-year-old girl – goes missing and appears to be in danger. But this is a beautifully shot, strongly acted film that’s probably suitable for viewers around 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Jungle Book (2016)  94%Rating: PG, for some sequences of scary action and peril.Kids around 6 and older will be just fine watching Jon Favreau’s live-action take on The Jungle Book. In fact, they’ll love it – it’s a visual wonder. If you saw it during its theatrical run, you know this was a rare example of a film that really is worth the extra cost for 3-D: The images are lush, vivid and immersive. But the movie as a whole is also just a lot of fun, with thrilling action sequences, delightful musical numbers and lively performances from a strong cast. You know the story: It’s Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book. Man-cub Mowgli (played by excellent newcomer Neel Sethi) struggles to find his place in the world amid a variety of animals — wolves, panthers, bears, tigers, snakes — as he grows into a young man. The excellent voice cast includes Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong’o, Scarlett Johansson, and Idris Elba. But much of the action could be too intense for young viewers, such as the brutal brawls between the panther who protects him and the tiger who’s trying to kill him. Wildfires devastate much of the jungle. Mowgli is pretty much in constant peril. And there is a significant character death. I took my son (who was then 6 ½) to a screening, and while he didn’t find anything frightening, kids who are sensitive to that kind of intense danger might.Me Before You (2016)  54%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and some suggestive material.Emilia Clarke is the ultimate manic pixie dream girl in this sweet but soapy adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel. She stars as a young woman in a small, British town who accepts a job as the caretaker for a formerly high-flying, risk-taking rich boy (Sam Claflin) who’s now paralyzed and in a wheelchair after being hit by a motorcycle. With her brightly colored tights, wacky vintage dresses and generally sunny demeanor, she naturally wears down this miserable man’s defenses. But even though the two share plenty of adventures (and eventually a romance – not exactly a spoiler), he still doesn’t feel life is worth living in this manner. Me Before You deals directly with the heavy, complicated subject of assisted suicide. It also features some drinking, plenty of language and the suggestion of sex. I’d say this is fine for viewers around 11 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"78th, sag, Star, CMT, motion, actors, jurassic, chucky, Thanksgiving","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/02122949/Light-Between-Oceans-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-the-light-between-oceans"},{"id":"47508909031292","title":"How Family-Friendly are Star Trek Beyond and Ice Age: Collision Course?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Star Trek Beyond and Ice Age: Collision Course?by Christy Lemire | July 22, 2016 |  CommentsThe latest installment of the Ice Age franchise is quite obviously aimed at kids — even if it is rated PG — but is there anything to worry about in the latest chapter of the Star Trek saga? Christy Lemire has seen them both, and she lets us know what to look out for.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond (2016)  86%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and violence.Justin Lin takes over the directing duties from J.J. Abrams in this latest installment of the rebooted Star Trek&nbsp;universe. Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto), Bones (Karl Urban) and the rest of the crew of the USS Enterprise go on a mission through a dangerous nebula to rescue a stranded ship.

Characters are temporarily separated from each other and frequently are in peril; one suffers a major, bloody injury that requires serious medical attention. Yes, there are legitimate stakes, but compared to a lot of recent summer blockbusters which get bogged down in self-serious mythology, this one’s just breezy, zippy fun. Fine for kids around age 8 and older.Ice Age: Collision Course (2016)  18%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor and some action/peril.What is this now, like, the fourth Ice Age movie? The fifth? It’s hard to keep track. Anyway, this time, Scrat ends up inside an alien spaceship, where he inadvertently sends a fiery asteroid hurtling toward Earth in his eternal pursuit of an acorn. All the prehistoric creatures down below must scurry about, seeking safety and working together to avoid obliteration. Yes, the characters (voiced by Ray Romano, Queen Latifah, Denis Leary, Jennifer Lopez, Keke Palmer, Adam Devine and – the rare highlight – Simon Pegg) are in constant danger, but the threat seems far away and cartoonish. There’s a scene in which a bunch of animals luxuriate in a hot tub and flirt with each other. And there is exactly one poop joke. This movie is harmless. It’s also not very good. But the jokes and action are suitable for the whole family, and your kids will probably think Scrat is cute. So if it’s really hot outside this weekend and you’re desperate to get indoors in the air conditioning, this’ll do.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action throughout, and some sensuality.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching director Zack Snyder’s follow-up to his 2013 film Man of Steel. This time, Superman (Henry Cavill) battles Batman (Ben Affleck) basically for the amusement of crazed industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Mass urban destruction ensues. Theoretically, there’s more to it than that, and it involves Batman’s fear that Superman is dangerous after the climactic events of the previous movie. But really, any semblance of plot is just a thin excuse to set up a pantheon of films based on DC Comics, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s firmly in place. All your usual action-movie elements are here: brutal fistfights, perilous car chases, enormous explosions and deadly gunfire. As in so many other Batman films, BvS&nbsp;replays the moment when young Bruce Wayne watches his parents get shot to death during a robbery outside a movie theater. Plus — without spoiling anything — a new monster arrives on the scene who’s seemingly indestructible. There’s also a disturbing dream sequence. It’s all very noisy and numbing, but it’s CGI-inflated comic-book violence.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Awards, Bowl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/22122136/Star-Trek-Beyond-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-star-trek-beyond-and-ice-age-collision-course"},{"id":"47508907614075","title":"How Family-Friendly are Jason Bourne and Nerve?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Jason Bourne and Nerve?by Christy Lemire | July 29, 2016 |  CommentsTwo of this week’s movies — the latest in the Bourne franchise and a thriller for the social media age — are rated PG-13, but how closely do they toe the line of an R rating? Christy lets us know whether either film might be a bit much for younger audiences and covers a couple of choice selections on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jason Bourne (2016)  54%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and brief strong language.I’m actually amazed this got a PG-13 rating. With its violence, rioting, brutal hand-to-hand combat, shootings and killings, it’s just right there on the edge of what you can show in a movie without earning an R. But if you’ve seen the three previous Bourne films, you know what you’re in for; Jason Bourne&nbsp;covers a lot of the same ground. Once again, Matt Damon returns as the title character. At the film’s start, the former assassin is living underground and continuing to put together the pieces of his past and fill in the blanks in his memory. Along the way, he must take out the various shadowy dark-ops guys who are trying to kill him, as well as a highly trained sniper (Vincent Cassel) who has a personal grudge against him. One early sequence takes place during a protest in Athens that quickly escalates into chaos. Bourne also causes a ton of damage on his own through a couple of incredibly tense chases, one of which involves an armored SWAT truck on the crowded Las Vegas strip. There’s also some profanity. I’d say this is OK for kids around 13 and older.Nerve (2016)  66%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving dangerous and risky behavior, some sexual content, language, drug content, drinking and nudity – all involving teens.Emma Roberts and Dave Franco co-star in this action thriller about teens playing a dangerous online game of dare. They and many others across the country have signed onto an app called Nerve, in which you can either watch or take part in an increasingly risky series of challenges for money. If you pull out, the consequences are dire. The pranks are harmless at first – embarrassing stuff in public – but become more demanding and possibly deadly depending on what the watchers want the players to do. It doesn’t seem terribly implausible; in this age of Pokémon Go, walking around with your phone and interacting with strangers in wild ways kinda makes sense. But the film grows tense and violent with stunts involving motorcycles, trains, fire, skyscrapers and guns. The lead characters end up in their underwear at a luxury department store and they kiss several times. One bad-girl cheerleader flashes her naked rear end during a football game. And there’s quite a bit of teen partying. Your tweens and young teens will probably want to see it, and that might be OK – provided you explain to them that they should NOT try any of this at home.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Barbershop: The Next Cut (2016)  90%Rating: PG-13, for sexual material and language.Young teens and older should be fine watching the latest Barbershop&nbsp;movie. It’s been 12 years since the last one, but much of the old gang is back alongside some new characters. Ice Cube, Cedric the Entertainer, Eve, Common, Nicki Minaj, Regina Hall, Anthony Anderson and J.B. Smoove joke around, talk politics and pop culture, and generally create the warm, community vibe we’ve come to know at Calvin’s Barbershop on Chicago’s south side. But director Malcolm D. Lee’s film very much takes place in the real world in which we’ve lived in recent years, and it addresses head-on not only the devastating gang violence that has plagued Chicago but also the racial tensions and shootings that have taken place across the country. Calvin’s son is considering joining a gang and another character dies off-screen in a gang-related shooting. There’s quite a bit of language and sexual humor — some of which is innuendo, some of which is graphic in nature. But the movie is also worthwhile because it balances humor and heart with social and political relevance.Sing Street (2016)  95%Rating: PG-13, for hematic elements including strong language and some bullying behavior, a suggestive image, drug material and teen smoking.This is a great choice for the tweens and teens in your house, especially if they have musical aspirations of their own. The third film from Irish writer-director John Carney has a lot in common with his first two, Once and Begin Again. They all explore the power of music to transform and connect us and to give us an outlet to express our every emotion — but that doesn’t make Carney’s latest any less charming. Set in Dublin in the mid-1980s, Sing Street&nbsp;has some autobiographical underpinnings. It focuses on a 15-year-old fledgling musician (an appealing Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who forms a band with some other outsiders at his rough public high school in hopes of impressing the beautiful older girl (Lucy Boynton) who lives across the street. There’s a ton of bullying and abuse that goes on here, both from fellow students and the priest who runs the place. There’s also quite a bit of language, arguing, and frank talk about divorce. And pretty much everyone smokes constantly. But the film as a whole is a complete joy to watch, with an infectious energy and an incredible soundtrack of both classic ‘80s songs (Duran Duran, The Cure, The Jam, Hall &amp; Oates) and original tunes.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Warner, Comic, media, Plus, festivals, cults, best, book, mockumentary, Netflix, Exclusive","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29144712/Jason-Bourne-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-jason-bourne-and-nerve"},{"id":"47508907603829","title":"How Family-Friendly Are Sully and Ithaca?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly Are Sully and Ithaca?by Christy Lemire | September 9, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is Clint Eastwood’s retelling of the “Miracle on the Hudson,” starring Tom Hanks, but we’ve also got the directorial debut of one-time frequent Hanks co-star Meg Ryan. Read on to see if these two PG-13 films are too intense for the kids.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Sully (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for some peril and brief strong language.Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the veteran pilot who famously landed a US Airways plane in the middle of the Hudson River when both engines cut out after takeoff, saving all 155 people on board. Clint Eastwood’s direction is lean and efficient, and he creates a surprising amount of tension given that he’s telling a recent story with an ending we all know. The emergency landing itself is as stressful as you’d expect, with people on board sobbing and saying goodbye to each other and their loved ones as they fear they’re about to die. Once the plane lands safely, several passengers are in danger of drowning in the frigid river. There’s also some language scattered throughout. But the movie itself is brisk and well made, and a worthwhile story of heroism, teamwork and perseverance. Fine for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Ithaca (2016)  22%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, a war image and smoking.Meg Ryan makes her feature-directing debut with this exceedingly earnest but tonally awkward adaptation of William Saroyan’s The Human Comedy. She also has a supporting role as a widow trying to hold her family together during World War II. Alex Neustaedter stars as her teenage son, Homer, who takes a job as a bike messenger to support the family while his older brother (Jack Quaid) is off fighting in the war. There’s some heavy thematic stuff here: Homer frequently has to deliver telegraphs informing mothers that their sons have died. There’s also a bit of language and a lot of smoking. (It was the ‘40s, after all.) And Sam Shepard has a supporting part as Homer’s frequently inebriated co-worker at the telegraph office. It means well. It’s just a mess.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Meddler (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for brief drug content.Tweens and older are fine seeing this feel-good comedy. Your enjoyment of it, however, will depend greatly on how you feel about its main character. Susan Sarandon stars as Marnie, a widow who moves from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be near her daughter (Rose Byrne), who’s a television writer. Marnie calls and texts her daughter incessantly and shows up at her house unannounced, but she also insinuates herself in the lives of people she barely knows. She’s well-intentioned, but she’s also extremely needy and clingy. There’s some language here and some grown-up talk about death and grief during therapy sessions. There’s also one scene in which Marnie eats a bag full of marijuana to hide it from a security guard and goes on a hallucinatory trip while wandering around an outdoor mall.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Turner, who, trailers, theme, Prime, thriller, Character, Pride, 2020, CBS, Geographic, Cartoon, Disney, &","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/09135102/Sully-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-sully-and-ithaca"},{"id":"47508907601780","title":"Captain America: Civil War is Out on DVD, but Can Your Kids Watch It?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Captain America: Civil War is Out on DVD, but Can Your Kids Watch It?by Christy Lemire | September 16, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the big films this week are rated R, but a very popular blockbuster arrived on DVD this week. Christy Lemire offers up a rundown of the film’s themes and content to help determine if it’s suitable for your kids.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War (2016)  90%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of violence, action and mayhem.Kids around 8-10 and older probably will be fine watching this massive cog in the Marvel Cinematic Universe machinery, which will end up being one of the biggest box-office hits of the year. This time, Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) square off over how much autonomy the Avengers should have when so much collateral damage lies in the wake of their good deeds. Their superhero buddies take sides depending on whom they agree with philosophically, with some old friends from previous Marvel movies joining in the mix. Like 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Civil War&nbsp;comes from the brother directing team of Anthony and Joe Russo. And like that previous film (and every other Marvel movie), there’s a ton of violence and destruction. But the film also addresses that head-on in a smartly self-referential way. Explosions and extended sequences of hand-to-hand combat abound, as well as the disturbing sight of the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) being activated as a killing machine with specific, sequential code words. This is about on par with all the other Marvel movies in terms of whether it’s appropriate for your kids. If they’ve seen other ones, they should be OK here. I brought my Marvel-savvy, 6-1/2-year-old son to a screening of Civil War&nbsp;this past summer and nothing frightened or disturbed him. And despite the movie’s serious themes, much of the dialogue is knowing and playful as the Avengers poke fun at themselves, each other and pop culture in general.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fresh, Year, Anna, CBS, talk","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/16114515/Captain-America-Civil-War-PG.jpg","slug":"captain-america-civil-war-is-out-on-dvd-but-can-your-kids-watch-it"},{"id":"47508909033341","title":"How Family-Friendly is Ghostbusters?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Ghostbusters?by Christy Lemire | July 15, 2016 |  CommentsThe new Ghostbusters is an all-out comedy, but if you’re thinking about taking the kids to see it, you should know whether or not some of the ghosts might still be a little too freaky for the littlest ones. Read on to see what Christy thought about it, as well as a couple of new DVD releases.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ghostbusters (2016)  74%Rating: PG-13, for supernatural action and some crude humor.This remake of the 1984 comedy-action classic finds four women busting ghosts in New York City rather than men. Comedians Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones star as paranormal investigators who run around town with their makeshift, high-tech gear, wrestling and capturing an ever-increasing number of ghouls who’ve invaded. It’s mostly played for laughs, but younger viewers might be frightened at first by the appearance of the ghosts, which are more detailed than they were 30 years ago. An early scene in particular finds a long-dead woman floating over our heroes menacingly with her wild eyes and sharp teeth – only to shoot projectile green slime all over Wiig’s character. That’s the way a lot of the bits go: They initially may seem scary but they’re ultimately played for laughs. There’s a bit of language here and there in addition to the complicated scientific jargon, which may confuse younger viewers. But the underlying theme of strong, smart women who stick by each other no matter what is more than worthwhile for both girls and boys to see. I brought my son (who’s almost 7) with me to the new Ghostbusters, and while he felt briefly frightened during the opening sequence in a haunted mansion, he quickly laughed when things turned silly. This is probably fine for viewers around 8 or 9 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016)  11%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action, thematic elements, and some partial nudity.Viewers around 13 and older should be fine watching this second-to-last movie in the Divergent&nbsp;franchise – especially if they’ve seen the previous two. And yes, there’s still one more coming; as usual, the last book in Veronica Roth’s trilogy is being split into two movies. This time, Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and their rag-tag band of buddies dare to climb the wall surrounding Chicago to investigate the outside world. As in all of these movies (and post-apocalyptic Young Adult fare in general), there’s a ton of violence, much of it involving gunfire and hand-to-hand combat. But toward the end, there’s also the climactic threat that an orange gas being pumped through the ventilation system will cause massive memory loss. Adults are universally nefarious figures. Several young people are shot to death, children are hunted down and snatched from their parents for scientific experiments, and one little boy watches as his father is fatally shot in front of him. There’s also a bit of nudity during a shower scene.Miracles from Heaven (2016)  45%Rating: PG, for thematic material, including accident and medical issues.Kids around 7 and up will probably be fine watching this real-life drama. It’s based on the story of Texas mom Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner), whose 10-year-old daughter, Annabel (Kylie Rogers), suddenly suffered from a rare and potentially fatal intestinal disorder – and, just as suddenly, was cured. A 30-foot fall through the hollowed-out trunk of a cottonwood tree miraculously healed Annabel. But while she was trapped on the ground, she says she had an out-of-body experience in which she went to heaven and God told her she’d be fine. Hence the title. Miracles From Heaven&nbsp;contains many stressful moments as Christy and Annabel travel back and forth to Boston for treatment, which doesn’t seem to be working. Anna and a young girl in the hospital bed next to her, who’s battling cancer, discuss very frankly whether they’re afraid of dying. But there are also many moments of uplift, kindness and faith.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Interview, SXSW","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15112547/Ghostbusters-PG2.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-ghostbusters"},{"id":"47508907597682","title":"How Family-Friendly are Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, Deepwater Horizon, and Queen of Katwe?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Deepwater Horizon, and Queen of Katwe?by Christy Lemire | September 30, 2016 |  CommentsAll of the big movies opening this week are rated PG-13 or below, so Christy lets us know what to watch out for if you plan on taking the little ones to any of them — with the exception of Masterminds, which wasn’t really widely screened for critics. Read on to find out.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)  64%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of fantasy action/violence and peril.A teenager named Jake (Asa Butterfield) travels back in time to visit an orphanage full of kids with magical abilities in the latest fantasy adventure from director Tim Burton. The material would seem tailor-made for Burton’s tastes. The “peculiars,” as they’re known, can set fire to things just by touching them, or float away, or spit bees from their mouths, to list just a few. But there are some deeply frightening images here, too, including the sight of dead people whose eyes have been plucked from their skulls, leaving them with dark, haunting holes. The murderous villains, meanwhile, have eyes that shine an eerie, bright white. We also see the repeated sight of Nazi planes dropping bombs on the orphanage during World War II. There’s some fun to be had here, too, as well as some moments of beauty and wonder. But the story, based on the Young Adult novel by Ransom Riggs, features a densely packed mythology that’s often hard to follow. My son — who’s almost 7 and never gets scared in movies – found the sight of the hollow-eyed people frightening. And, like me, he often thought the convoluted plot was confusing. But if your kids are interested in seeing Miss Peregrine’s, I’d say it’s OK for viewers around 9 or 10 and older.Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged intense disaster sequences and related disturbing images, and brief strong language.The April 2010 explosion on&nbsp;the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which left 11 men dead and dumped 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, is the subject of this intense drama. Director Peter Berg lets us get to know the crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Gina Rodriguez, and Kurt Russell lead the ensemble cast) and provides a glimpse into the arduous, complicated work they do. Then he steadily builds tension leading up to the volatile disaster itself. This is a riveting, well-made, and strongly acted film, but it’s also really tense and difficult to watch for much of the time. Men get pummeled with oil and thrown across rooms by the sheer force of the blasts. Several of them leap from the rig into the fiery water, hoping to survive, but others plummet to their deaths. One character gets hit with shattered glass all over his face and body; another suffers a severe leg injury. And at the end, the credits reveal the names and photographs of the victims, which is stirring. There’s also quite a bit of language: These are blue-collar guys who are boisterously joking with each other and, later, reacting to a disastrous situation. But it’s a worthwhile story in terms of educating young people about the environmental impact of this massive spill, and it has important themes of courage and teamwork. Fine for viewers around 10 and older.Queen of Katwe (2016)  94%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, an accident scene and some suggestive material.This feel-good true story, which opened in limited release last week and goes wider this week, is a beautifully acted and inspiring tale of a girl from the slums of Uganda who becomes an unlikely chess champion. The lovely Madina Nalwanga stars as 10-year-old Phiona, who sells corn in the streets to help her family survive. But she’s quick-witted and inquisitive, and she becomes curious when she sees a missionary (David Oyelowo) teaching chess to the local youth. He, in turn, recognizes her smarts and instincts for the game – as well as her fighting spirit – and agrees to coach her. But Phiona’s hardworking and protective mother (Lupita Nyong’o) is apprehensive about letting her compete on an international scale. Director Mira Nair creates a vivid sense of place, both in the daily hardships these kids endure and the small joys they savor. There’s also a subplot involving the questionable choices Phiona’s older sister makes to ensure her own survival. But for the most part, this is a worthwhile, emotionally powerful film for kids to see with lessons about dedication and hope.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Warcraft (2016)  28%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence.Kids around age 10 or 11 and older would probably be fine watching this feature-film version of the Warcraft&nbsp;video game – but should they? It’s a giant, noisy, computer-generated extravaganza crammed with massive battles between hulking orcs and sword-wielding knights. If that’s what you’re into, awesome. But if you’ve never played the game before, you’re likely to be confused (as I was), because it’s often difficult to tell who’s doing what to whom. The violence is pummeling and relentless, full of fighting, shooting and stabbing, but it’s also rather fake looking and cartoonish. Having said that, the orcs’ appearance alone may be rather startling to some younger viewers. There’s also quite a bit of magic at play here as warlocks use their powers for good and evil. My son was 6 ½ when I took him with me to a screening of this and he didn’t find anything frightening; actually, he was rather bored and squirming the whole time.The Shallows (2016)  78%Rating: PG-13, for bloody images, intense sequences of peril, and brief strong language.Viewers around 12 or 13 and older will be fine with this lean, mean thriller in which Blake Lively battles a hungry shark. Who will win?! Lively stars as a young woman who goes surfing alone at a secluded Mexican beach. Ignoring warnings to return to shore before it gets too dark, she stays for one last wave and becomes the target of a particularly persistent great white. It’s pretty gnarly, I must say – in all the best possible ways. Lively’s character suffers a serious bite on the leg and stitches up the bloody limb in clever, makeshift fashion. The few other people who exist in this remote setting don’t fare nearly so well. She’s in constant peril but she’s also smart, resourceful and skilled as she runs through her options for survival. And she gets the one well-chosen F-bomb you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. This is an intense, frightening, well-made and surprisingly fun little flick.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"child's, Pictures, breaking","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/30140705/Deepwater-Horizon-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-deepwater-horizon-and-queen-of-katwe"},{"id":"47508909038464","title":"How Family-Friendly are Independence Day: Resurgence and The Shallows?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Independence Day: Resurgence and The Shallows?by Christy Lemire | June 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy lets us know whether or not the big sci-fi blockbuster or the smaller — but possibly more thrilling — shark attack movie might be too intense for younger viewers. Then she also revisits a couple of movies now available on DVD, in case you choose to stay home with the little ones. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Independence Day: Resurgence (2016)  30%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action and destruction and for some language.The aliens are back, and this time they want… more of the same thing they wanted before, maybe? Not that it matters, because this sequel to the 1996 smash-hit blockbuster Independence Day is all about the spectacle. And it is big, shiny and noisy in the over-the-top tradition of Roland Emmerich, but without the kind of visceral thrills you usually get with the director’s outlandish action extravaganzas. Twenty years after the original film’s alien battle, humans have learned to use their technology for everything from space exploration to getting across town more efficiently. But just as America is about to celebrate the anniversary of that victory, the aliens return — in a spaceship that’s 3,000 miles wide, no less — to lock onto our planet and drill into its core for resources. Or something. Anyway, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner are back — Will Smith opted out, wisely — fighting alongside newcomers Liam Neeson, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, William Fichtner, and (in the strangest bit of casting of all) Charlotte Gainsbourg. There’s massive urban destruction, ostensibly resulting in massive death, little of which we actually see. The aliens are big, gooey and relentless in typical alien fashion. Children are in peril — a school bus full of them, for good measure. There’s a bit of language. And there are lots of battles in which human and alien ships shoot green lasers at each other that go “Pew! Pew! Pew!” I brought my 6 ½-year-old son with me (because he’d seen the original Independence Day&nbsp;and was actually curious to know what could possibly happen next) and he was never scared, but he also slept through about half of it. Lucky him. As for your kids, they’ll probably be OK if they’re around 10 and older.The Shallows (2016)  78%Rating: PG-13, for bloody images, intense sequences of peril, and brief strong language.It’s Blake Lively vs. Shark: Who will win?! That’s the premise of this lean, mean genre picture. Lively stars as a young woman who goes surfing alone at a secluded beach in Mexico. Ignoring warnings to come out of the water before it gets too dark, she stays for one last wave and becomes the target of a particularly insistent great white shark. It’s pretty gnarly, I gotta say – in all the best ways. Lively’s character suffers a serious bite on the leg and stitches up the bloody limb in clever, makeshift fashion. The few other people who exist in this remote setting don’t fare nearly so well. She’s in constant peril but she’s also incredibly resourceful as she runs through her options for survival. And she gets the one well-chosen F-bomb you’re allowed in a PG-13 movie. This is an intense, frightening, well-made, and surprisingly fun little movie. Kids around 12 or 13 and older will be fine watching it.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (2016)  27%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material.Viewers around 9 or 10 will probably be fine watching this sequel to the 2002 surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding, although I’m not sure why they’d want to do that. The wacky Portokalos family is back in all its overbearing, obnoxious glory. And yes, there is indeed another big, fat, Greek wedding. This time, Toula (writer and star Nia Vardalos) must help orchestrate the event when it turns out that her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) never were married officially 50 years ago in Greece because the priest didn’t sign the certificate. Madcap hilarity (and lots of Windex spritzing) ensue. The only possibly offensive part of this movie is the thoroughly inappropriate sex talk from Toula’s outspoken Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). She also buys Toula a racy, red negligee to help her spice things up with Ian (John Corbett), the WASPy dude she married in the first film.Midnight Special (2016)  83%Rating: PG-13, for some violence and action.Mature tweens and older will probably be fine watching this sci-fi thriller from indie auteur Jeff Nichols (Take Shelter, Mud), which reunites him with the great Michael Shannon. This time, Shannon plays the father of a young boy (Jaeden Lieberher) whose mysterious powers make him a prophet for some and a target for others. Father and son go on the run with the help of an old friend (Joel Edgerton) as they try to elude both the religious cult to which they’d belonged and federal authorities. There’s great tension throughout as well as some startling special effects, including chunks of a satellite raining down on a gas station. The boy’s eyes beam a bright light at various points, which may be frightening for younger viewers to see, and he’s in constant danger. There’s also a bit of gunfire. But it’s a powerfully written and acted story about a father-son bond, sacrifice, and love.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"SDCC, Extras, TV, Company, Holiday, FX, Tomatazos, stoner, Avengers, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/24111828/Shallows-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-independence-day-resurgence-and-the-shallows"},{"id":"47508909042562","title":"How Family-Friendly is Warcraft?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is Warcraft?by Christy Lemire | June 10, 2016 |  CommentsThe wildly popular video game franchise Warcraft comes to the big screen this weekend, but is it too violent for the little ones?&nbsp;Read on for Christy’s thoughts on that, as well as her assessment of an animated Disney treat on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Warcraft (2016)  28%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence.The big-screen version of the Warcraft video game is a giant, noisy, computer-generated extravaganza crammed with massive battles between hulking orcs and sword-wielding knights. If that’s your thing, have at it. But if you’ve never played the game before, you’re likely to be confused (as I was), because it’s often difficult to tell who’s doing what to whom. The violence is pummeling and relentless, full of fighting, shooting and stabbing, but it’s also rather fake-looking and cartoonish.

I brought my movie-savvy, 6 ½-year-old son with me to the screening and he didn’t find anything frightening; actually, he was quite bored and squirming the whole time. I’d say this is fine for kids around age 10-11 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Zootopia (2016)  98%Rating: PG, for some thematic elements, rude humor and action.Kids around age 6 and older will be just fine watching this extremely timely animated Disney movie. It’s a smart, clever allegory about prejudice and race relations. But before you cringe at the prospect of a heavy-handed, preachy tale, just know that Zootopia&nbsp;handles some tricky, emotional issues with great deftness, humor and honesty. Basically, it suggests that we’re all a little racist, whether or not we think we are, and acknowledging as much is the first step to true understanding and harmony. Heavy stuff potentially, but it’s packaged in the context of a lively and thriving urban center called Zootopia, full of adorable creatures – predators and prey alike – who’ve found a way to co-exist peacefully. Ginnifer Goodwin provides the voice of a plucky bunny named Judy Hopps, the first of her species to join the city’s police force. She teams up with an unlikely ally – sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) – a con artist who helps her investigate a series of attacks in which predators are suddenly turning savage, which breeds rampant mistrust. Kids will delight in the furry animals, colorful settings and charming details, but might feel a little frightened during the brief moments when some of the animals lose control.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"boxing, of, TV, festivals, twilight, Star, DC, south, winner, globes, Walt, 93rd, Brie, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10112428/Warcraft-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-is-warcraft"},{"id":"47508909050760","title":"How Family-Friendly are Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mother’s Day, and The Meddler?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly are Ratchet &amp; Clank, Mother's Day, and The Meddler?by Christy Lemire | April 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy goes over a new video game adaptation, Garry Marshall’s latest holiday-based ensemble movie, and a solid comedy that opened last week. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)  21%Rating: PG, for action and some rude humor.This animated family comedy is based on the sci-fi video game of the same name about the adventures of a cat-like creature named Ratchet, who’s a mechanic, and Clank, his robot friend. The two team up with a group of Galactic Rangers to stop the villainous Chairman Drek (voiced by Paul Giamatti) from blowing up various planets for his own nefarious purposes. John Goodman, Rosario Dawson, Sylvester Stallone, and Bella Thorne are also among the starry voice cast. This movie is pretty harmless but it’s also not very good. The jokes are flat, the antics are noisy and the overall tone is annoyingly cheeky. As for whether it’s appropriate for your kids, though, there’s a bit of action violence but it’s never scary. There is some weaponry and we see a few explosions, but it’s cartoonish in every sense of the word. I brought my 6 ½-year-old son to a screening and nothing bothered him. If your kids are begging to see Ratchet &amp; Clank, it’ll be fine for around ages 6 or 7 and older.Mother's Day (2016)  8%Rating: PG-13, for language and suggestive material.This is the latest holiday-based comedy from director Garry Marshall, who previously gave us Valentine’s Day&nbsp;and New Year’s Eve. Once again, a large, A-list cast (Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson, Jason Sudeikis) comes together in several intertwined storylines, all of which are meant to celebrate the joys and challenges of motherhood. There is language scattered throughout, including the one F-bomb you get in a PG-13 movie, which Aniston gets to drop. There’s a running bit in which a couple of racist parents from Texas (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) make inappropriate comments about their daughter’s Indian husband. But while the content is mostly harmless, it’s also terrible. There’s not a single authentic moment in the entire movie — which, at a couple minutes under two hours, feels like a massive slog. Avoid, regardless of age.The Meddler (2016)  85%Rating: PG-13, for brief drug material.I wanted to play catch-up with this one because I missed it last week, and it’s a far preferable movie to take your mom to than Mother’s Day. Susan Sarandon stars as Marnie, a widow who moves from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be near her daughter (Rose Byrne), who’s a television writer. Marnie calls and texts her daughter incessantly and shows up at her house unannounced, but she also insinuates herself in the lives of people she barely knows. She means well, but she’s also extremely needy and clingy. There’s some language here and some grown-up talk about death and grief during therapy sessions. There’s also one scene in which Marnie eats a bag full of marijuana to hide it from a security guard and goes on a hallucinatory trip while wandering around an outdoor mall. But this is a fine movie for tweens and older to see, with some nice performances.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Ride Along 2 (2016)  14%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence, sexual content, language and some drug material.The sequel to the surprise 2014 hit Ride Along reunites stars Kevin Hart and Ice Cube for more mismatched buddy-cop antics. It’s essentially the same movie all over again — Hart chatters, Cube glowers — but this time, Hart’s character really is a probationary police officer, and not just a wannabe. Still, he manages to mess things up with his unstoppable enthusiasm and half-baked notions of detective work. He follows his soon-to-be brother-in-law from Atlanta to Miami to stop a villainous shipping magnate (Benjamin Bratt) from doing something villainous. Shootouts, explosions and copious amounts of South Beach booty shaking ensue. There’s also some language and sexually suggestive material. If you must watch this, it’s probably OK for mature tweens to watch, too.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"language, cats, remakes, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/29111620/Ratchet-Clank-PG.jpg","slug":"how-family-friendly-are-ratchet-clank-mothers-day-and-the-meddler"},{"id":"47508909052809","title":"How Family-Friendly is The Huntsman: Winter’s War?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})How Family-Friendly is The Huntsman: Winter's War?by Christy Lemire | April 22, 2016 |  CommentsThe big movie this week is the prequel/sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman, and Christy lets us know if there are any fantastical images in it that might frighten the wee ones. Also on video, she covers a poorly received animated film from earlier this year and an underseen gem from across the pond. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Huntsman: Winter's War (2016)  19%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy action violence and some sensuality.This sorta-prequel, sorta-sequel, sorta-spinoff to 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman&nbsp;is visually lush but the script is a mess. It’s essentially a really angry version of Frozen, starring Charlize Theron and Emily Blunt as wicked royal sisters dueling for power. Blunt’s character, Freya, discovers she can shoot ice from her fingertips in a fit of rage and exiles herself to the snowy mountains where she builds her own kingdom and forms her own army. She rounds up and trains child soldiers for battle and explicitly instructs them not to fall in love. But two of them (Chris Hemsworth and Jessica Chastain) — her two brightest, actually — grow up and do just that. (There are two brief love scenes — one in a hot tub, another in the forest — which suggest they have sex, but you don’t see anything.) Winter’s War&nbsp;is also about a quest to recover that famous mirror and, like the original film, features various, strange forest creatures and digitally rendered dwarfs. Much of the combat is rather intense, and there’s a horned, roaring goblin who might be seriously frightening for younger kids. The special effects are quite dazzling but they also result in images that might be too scary, especially during the climactic showdown between the two sisters. Probably fine for kids around 9 or 10 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Norm of the North (2016)  7%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor and action.Critics weren’t kind to this animated family comedy when it came out earlier this year. It barely hovered above the ground at 8 percent on the Tomatometer and stayed there, despite its theoretically worthwhile ecological message. It’s about a chatty, wacky polar bear (voiced by Rob Schneider) who travels to New York City to stop a real estate developer from building luxury condos near his Arctic home. Along for the ride is a trio of adorable, Minion-esque lemmings. Madcap fish-out-of-water antics and fart jokes ensue. This is probably fine (and best-suited, really) for the youngest children in your house. Maybe if you’re desperate, you can put it on to occupy your kids while you’re folding laundry or making dinner — but there are a million other preferable options.The Lady In The Van (2015)  89%Rating: PG-13, for a brief unsettling image.Maggie Smith is adorably cantankerous in this true story of a homeless woman who parked her van in the driveway of a playwright’s London home and didn’t leave for 15 years. The Lady in the Van&nbsp;is based on Alan Bennett’s play of the same name, inspired by his real-life experience with a mysterious woman who demanded that people address her exclusively as Miss Shepherd. Nicholas Hytner’s film has plenty of hard-earned lessons about tolerance, generosity and kindness. It features several characters who are repulsed by the sight and smell of Miss Shepherd but eventually find a soft spot in their hearts for her. But it also includes — spoiler alert — the discovery of her dead body inside the van toward the end; it’s a quiet, peaceful image, but it’s apparently the reason for the film’s PG-13 rating. The movie has a nice message, though, and should be fine for older kids and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"dceu, impossible, Arrangement, The, unscripted, sports, Pop, serial, Talk, Rocky, Logo, casting","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/21220528/Huntsman-PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-the-huntsman-winters-war"},{"id":"47508910506897","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Gods of Egypt and Eddie the Eagle?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Gods of Egypt and Eddie the Eagle?by Christy Lemire | February 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at a special effects-driven mythological tale and a lighthearted, inspirational true story. Then, on home video, she revisits one of Pixar’s two films from 2015 and an American remake of an Argentine Oscar-winner. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Gods Of Egypt (2016)  15%Rating: PG-13, for fantasy violence and action, and some sexuality.This is a crazy, cheesy, over-the-top mish-mosh of history, mythology, and sci-fi fantasy. It’s basically about Egyptian gods (played by actors who are either Scottish, Australian or Danish) turning into giant, metallic flying creatures that battle each other in the sky. There’s a ton of carnage and destruction, all of which is rendered in hilariously terrible 3-D special effects. One character gets his eyes plucked out of his face. Another takes a lengthy trip to the underworld, where some fellow travelers find themselves graphically obliterated if they don’t have anything valuable to secure their passage to eternal peace. There’s also a brief sex scene with partial nudity between Gerard Butler’s character, the power-hungry Set, and his mistress. This is super-violent and overlong but also just bad. Bad in a fun way quite often, but still — bad. If for some reason you feel compelled to see it, though, it’s probably OK for young teens and older.Eddie The Eagle (2016)  82%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material, partial nudity and smoking.The unlikely athletic prowess of Michael “Eddie” Edwards provides the inspiration for this feel-good, formulaic story. Edwards competed in the 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary as the first British ski jumper since the 1920s. What he lacked in natural physical ability he made up for in fearlessness and heart. It’s a pretty harmless story for the whole family for the most part, except for a couple of racy scenes. One features Eddie’s reluctant coach, a former American ski jumping great (Hugh Jackman), comparing the dynamics of takeoff to having sex with Bo Derek, complete with fake orgasm. The other scene takes place in a sauna where a bunch of hunky, Scandinavian ski jumpers are unwinding in little more than skimpy towels. Also, Jackman’s character smokes and sips from a flask pretty much non-stop. (It’s shorthand to indicate how rebellious he is.) But the movie also has some worthwhile messages about perseverance, self-confidence and drive. I brought my 6-year-old son and he enjoyed Eddie’s slapsticky antics (he falls a lot, from various heights). Probably OK for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur (2015)  76%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for peril action and thematic elements.This stunningly beautiful animated adventure from Disney’s Pixar Animation is probably OK for most kids in your family, even though it has a pervasive sense of old-school peril reminiscent of Bambi or Dumbo. In this prehistoric twist on the traditional boy-and-his-dog tale, a young dinosaur named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) reluctantly befriends the feral boy (Jack Bright) who’d been stealing food from his family’s farm. The two repeatedly find themselves in serious danger. Arlo becomes separated from his family and loses his way home in the treacherous wilderness. There are raging storms, predatory pterodactyls and vicious cattle rustlers to survive as well as a dramatic parental loss early in the film, which already was devastating. I brought my 6-year-old son to see this and we both cried in different spots. But we were also dazzled by the movie’s visual wonder — it has such a high-tech, photorealistic beauty, you’ll swear you’re looking at real water, trees and mountains — as well as its touching, unlikely friendship.Secret in Their Eyes (2015)  39%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving disturbing violent content, language and some sexual references.Mature young teens and older are probably the suitable audience for this star-studded thriller. Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Nicole Kidman share the screen in an English-language remake of Argentina’s El secreto de sus ojos, winner of the Academy Award for best foreign-language film in 2010. It follows a group of investigators and close friends still reeling from the brutal rape and murder 13 years earlier of Roberts’ character’s daughter, and it jumps back and forth in time as it reveals clues and twists. We see the young woman’s body — soaked in bleach and tossed in a Dumpster — as well as her mother’s anguish at the discovery. We also see montages of partially obscured images from the attack itself. There’s some disturbing imagery here as well as some fatal shootings.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"BBC, The, Trivia","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/26105952/EddieTheEaglePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-gods-of-egypt-and-eddie-the-eagle"},{"id":"47508910515094","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The 5th Wave and The Boy?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The 5th Wave and The Boy?by Christy Lemire | January 22, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the latest YA novel adaptation and a horror movie centered around a creepy doll, plus a bubbly music movie, a harrowing survival story, and a sweet comedy on DVD. Read on for the list.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The 5th Wave (2016)  15%Rating: PG-13, for violence and destruction, some sci-fi thematic elements, language and brief teen partying.This is yet another movie based on yet another Young Adult novel. But the way it trots out every trope of the genre, it plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof. There’s been an apocalypse (this time aliens are to blame). There’s a plucky teenage girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) who dares to think for herself and fight back. There are two hunky young men (Nick Robinson and Alex Roe) who are competing for her affections. There are untrustworthy adults played by serious actors (Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello). There are kids being trained as soldiers. And eventually there’s a mad dash through maze-like hallways. It’s all there. Also because it’s possibly the end of the world, there’s general panic, violence, death and destruction. Kids get sent into battle and must pick off their enemies in hails of gunfire (and some of them get shot, as well). There’s also some language including one F-bomb and a kegger during happier times at the film’s start. This may not be very good but it is very intense, and probably best suited for viewers around 13 and older.The Boy (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for violence and terror, and for some thematic material.A young American woman finds that the 8-year-old boy she’s been hired to nanny at an imposing estate in the English countryside is actually a china doll, whom his parents treat like a living, breathing child. It should be a super-creepy premise but, in execution, The Boy&nbsp;is too silly to take seriously — yet not knowingly over-the-top enough to serve as a guilty pleasure. Lauren Cohan of The Walking Dead&nbsp;stars as the nanny, who’s skeptical about the toy until her clothes start going missing and she hears a child’s giggling and sobs in the hallways. There’s some potentially unsettling stuff here in terms of what happened to the couple’s actual 8-year-old son, and the climactic showdown is violent and bloody. Probably OK for viewers around 12 or 13 and up.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Jem and the Holograms (2015)  22%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for thematic material including reckless behavior, brief suggestive content and some language.If you’ve got a girl in your house between the ages of 8 and 12, they will love this. Tweens and older are the perfect age for this live-action movie based on the 1980s cartoon series about the adventures of an all-girl rock band. Shy singer-songwriter Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) becomes a viral Internet sensation when her younger sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott), posts a video of her performing online. She gets whisked away to Los Angeles for a record deal but insists on bringing not just Kimber but also her two foster sisters. But while she’s there, she also must follow a series of clues her late father left behind for her in the form of hologram images stored inside a robot. As you might have figured out, there’s a lot going on here — and the movie is all of two hours long — so really little kids might be lost. There’s also a bit of minor language and a few scenes of nighttime trespassing. And at one point, the band’s hunky handler (Ryan Guzman) emerges from the shower in nothing but a towel — but that’s for the moms’ enjoyment.Everest (2015)  73%Rating: PG-13, for intense peril and disturbing images.The moral of the story is: Don’t climb Mt. Everest. You won’t make it to the top. And if you do, you probably won’t make it back down. And even if you do make it back down, you’ll probably have frostbite. The visuals are spectacular, though; theatrically, it was available in IMAX 3-D, and was definitely worth the extra cost. An all-star cast including Jason Clarke, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal and Josh Brolin brave the elements in this harrowing recreation of a real-life, ill-fated trek up the mountain in 1996. Keira Knightley and Robin Wright are among the women waiting and worrying for them back home. The characters struggle and suffer in disturbing ways, and not everyone makes it out alive. Amid the striking imagery, director Baltasar Kormakur also shows us dead, frozen bodies in the snow. My son (who was almost 6 at the time) was curious about Everest, though, so I brought him with me to a screening and he did fine. This should be suitable for older kids and up.The Intern (2015)  59%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive content and brief strong language.This week, Robert De Niro is in theaters as Dirty Grandpa. But last year, he played a much sweeter guy: Ben Whittaker, a 70-year-old widower and retiree who takes an internship at a burgeoning fashion website to feel useful again. He’s assigned to work with the site’s founder, Jules Ostin (Anne Hathaway), an impatient, workaholic wife and mom. Magically, they make each other’s lives better — and they do it all in great clothes within impeccably decorated homes and offices. (This is a Nancy Meyers movie, after all.) There’s a bit of language here and a mature subplot involving Jules’ husband (Anders Holm). Otherwise, this movie is fine for tweens and older. You’ll just have to explain to them that nobody actually lives this way in Brooklyn.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"women, marvel, 2017, show, sequels, books, lee","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/22151020/5thWavePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-5th-wave-and-the-boy"},{"id":"47508910507922","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Race?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Race?by Christy Lemire | February 19, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at the inspirational true story of Olympian Jesse Owens, who faced immense obstacles on his way to winning four gold medals at the 1936 Summer Games in Berlin. Also, on video, she looks at the real life story of the Chilean miners who were trapped underground in 2010. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Race (2016)  62%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and language.Prolific Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens is the subject of this well-intentioned sports biopic. Stephan James stars as the legendary track and field athlete who was part of the controversial decision by the American team to take part in the Nazi-run 1936 Summer Games. Given the time period and the racially charged setting, you can expect lots of language and slurs, which may be uncomfortable for young viewers to hear — but it also may provide a teaching moment about history and racial struggles. (The title is a double entendre, get it?) The film features Jews being forced onto transport vehicles and having their businesses vandalized. It also includes some sexual humor and shows Owens cheating on the mother of his child. But there are also many worthwhile themes here for kids to learn about and discuss: perseverance, courage and understanding. This is probably fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The 33 (2015)  48%Rating: PG-13, for a disaster sequence and some language.Here’s another drama based on a real-life events, which is probably suitable for kids around 8 or 9 and older. It’s about the 33 Chilean men who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010 when the gold mine where they worked collapsed. As they fight to survive, the government tries to rescue them and their family members struggle to maintain hope. Antonio Banderas, Lou Diamond Phillips, Rodrigo Santoro, and Juliette Binoche are among the film’s stars. Much of the imagery of the actual collapse is intense as giant chunks of rock come tumbling down around the miners, giving them little room to run for safety. It’s dark and cramped in there, and the men get edgy with each other as they face starvation and possible death. (Spoiler: They all make it out alive, hence the title.) Above ground, there’s a subplot involving one of the miners who has both a wife and a mistress, with each woman insisting he loves her best. But The 33&nbsp;also is a story of hope, faith, teamwork, and perseverance, which could make it worthwhile for the younger members of your family to watch.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"drama, Paramount, TCA, IFC, Rey, NBC, Video, Country, of, Film, new, casting, ID, Rom-Com, docudrama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/19114244/RacePG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-race"},{"id":"47508910498701","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2?by Christy Lemire | March 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy reports back on a superhero spectacle that happens to be one of the most anticipated films of the year, as well as a sequel to a surprise hit from 2002 and, on DVD, the final chapter of the Hunger Games franchise. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)  29%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action throughout, and some sensuality.Director Zack Snyder’s follow-up to his 2013 film Man of Steel&nbsp;finds Superman (Henry Cavill) battling Batman (Ben Affleck) basically for the amusement of crazed industrialist Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). Mass urban destruction ensues. Theoretically, there’s more to it than that, and it involves Batman’s fear that Superman is dangerous following the climactic events of the previous movie. But really, any semblance of plot is just a thin excuse to set up a pantheon of films based on DC Comics characters, similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe that’s firmly in place. All your usual action-movie elements are here: brutal fistfights, perilous car chases, enormous explosions and deadly gunfire. As in so many other Batman films, BvS&nbsp;replays the moment when young Bruce Wayne watches his parents get shot to death during a robbery outside a movie theater. Plus — without spoiling anything — a new monster arrives on the scene who’s seemingly indestructible. There’s also a disturbing dream sequence. It’s all very noisy and numbing. It’s CGI-inflated comic-book violence. But it’s probably OK for mature tweens and older.My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 (2016)  27%Rating: PG-13, for some suggestive material.The sequel to the 2002 surprise smash hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding&nbsp;revisits the wacky Portokalos family in all their overbearing, obnoxious glory. And yes, there is indeed another big, fat, Greek wedding. This time, Toula (writer and star Nia Vardalos) must help orchestrate the event when it turns out that her parents (Michael Constantine and Lainie Kazan) never were married officially 50 years ago in Greece because the priest didn’t sign the certificate. Madcap hilarity (and lots of Windex spritzing) ensue. The only possibly offensive part of this movie is the thoroughly inappropriate sex talk from Toula’s outspoken Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin). She also buys Toula a racy, red negligee to help her spice things up with Ian (John Corbett), the WASPy dude she married in the first film. But for the most part, this is probably fine for kids around age 9 or 10 and up. (Although I brought my movie-savvy 6 ½-year-old with me to the screening and he complained afterward that it gave him a headache.)NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)  69%Rating: PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for some thematic material.The final Hunger Games&nbsp;film comes with all the massive carnage and destruction you’ve come to expect from the series — and from any movie within the post-apocalyptic, dystopian-future Young Adult genre. So if you’ve seen any of the three previous films, you know what’s in store for you. There is the threat of all-out war in Panem. Additionally, diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his gamesmakers have scattered deadly obstacles — or pods — throughout the capitol to keep Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow rebels from storming in and killing him. These are devastating, ranging from a giant, ferocious wave of black ooze to an army of ravenous, reptilian lizard mutts in the sewers. (The latter scene had me curled up in a ball, watching through splayed fingers.) There’s also a disturbing sequence involving the death of many young children. This is just extremely violent for a PG-13 movie. It’s probably OK for mature, older tweens and up — but if your kids are fans of the book, they know what’s in the movie, and they’ll probably want to see it all unfold for themselves.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Lucasfilm, adaptation, children's, on, poppins, PlayStation, Shondaland, Teen, awards, Bros., Fantasy, streaming, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/24154305/BatmanVSupermanPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-and-my-big-fat-greek-wedding-2"},{"id":"47508910513045","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Kung Fu Panda 3 and The Finest Hours?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Kung Fu Panda 3 and The Finest Hours?by Christy Lemire | January 29, 2016 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the third installment of DreamWorks’ hit franchise&nbsp;and a real life high seas rescue story, plus a monster-filled adventure for kids on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016)  87%Rating: PG, for martial arts action and some mild rude humor.Roly-poly panda Po (voiced by Jack Black) is back for his third animated adventure, and this time the student becomes the teacher. Po must find his inner dragon master — and show other creatures how to find the untapped warrior within himself or herself. He teams up with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston), the noodle-making goose who raised him (James Hong) and all their friends (Seth Rogen, David Cross, Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu and Dustin Hoffman) to defeat an evil spirit warrior (J.K. Simmons) who’s stealing the chi of kung fu masters across China. It’s a gorgeous film filled with lively battles scenes as well as moments of genuine emotion. The combat scenes aren’t scary, though; they’re actually quite playful. After all, this is a movie in which a panda uses dumplings as weapons. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and there’s nothing here that was scary or troubling. Fine for all ages, but it might be a bit intense for the littlest kids, especially those who haven’t seen a movie in a theater very often if at all. There’s quite a lot going on here visually.The Finest Hours (2016)  63%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of peril.Based on the true story of an oil tanker that got sheared in half during a powerful blizzard off the coast of Cape Cod in 1952, and the plucky Coast Guard team that dared brave the elements to rescue the men aboard. Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Holliday Grainger are among the large ensemble cast. There are many intense moments here, with both the tanker’s crew and the Coast Guard team in constant danger of death. The waves are massive, the winds are punishing and the downpour is incessant. And as the tanker takes on more water, it looks unlikely that anyone on board will survive. (Given that this is a Disney movie, though, you can guess what happens). This is an extremely earnest and old-fashioned movie, one that’s probably best suited for tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%Rating: PG, for scary and intense creature action and images, and for some rude humor.Speaking of Jack Black, he also stars in this live-action horror comedy that brings the Goosebumps books to life. The new kid in town, Zach (Dylan Minnette), finds out that his reclusive, next-door neighbor is actually the author R.L. Stine (Black). During an ill-fated adventure with Stine’s sheltered teenage daughter (Odeya Rush), sealed manuscripts of Stine’s work burst open and the characters leap out to wreak havoc on a peaceful, small town. Much of the imagery is silly and playful – an army of adorable yard gnomes causing chaos, for example. But some might be too scary for the littlest kids in your family – a giant preying mantis creating mass destruction, or a creepy ventriloquist’s dummy spewing venomous threats. (The latter freaked me out, that’s for sure.) Goosebumps is actually a lot of fun for the adults watching, and it feels like a throwback to ‘80s films of this ilk like Gremlins, in which actual danger was in store for the characters. This is probably fine for kids around 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"boxoffice, Plus, Kimmy, blockbuster, emmy, Spring, Bowl, in, shows, Musical, DGA, finale, politics, casting, golden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/29112147/KungFuPanda3PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-kung-fu-panda-3-and-the-finest-hours"},{"id":"47508911575965","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 and Secret in Their Eyes?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 and Secret in Their Eyes?by Christy Lemire | November 20, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy&nbsp;breaks down the much-anticipated final chapter of the&nbsp;Hunger Games series, a star-studded remake of an Oscar-winning Argentinean thriller, and a coming-of-age drama from Turkey, as well as Guy Ritchie’s zippy spy movie on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)  69%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, and for some thematic material.It’s the final movie in the Hunger Games&nbsp;series — no, really, it is. So if you’ve seen any of the three previous films — or any movie within the post-apocalyptic, dystopian-future Young Adult genre — you know what’s in store for you. The second half of the Mockingjay&nbsp;finale features massive amounts of carnage and destruction, as well as the constant threat of all-out war. Additionally, diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his gamesmakers have scattered deadly obstacles — or pods — throughout Panem’s capitol to keep Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her fellow rebels from storming in and killing him.

It follows a group of investigators and close friends still reeling from the brutal rape and murder 13 years earlier of Roberts’ character’s daughter, and it jumps back and forth in time as it reveals clues and twists. We see the young woman’s body — soaked in bleach and tossed in a Dumpster — as well as her mother’s anguish at the discovery. We also see montages of partially obscured images from the attack itself. There’s some disturbing imagery here as well as some fatal shootings. I’d say this is probably appropriate for mature young teens and older.Mustang (2015)  97%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for mature thematic material, sexual content and a rude gesture.A great choice for the older girls in your house, the debut film from Turkish-French director Deniz Gamze Erguven provides an intimate look at five sisters who become imprisoned in their own home. A neighbor in their small, coastal village sees them romping on the shores of the Black Sea on the last day of school and misinterprets their behavior as being inappropriately sexual. Embarrassed and enraged, their grandmother and uncle take away their belongings, lock them inside and make plans to marry them off, one by one. You could think of it as a Turkish version of Sofia Coppola’s haunting 1999 debut The Virgin Suicides, but Mustang&nbsp;has its own sense of melancholy as well as a rebellious spirit. There’s some frank talk in here about virginity and ensuring that the girls have maintained theirs — or not, on their wedding night, once the older sisters enter into their arranged marriages. And at one point, one of the sisters playfully flips the bird to another at the dinner table. But it’s also about young women who are loyal and brave as they assert their identities in the face of patriarchal oppression. Fine for tweens and up (who don’t mind reading subtitles).NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)  68%Rating: PG-13, for action violence, some suggestive content, and partial nudity.Guy Ritchie’s big-screen version of the 1960s TV spy series is a great example of what the British director does so well through his signature, kinetic style. It’s slick and sexy, fizzy and funny. But it can also be quite violent — although less so than his best films, the R-rated Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch,&nbsp;and RocknRolla. You don’t need to know a thing about the television show (I certainly didn’t) to have a good time here. Henry Cavill stars as a suave, American CIA agent sent on a mission to East Berlin during the Cold War to rescue a beautiful mechanic (Alicia Vikander) whose estranged father is a world-renowned rocket scientist working on a nuclear bomb. Also on the hunt for her is a Russian KGB agent (Armie Hammer), who’s as highly skilled as Cavill’s character but burdened with a beast of a temper. Multiple shootouts, car chases and fistfights ensue, including one in a men’s bathroom between the two spies. Characters are fatally shot but there’s no blood. There’s also a bit of torture, with one supporting character dying in spectacularly grisly fashion — but we see it from a distance, so there’s sort of a detachment to how disturbing it is, and it’s played for laughs. If sex is what you’re worried about, Cavill’s character effortlessly beds the hotel’s front desk clerk, whom we see afterward from behind in nothing but a pair of lacy panties. And there’s a playfully flirty fight between Hammer and a drunk Vikander that results in a trashed hotel room. This is probably OK for tweens and older.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"demand, ESPN, football, movie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20132640/HungerGamesMockingjay21.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-and-secret-in-their-eyes"},{"id":"47508911589283","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Pan?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Is Pan?by Christy Lemire | October 9, 2015 |  CommentsJust one movie out this week you might want to share with your kids, and that movie is Joe Wright’s origin story, Pan. Christy lets us know how harrowing Peter’s adventures are, whether or not there are any frightening elements for the littlest of your little ones, and whether or not it’s worth seeing at all.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Pan (2015)  27%Rating: PG, for fantasy action violence, language and some thematic material.Director Joe Wright’s film is a Peter Pan origin story – because every classic children’s character has to have an origin story these days, right? But despite the elaborate, fanciful imagery, Pan is actually a slog. Levi Miller stars as young Peter, whose mother (Amanda Seyfried) leaves him at the doorstep of a London orphanage at the film’s start. Years later, during World War II, he’s stuck in this squalid place with dozens of other boys – until the night Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) swoops by on his flying pirate ship to scoop them all up to do his bidding. The story has something to do with the kids being forced to work as miners, digging for pixie dust to keep Blackbeard eternally young. But Peter also is The Chosen One spoken of in a prophecy, so he’s got bigger things in store. He also has to meet up with the dude who will become Captain Hook (Garrett Hedlund, doing a Harrison Ford impression circa 1980) and Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara), whose tribe he must free. It’s very complicated and not much fun. Some of the early orphanage imagery is bleak, but once we’re in Neverland, Blackbeard and his cronies aren’t terribly enjoyable to look at, either. Your kids also may be confused about why everyone sings Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” upon Blackbeard’s initial appearance on screen. (My 6-year-old was.) Anyway, avoid.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"best, Awards, Awards, and, universal, FX, singing, french, golden, HBO, book, joker, satire","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PanParental.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-is-pan"},{"id":"47508911571868","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Good Dinosaur and Creed?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Good Dinosaur and Creed?by Christy Lemire | November 25, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy gives us a look at Pixar’s latest CGI wonder and Sylvester Stallone’s&nbsp;Rocky franchise reboot, as well as a stop-motion animated gem on DVD. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur (2015)  76%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for peril action and thematic elements.The latest film from Disney’s Pixar Animation has a high-tech, photorealistic beauty about it – you’ll swear you’re looking at real water, trees and mountains – but it also features old-school Disney peril that’s reminiscent of Bambi&nbsp;and Dumbo. In this prehistoric twist on the traditional boy-and-his-dog story, a young dinosaur named Arlo (voiced by Raymond Ochoa) reluctantly befriends the feral boy (Jack Bright) who’d been stealing food from his family’s farm. The two repeatedly find themselves in serious danger. Arlo becomes separated from his family and loses his way home in the treacherous wilderness. There are raging storms, predatory pterodactyls and vicious cattle rustlers to survive as well as dramatic parental loss early in the film, which already was devastating. The film has plenty of visual wonder and a touching, unlikely friendship, but also a pervasive sense of loneliness and fear. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and we both cried in different spots. I’d say this is OK for most kids in your family, but the sensitive ones may have trouble with the elements of parental separation.Creed (2015)  95%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for violence, language and some sensuality.The seventh Rocky&nbsp;movie finds Apollo Creed’s son, Adonis (a charismatic Michael B. Jordan), traveling to Philadelphia and seeking out an aging Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone, of course) to train him when no one else will. Ryan Coogler’s thrilling, beautifully made film is extremely violent and bloody – it is about boxing, after all – but it also features all the uplift and overcoming-of-odds you’d expect. And it’s got training montages – lots and lots of training montages. Along his journey, Adonis falls for the cool, beautiful musician (Tessa Thompson) who lives in the apartment downstairs from him, and it’s implied that they have sex. There’s also plenty of language and trash talk as Adonis prepares to take on various opponents, as well as serious discussions and imagery involving a health scare. Having said that, I’d say this is fine for mature tweens and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015)  99%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for rude humor.Totally charming, extremely clever and beautifully detailed, as you’d expect from the folks at Aardman Animation. The latest from the studio that brought you Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;and Chicken Run&nbsp;finds a mischievous sheep named Shaun enjoying some unexpected adventures in the big city. When Shaun and his buddies in the flock decide they’re tired of their quiet life, they cook up a scheme to sneak away from the farmer and have a little fun – but naturally, nothing goes as planned. What’s amazing about this movie is that it’s told without a single bit of dialogue – just grunts and noises here and there to indicate thoughts and emotions. There is some danger, though, as Shaun and his pals find themselves the targets of the evil animal control officer, who’s hell-bent on rounding up every creature he can find and throwing them behind bars. But the movie is also about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. The “rude humor” that earned the film a PG rating consists of some fart jokes, but otherwise this film is completely harmless. It’s a great choice for the whole family, especially if you’re looking for something to watch together over the Thanksgiving holiday.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"American, films, Amazon, awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/25133512/GoodDinosaur.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-good-dinosaur-and-creed"},{"id":"47508911578014","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Love the Coopers and The 33?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Love the Coopers and The 33?by Christy Lemire | November 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy looks at an early Christmas-themed ensemble comedy and a based-on-true-events story about a miraculous rescue. Then, on DVD, we’ve got a big blockbuster franchise sequel and a smaller drama about Sherlock Holmes. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Love the Coopers (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, language and some sexuality.It’s your obligatory wacky Christmas comedy, complete with family dysfunction, shopping mall mishaps, a truly awkward dinner and plenty of cutaways to an adorable dog. Matriarch Charlotte Cooper (Diane Keaton) just wants one last perfect Christmas before she and her husband, Sam (John Goodman), announce to the family that they’re separating after 40 years of marriage. But as it turns out from the various supporting characters’ subplots, everyone else’s life is just as much of a mess. There’s some randy and raunchy humor here (including old-lady flatulence) and a bit of language. Charlotte’s sister (Marisa Tomei) gets arrested for shoplifting. A teenage boy frequently makes out in public with his new girlfriend. The littlest girl comes up with a catch phrase that includes a vulgar word for penis. And the eldest member of the family (Alan Arkin) has a dramatic health scare. I’d say this is fine for kids around age 8 and older. I brought my 6-year-old son to the screening and he wasn’t scarred.The 33 (2015)  48%Rating:&nbsp;PG-13, for a disaster sequence and some language.This drama tells the true story of the 33 Chilean men who were trapped underground for 69 days in 2010 when the gold mine where they worked collapsed. It focuses on their fight to survive as well as the government’s efforts to rescue them and their family members’ struggles to maintain hope. Antonio Banderas, Lou Diamond Phillips and Rodrigo Santoro are among the film’s stars, alongside a wildly miscast Juliette Binoche as an empanada peddler. Much of the imagery of the actual collapse is intense, as giant chunks of rock come tumbling down around the miners, giving them little room to run for safety. It’s dark and cramped in there, and the men get edgy with each other as they face starvation and possible death. (Spoiler: They all make it out alive, hence the title.) Above ground, there’s a subplot involving one of the miners who has both a wife and a mistress, with each woman insisting he loves her best. But The 33&nbsp;is also a story of hope, faith, teamwork and perseverance, so it could be worthwhile for the younger members of your family to watch for that reason. This is probably fine for kids around 8 or 9 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Terminator Genisys (2015)  27%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout, partial nudity and brief strong language.Perhaps you’ve heard of the Terminator franchise. It’s been around for a while. So if you’ve seen any of the four previous films — or you’re generally familiar with Arnold Schwarzenegger’s action oeuvre — then you should have a pretty good idea of what’s in store here. Massive amounts of gunfire, crushing fistfights, dangerous chases, post-apocalyptic terror, explosions and some brief (and chastely shot) nudity during the time-travel segments. Oh, and of course, the constant threat of the world ending. This time, Schwarzenegger returns to the role that made him a superstar in 1984’s original Terminator. But because of some time-travel glitches, he’s the good guy from the get-go. In the year 2029, rebellion leader John Connor (Jason Clarke) sends his right-hand man, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney), back in time to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke). But Schwarzenegger’s Terminator already is there, functioning as a father figure she affectionately calls Pops. Besides the wall-to-wall violence, the general tone of Alan Taylor’s film is quite dark, and the overlapping time-travel streams can get confusing. Plus, at two hours, it could be too long for young viewers. This is probably OK for kids around age 12 and older — but the first two Terminator&nbsp;movies are better choices.Mr. Holmes (2015)  88%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, some disturbing images and incidental smoking.This is a different take on the legacy of Sherlock Holmes, focusing on his later years in his remote farmhouse by the sea. Director Bill Condon’s film finds the world-famous detective (Ian McKellen), at age 93, struggling to recall the details of the case that ended up being his last. He has just returned from post-World War II Japan with a plant whose healing powers he hopes will restore his mental acuity, but he continues to deteriorate. Also living in the house are Holmes’ housekeeper (Laura Linney) and her young son (Milo Parker). Holmes reflects upon this final investigation, which involved the makings of a murder plot. While in Japan, he visited the remnants of Hiroshima and witnessed the devastating impact the bomb had on the city’s survivors. And the boy, whose inquisitive nature makes him a keen companion for Holmes, winds up in serious physical danger when he helps tend to the detective’s prized bees. There’s also just the scary nature of the creeping effects of dementia. It’s rated PG, though, so for the most part it’s fine for kids around age 8 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"joker","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13134047/LoveTheCoopersPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-love-the-coopers-and-the-33"},{"id":"47508911584161","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Jem and the Holograms and The Last Witch Hunter?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Jem and the Holograms and The Last Witch Hunter?by Christy Lemire | October 23, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy talks about the big screen adaptation of a popular 1980s cartoon and a fantasy action/adventure starring Vin Diesel. Then, on video, she also tells us whether or not three of this week’s new releases are appropriate for the little ones. Read on for details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Jem and the Holograms (2015)  22%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for thematic material including reckless behavior, brief suggestive content and some language.This is a live-action movie based on the 1980s cartoon series about the adventures of an all-girl rock band. Shy singer-songwriter Jerrica (Aubrey Peeples) becomes a viral Internet sensation when her younger sister, Kimber (Stefanie Scott), posts a video of her performing online. She gets whisked away to Los Angeles for a record deal but insists on bringing not just Kimber but also her two foster sisters. But while she’s there, she also must follow a series of clues her late father left behind for her in the form of hologram images stored inside a robot. There’s a lot going on here – and the movie is all of two hours long – so really little kids might be lost. But if you’ve got a girl in your house between the ages of 8 and 12, they will love this. There’s a bit of minor language and a few scenes of nighttime trespassing. The band’s hunky handler (Ryan Guzman) emerges from the shower in nothing but a towel (but that’s for the moms in the audience). Fine for young tweens and up.The Last Witch Hunter (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images.It’s boring and confusing and grim and the effects look murky and cheesy. Having said that, if you can figure out what’s going on here, many of the images are super-scary. Vin Diesel stars as a man who’s been cursed with immortality, and who’s been hunting witches for the past 800 years. There’s been a truce between humans and the witches who exist among us, but the most evil being of them all, the Queen Witch, has plans to return and unleash the Black Death upon the planet in a fit of revenge. There is the suggestion that some characters die – or at least they appear to die. There’s some language. But more potentially disturbing is the imagery of the icky witch covered in gooey, oozing glop who unleashes torrents of insects upon New York City. This movie is terrible. But if your kids insist on seeing it, it’s probably OK for young teens and up. I’d steer them toward something else, though.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Jurassic World (2015)  71%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril.This is an extremely violent PG-13 movie. It’s actually kind of amazing that it got a PG-13 rating — it’s right there on the edge of the most you can get away with before earning an R. In keeping with other movies in the Jurassic Park series, people get straight-up eaten here. Or trampled. Or torn to pieces. There’s no other way to phrase it — it’s a movie about dinosaurs run amok at a (supposedly) family-friendly theme park. Thousands flee in terror as dinosaurs stomp and roar and tear their way through the scenery and eateries. The biggest of them all is the genetically engineered Indominus Rex, which stands 50 feet high and contains strands of DNA from various other creatures, making it unstoppable. A couple of kids are in particular danger: A teenager and his younger brother, visiting their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard), who’s a top executive at Jurassic World. Luckily, a tough-guy velociraptor trainer (Chris Pratt) is there to save the day. It’s the biggest hit of the year and No. 3 all-time at the box office, but I still feel like it’s best suited for viewers around 13 and up.Paper Towns (2015)  58%Rating: PG-13, for some language, drinking, sexuality and partial nudity – all involving teens.A sweetly geeky high school senior (Nat Wolff) goes on an all-night adventure with his neighbor from across the street (Cara Delevingne), his one-time, childhood pal who’s now the rebellious, cool girl. The next morning, she has disappeared mysteriously, inspiring him and his two best friends to go on a hunt to find her. Paper Towns is based on the novel by John Green, who also wrote The Fault in Our Stars, so the young-adult crowd probably knows what’s in store. There’s some teen-movie partying, including beer bongs, keg stands and subsequent vomiting. A couple of characters engage in a hot-and-heavy make-out session, and a couple of others ponder the prospect of losing their virginity to each other on prom night. And there’s a bit of language. But this is totally fine for tweens and older. It’s a movie that I really liked — but I would have loved it if I’d seen it at age 13.Z For Zachariah (2015)  78%Rating: PG-13, for a scene of sexuality, partial nudity and brief strong language.This would be a tough sit for most young viewers with its ambiguous premise and languid pacing, but if you have tweens in your family with a taste for bleak, post-apocalyptic dramas, this may work for you. Margot Robbie, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine star as the only survivors for miles around of some sort of nuclear catastrophe. They share a farmhouse nestled in a valley somewhere in the rural South, and a creeping tension grows between them. Director Craig Zobel’s beautifully shot film features some disturbing images of disease and distress as well as mature themes of death and the necessary steps to maintain humanity. The three characters get drunk and frisky one night; there’s also a bit of nudity and the implication that a couple of the characters have had sex. We won’t spoil it by telling you which ones, though.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"dc, TV, Christmas, mockumentary, CW, history, The, news, Guild, show, football, VH1, Reality, IFC, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/JemHologramsPG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-jem-and-the-holograms-and-the-last-witch-hunter"},{"id":"47508911587234","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Goosebumps and Bridge of Spies?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are Goosebumps and Bridge of Spies?by Christy Lemire | October 16, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy give us the lowdown on a horror comedy inspired by the work of author R.L. Stine, a cold war thriller from Steven Spielberg, and on DVD, a George Clooney-powered Disney fantasy adventure. Read on to find out all the details.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;Goosebumps (2015)  78%Rating: PG, for scary and intense creature action and images, and for some rude humor.The Goosebumps books come to life – just in time for Halloween – in this live-action horror comedy. The new kid in town, Zach (Dylan Minnette), finds out that his reclusive, next-door neighbor is actually the author R.L. Stine (Jack Black). During an ill-fated adventure with Stine’s sheltered teenage daughter (Odeya Rush), sealed manuscripts of Stine’s work burst open and the characters leap out to wreak havoc on a peaceful, small town. A lot of the imagery is silly and playful – an army of adorable yard gnomes causing chaos, for example. But much of it might be too scary for the littlest kids in your family – a giant preying mantis creating mass destruction, or a creepy ventriloquist’s dummy spewing venomous threats. (The latter freaked me out, that’s for sure.) But Goosebumps&nbsp;is actually a lot of fun for the adults in the audience, and it feels like a throwback to ‘80s films of this ilk like Gremlins, in which actual danger was in store for the characters. This is probably fine for kids around 8 and older.Bridge of Spies (2015)  90%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for some violence and brief strong language.Steven Spielberg’s Cold War drama is based on the true story of the American attorney (Tom Hanks) who negotiated the release of a U-2 spy plane pilot (Austin Stowell) captured in the Soviet Union in exchange for a Russian spy (Mark Rylance) discovered living in New York. It’s impeccably made, as you would expect from Spielberg, but it’s a slow burn, and the two-plus-hour running time might make it a tough sit for younger viewers. There’s some violence here – a prisoner endures a harsh interrogation, and some people are shot while trying to escape East Berlin. There’s also quite a bit of language and just a general unease that prevails because of U.S.-Soviet tensions. But if older kids in your family are interested in history (and excellent filmmaking), this would be a smart, challenging choice for them. Fine for viewers around 13 and older.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Tomorrowland (2015)  50%Rating: PG,&nbsp;for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril, thematic elements, and language.The section of Disneyland that features the Space Mountain and Star Tours rides inspires this live-action, sci-fi adventure. George Clooney and Britt Robertson star as strangers linked by a mysterious pin that transports them to a magical, futuristic land when they touch it. A robot in the form of a plucky teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy) brings them together in hopes that they’ll be able to save the place from falling apart. Two-time Oscar winner Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) directed from a script he co-wrote with Lost&nbsp;co-creator Damon Lindelof, so the loftier philosophical elements of the script may go over younger viewers’ heads. But the film’s dreamy, central message — do something great with your talents and make the world a better place — couldn’t be clearer. Bad guys are after our heroes in both human and robot form, and many chases and shootouts with laser guns ensue in which characters get disintegrated. And at one point, a truck hits the little girl/robot, but she’s fine. OK for kids around 8 and older.&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, Television, Interview, movies, Century, independent, Studios","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Goosebumps1.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-goosebumps-and-bridge-of-spies"},{"id":"47508911598503","title":"Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Perfect Guy and The Age of Adaline?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How Family-Friendly Are The Perfect Guy and The Age of Adaline?by Christy Lemire | September 11, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Christy takes a look at the psychological thriller starring Sanaa Lathan and Michael Ealy, which is new in theaters, and a sci-fi drama starring Blake Lively, new on DVD.NEW IN THEATERS&nbsp;The Perfect Guy (2015)  18%Rating: PG-13, for violence, menace, sexuality and brief strong language.This romantic thriller is going to be too racy for the younger viewers in the house, even your mature tweens. Sanaa Lathan stars as Leah, a Los Angeles-based lobbyist who seems to have it all: brains, looks, power, a beautiful home in the hills and a handsome longtime boyfriend (Morris Chestnut). But she’s ready to start a family and he isn’t, which drives her into the arms of the charming Carter (Michael Ealy). He seems perfect, hence the title. But he’s actually a super-psycho stalker who beats a stranger to a pulp for a perceived, minor offense right before Leah’s eyes. He also breaks into her house, steals her cat, installs surveillance equipment, hacks into her computer and calls and texts her incessantly. Oh, and he pushes the old lady across the street down a flight of stairs when he realizes she’s onto his antics and causes a deadly car accident for another character. In happier times, Leah and Carter engage in some sloppy bathroom sex at a club. There’s also some language.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;The Age of Adaline (2015)  54%Rating: PG-13, for a suggestive comment.Blake Lively stars in this romantic fantasy as a beautiful woman who stopped aging at 29 after a cosmic car accident. Decades later, she’s been moving around and changing her identity to avoid being discovered — and she’s been reluctant to connect with anyone emotionally. This handsomely made movie also features a couple of major car crashes. It suggests that Adaline has sex with the handsome philanthropist (Michiel Huisman) she allows herself to fall for, but we don’t actually see anything. There’s also a dog death, which might choke you up. (It bothered me). And it features some very mature notions about love and immortality. Still, this is probably fine for tweens and older — especially those with an interest in history or fashion. The statuesque Lively gets to wear some gorgeous period clothes.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Lionsgate, in, Lifetime, festival, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PerfectGuy.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-how-family-friendly-are-the-perfect-guy-and-the-age-of-adaline"},{"id":"47508913404849","title":"Parental Guidance: Is Terminator Genisys Too Dark for Kids?","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Is Terminator Genisys Too Dark for Kids?by Christy Lemire | July 2, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSTerminator Genisys 27%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and gunplay throughout, partial nudity and brief strong language.Well, it’s a Terminator movie.

Read on for more details.NEW ON DVD&nbsp;Little Boy (2015)  24%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic material, including violence.This is a lot more intense, mature and violent than its wholesome marketing might suggest. It’s a faith-based movie that features war footage, a hate crime and racial epithets against a Japanese man, shootings, a major death and a funeral. It’s also terrible, so even if it’s one of the few choices available to you, avoid it if you can. Jakob Salvati stars as a diminutive 8-year-old named Pepper, who’s mercilessly teased by bullies in 1940s small-town California. When his father and only friend (Michael Rapaport) goes off to fight in World War II, Pepper performs a series of charitable acts in hopes of bringing him back at the suggestion of the town priest (Tom Wilkinson).

In this iteration, the story focuses a little bit more on Reed Richards (Miles Teller), but except for Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), none of the rest the characters are particularly well-developed. &nbsp;To be fair, the first half of the film isn’t all that bad (if unoriginal), but it’s after the team gets their powers that the film falls apart. There’s too much exposition about what characters are doing off-screen, instead of actually showing us what those characters do, and iconic villain Doctor Doom ends up being pretty cartoonish in execution. This is also a surprisingly gory movie; once Doom comes into power, we see him embark on a&nbsp;rampant killing spree with a fair amount of blood on screen, making this a movie firmly planted on the more mature end of the PG-13 spectrum. &nbsp;If your kids are begging you to see this movie, distract them with the 2005 version. &nbsp;It’s a better film and a lot more kid-friendly.&nbsp;Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015)  99%Rating: PG, for rude humor.The latest film from Aardman Animation is a sweet and surprisingly smart movie about a mischievous sheep who has an unexpected adventure in the the big city. &nbsp;You may recognize Shaun; he (and his flock) have been featured in a UK TV series for the last few years, and that series is a spinoff that was created after Shaun made his debut in the Wallace &amp; Gromit movie A Close Shave. &nbsp;In his first feature, Shaun gets bored with the daily routine of life on the farm, and comes up with a plan to sneak away from the farmer and take a day off. &nbsp;That leads to an accident that sends the farmer off to the big city, leaving Shaun and his flock to fend for themselves, and chaos ensues. &nbsp;So Shaun and his flock go to the city to find the now-amnesiac farmer, while avoiding the clutches of an animal control officer. &nbsp;The entire story is told without any discernible dialogue so it’s pretty easy for the little kids to follow, but the jokes are smart enough that adults should enjoy the film, too. &nbsp;I’m frankly surprised that this movie didn’t get a G rating; the extent of the “rude humor” is a couple of fart jokes.Ricki And The Flash (2015)  65%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for thematic material, brief drug content, sexuality and language.Meryl Streep plays a never-was rock singer who returns home to the midwest to help her daughter and see her estranged children. &nbsp;There’s a solid supporting cast here, including Kevin Kline as Ricki’s ex-husband, Rick Springfield as Ricki’s guitarist and sometime paramour, and Meryl’s daughter Mamie Gummer as Ricki’s daughter. &nbsp;This is a decent enough movie, but it’s probably not essential Meryl Streep; she’s certainly having fun as a slightly batty rocker, but the movie never dives very deep. &nbsp;Ricki’s now-grown kids feel like she abandoned them to pursue her career, and she hasn’t done much to stay in their lives, but the movie doesn’t evoke all that much drama from Ricki’s decisions. &nbsp;It’s a good bet that younger kids simply won’t be interested this story, and for that matter, it’s hard to imagine many teens will be interested in this one either. &nbsp;But if your budding Streep completist wants to see this film, you’ll want to be aware that Ricki, her ex-husband, and their adult daughter smoke pot in one scene. Ricki and her guitarist talk about past trysts and you see them in bed under sheets, but there’s no on-screen sex scene. &nbsp;And there’s a fair amount of swearing too.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"telelvision, FOX, America, Peek, lord, concert, based, Arrangement, unscripted, USA, Christmas, show, TV, richard, Yoda","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ShaunSheepPG2.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-fantastic-four-shaun-the-sheep-and-ricki-and-the-flash"},{"id":"47508913391531","title":"Parental Guidance: The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Hot Pursuit","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and Hot Pursuitby Christy Lemire | August 14, 2015 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week&nbsp;The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015)  68%Rating: PG-13,&nbsp;for action violence, some suggestive content, and partial nudity.Guy Ritchie’s big-screen version of the 1960s TV spy series is a great example of what the British director does so well through his signature style. It’s slick and sexy, fizzy and funny. But it can also be quite violent – although less so than his best films, the R-rated Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch&nbsp;and RocknRolla. You don’t need to know a thing about the television show (I certainly didn’t) to have a good time here. Henry Cavill stars as a suave, American CIA agent sent on a mission to East Berlin during the Cold War to rescue a beautiful mechanic (Alicia Vikander) whose estranged father is a world-renowned rocket scientist working on a nuclear bomb. Also on the hunt for her is a Russian KGB agent (Armie Hammer), who’s as highly skilled as Cavill’s character but burdened with a beast of a temper. Multiple shootouts, car chases and fistfights ensue, including one in a men’s bathroom between the two spies. (Soon afterward, they learn they’re going to be partners.) Characters are fatally shot but there’s no blood. There’s also a bit of torture, with one supporting character dying in spectacularly grisly fashion – but we see it from a distance, so there’s sort of a detachment to how disturbing it is, and it’s played for laughs. If sex is what you’re worried about, Cavill’s character effortlessly beds the hotel’s front desk clerk, whom we see afterward from behind in nothing but a pair of lacy panties. And there’s a playfully flirty fight between Hammer and a drunk Vikander that results in a trashed hotel room. This is probably OK for tweens and older.New on DVD&nbsp;Hot Pursuit (2015)  7%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, violence, language and some drug material.This mismatched-buddy comedy is probably suitable for tweens and older, but it’s terrible for everybody regardless of age. Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vergara co-star as obnoxious opposites forced together on a road trip. Witherspoon plays a fast-talking, by-the-book police officer who’s eager to prove herself after an embarrassing Taser incident. Vergara plays the sassy, flashy wife of a high-ranking drug cartel member whom Witherspoon’s character must escort to Dallas to testify before entering witness protection. When they’re confused for dangerous criminals, madcap hilarity (and misogynistic humor) ensue. There’s a bit involving a car crash which sends a cloud of cocaine floating into the sky — and into Witherspoon’s system, which makes her even more manic. Lots of gunshots are fired — some resulting in death — but since this is a PG-13 movie, we don’t see much carnage. There’s some language. And at one point, Vergara and Witherspoon pretend to be lesbian lovers, making out with each other to distract a suspicious farmer. It’s hilarious.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"2020, composers, binge, drama, black, Sabrina, frames, SXSW, Kimmy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Man-from-UNCLE-PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-the-man-from-u-n-c-l-e-and-hot-pursuit"},{"id":"47508913402800","title":"Parental Guidance: Minions Is Pretty Family-Friendly","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Minions Is Pretty Family-Friendlyby Christy Lemire | July 9, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSMinions 55%Rating: PG, for action and rude humor.The Minions always were the best parts of the Despicable Me movies anyway. Now, the little, yellow, pill-shaped creatures have a movie of their own. This 3-D animated comedy serves as an origin story, explaining where the Minions came from and how they’ve had a singular purpose for centuries: Find the most evil villain they can, and then do that person’s bidding (although in the beginning, they worked for a T. rex). The central adventure here finds three brave Minions — Kevin, Stuart and Bob — venturing away from the pack into the vast unknown to find their latest and greatest big boss. At a bad-guy convention, they discover the first female super villain, Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock), who seeks their help in stealing Queen Elizabeth’s crown. As you might expect from these irrepressible imps, a lot of the humor here is of the silly and slapsticky variety: slams, slaps and squashings. At one point, the Minions work for Dracula, but he’s more of a goofy figure than a frightening one. A scene in a dungeon full of potentially scary contraptions ends up being played for laughs. And Scarlet herself is cartoonish in every way imaginable, from her teased-up coif to her shrieky demeanor to her sleek, high-tech vehicles. Totally fine for everyone — although the kids in your house will probably laugh a lot harder than you will.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Family, dragons, Spectrum, Calendar, zero, comiccon, series, Tarantino, Us, Plus, MTV, comedy, crime, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Minions-PG.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-minions-is-pretty-familyfriendly"},{"id":"47508914552768","title":"Parental Guidance: Cinderella, Night at the Museum, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Cinderella, Night at the Museum, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's movies.by Christy Lemire | March 13, 2015 |  CommentsCinderella 83%Rating: PG, for mild thematic elements.Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before: A sweet young woman, tortured and abused by her evil stepmother and stepsisters, enjoys an enchanted (but brief) evening with a handsome prince, only to scurry off mysteriously at midnight. Director Kenneth Branagh tells this classic fairy tale in rather straightforward, live-action fashion — there’s no self-referential irony, no transformation of Cinderella (Lily James) into a sword-wielding warrior princess — but his film is lively and visually sumptuous. Cate Blanchett is formidable as Cinderella’s stepmother but there’s an actual explanation for the origin of her cruelty. Parents die, as is always the case in such stories, so there are a few heavy, emotional moments. Mainly, though, this is a solid way to introduce kids to this enduring story. My 5-year-old son insisted he thought it was “boring,” but the little girl we brought with us to the screening absolutely loved it. I recommend it highly for all ages.The Wrecking Crew 95%Rating: PG, for language, thematic elements and smoking images.This enlightening and entertaining documentary shines a spotlight on a group of session musicians who played on many of the most important and enduring rock and pop hits of the 1960s and early ’70s. For starters, they performed on the Beach Boys’ entire, groundbreaking album Pet Sounds and pretty much all of the Phil Spector Wall of Sound tunes. Director Denny Tedesco made the film to honor his late father, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, and his talented colleagues. There’s some language here and there and pretty much non-stop smoking in the archival photos, but nothing terribly shocking or inappropriate. Fine for pretty much all ages, especially the kids in your house who are into music.New On DVD:Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb 47%Rating: PG, for mild action, some rude humor and brief language.Security guard Larry (Ben Stiller) and his historical pals travel to London to solve the mystery of their mobility in this third and (theoretically) final film in the Night at the Museum trilogy. Everything here is pretty tame (and often lame). The giant, marauding dinosaur skeletons might seem briefly scary for very young kids. The miniature Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan characters find themselves in peril when they get stuck in an air-conditioning vent, but it’s played more for physical comedy than anything else. And there is the vague threat that these museum pieces might transform into their formerly inanimate selves — including the playful, adorable Capuchin monkey — in a way that’s sort of sad, but resolves itself quickly. The movie itself isn’t all that great but it’s a harmless pick if you’re looking for something suitable for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"werewolf, BBC, TCA, cooking, toronto, AMC, zombies, 45, Awards, ViacomCBS, parents, on, based","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cinderella-3.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-cinderella-night-at-the-museum-and-more"},{"id":"47508913414071","title":"Parental Guidance: Pitch Perfect 2 and Still Alice","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Pitch Perfect 2 and Still Aliceby Christy Lemire | May 14, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSPitch Perfect 2 65%Rating: PG-13, for innuendo and language.The sequel to the 2012 surprise hit Pitch Perfect finds the college a cappella group the Barden Bellas fighting to maintain their national championship status after an on-stage wardrobe malfunction in front of President Obama and the first lady. (We don’t actually see the embarrassing costume split Rebel Wilson’s Fat Amy suffers, but other characters discuss it in vivid detail.) As in the first film, John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks (who also directs this time) provide a running commentary on the various singing competitions, which includes plenty of satirically inappropriate racist and sexist remarks. There is the implication that some characters have had sex, some heavy-duty (but broadly comic) make-out sessions as well as some language and general mean-girl trash talk. Still, Pitch Perfect 2, like its extremely similar predecessor, ultimately is about female solidarity and finding your own voice. Fine for tweens and older.NEW ON DVDStill Alice 85%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material, and brief language including a sexual reference.Julianne Moore won a long-overdue Academy Award for her starring role as a brilliant linguistics professor suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s. She gives a heartbreaking performance in this drama, and the terrifying way in which the disease strips her character of her ability to communicate and connect with others is tough to watch. Alice starts forgetting words, losing items and becoming disoriented. A visit to a neurologist provides her with a diagnosis, and it isn’t long before the bottom drops out from underneath her. Besides the disturbing subject matter, there’s a bit of language here, including an argument between grown children which features some vague sexual references. But if you have a loved one who’s struggling with this cruel affliction, Still Alice might provide a bit of comfort and enlightenment for tween viewers and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"streaming, Stephen, reviews, hollywood, parents, shows, Adult, history, south, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pitch-perfect.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-pitch-perfect-2-and-still-alice"},{"id":"47508913410997","title":"Parental Guidance: San Andreas and Aloha","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: San Andreas and Alohaby Christy Lemire | May 29, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSSan Andreas 49%Rating: PG-13, for intense disaster action and mayhem throughout, and brief strong language.Earthquakes ravage the entire state of California — including an historic one that levels San Francisco at 9.6 on the Richter scale, followed by a tsunami — but it’s all played for summer thrills in this CGI-heavy disaster epic. Dwayne Johnson stars as a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter pilot who commandeers various vehicles to save his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) and their daughter (Alexandra Daddario) from the destruction. It’s like Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles, with a catastrophic body count. Seriously, millions of people die in this movie. But since it’s rated PG-13, the totality of the carnage gets glossed over. It’s all extremely over the top, but the massive spectacle might frighten younger viewers. Buildings topple, glass rains from the sky, the ground rips open to create giant chasms and the threat of yet another aftershock is constant. There’s also some serious talk between Johnson and Gugino’s characters about the daughter they lost in a drowning accident. Gugino also gets the pleasure of uttering the one well-chosen F-bomb you get with a PG-13 movie. Probably OK for kids around 8 or 9 and older.Aloha 20%Rating: PG-13, for some language including suggestive comments.This star-studded romantic comedy will confuse moviegoers of all ages because it’s been tinkered and re-tinkered with to the point that it no longer makes sense. The latest from writer-director Cameron Crowe feels like several movies at once, crammed together and sped up. Bradley Cooper stars as an ex-military man who returns to his former Air Force base in Hawaii for work as a private contractor. But he also must reconcile his failed romance with the one that got away (Rachel McAdams) while launching into a new fling with an uptight, up-and-coming captain (Emma Stone). There is the implication that some characters have had sex, as well as some mature discussion about the question of paternity. Cooper drops one big F-bomb in casual conversation. I can’t really recommend this movie to anyone, but if you feel compelled to go see it, I guess it’s OK for mature tweens and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"breaking, Festival, TCA","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/san-andreas-destruction.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-san-andreas-and-aloha"},{"id":"47508913412022","title":"Parental Guidance: Tomorrowland and Strange Magic","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Tomorrowland and Strange Magicby Christy Lemire | May 22, 2015 |  CommentsNEW IN THEATERSTomorrowland 50%Rating: PG, for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril, thematic elements, and language.The section of Disneyland that contains the Space Mountain and Star Tours rides inspires this live-action, sci-fi adventure. George Clooney and Britt Robertson star as strangers connected by a mysterious pin that transports them to a magical, futuristic land when they touch it. A robot in the form of a plucky teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy) brings them together in hopes that they?ll be able to save the place from dying. Two-time Oscar winner Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) directed from a script he co-wrote with Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof, so many of the loftier philosophical elements of the script might go over younger viewers’ heads. But the film’s dreamy, central message — do something great with your talents and make the world a better place — couldn’t be more clear. Bad guys are after our heroes in both human and robot form, and many chases and shootouts with laser guns ensue in which characters get disintegrated. And at one point, a truck hits the little girl/robot, but she’s fine. OK for kids around 8 and older.NEW ON DVDStrange Magic 18%Rating: PG, for some action and scary images.This visually attractive but thematically messy animated fantasy combines pop tunes from the past 60 years with elements of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. There’s a lot going on here, and most of it doesn’t work. Star Wars creator George Lucas came up with the story, which takes place in an enchanted land that’s been split in two: There’s the Fairy Kingdom and the Dark Forest. A feisty fairy princess (voiced by Evan Rachel Wood) dares to enter the scary next-door neighborhood, where she makes an unexpected connection with the mean, lonely Bog King (Alan Cumming). This inspires the singing of several wedged-in (and often painfully on the nose) radio hits. The colors and background elements are vibrant and beautifully detailed, but the character and creature faces are stiff and rubbery in a way that’s distracting. The music selections, which range from Elvis Presley to Bob Marley to Beyonce, are incessant and overbearing. And some of the homelier creatures, including the Bog King (who’s some sort of insect hybrid), might frighten younger viewers. OK for most ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Studios, Cinematographers, drama, romantic, Crunchyroll, Sabrina, saw, halloween, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tomorrowland-2.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-tomorrowland-and-strange-magic"},{"id":"47508914518969","title":"Parental Guidance: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Far from the Madding Crowd, and Paddington","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Avengers: Age of Ultron, Far from the Madding Crowd, and Paddingtonby Ryan Fujitani | May 1, 2015 |  CommentsAvengers: Age of Ultron 76%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi action, violence and destruction, and for some suggestive comments.Summer is officially here. The sequel to the 2012 megahit The Avengers features mass destruction, mayhem and myriad bad guys — most of whom are made of metal. This time, our Marvel superheroes — Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) — must battle a formidable form of artificial intelligence named Ultron (James Spader). Basically, he wants to assemble a robot army to end humanity — especially the Avengers. Besides its massive amounts of fighting, weaponry and carnage (which result in minimal blood, hence the PG-13 rating), writer-director Joss Whedon’s film is probably too long for most younger viewers at nearly 2.5 hours. It’s also got an incredibly convoluted narrative and it’s overstuffed with a ton of characters, which makes it hard to follow regardless of your age. Our heroes also suffer through some frightening and vivid dream sequences, courtesy of the mind games the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) plays on them. This is probably OK for tweens and up.Far from the Madding Crowd 84%Rating: PG-13, for some sexuality and violence.This adaptation of the classic Thomas Hardy novel follows one of literature’s great heroines, the headstrong Bathsheba Everdene, as she juggles the various men who compete for her affections. Carey Mulligan is radiant in the role as an educated young woman in rural 1870 England who inherits her uncle’s farm after his death. Three very different men try to win her heart, and eventually she marries one of them, although director Thomas Vinterberg only shows the beginnings of what happens on their wedding night. A major character is believed to have drowned, and jealousy prompts one of Bathsheba’s suitors to kill another. Probably fine for mature tweens and older, especially those with an interest in literature and/or Victorian England.NEW ON DVDPaddington 97%Rating: PG, for mild action and rude humor.Thoroughly cuddly and sweet, this live-action/CGI-animated take on the tales of an adorable stuffed bear in Britain is mostly fine and even recommended for the whole family. Ben Whishaw voices the beloved children’s book character, who gets an origin story here. We see what prompted Paddington to leave Darkest Peru and travel to London, and how he ends up living with the Brown family. The tone is quite often gentle but dabbles in slight raunchiness here and there, including some literal toilet humor when Paddington has an escapade in the bathroom and a disgusting scene when he cleans out his ears. He does find himself in some peril, though, when Nicole Kidman’s character, a ruthlessly driven taxidermist, wants to capture Paddington and add him to her museum collection. Kidman’s wardrobe is as sharp as the instruments she wants to use to destroy this sweet creature. Her performance is the only element of the movie that frightened my then-5-year-old son.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Mindy, drama, Now, Century","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/avengers-ultron-quicksilver.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-avengers-age-of-ultron-far-from-the-madding-crowd-and-paddington"},{"id":"47508914526139","title":"Parental Guidance: Monkey Kingdom, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, and Big Eyes","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Monkey Kingdom, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, and Big Eyesby Christy Lemire | April 17, 2015 |  CommentsMonkey Kingdom 93%Rating: G.The cute factor is high in the latest film from Disney’s Disneynature branch, which releases a family-friendly documentary nearly every year around Earth Day. This time, the cameras follow a community of macaque monkeys living in the jungle in Sri Lanka. Among them are Raja, the alpha male; a trio of regal females known as the Sisterhood; and the story’s heroine, Maya, a lowborn who becomes a mother and unlikely leader. Children will delight in their playful antics, and they won’t notice that some of them clearly have been staged, including a siege on a kid’s birthday party when the monkeys venture into a nearby town. But because this is a Disney movie, there is peril, too. A monitor lizard preys on them as they seek food in a lily pond. And when a rival band of monkeys fights them for control of the rock that’s been their longtime home, there are casualties — but nothing nearly so brutal as the zebra attack in African Cats. Also: Maya’s baby, Kip, is kidnapped briefly, but the two are reunited. This is totally fine for all ages.Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 5%Rating: PG, for some violence.If you love your children, you will not take them to see the painfully unfunny Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. Sure, it’s harmless. Nothing truly violent happens. There’s no language, no sexual innuendo. But even Kevin James’ slapsticky shtick as a portly security guard won’t draw many laughs — and you’ll be annoyed that you wasted your time and money. Six years after the inexplicably massive hit that was the original Paul Blart: Mall Cop, James is back in the title role. This time, he travels to Las Vegas for a security officers’ convention. There, he inadvertently thwarts a major art heist at the Wynn Las Vegas resort (for which the movie is essentially one, long infomercial). Paul’s teenage daughter (Raini Rodriguez) briefly finds herself in peril when she discovers the scheme, and some of the bad guys carry guns. (The majority of the fighting takes place with non-lethal weaponry, however.) But before they ever leave town, Paul’s mother is run over and killed by a milk truck in quick, cartoonish fashion at the film’s start. Hilarious! Avoid this movie with every fiber in your being.NEW ON DVDBig Eyes 72%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.The story of Margaret Keane, whose kitschy paintings of waifs with enormous, sad eyes drew a large following in the 1960s, is probably suitable for kids around age 10 and up, especially those with an interest in art. Amy Adams stars as Margaret, whose grandstanding husband, Walter (Christoph Waltz), took credit for her work for years — with her meek permission — and became a megalomaniacal celebrity. But as his fame grew, so did his alcoholism and his temper. He drunkenly puts Margaret and her daughter in danger when he sets fire to her art studio. There is also some language in director Tim Burton’s film and a tiny bit of violence: a bar brawl that’s played for laughs. Eventually, though, Big Eyes does have a message of female empowerment, as Margaret finds the courage to stand up to Walter and claim credit for her work.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"See","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/monkey-kingdom.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-monkey-kingdom-paul-blart-mall-cop-2-and-big-eyes"},{"id":"47508914567106","title":"Parental Guidance: Big Hero 6 and Beyond the Lights on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Big Hero 6 and Beyond the Lights on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | February 27, 2015 |  CommentsNew On DVD:Big Hero 6 90%Rating: PG, for action and peril, some rude humor and thematic elements.Now is a great time to catch up with (or re-watch) the lively and lovely Big Hero 6, which just won the Academy Award for best animated feature on Sunday night. It features clever, small details and a cuddly, large robot as well as some heavy themes of life and death, betrayal and revenge. Brilliant, 13-year-old Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney), are obsessed with robots and all things high-tech. But after a major explosion early in the film, Hiro unexpectedly finds himself taking over — and befriending — his brother’s pet project: a giant, inflatable robot named Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) who offers sharp medical care and soft hugs. Along with Tadashi’s energetic band of college buddies, they form a team to battle a bad guy who steals Hiro’s latest invention with evil intent. The film is high-energy and colorful but it also has some dark undertones which may disturb some kids. Before the explosion, the two brothers already were orphans living with their aunt (Maya Rudolph). And the villain is a menacing figure in a cloak and a frightening mask with infinite power at his fingertips. My 5-year-old son wasn’t frightened, though — and he was jumping for joy when Big Hero 6 won the Oscar. Fine for nearly all ages.Beyond the Lights 83%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content including suggestive gestures, partial nudity, language and thematic elements.Gugu Mbatha-Raw gives a star-making performance in this intimate and intense drama set in the R&amp;B world from Love &amp; Basketball director Gina Prince-Bythewood. Mbatha-Raw plays Noni, a Rihanna-esque music sensation on the rise who’s having trouble balancing the pressures of fame with her personal life. She falls for the hunky police officer (Nate Parker) who’s been assigned to protect her, but their romance conflicts with their individual career ambitions. Beyond the Lights shines a light on the demands of celebrity, mental illness and the music industry’s heightened sexualization of female artists. It also features some strong language, suggestive movements on stage and in music videos and sex scenes with partial nudity, including one in an airplane to the inspired strains of Beyonce and Jay Z’s Drunk in Love. It’s probably best for mature tweens and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fantasy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Big-Hero-6-and-Beyond-the-Lights-on-DVD"},{"id":"47508914535357","title":"Parental Guidance: Furious 7, Interstellar, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Furious 7, Interstellar, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's movies.by Christy Lemire | April 3, 2015 |  CommentsFurious 7 82%Rating: PG-13, for prolonged frenetic sequences of violence, action and mayhem, suggestive content and brief strong language.It’s the seventh film in the blockbuster Fast and Furious franchise, so if you’ve seen any of the previous movies, you know what you’re in for here — except the gravity-defying chases, crashes and stunts are even bigger and more insane than usual. Cars drop from planes, float beneath parachutes and fly between skyscrapers. They smash into each other at alarming speeds and tumble down craggy cliffs. Explosions and gunfire abound, some of which result in characters’ deaths. In between the big set pieces, Vin Diesel and his crew engage in brutal fistfights with enemies of various ethnicities. There’s also quite a bit of language as well as scantily clad women dancing and grinding into each other in cartoonish, music-video fashion. It’s all over-the-top, silly fun, but it’s also probably best suited for mature tweens and older.New On DVD:Interstellar 72%Rating: PG-13, for some intense perilous action and brief strong language.Christopher Nolan’s nearly-three-hour space odyssey will be too overwhelming for the vast majority of young viewers. It’s just too long and too intense, with a dense script filled with dry talk of wormholes, time-space relativity issues and what’s on the other side of the horizon line. It also presents the possibility of the end of life on Earth as we know it, and the need to repopulate the species in a galaxy far, far away. Matthew McConaughey stars as a pilot-turned-farmer who dares take a crew of brilliant scientists (including Anne Hathaway) into the vast unknown to see whether life is possible on a trio of distant planets. He’s also a widower who has made a promise to return to his daughter, played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain. Much of the scenery is beautiful and dazzling — Nolan does not mess around when it comes to special effects, as we know — but there’s also quite a bit that’s frightening, including massive dust storms, a powerful tidal wave and various explosions and technical complications. This is probably suitable for viewers around 12 or 13 and older.Island of Lemurs: Madagascar 81%Rating: GThis beautiful and intimate documentary, which follows the playful adventures of lemurs in the wild, will be totally suitable and quite enjoyable for the whole family. Morgan Freeman narrates, sharing the story of how these furry creatures floated on a raft of vegetation across the Indian Ocean from Africa to a remote, exotic island 60 million years ago. Now, many types of lemur face extinction, as well as a shortage of rainforest in Madagascar because so much land has been burned for farming. The film offers a powerful ecological message that older kids will understand; younger ones will probably just revel in the gorgeous imagery and the lemurs’ hilarious, adorable antics.The Imitation Game 89%Rating: PG-13, for some sexual references, mature thematic material and historical smoking.Benedict Cumberbatch stars in this well-made historical drama as Alan Turing, the brilliant British mathematician who devised a system to crack the Germans’ highly complicated Enigma code during World War II. But Turing also was a closeted homosexual, which was illegal at the time. Flashbacks to his childhood reveal his torment as well as the bullying he suffered from his peers. The wartime segments, meanwhile, feature references to loss of life. The whole film will be too restrained — and probably boring — for most younger viewers. But those around 12 or 13, especially ones with an interest in history, might connect with it. And Keira Knightley’s character, who functions as a rare female figure in this predominately male world, is a strong role model for her keen scientific mind.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"sag, Tyler, Legendary, YA, The, cars, OneApp, Marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/lemurs-madagascar.jpg","slug":"parental-guidance-furious-7-interstellar-and-more"},{"id":"47508916243404","title":"Parental Guidance: Exodus: Gods and Kings, Plus Guardians of the Galaxy on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Exodus: Gods and Kings, Plus Guardians of the Galaxy on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | December 11, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Exodus: Gods and Kings 31%Rating: PG-13, for violence including battle sequences and intense images.This massive biblical epic from director Ridley Scott makes his Oscar-winning Gladiator look like an independent film by comparison. Presented in 3-D and heavy on the visual effects, it’s the Old Testament story of Moses leading hundreds of thousands of Hebrew slaves out of Egypt to freedom. That means plagues — lots of em — from frogs to locusts to boils. (The boils are especially gnarly.) And because everything has gotten so out of control and overpopulated under the reign of the inept Ramses (Joel Edgerton), slaves are thrown into enormous fires to thin out the city. There are also several major battle scenes, perilous chariot chases and a pummeling wall of water once Moses (Christian Bale) has finished parting the Red Sea. Between the violence, the subject matter and the running time of nearly two and a half hours, this is probably best suited only for the most mature tweens and older.New On DVD:Guardians of the Galaxy 92%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language.The cheekiest, wackiest blockbuster of the past summer, but it also features all the massive violence and destruction you’d expect from a movie of this genre. Based on the Marvel Comics series about a rag-tag group of misfits who band together to save the galaxy, it begins with a child witnessing a parent’s death, followed by his abduction by otherworldly beings. That child grows up to be the brash space scavenger Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who refers to himself as Star-Lord and becomes an unlikely hero. Among the other characters are the muscular, brutish Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) and a talking, gun-toting raccoon named Rocket voiced hilariously by Bradley Cooper. Guardians also features a couple of dark and intimidating villains, and everyone’s after a powerful, mystical orb that’s capable of causing some major damage. The spectacle is massive in director James Gunn’s film but cartoonishly so. My son was almost 5 when he attended the screening with me and wasn’t frightened by anything, but some of the seriously traumatic stuff might have gone over his head. If your child has seen this sort of comics-inspired movie before, he or she will probably be OK.Dolphin Tale 2 66%Rating: PG, for some mild thematic elements.This is a sequel to the 2011 family film Dolphin Tale and, like its predecessor, it’s exceedingly earnest and harmless entertainment. There’s something sort of sweet and quaint about that, though. Winter, the dolphin who was rescued in the first movie, now lives at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Florida and is learning to function with a high-tech prosthetic tail. But her status there is in jeopardy when — spoiler alert! — her elderly companion dolphin dies. My son was not quite 5 years old when I brought him with me to the screening and the dolphin’s death — as well as the devastated reactions from the teens who worked with her — upset him. But mostly, this is a film that’s all about teamwork and uplift. Fine for the whole family.When the Game Stands Tall 20%Rating: PG, for thematic material, a scene of violence and brief smoking.Based on a true story, this inspirational drama is suitable for viewers around age 8 or 9 and up. It’s about the De La Salle High School Spartans of Concord, Calif., a football team that enjoyed a historic 151-game winning streak in the 1990s and early 2000s. Director Thomas Carter’s film reveals how the players respond when they finally do lose a game, and how they bounce back from a series of traumas on and off the field. A star player is shot to death outside a party and another player loses his mother to cancer. A wide receiver on the verge of breaking a touchdown record endures physical and emotional abuse from his demanding father. And head coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel), a longtime smoker, suffers from heart trouble. But the film’s messages about teamwork, dedication and sacrifice are worthwhile.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"classics, GIFs, Review, Avengers, police, Tour, Mystery, Sundance, Kimmy, Biopics, halloween, crime, binge","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Exodus-Gods-and-Kings-Plus-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-on-DVD"},{"id":"47508916252625","title":"Parental Guidance: Big Hero 6, Interstellar and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Big Hero 6, Interstellar and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | November 6, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Big Hero 6 90%Rating: PG, for action and peril, some rude humor and thematic elements.The latest from Walt Disney Animation Studios is a lively and lovely adventure full of clever, small details and a cuddly, large robot. But it also features some heavy themes of life and death, betrayal and revenge. Brilliant, 13-year-old Hiro (voiced by Ryan Potter) and his older brother, Tadashi (Daniel Henney), are obsessed with robots and everything high-tech. But when Tadashi dies in an explosion early in the film, Hiro unexpectedly finds himself taking over — and befriending — his pet project: a giant, inflatable robot named Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit) who provides top-notch medical care (and squishy hugs). Along with Tadashi’s college friends — a merry, multi-ethnic band of nerds — they form a team to battle a bad guy who steals Hiro’s latest invention with dastardly intent. The film is high-energy and colorful but it also has some dark undertones which may be disturbing for some kids. Prior to Tadashi’s death, the two brothers already were living with their aunt (Maya Rudolph) because their parents died. And the villain is a cloaked figure in a frightening mask with infinite power at his fingertips. My 5-year-old son wasn’t frightened, though, and this should be OK for nearly all ages.Interstellar 72%Rating: PG-13, for some intense perilous action and brief strong language.Well, the running time alone — nearly three hours — will be prohibitive to most young viewers who might be curious about Christopher Nolan’s space odyssey. For those who do choose to stick it out, they’ll have to decipher a dense script filled with dry talk of wormholes, time-space relativity issues and what’s on the other side of the horizon line. Also: the possibility of the end of life on Earth as we know it, and the need to repopulate the species in a galaxy far, far away. No biggie. Matthew McConaughey stars as a pilot-turned-farmer who dares take a crew of brilliant scientists (including Anne Hathaway) into the vast unknown to see whether life is possible on a trio of distant planets. He’s also a widower father who has made a promise to return to his daughter, played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain. Much of the scenery is spectacular but there’s also quite a bit of it that?s frightening, including massive dust storms, a powerful tidal wave and various explosions and technical complications. I would maybe take a 12- or 13-year-old to see this; for anyone younger, Interstellar is sure to be quite a slog.The Theory of Everything 80%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic elements and suggestive material.A biopic about renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking might be a tough sell for your kids. But if the older and more enterprising ones are interested — especially those who are keen on science — there’s little here that might seem inappropriate for them. Eddie Redmayne portrays Hawking from his blissful days in the early 1960s at Cambridge, where he meets his wife, Jane (Felicity Jones), through his stunning diagnosis of motor-neuron disease and his intellectual triumph over the gradual bodily deterioration that leaves him in a wheelchair, unable to speak. As his condition worsens, their marriage evolves, and there’s the suggestion that each had an affair on the side with the other’s tacit approval. At one point, Hawking’s therapist leafs through the pages of a Penthouse magazine for his perusal. And there’s a bit of joking about the fact that Hawking was able to produce three children with his wife, despite suffering from a disease that renders him unable to move much. Fine for older tweens and up.New On DVD:Planes: Fire and Rescue 44%Rating: PG, for action and some peril.In this sequel to the 2013 animated adventure Planes, Dusty Crophopper (voiced again by Dane Cook), the cropduster-turned-racer, is dismayed to learn he no longer can compete because of a broken, outdated gearbox. But realizing that his small town needs emergency support, he shifts his attention and receives training to become a firefighting plane. He sees lots of action, not all of which he’s prepared for, and ends up in some danger. The forest fires he helps contain are intense and all-consuming; they ravage trees and send guests at an historic lodge scurrying for safety. Some characters also discuss the fact that not all firefighters make it out of these situations alive. So if that kind of peril troubles your kids, that might be something to ponder beforehand. There’s also a handful of harmless fire truck fart jokes. Suitable for pretty much all ages.Maleficent 54%Rating: PG, for sequences of fantasy action and violence, including frightening images.Angelina Jolie is ideally cast as the villain from Sleeping Beauty in this dark fairy tale that traces the character’s origins. You might not have been wondering what could turn someone’s heart so cold that she’d curse a newborn baby, but Maleficent details the childhood betrayal that would define her adult life. Jolie is a ravishing and intimidating figure, of course, with those dramatic lips and cheekbones. But the creatures and surroundings in director Robert Stromberg’s film might just be more frightening in their own way. They include gnarled, talking trees, odd-looking woodland creatures, a fire-breathing dragon, a dark forest full of thorns and a couple of intense battle sequences. When I brought my son (who was 4 ½ years old at the time) to see this movie in 3-D last summer, he wasn’t frightened. But he’d also seen Sleeping Beauty beforehand, so maybe that helps. This is probably fine for kids around age 6 and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Christmas, Musicals, political, TV, IFC, live, Food, Summer, Pop, Netflix, 45, Emmy, Fox, TruTV, nightmare","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-big-hero-6-interstellar-and-more"},{"id":"47508916245453","title":"Parental Guidance: Still Alice, Plus Dawn of the Planet of the Apes on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Still Alice, Plus Dawn of the Planet of the Apes on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | December 4, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Still Alice 85%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material, and brief language including a sexual reference.It’s doubtful that a drama about a linguistics professor suffering from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease would appeal to any of the kids in your house. But if you have a loved one who’s struggling with this cruel affliction, perhaps this film might provide a bit of comfort and catharsis for tween viewers and older. Julianne Moore stars as the title character, a brilliant and accomplished woman who starts forgetting words, losing items and becoming disoriented. A visit to a neurologist provides her with a diagnosis, and it isn’t long before the bottom drops out from underneath her. Moore gives a heartbreaking performance, and the terrifying way in which the disease strips her character of her ability to communicate and connect with others is difficult to watch. There’s also a bit of language here, including an argument between grown children which features some vague sexual references.New On DVD:Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 90%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and brief strong language.The sequel to 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes is probably OK for kids around age 10 and older. Director Matt Reeves’ film is intimate and thrilling but it’s also extremely violent — packed with gun battles and massive amounts of firepower. Intelligent and intense, it’s vividly rendered and visceral in its huge action sequences. And the apes themselves — which are more textural and realistic than ever, thanks to some extraordinary computer-generated effects — are probably way too frightening for most young viewers when they?re in full-on rampage mode. Andy Serkis once again offers his immersive and technically exquisite powers of transformation to play Caesar, the leader of a group of highly sophisticated apes who’ve taken over after a virus devastates the planet. He works reluctantly with a human (Jason Clarke) who hopes to get a dam running to provide power to the few survivors left in San Francisco. Mistrust and misunderstanding bring both groups to the brink of war.The Hundred-Foot Journey 68%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, some violence, language and brief sensuality.Aside from a couple of moments of brief violence, this delightful (and conventional) multicultural romance is probably just fine for kids around 10 and older. Helen Mirren stars as the uptight owner of an elegant restaurant in the south of France. Om Puri plays the boisterous patriarch who moves his family into her quaint village and opens a new Indian restaurant directly across the street — 100 feet away, hence the title. Their competition, and the way they sabotage each other, is petty and cruel but amusing. And eventually their rivalry leads to greater understanding and even friendship, you’ll be shocked to learn. At the beginning of the film and in the middle, vandals attack the Indian family’s restaurants, setting fire to them and even causing a death. But in both scenes in director Lasse Hallstrom’s film, these are opportunities for rebuilding and redemption.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"The, shows, we, Sneak, First, popular, One, Showtime, FOX, hollywood, TV, Comic-Con, Plus, Geographic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Still-Alice-Plus-Dawn-of-the-Planet-of-the-Apes-on-DVD"},{"id":"47508914585540","title":"Parental Guidance: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | February 13, 2015 |  CommentsWe’ve got a short Parental Guidance this week due to the lack of family friendly wide releases in theaters. Read through for this week’s DVD release, and make sure to check our Parental Guidance archive for additional options.New on DVD:Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day 61%Rating: PG, for rude humor including some reckless behavior and language.The popular Judith Viorst children’s book provides the inspiration for this family-friendly Disney comedy. The misadventures begin when Alexander (Ed Oxenbould) suffers through an atrocious day. While blowing out a birthday candle, he wishes that his happy, thriving parents and siblings could understand his misery — and accidentally places a curse on them in the process. Madcap hilarity ensues: a wrecked minivan, a Peter Pan performance that goes haywire after Alexander’s sister drinks too much cough syrup and a baby who eats an entire green marker. There’s nothing that’s the slightest bit offensive here. Even when the male-stripper group the Thunder From Down Under shows up — it’s a long story — they do a sanitized version of their sexy routine. This is a solid choice for the whole family — even parents, who may find it surprisingly enjoyable thanks partly to the likable presence of Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner as Alexander’s parents.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Disney, new, Holidays, TIFF, name, song, 24, Comics, TV+, elm, kids, series, zombies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Alexander-and-the-Terrible-Horrible-No-Good-Very-Bad-Day-on-DVD"},{"id":"47508916250576","title":"Parental Guidance: Dumb and Dumber To, Beyond the Lights and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Dumb and Dumber To, Beyond the Lights and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | November 14, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Dumb and Dumber To 30%Rating: PG-13, for crude and sexual humor, partial nudity, language and some drug references.It’s a Farrelly brothers movie — and a sequel to a hugely popular Farrelly brothers movie — so you know exactly what you’re getting. Fart jokes and urine jokes. Jokes about genitalia — those of our idiotic heroes and an unsuspecting old lady in a nursing home. Jokes about people of various ethnicities, sexual orientations and physical disabilities. If it’s raunchy and (allegedly) shocking, it’s in here. Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey return to the roles of Harry and Lloyd, respectively, which they played in the original Dumb and Dumber from 1994. This time, they reunite to go on a road trip in hopes of tracking down the daughter Harry never knew he had, and hopefully finding a spare kidney along the way. They bumble their way from one ridiculous situation to the next and offend everyone they come across. It’s satire! The crude physical comedy, which is the Farrellys’ bread and butter, makes much more sense to me now that my son is 5. Still, the material here is probably best suited for older tweens and up.Beyond the Lights 83%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content including suggestive gestures, partial nudity, language and thematic elements.There are some heavy themes as well as some mature situations in this romantic drama set in the music world from Love &amp; Basketball director Gina Prince-Bythewood. Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars as Noni, a troubled, Rihanna-esque R&amp;B singer on the brink of superstardom. She falls for a hunky member of her security detail (Nate Parker), but their romance conflicts with their individual career ambitions. Beyond the Lights tackles the pressures of fame, mental illness and the music industry’s heightened sexualization of female artists. It also features some strong language, suggestive movements and sex scenes with partial nudity. It’s probably best for 13-year-olds and up.New On DVD:How to Train Your Dragon 2 91%Rating: PG, for adventure action and some mild rude humor.In case you were wondering, the young Viking Hiccup (voiced with great humor and warmth by Jay Baruchel) has indeed trained his dragon, the playful and loyal Toothless. Now, in this sequel to the 2010 animated hit, dragons are a big part of everyone’s daily life and serve as friendly companions, and they’re all depicted in wondrous color and vibrant detail. But another challenge awaits Hiccup and his buddies: They must conquer a villain (voiced by an intimidating Djimon Hounsou) who wants to kidnap all the dragons and turn them into an army to carry out his nefarious plans. While the movie is lively and thrilling for viewers of all ages, there are some serious themes, daring deeds and dire consequences. Hiccup reconnects with an important figure from his past and watches as another key character dies. My son was 4 ½ when I brought him with me to see this, and he was a bit frightened only by the Hounsou character. The heavier stuff might register more with slightly older kids. This is a great pick for most ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"hist, Peacock, Disney, best, CMT, Nominations, play, crime, movie, Marvel, John, streaming, Channel, tv","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-dumb-and-dumber-to-beyond-the-lights-and-more"},{"id":"47508916237259","title":"Parental Guidance: The Hobbit, Annie, Night at the Museum, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Hobbit, Annie, Night at the Museum, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | December 19, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 59%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images.It’s the last film in Peter Jackson’s Hobbit trilogy and it has the words “battle” and “armies” in the title, so naturally it has a ton of graphic violence and a high body count. But even before all the fighting begins between various orcs and dwarves and elves, the fearsome dragon Smaug (menacingly voiced once again by Benedict Cumberbatch) wreaks fiery havoc on the innocent citizens of Laketown. If your kids are old enough to have seen any of the previous J.R.R. Tolkien adaptations and have been OK with them — and they’re curious to know how this series ends and then leads up to The Lord of the Rings — they’ll probably be fine. But for younger and less mature viewers, this is pretty intense, and the mythology might be confusing, and it is extremely long at nearly two and a half hours.Annie 28%Rating: PG-13, for some mild language and rude humor.This modern-day version of the enduring stage musical has been moved from the Great Depression to the present day, with the plucky orphan Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) moving in with a billionaire cell-phone mogul (Jamie Foxx) and melting his heart… in song! The notion that material wealth equals happiness is definitely magnified in this adaptation, with Annie enjoying a helicopter ride around New York City and distributing free phones to her foster-kid friends. So that’s kind of a bummer. Cameron Diaz is rather shrill and inept as Miss Hannigan but she’s not as intimidating as she’s been in previous versions; she’s more pathetic than anything else. And Annie is briefly in peril when she goes off with a couple who pretend to be her parents, but she’s not hurt in any way. All in all, this movie is harmless. But it’s also terrible.Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb 47%Rating: PG-13, for mild action, some rude humor and brief language.The third and (theoretically) final film in the Night at the Museum trilogy finds security guard Larry (Ben Stiller) and the rest of the historical gang traipsing off to London to solve the mystery of their mobility. Everything here is pretty tame (and often lame). The giant, marauding dinosaur skeletons might seem briefly scary for very young kids. The tiny Owen Wilson and Steve Coogan characters are in danger when they get stuck in an air-conditioning vent, but it’s played more for slapstick humor than anything else. And there is the vague threat that these museum pieces might transform into their formerly stiff selves — including the impish Capuchin monkey — in a way that’s slightly sad, but resolves itself quickly. Decent for all ages.New On DVD:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 21%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence.This live-action reboot of the franchise featuring modified, crime-fighting, pizza-eating turtles is a Michael Bay production. So it’s essentially a Transformers movie, complete with shiny action sequences and destructive battles that place innocent bystanders in harm’s way. The turtles themselves may be cute and cool and wacky in other incarnations but here, the special effects make them odd-looking in an off-putting way. Still, they emerge from the sewers to defend New York City, as they must, with the help of Megan Fox as a fearless TV reporter. The enemy is a giant robot samurai named Shredder. He’s working with a wealthy, evil scientist (William Fichtner) who wants to rule the city by releasing a deadly toxin. Explosions, gunfire and general mayhem abound as a roaming group of marauders called the Foot Clan terrorize the city and take hostages. My son wasn’t quite 5 years old when I took him to see this, and he was a bit frightened of Shredder, but only briefly. “I really liked it,” he said. So there you go.The Maze Runner 65%Rating: PG, for thematic elements and intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, including some disturbing images.Because there aren’t enough sci-fi thrillers based on young adult novels set in rigidly structured, dystopian futures, here is yet another. The tween and teen readers who are the targets for the James Dashner book will know what they’re getting into here. Still, this is a pretty violent and often harrowing PG-13 film. Dylan O’Brien stars as Thomas, a young man who finds himself in a pastoral square called the Glade. He has no idea who he is or how he got there, similar to the dozens of other teenage boys who arrived before him and have forged their own society. But Thomas soon grows curious about the dangerous maze that lies outside the giant concrete walls surrounding the Glade. Ravenous, speedy creatures await in those dark corridors, and we see them tear some of the characters apart. The big reveal which explains how all these kids ended up here and what they’re intended for is filled with gunfire and it grows deadly pretty quickly. This is not for the young or the squeamish.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"video, Chilling, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-The-Hobbit-Annie-Night-at-the-Museum-and-More"},{"id":"47508916234186","title":"Parental Guidance: Into the Woods, Big Eyes, and More","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Into the Woods, Big Eyes, and MoreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | December 24, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Into the Woods 71%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, fantasy action and peril, and some suggestive material.This is a Disneyfied, film version of the popular Stephen Sondheim musical which twists and combines several beloved fairy tales. Cinderella shares the screen with Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Jack of beanstalk fame, with Meryl Streep playing the witch who ties all their stories together. The forest where their paths cross is dark, gnarled and ominous — although, as the song goes, “The woods are just trees. The trees are just wood.” A lot of the heavier themes that exist in the stage production involving the younger characters and their sexual awakening have been softened here to reach a wider audience with a PG rating. The Big Bad Wolf’s big badness is implied, slightly. Overall, though, Sondheim is a lot for young viewers to take in; his melodies are complicated and his lyrics are dense. And the playfulness of the first half gives way to heavier themes of sacrifice and death in the second half. I brought my 5-year-old son to the screening with me and the main thing that scared him was the giant that appears toward the end. The witch has some frightening moments, too. This is probably best for kids around age 8 and up.Big Eyes 72%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and brief strong language.Amy Adams stars as the artist Margaret Keane, whose kitschy paintings of waifs with enormous, sad eyes earned a large following in the 1960s. Tim Burton’s film follows the deception she agreed to as her husband, Walter (Christoph Waltz), took credit for her work and became a megalomaniacal celebrity. There is some language here and a tiny bit of violence: a bar brawl that’s played for laughs. Walter’s drinking increases throughout the course of the film until he becomes erratic and menacing, and at one point, he places Margaret and her teenage daughter in fiery peril in her studio. This is probably fine for kids around age 10 and up, especially those with an interest in art.Selma 99%Rating: PG-13, for disturbing thematic material including violence, a suggestive moment, and brief strong language.This is a beautifully made, powerfully acted film which provides a useful lesson about the civil rights movement. But the cruelty and closed-mindedness it shows is extremely difficult to watch, and will be way too disturbing for most young viewers. David Oyelowo stars as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as he was leading the fight for equal voting rights in the segregated South in 1965. Director Ava DuVernay vividly depicts the violent backlash these peaceful protesters endured, especially during their first attempt to march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. The beatings many of them suffered were brutal and bloody. This is probably suitable for older tweens and up, but eventually, it’s a must-see movie for all young people.Unbroken 51%Rating: PG-13, for war violence including intense sequences of brutality, and for brief language.Director Angelina Jolie’s film is based on the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner and World War II hero who lasted 47 days on a life raft after a plane crash, only to wind up in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. The hardship he suffers on the life raft with two other men is lengthy and brutal: the starvation, dehydration and hallucinations, with the constant, lingering threat of death. But once he and his fellow soldiers arrive at the POW camp, they are subjected to repeated and merciless beatings. I’m actually sort of amazed this movie received a PG-13 rating. It’s an inspirational story of courage and perseverance but one that’s probably best suited only for mature tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Comics, Syfy, Disney, Women's, joker, Sneak, VH1, mutant, Geographic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Parental-Guidance-Into-the-Woods-Big-Eyes-and-More"},{"id":"47508917961694","title":"Parental Guidance: Guardians of the Galaxy, Get On Up and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Guardians of the Galaxy, Get On Up and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 1, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy 92%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language.Based on the Marvel Comics series about a rag-tag group of misfits who band together to save the galaxy, this is the cheekiest, wackiest blockbuster you’ll see all summer. But it also features all the massive violence and destruction you’d expect from a movie of this genre.

Among the other characters are the muscular, brutish Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) and a talking, gun-toting raccoon named Rocket voiced hilariously by Bradley Cooper. Guardians also features a couple of dark and intimidating villains. Everyone’s after a powerful, mystical orb that’s capable of causing some disturbing damage. The spectacle is massive in director James Gunn’s film but in a cartoonish sort of way. My son, who’s almost 5, came with me to see this and wasn’t frightened by anything, but some of the substantively traumatic stuff might have gone over his head. If your kid has seen this sort of comics-inspired movie before, he or she will probably be OK.Get On Up 80%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, drug use, some strong language, and violent situations.The James Brown story sadly features no hot tub. Still, the hugely charismatic Chadwick Boseman gives a powerhouse performance as The Godfather of Soul. The film from director Tate Taylor (The Help) doesn’t shy away from the impoverished, abusive childhood Brown endured growing up in rural Georgia. We see his father hit him and his mother (Viola Davis) before the mother abandons the family for good. We see young James move into a brothel where the madam (Octavia Spencer) pays him for luring in randy, young soldiers. And as Brown rises to musical superstardom, we see all the usual infidelities, betrayals and skirmishes (as well as a domestic violence streak of his own). Taylor only briefly alludes to Brown’s drug use. But he does include the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and its impact on the racial tension of the era. This is probably fine for mature tweens and older.4 Minute Mile 29%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material involving violence, drinking and drugs, and for smoking and some language.This is a by-the-numbers but surprisingly understated underdog sports movie. Richard Jenkins stars as an aging, alcoholic track coach who trains a talented but troubled teen to run a mile at a punishing four-minute pace. Jenkins’ character drinks a ton and smokes pretty much non-stop. The young man at the center of the film (Kelly Blatz) saw his father’s die at a young age and now makes cash deliveries for his no-good brother (Cam Gigandet) to a local drug dealer. We see a climactic shooting as well as its aftermath. The story is inspirational if familiar — at one point, Jenkins’ character knowingly makes a reference to The Karate Kid. But it’s suitable for young teens and up.New On DVD:Noah 76%Rating: PG-13, for violence, disturbing images, and brief suggestive content.Darren Aronofsky’s big-budget depiction of the legend of Noah’s Ark is probably best for teen viewers and older. It’s visually striking and often disturbing, as you’d imagine from the visionary director of Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. Russell Crowe stars as the title character, who believes he receives a message from God about a massive, impending flood. He gets some help in building the ark from a group of enormous rock monsters who initially seem frightening but turn out to be misunderstood, fallen angels. The flood itself, and the way it strands thousands of terrified people&nbsp;is a startling thing to behold. There’s also the possibility of infanticide and potential incest.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"finale","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-guardians-of-the-galaxy-get-on-up-and-more"},{"id":"47508917947354","title":"Parental Guidance: Ghostbusters, Plus Blended and Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Ghostbusters, Plus Blended and Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 29, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Ghostbusters 97%Rating: PG.The classic ’80s comedy is back in theaters this weekend on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson star as paranormal scientists who run around New York City ridding the place of ghosts. Along the way, Murray’s character falls for the beautiful Dana (Sigourney Weaver), who becomes the unwitting conduit to demons in the netherworld. Some of the ghouls may seem slightly frightening for little kids, but the climax — involving a giant, marauding Stay Puft Marshmallow Man — is just absurdly hilarious. There’s some language, smoking and a bit of sexual innuendo. Fine for kids around age 8 and up — plus, you can enjoy sharing that catchy Ray Parker Jr. theme song with them.New On DVD:Blended 15%Rating: PG-13, for crude and sexual content, and language.The third teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, following The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates, isn’t exactly good but it’s probably suitable for tweens and older. Sandler and Barrymore co-star as single parents who initially hate each other but (naturally) end up getting together and blending their five combined kids during a luxurious African vacation. Compared to most Sandler comedies, this is pretty low-key in terms of the gross-out factor. There’s no projectile vomit, no messy excrement. There is one joke about urinating outdoors but it’s actually relevant in context. Computer-generated rhinos cavort and a giraffe surprises a teenage boy with a tongue kiss. Speaking of kissing, a couple of newlyweds make out incessantly (and the young wife is especially jiggly). There’s also a running bit about Barrymore’s 13-year-old son’s propensity for masturbation. But hey, it’s never too early to have that conversation.Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return 16%Rating: PG, for some scary images and mild peril.Creepy-looking and totally lacking in charm, this animated sequel to The Wizard of Oz is an insult to the classic original. But if it’s the only family-friendly movie that’s available to rent — well, you should still avoid it. Still, if your kids want to watch it, they (probably) won’t be scarred for life. Dorothy (voiced by Glee star Lea Michele) returns to Oz at the urging of the Scarecrow (Dan Aykroyd), Tin Man (Kelsey Grammer) and Lion (Jim Belushi). She must defeat the evil and power-hungry Jester (Martin Short), who has taken over and plunged the magical land into ruin. The flying monkeys look more impish than scary this time, but when Jester is projected in full-on, great-and-powerful mode, it might be a bit frightening for the youngest kids. A whole new motley crew joins Dorothy on the yellow brick road, where various dangers and obstacles await. One of these supporting character “dies,” but not really. Please seek out the 1939 Wizard of Oz — or even The Wiz from 1978 — instead.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Paquin, IFC, casting, Trivia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-ghostbusters-plus-blended-and-legends-of-oz-dorothys-return-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508917965792","title":"Parental Guidance: Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue and Rio 2","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue and Rio 2We give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | July 17, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Planes: Fire &amp; Rescue 44%Rating: PG, for action and some peril.The sequel to 2013’s Planes finds Dusty Crophopper (voiced again by Dane Cook), the cropduster-turned-racer, unable to compete anymore because of a faulty, outdated gearbox. Seeing the need for emergency support in town, he reinvents himself as a firefighting plane, traveling far away to train with a veteran team. He sees a ton of action, not all of which he’s ready for, and winds up in some danger. The forest fires he helps contain are intense and all-consuming; they ravage trees and send visitors to an historic lodge scurrying to safety. It’s also mentioned that not all firefighters make it out of these situations alive. So if that kind of peril troubles your kids, that might be something to consider beforehand. I took my son, who’s almost 5, and he had no problem with it. There’s also a handful of innocuous fire truck fart jokes.New On DVD:Rio 2 48%Rating: G.Sequel time again. The follow-up to the 2011 animated hit Rio is lively and colorful and enjoyable during the musical numbers, but a bit dull and overloaded when it comes to actual storytelling. This time, neurotic Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and energetic Jewel (Anne Hathaway) are the parents of three baby blue macaws, and they’re all enjoying domesticated bliss in the big city. But when they learn that other rare birds of their species still exist in the Amazon, they journey to find them, with a cadre of creatures and people on their tails with devious intentions. Nigel (Jemaine Clement), the evil cockatoo who villainously stole the show last time, can’t fly anymore so he’s more of a preening diva here. And there’s a subplot about illegal forestry that’ll go over young kids’ heads. Still, it’s all appropriate for the entire family.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Kaling, black, on, movies, Musical, Series, 007, Unbreakable, BET, Film, Reality, Searchlight","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-planes-fire-and-rescue-and-rio-2"},{"id":"47508917931990","title":"Parental Guidance: The Boxtrolls","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The BoxtrollsWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 26, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Boxtrolls 77%Rating: PG, for action, some peril and mild, rude humor.This family-friendly comedy is crammed with painstakingly detailed stop-motion animation. It’s also got a major dark streak and its prevailing grotesquery may be too much for the youngest kids. Beneath a quaintly dreary English village lives a population of creatures known as the Boxtrolls. They are industrious and mischievous and misunderstood. They also have a young, orphaned boy living among them who’s known as Eggs (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) because they all take their names from the boxes they wear: Fish, Shoe, etc. A scheming and socially ambitious villain with the Dickensian name of Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) promises the city’s leaders that he will eradicate the town of all the Boxtrolls if they will let him join their elite white hat society. The adventures here are pretty tame. It’s the details that may freak some kids out. Snatch loves cheese (as everyone in town does) but he’s allergic to it, swelling in gnarly fashion from a single bite. Children are repeatedly in peril or neglected, and there’s a subplot about kidnapping. OK for kids around 6 and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"globes, Horse, The, Masterpiece, thriller","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-boxtrolls"},{"id":"47508916259797","title":"Parental Guidance: Left Behind and Transformers: Age of Extinction","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Left Behind and Transformers: Age of ExtinctionWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | October 3, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Left Behind 1%Rating: PG-13, for some thematic elements, violence/peril and brief drug content.A remake of the 2000 Kirk Cameron thriller about the Rapture, this has a bigger budget and a bigger star in Nicolas Cage in hopes of reaching a larger, more mainstream audience. But that didn’t exactly result in a quality piece of filmmaking in terms of special effects. Or dialogue. Or performances. Or anything. Cage stars as a philandering airline pilot who’s the captain on a transatlantic flight from which several passengers mysteriously disappear. The same phenomenon occurs back on the ground where his wife and kids are. Mostly children get zapped but also the truly faithful. Because, you know, it’s Armageddon. Director Vic Armstrong’s film features some “big” set pieces that look pretty small and chintzy, including a school bus that goes off an overpass and a small plane that crashes into a shopping mall parking lot. Cage’s character, meanwhile, must find someplace to land his own plane amid the pandemonium. There’s a brief bit of drug content involving one of the passengers. But mainly there’s just widespread panic. Probably fine for tweens and up, or anyone looking for a good laugh.New On DVD:Transformers: Age of Extinction 17%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and brief innuendo.Transformers: Perhaps you’ve heard of them. They’re robots disguised as cars and trucks. Sometimes they fight each other. This is the fourth Transformers film Michael Bay has made, so you should know what you’re in for by now: noise and violence, followed by mass destruction.But there isn’t much of a body count because it’s a PG-13 movie. One character does get blasted to death and remains frozen in horror — that’s kind of a disturbing sight. Lots of buildings blow up, including the quaint Texas farmhouse where Mark Wahlberg’s character and his sexy teenage daughter (Nicola Peltz) live. Shadowy government bad guys, including Kelsey Grammer, skulk about the globe furthering their nefarious plans. And while there’s language throughout, Stanley Tucci (as a slick, high-tech inventor) gets to drop one well-placed F-bomb. Probably OK for tweens and up, although with a running time pushing three hours, this is a challenging slog for anyone to endure regardless of age.Editor’s note: In addition, The Hero of Color City is in limited release and geared for young children. Hero is an uplifting animated adventure about crayons who embark on an adventure to discover their true colors, featuring the voices of Christina Ricci, Owen Wilson, Craig Ferguson and more.

That means it’s essentially a Transformers movie, complete with shiny action sequences and destructive battles that place innocent bystanders in peril. The turtles themselves may be cute and cool and wacky in other incarnations but here, the special effects make them odd-looking in an off-putting way. Still, they emerge from the sewers to defend New York City, as is their duty, with the help of Megan Fox as an intrepid TV reporter. The enemy is a giant robot samurai named Shredder who resembles a Japanese Megatron. He’s working with a wealthy, villainous scientist (William Fichtner) who wants to rule the city by releasing a deadly toxin. There are explosions, lots of gunfire and general mayhem as a roaming group of marauders known as the Foot Clan terrorize the city and take hostages. I saw this movie with my son (who’s almost 5) and he was a bit frightened of Shredder, but only briefly.The Hundred-Foot Journey 68%Rating: PG, for thematic elements, some violence, language and brief sensuality.Helen Mirren stars as the uptight owner of an elegant restaurant in the south of France. Om Puri plays the boisterous patriarch who moves his family into her quaint village and opens a new Indian restaurant directly across the street — 100 feet away, to be exact. Their competition, and the way they sabotage each other, is petty and cruel but amusing. And eventually — spoiler alert! — their rivalry leads to multicultural understanding. There are a couple of brief instances of violence — one in the beginning, one in the middle — in which vandals attack the Indian family’s restaurants, setting fire to them and even causing a death. But in both cases in director Lasse Hallstrom’s film, these are opportunities for rebuilding and redemption. Fine for kids around 10 and older.Step Up: All In 42%Rating: PG-13, for some language and suggestive material.I’m guessing that the solitary, casually tossed F-bomb is the main reason that this fifth Step Up movie received a PG-13 rating. Otherwise, it’s pretty harmless as it offers one dance battle after another after another. This time, the action takes place at a competition in Las Vegas, with various characters from the previous films assembling and reassembling in different crews. The ultimate prize is a three-year deal performing at Caesars Palace. Maybe some of the dance moves are slightly and briefly risque — the thrusting, the suggestion of some sexual acts — but it all flies by at a dizzying pace. Even the dancers’ night out on the town is chaste. No smoking for these agile, muscular guys and gals, and even the drinking they do consists of a few glasses of celebratory champagne. Totally fine for kids around 8 or 9 and up.New On DVD:Divergent 41%Rating: PG-13, for intense violence and action, thematic elements and some sensuality.This is yet another movie based on a young adult novel set in a dystopian future where teenagers must fight each other for survival. Tweens who have read the book — and anyone familiar with this genre, really — will know what to expect in terms of violent situations and disturbing imagery. Still, because it’s rated PG-13, there’s very little blood to accompany the considerable body counts that accumulates. Shailene Woodley stars as Beatrice — or Tris, as she renames herself — a modest girl who faces the momentous task of deciding which of society’s five factions is the best fit for her. She chooses to join the Dauntless, which means a quick and demanding training regimen of shooting, fighting, throwing knives, climbing great heights and jumping from moving trains. But she also must defend herself against the competing initiates who are trying to take her down. It’s intense, dark stuff with a lengthy running time at two-plus hours.Need For Speed 23%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of reckless street racing, disturbing crash scenes, nudity and crude language.Aaron Paul’s first major role post-Breaking Bad finds him starring in this zippy, flashy action thriller in which a lot of cars get seriously mangled. Paul plays a small-town drag racer and mechanic who must compete in that tried-and-true one last race to redeem himself and save his family’s shop. It’s a high-stakes road challenge full of exotic sports cars, which inevitably causes some serious crashes. These adrenaline junkies knowingly put themselves in this dangerous situation — and some of them won’t survive — but they also subject untold innocent pedestrians and fellow drivers to their general disregard for human safety. Probably fine for viewers age 10 and up — but kids, don’t try this at home.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"satire, comedy, Acorn, Sematary, Annual, Pixar, Box, Sundance, Fantasy, archives, It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-tmnt-the-hundred-foot-journey-and-more"},{"id":"47508917936087","title":"Parental Guidance: The Maze Runner, Godzilla, and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Maze Runner, Godzilla, and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 18, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Maze Runner 65%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements and intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, including some disturbing images.This is yet another sci-fi thriller based on yet another young adult novel set in a rigidly structured, dystopian future. The tween and teen readers who are the targets for the James Dashner book will know what they’re getting into here. Still, this is a pretty violent and often harrowing PG-13 film. Dylan O’Brien (from MTV’s Teen Wolf) stars as Thomas, a young man who winds up in a pastoral square called the Glade. He has no memory of who he is or how he got there, similar to the dozens of other teenage boys who preceded him and have built their own society there. But Thomas soon becomes curious about the dangerous maze that lies outside the giant concrete walls surrounding the Glade. Ravenous, fast-moving creatures await in those dark corridors, and we see them tear some of the characters apart. The big reveal which explains how all these kids ended up here and what they’re intended for is filled with gunfire and it grows deadly pretty quickly. This is not for the young or the squeamish.New On DVD:Godzilla 76%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of destruction, mayhem and creature violence.It’s big and noisy and scary, as you would expect from a sci-fi blockbuster monster movie. The latest incarnation of Godzilla starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Bryan Cranston, duly features mass urban destruction and masses fleeing in terror. This time, the big green guy stomps across San Francisco as he battles a couple of other enormous creatures that grow stronger through radioactivity. Untold thousands find themselves in peril, including a school bus full of kids on the Golden Gate Bridge. The special effects in director Gareth Edwards’ film are really sharp — crisp, textural, visceral — making some of the battle sequences truly tense and terrifying. The sound design is also quite vivid, with its ominous creaks, groans and roars. This is probably suitable for kids around age 10 and older.The Fault In Our Stars 81%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, some sexuality and brief strong language.This is totally suitable for the teens and tweens who are familiar with John Green’s best-selling young adult novel about cancer patients in love. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort’s characters, Hazel and Augustus, refuse to be defined by the mawkish pop culture clichés of the genre, however. They are self-aware and hyper-verbal. So they curse a lot and do stupid things and behave like typical teenagers in general. They also lose their virginity to each other in an Amsterdam hotel room, but it’s handled very tastefully and there’s barely any nudity. And Woodley gets to enjoy the one F-bomb you’re allowed with a PG-13 rating. The characters experience quite a lot of joy with each other, but the prospect of death lingers over their romance at all times. Probably too mature for anyone under the tween ages.Think Like a Man Too 23%Rating: PG-13, for crude sexual content including references, partial nudity, language a drug material.Clichéd, wacky Las Vegas hijinks are in full force in this sequel to the 2012 hit comedy Think Like a Man. The whole crew has reassembled, with a handful of new characters, for the wedding of Mama’s boy Michael (Terrence J) and single mom Candace (Regina Hall). So in addition to the Sin City clichés, we also have all the usual bachelor/bachelorette party antics. That means strip clubs for everyone (although there’s very little actual nudity) and a ton of drinking and partying hard with hot men and women. Jerry Ferrara’s character complains that he can’t smoke pot anymore because he and his wife (Gabrielle Union) are trying to have a baby. But! He does think to bring along some marijuana-laced gum, which the ladies accidentally pop into their mouths. Everybody eventually ends up in a brawl, which lands them all in jail. Between the risqué activities and the talks about boring, adult subjects like careers, marriage and family, this is probably best suited for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"YA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-maze-runner-godzilla-and-more"},{"id":"47508917963743","title":"Parental Guidance: Magic in the Moonlight, And So It Goes, Plus Transcendence on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Magic in the Moonlight, And So It Goes, Plus Transcendence on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | July 24, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Magic in the Moonlight 51%Rating: PG-13, for a brief suggestive comment and smoking throughout.Woody Allen’s annual offering is a fluffy comic trifle about spirits and sleight of hand amid the wealthy on the Cote d’Azur. Colin Firth stars as a world-renowned, arrogant illusionist who’s asked to unmask a pretty, young American psychic (Emma Stone) as a fake. Because the movie takes place amid the wealthy in Europe in the 1920s, every single character smokes constantly throughout. There are also séances where Stone’s character claims she’s conversing with the dead — which may freak children out — along with some brief risqué references. But for the most part, Allen’s typically hyper-verbal banter will go over younger kids’ heads and older ones will just be bored.And So It Goes 18%Rating: PG-13, for some sexual references and drug elements.Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton play widows in their 60s who live next door to each other in a Connecticut fourplex and bicker incessantly. Naturally, this means they will fall in love. He’s a real estate agent; she’s a lounge singer. Together, they’re forced to come together to take care of the 9-year-old granddaughter he never knew he had. Rob Reiner’s comedy features some drug references — Douglas’ character’s son is a recovering heroin addict, and Douglas himself must visit a couple of squalid homes where substance abuse clearly is taking place. Douglas and Keaton eventually share a flirtation which turns sexual; Reiner shows up the build-up and the aftermath but not the deed itself. It’s pretty harmless for the most part and has an undeniable message about the importance of family. But it’s also terrible, so if you’re looking for a great Reiner movie that everyone can watch, rent The Princess Bride instead.New On DVD:Transcendence 19%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action and violence, some bloody images, brief strong language and sensuality.This thinky sci-fi thriller starring Johnny Depp is probably best for tweens and up only. It’s full of big ideas about the power of technology — both its potential and its abuse as an invasion of privacy — but the way it’s presented is pretty dull and often silly. But this is the directing debut of Christopher Nolan’s longtime cinematographer, Oscar-winner Wally Pfister, so at least it’s visually striking. Depp stars as an esteemed scientist who’s been experimenting with artificial intelligence with the help of his wife (Rebecca Hall). When a terrorist group targets him, he uploads his consciousness to the Internet to maintain his legacy. There are plenty of shootings and explosions here with quite a bit of blood, but a key part of the story focuses on medical advancements that let people regenerate and heal themselves — so they don’t stay injured for long. Still, it’s extremely violent and long at nearly two hours.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"cars, school, WGN, globe, e., Opinion, Oscars, DC, monsters","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-magic-in-the-moonlight-and-so-it-goes-plus-transcendence-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508917973988","title":"Parental Guidance: How to Train Your Dragon 2, Non-Stop, and Jack Ryan","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: How to Train Your Dragon 2, Non-Stop, and Jack RyanWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | June 13, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:How to Train Your Dragon 2 91%Rating: PG, for adventure action and some mild rude humor.In this sequel to the 2010 animated hit, the young Viking Hiccup (voiced with great warmth and humor by Jay Baruchel) has indeed trained his dragon, the playful and loyal Toothless. Dragons are actually a big part of everyone’s daily life now, serving as friendly companions, and they’re all depicted in wondrous color and vibrant detail. But another challenge is in store for Hiccup and his pals as they must conquer a villain (voiced by an intimidating Djimon Hounsou) who wants to capture all the dragons to form an evil army, or something. While the movie is lively and thrilling for viewers of all ages, there are some serious themes, daring deeds and dire consequences. Hiccup reconnects with an important figure from his past and watches as another key character dies. I brought my 4½-year-old son and he was a bit frightened only by the Hounsou character, but the heavier stuff might register more with slightly older kids. Fine for most ages.New On DVD:Non-Stop 62%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of action and violence, some language, sensuality and drug references.In the latest Liam Neeson festival of butt kicking, the veteran actor plays a troubled air marshal who receives a series of threatening text messages while on a late-night, trans-Atlantic flight from New York to London. He must deposit $150 million into an account or a passenger will die every 20 minutes. And so a few people will indeed have to die to make it clear that the terrorist is serious. Non-Stop is extremely violent, full of brawls, punches, shootings, stabbings and a battle to the death inside an airplane bathroom. But it all results in very little blood to ensure a PG-13 rating. There’s also a briefcase full of cocaine and an amorous couple who get frisky beneath a blanket. OK for tweens.Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit 54%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence and intense action, and brief strong language.Chris Pine stars as the title character, the hero of so many best-selling Tom Clancy novels, whom Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck have played in the past. This is a prequel/reboot of sorts, featuring Ryan as he’s just beginning his career as a CIA operative. It’s post-9/11, and he must travel to Moscow undercover as a financial analyst to find out why a major firm is holding some secret accounts. (Director Kenneth Branagh plays the company’s president, who has some dastardly plans for the money.) Things get dangerous soon after Ryan arrives, including killing a man who comes after him in his hotel room. Gunfire, car chases, explosions and a deadly shooting follow. Based on the violence and the complexity of the subject matter, this is probably suitable for tweens and up only.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Exclusive, Con","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-how-to-train-your-dragon-2-non-stop-and-jack-ryan"},{"id":"47508919728101","title":"Parental Guidance: Edge of Tomorrow and The Fault in Our Stars, Plus Robocop on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Edge of Tomorrow and The Fault in Our Stars, Plus Robocop on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | June 5, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Edge of Tomorrow 91%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence, language and brief suggestive material.This is an extremely violent PG-13 movie. I’m actually kind of amazed that it got a PG-13 rating, but barely any blood results from the pervasive violence and death, so there you have it. Basically, Tom Cruise’s character gets shot in the head over and over again — or he’s devoured by monsters, or he’s hit by a truck — which resets his day, forcing him to relive the same sequence of events with more knowledge and slight tweaks each time. It’s Groundhog Day, with carnage. In the near future, creatures that resemble giant, evil calamari have ravaged our planet. They’re fast-moving, spinning, climbing, flying — they’re totally frightening. Cruise, as a reluctant Army major, and Emily Blunt, as a famously fierce warrior, must team up to manipulate time and stop the assault. Among the elements of the fight is a futuristic storming of the beach at Normandy where massive gunfire, exploding aircraft and general mayhem rule. Director Doug Liman’s film is extremely clever but definitely not suitable for anyone younger than their teens.The Fault in Our Stars 81%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, some sexuality and brief strong language.Teens and tweens familiar with John Green’s best-selling novel about teenage cancer patients in love know exactly what they’re in for: heavy-duty hanky time. But Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort’s characters, Hazel and Augustus, refuse to be defined by the mawkish pop culture clichés of the genre, so they curse a lot and do stupid things and behave like garden-variety teenagers in general. They also — spoiler alert! — lose their virginity to each other in an Amsterdam hotel room, but there’s barely any nudity. And Woodley gets to enjoy the one choice F-bomb you’re allowed with a PG-13 rating. Because of the subject matter alone — and the prospect of death that hovers over everything — this is probably suitable for the same target audience as the young adult book.New On DVD:Robocop 48%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of action including frenetic gun violence, brief strong language, sensuality and some drug material.Like Edge of Tomorrow this is an insanely violent PG-13 movie — and, like Edge of Tomorrow there’s very little blood as a result of all that violence, hence the PG-13 rating. This shiny, noisy remake of the groundbreaking 1987 action satire contains a ton of gunfire, both real and simulated. Joel Kinnaman stars as a former police officer in a near-future version of Detroit who nearly dies in an explosion. Instead, corporate scientists rebuild him as half-man, half-robot crime fighter. He has to take down a bunch of bad guys, which leads to some drug material when RoboCop infiltrates a hidden manufacturing warehouse. And Samuel L. Jackson, as a Bill O’Reilly-type TV commentator, gets to spew some amusing profanity — only some of which gets bleeped out.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"monsters","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-edge-of-tomorrow-and-the-fault-in-our-stars-plus-robocop-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508919742443","title":"Parental Guidance: Bears, Transcendence, Plus The Nut Job and more","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Bears, Transcendence, Plus The Nut Job and moreWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | April 18, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:&nbsp;Bears 90%Rating: G.The latest family-friendly documentary from Disney’s Disneynature label, following Earth, Oceans, African Cats and Chimpanzees, is mainly an adorably cuddly adventure. It follows a mama bear named Sky and her two cubs, Scout and Amber, as they dig out from their snowy cave in the Alaskan wilderness and head down the mountain in search of food. Perils do await them, though, from larger and hungrier bears and wolves to rising water and the threat of starvation. (If you and your family have seen African Cats, with its bloody zebra mauling, nothing nearly so gory happens here.) There are a couple of tense moments but John C. Reilly’s amiable narration lets you know everything will be all right. And the film is beautiful, intimately shot, so it’s at least worthwhile from a visual perspective. Fine for all ages.Transcendence 19%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action and violence, some bloody images, brief strong language and sensuality.Christopher Nolan’s longtime cinematographer, Oscar-winner Wally Pfister, makes his directing debut with this thinky sci-fi thriller. It’s full of big ideas about the frightening power of technology — both its potential and its threat to our privacy — but the execution is rather dull and sometimes silly. Johnny Depp stars as a brilliant scientist who’s been experimenting with artificial intelligence alongside his wife (Rebecca Hall). When a terrorist group guns him down, he uploads himself to the Internet to keep his legacy alive. There are lots of shootings and explosions here with quite a bit of blood, but part of the story hinges on medical advancements that allow people to regenerate and heal themselves – so they don’t stay injured for long. The violence, subject matter and nearly two-hour running time make this suitable for tweens and up only.New On DVD:The Nut Job 12%Rating: PG, for mild action and rude humor.A mostly innocuous but thoroughly unpleasant animated comedy full of unlikable characters. Will Arnett provides the voice of Surly, a squirrel who’s just trying to get a nut – and he’s unwilling to share with the rest of the furry woodland creatures in the park. Trouble is, there’s a food shortage as winter approaches, so Surly must choose between remaining selfish or being a team player. Fart jokes abound here – and many of them take place underground just to make them extra gross. Some of the rodents also wind up in danger on a raging river. Surly and his pals run into some mobster types, but they’re too cartoonish (in every way) to be threatening. And a raccoon voiced by Liam Neeson might just be more devious than he initially seems.The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty 51%Rating: PG, for some crude comments, language and action violence.Ben Stiller directs and stars as the title character in this big-budget version of the classic James Thurber story. The milquetoast Mitty enjoys a vivid fantasy world which becomes reality when he’s forced to embark on a globetrotting adventure. The special effects are pretty spectacular here – and they’re the main reason to recommend this movie. There are a couple scenes of peril: a chase through the crowded streets of Manhattan, as well as an erupting volcano. And Walter’s boss, played by an arrogant Adam Scott, is a total jerk. But for the most part this inanely uplifting story about overcoming your fears and chasing your dreams is pretty darn harmless.Ride Along 18%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of violence, sexual content and brief strong language.Ice Cube and Kevin Hart co-star in this clichéd, mismatched buddy-cop comedy that strains desperately to be funny. Hart plays a fast-talking security guard with dreams of becoming a police officer. He also dreams of marrying his longtime girlfriend (Tika Sumpter), whose brother is the toughest detective in all of Atlanta. Hart goes for a ride along with Cube — hence the title — to prove his worth. Shootings, showdowns with generic Serbian bad guys and explosions ensue. There’s also plenty of language and suggestive sexual jokes involving the various positions and tricks Hart likes to employ in the bedroom. (And his nickname is Black Hammer, supposedly a reference to his manhood.) This is probably OK for older kids, but you may want to show them The Other Guys or even 21 Jump Street instead.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Century","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-bears-transcendence-plus-the-nut-job-and-more"},{"id":"47508919732198","title":"Parental Guidance: Maleficent, Plus Endless Love on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Maleficent, Plus Endless Love on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | May 30, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Maleficent 54%Rating: PG, for sequences of fantasy action and violence, including frightening images.It’s Sleeping Beauty from the villain’s perspective — an origin story that explains what could turn someone so evil that she’d curse a newborn baby. Angelina Jolie is ravishing in the title role — Those lips! Those cheekbones! Those horns! — and she cuts quite an intimidating figure. But the creatures and surroundings in director Robert Stromberg’s film might potentially be even more frightening. Maleficent features gnarled, talking trees, odd-looking woodland creatures, a fire-breathing dragon and a dark forest full of thorns. It’s also got a couple of big battle sequences, because what movie doesn’t this time of year? I took my 4 1/2-year-old son to see it and he wasn’t frightened at all, but I’d also shown him Sleeping Beauty recently so he knew what to expect, somewhat. This is probably fine for kids around age 6 and up.New On DVD:Endless Love 16%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content, brief partial nudity, some language and teen partying.This remake of the 1981 drama that helped make Brooke Shields a star is pretty much completely different. The names and some details are the same, but writer-director Shana Feste taken out all the crazy that marked Franco Zeffirelli’s film. Feste’s take on this tale of forbidden teen love plays more like an extended Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ad, with its gorgeous lead actors frolicking in idyllic settings. Alex Pettyfer stars as the smart, decent-hearted mechanic’s son who dares to fall for Gabriella Wilde’s character, a wealthy, sheltered cardiologist’s daughter. They make out everywhere, have sex on the carpet in front of a fireplace and engage in partying that’s alluded to but never shown. Despite his hunky dreaminess, Pettyfer’s character also has a temper — he punches a couple of guys and gets arrested. This is probably fine for older tweens/young teens and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"shows, Mirror, Comic, bond","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-maleficent-plus-endless-love-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508917971939","title":"Parental Guidance: Think Like a Man Too and The Lego Movie","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Think Like a Man Too and The Lego MovieWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | June 19, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Think Like a Man Too 23%Rating: PG-13, for crude sexual content including references, partial nudity, language a drug material.This lazy sequel to the 2012 hit comedy about the battle of the sexes finds the cast reuniting for the Las Vegas wedding of Mama’s boy Michael (Terrence J) and single mom Candace (Regina Hall). All the Sin City clichés are here as well as the typical bachelor/bachelorette party antics. The guys and gals both go to strip clubs (where there’s very little actual nudity). They drink a ton and party hard with hot men and women. Jerry Ferrara’s character laments his inability to smoke pot because he and his wife (Gabrielle Union) are trying to conceive a child. But he does bring along with him some marijuana-laced gum, which the ladies accidentally ingest. Eventually, the whole crew ends up in a brawl, which lands them in jail. Between the risqué activities and the discussions about boring, grown-up topics like careers, marriage and family, this is probably best suited for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Society, movies, Tumblr, Paramount, 2017, movie, HBO, boxing, nfl, of, Series, park, diversity, scary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-think-like-a-man-too-and-the-lego-movie"},{"id":"47508923017228","title":"Parental Guidance: Mortal Instruments: City of Bones","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Mortal Instruments: City of BonesWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | August 23, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Mortal Instruments:City of Bones 13%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action, and some suggestive content.This fantasy franchise mashup is tween-tacular: It’s got angels and demons, vampires and werewolves, mysterious symbols and magic wands. There’s even a love triangle and some Star Wars-style sibling weirdness for good measure. What it does not have, though, is much sense or storytelling efficiency. Mortal Instruments is crammed with mythology and overloaded with effects-laden action sequences. It’s got plenty of fistfights, swordplay and supernatural frights — including some gooey, shapeshifting beasties which are truly disgusting — but very little actual blood spills as a result of all this violence. There’s also some very slightly suggestive flirty banter between our young heroine (Lily Collins) and the androgynous demon slayer (Jamie Campbell Bower) who becomes her protector. Although the film is overlong at two hours and 10 minutes, its content is suitable for the same audience as the young-adult book that inspired it.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"rotten, Prime, Disney, Critics, Disney+, It, game, talk, television, Golden, cats, Starz, 2021, canceled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones"},{"id":"47508919746542","title":"Parental Guidance: Noah and on DVD Delivery Man","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Noah and on DVD Delivery ManWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | March 28, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:&nbsp;Noah 76%Rating: PG-13, for violence, disturbing images and brief suggestive content.Darren Aronofsky’s take on the tale of Noah’s Ark is as visually striking and thematically wacky as you’d expect from the maker of Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream. This is not exactly a Sunday school lesson, but it’s also more faith-affirming than you might expect from a big-budget, studio picture. Russell Crowe stars as the title character, who receives a message from God that a massive, purging flood is coming, so he better build an ark and load the animals in, two-by-two, blah blah blah. Along the way he also must fight a descendant of Cain (Ray Winstone) and his fellow marauders. But he gets some help from a group of enormous rock monsters, which initially seem scary but turn out to be misunderstood, fallen angels. The flood itself – and the way it strands the terrified masses – is a disturbing thing to see and hear. Aronofsky also presents the possibility of infanticide as well as the vague suggestion of potential incest. All of these factors – plus the nearly 2 ½-hour running time – make this best for teens and older.New On DVD:Delivery Man 40%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, sexual content, some drug material, brief violence, and language.Masturbation jokes abound in this otherwise mawkish comedy-drama about an underachiever (Vince Vaughn) who discovers he’s the father of hundreds of children through the anonymous sperm donations he made two decades ago. In hopes of connecting with them – and proving he can be a suitable dad to his pregnant girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) – Vaughn’s character secretly inserts himself into their lives and performs good deeds for them. Often these lead to laughs, but sometimes the situations get serious, as is the case with a young woman who nearly dies of a heroin overdose. Lots of mature themes and discussions here, making this movie appropriate for tweens and older.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"service, documentary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-noah-and-on-dvd-delivery-man"},{"id":"47508919741418","title":"Parental Guidance: Spider-Man 2, Plus Three Rotten DVD Releases","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Spider-Man 2, Plus Three Rotten DVD ReleasesWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | May 3, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Amazing Spider-Man 2 51%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of sci-fi action/violence.Well, it’s yet another summer blockbuster about a comic-book character, so this sequel contains all the 3-D, computer-generated action and violence you’d expect. This time, Andrew Garfield’s Peter Parker/Spider-Man must take on not one, not two, but three villains. Among them is Jamie Foxx’s Electro, who gets zapped by a bunch of electric eels when he falls into a vat at work, then uses his newfound powers to wreak havoc on New York City. (Times Square suffers the majority of his wrath.) Peter also continues to investigate what happened to his parents, which includes a flashback to a harrowing airplane trip. There’s the general threat of massive destruction at all times, as well as intimate moments of peril, including the sight of a little boy dressed in a Spider-Man costume who dares confront the metal beast Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Tiananmen Square-style. Fine for tweens and up ? they’ve seen all this stuff before, anyway.New On DVD:The Legend of Hercules 5%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense combat action and violence, and for some sensuality.I couldn’t even recall what movie this was from the title alone. I actually had to look it up to remind myself of whether I’d actually seen it, that’s how forgettable it was ? and it only came out in theaters a few months ago. But if for some reason you feel the urge to rent The Legend of Hercules, you’re in for a dully derivative 300 rip-off from director Renny Harlin. Hunky Twilight vampire Kellan Lutz stars as the title character, who’s the illegitimate half-son of Zeus. He doesn’t have to endure all 12 quests from Greek mythology, but he does use his considerable brawn in plenty of battles, with various body parts and weaponry flinging their way toward us in converted 3-D. Much of the slick action violence is slowed down and then sped up in the preferred (and overused) technique these days. It all looks so fake, it’s probably harmless for older kids.Gimme Shelter 29%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material involving mistreatment, some drug content, violence and language ? all concerning teens.Vanessa Hudgens stars as a runaway pregnant teen in this earnest and well-intentioned but clunky melodrama. Following Spring Breakers, the former Disney Channel star continues to distance herself from her good-girl image. She’s unrecognizable as Agnes “Apple” Bailey beneath her shaggy hair, baggy clothes, tattoos and piercings. Apple flees the clutches of her drug-addicted mother (Rosario Dawson) to live with the Wall Street financier father (Brendan Fraser) she’s never met. But Apple’s dirty and desperate mom tracks her down, smacks her several times and, at one point, slices her face with a razor. Apple also considers having an abortion before moving into a home for pregnant teens and young mothers. So there’s a lot of mature stuff here to discuss with your kids ? older ones, only — if you end up renting this movie.Labor Day 35%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material, brief violence and sensuality.This is a soapy romance/thriller/coming of age drama from the perspective of a 13-year-old boy. Despite the character’s age, though, the film’s subject matter is probably too mature for kids and even tweens. Josh Brolin plays an escaped killer who takes Kate Winslet’s single-mom character and her son hostage in their New Hampshire home. He’s a misunderstood fugitive with a heart of gold. She’s a depressed divorcee longing for a man’s touch. While Jason Reitman’s film is unintentionally hilarious, it also has some flashbacks to the murder that landed Brolin’s character in prison and to the traumatic events that destroyed Winslet’s character’s marriage.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, Awards, King, Kemper, Cannes, Trivia, on, Plus, NYCC, Superheroes, facebook","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-spider-man-2-plus-three-rotten-dvd-releases"},{"id":"47508919744492","title":"Parental Guidance: Rio 2, Draft Day, Plus The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Rio 2, Draft Day, Plus The Hobbit: The Desolation of SmaugWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | April 11, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Rio 2 48%Rating: G.Rio 2 is the sequel to Rio, hence the name. And like that 2011 animated hit, it soars in the musical segments but stays earthbound when it comes to actual story. This time, nervous Blu (voiced by Jesse Eisenberg) and confident Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have given birth to three baby blue macaws, and they’re all living a life of domesticated bliss in the city. But when they discover there are other rare birds of their kind still out there in the Amazon, they make the trek to find them – with several people and creatures on their tails who have varying dastardly intentions. The evil cockatoo Nigel (Jemaine Clement) can’t fly this time so he’s more of a preening diva than a true villain. There’s also a half-baked subplot about illegal forestry that’ll be sure to get the kids excited. But the colors are wondrous and the production numbers are a delight. Everything in here is suitable for the whole family.Draft Day 60%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language and sexual references.Kevin Costner stars as the general manager of the beleaguered Cleveland Browns, who must navigate athletes, agents, team executives, competitors, the media and even his own mother during one of the most important dates on the NFL calendar: draft day. Given this testosterone-infused environment, it’s no surprise that there’s some rough talk and profanity. Costner gets to utter the one well-chosen F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating. There’s also a slightly mature subplot involving Costner’s relationship with a fellow executive, played by Jennifer Garner. But kids and pre-teens should probably stay away from this — not because of anything inappropriate, but because they’ll be bored. Director Ivan Reitman’s film focuses on the nitty-gritty of NFL machinations: the phone calls, manipulation and trading that go on between teams. But teens and up, especially those who are into football (or fantasy football), will probably enjoy it.New On DVD:The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 74%Rating: PG-13, for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images.If the giant talking spiders or ugly orcs don’t get you, the ferocious, fire-breathing dragon Smaug will. In between there are piercing arrows, ominous shadows, stabbings and beheadings. (And just think: If you have a 3-D TV at home, some of those severed heads will come flying right at you.) Yes, the source material – J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, contains this kind of fantasy action, but director Peter Jackson’s second film in his treatment of the book is just extraordinarily violent. Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and his dwarf pals enjoy many lively adventures on their way to Lonely Mountain, but once they get there they must contend with Smaug himself. Benedict Cumberbatch voices him, so you know he’s going to be deeply chilling. Given the graphic nature of this movie and the extended running time, this really is just for the most mature tweens and up.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Spike, comiccon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-rio-2-draft-day-plus-the-hobbit-the-desolation-of-smaug"},{"id":"47508921425915","title":"Parental Guidance: Christmas Edition","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Christmas EditionWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of some holiday favorites.by Christy Lemire | December 24, 2013 |  CommentsChristmastime is here, as the kids sing in one of my favorite holiday movies. This time of year is tailor-made for gathering together with the family and revisiting some classic movies. Here are a few favorites that are suitable for all ages:A Charlie Brown Christmas 83%Part of the fun of being a mom is rediscovering the films and shows I loved as a child. My 4-year-old son, Nicolas, is totally into this animated classic in which Charlie Brown learns the true meaning of Christmas beyond the material trappings. Plus you’ve got all that great, jazzy music from composer Vince Guaraldi which will be stuck in your head while you’re cleaning up wrapping paper and leftovers.Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas 100%Be sure and pop the animated classic into the DVD player, not the Ron Howard live-action version starring Jim Carrey. Boris Karloff provides a rich line-by-line reading of the favorite kids book and voices the scheming green monster who dares dash off with all the shiny finery brightening up Whoville for the holidays. He’s a mean one, Mr. Grinch — but kids as young as 4 will love him.A Christmas Story 89%It’s on 24 hours a day around Christmas, so if you turn on the television you’re sure to come across it at some point. Even though you’ve seen it a million times, it always charms, and your own kids are sure to fall for it the same way you did. This comedy about a 9-year-old boy who desperately wants Santa to bring him a BB gun accurately captures the mixture of emotions children experience around Christmas: all the wonder, expectation and anxiety rolled together.The Nightmare Before Christmas 95%One of Tim Burton’s many marvels of stop-motion animation. Serving as writer and producer this time, Burton helps brings his signature gothic look brilliantly to life in this fairy tale in which the king of Halloweentown discovers the wonders that await in Christmastown. It may be slightly scary for only the littlest kids.Elf 85%Seriously, how adorable is Will Ferrell? It is impossible not to smile — “I just like to smile, smiling’s my favorite” — watching the 6-foot-3 comic prancing around New York in his red-and-green get-up as the perpetually perky Buddy the Elf. The childlike innocence and enthusiasm he exudes is just dead-on.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, pirates, movies, Crackle, name, talk, Guide, GoT, Endgame, movie, TIFF","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-christmas-edition"},{"id":"47508921421817","title":"Parental Guidance: The Legend of Hercules","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Legend of HerculesWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | January 10, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Legend of Hercules 5%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense combat action and violence, and for some sensuality.Director Renny Harlin’s 300 rip-off is a dully derivative take on the Hercules origin story. There’s plenty of slick action violence — slowed down and then sped up, the de rigueur style these days — but it all might be too numbing to make any kind of impact. Hercules (Kellan Lutz, one of the hunky Twilight vampires), the illegitimate half-son of Zeus, doesn’t even go through all of the 12 quests as depicted in Greek mythology. But he does use his brawn to take part in plenty of battles, with various body parts and weaponry flinging themselves at us through the screen in converted 3-D. It all looks like the fake product of CGI, though, so it’s probably harmless for older kids. But you may have to have a conversation about the way Hercules was conceived, because it goes down a bit differently than they’re learning in seventh-grade health class.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"psychological, ViacomCBS, women, strong, live, Biopics, toy, Schmidt, Fox, movie, remakes, rom-coms, Office, Shudder, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-legend-of-hercules"},{"id":"47508919751665","title":"Parental Guidance: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman and The Hunger Games: Catching FireWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | March 7, 2014 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman 81%Rating: PG, for some mild action and brief rude humor.Inspired by the cartoon series from those old Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle episodes, this 3-D update finds Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell), the world’s smartest dog, and his genius boy, Sherman (Max Charles), enjoying various time-travel adventures. It is way better than that description makes it sound, though, or that&nbsp;the commercials might suggest. This animated action comedy is lively, clever, smart and frequently funny — even with Mr. Peabody’s trademark, groan-worthy puns. It’s totally suitable for kids of all ages, although a lot of the humor, historical details and pop-culture references clearly were intended for the adults in the audience. And there’s even a lesson or two to be learned here, albeit in a Bill &amp; Ted’s Excellent Adventure kind of way. There is exactly one fart joke, but the set-up for it actually makes it work. Stephen Colbert, Leslie Mann, Ariel Winter, Stanley Tucci and Patrick Warburton are among the strong voice cast.New On DVD:The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 90%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, some frightening images, thematic elements, a suggestive situation and language.Totally unsurprisingly, given its source material, this second film in the Hunger Games trilogy is dark, suspenseful and very, very violent. Even more than its predecessor, 2012’s The Hunger Games, there’s an inescapable sense of totalitarian dread. This is a dystopian future in which young people must kill each other to save their home districts, with the unflappable Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) at the center as reigning co-champion. This time, she must fight again against other previous victors in a sort of sadistic all-stars round. It’s heady and disturbing as well as bloody and gruesome. If you’ve seen the first movie, you know what you’re getting into here.

Brolin plays a convicted killer who escapes from prison and takes Winslet’s depressed divorcee character and her son hostage in their New Hampshire home. For starters, Jason Reitman’s film is unintentionally hilarious. But it also has some mature material for young viewers, including flashbacks to the murder that landed Brolin’s character in prison as well as the traumatic events that destroyed Winslet’s character’s marriage and turned her into a shaky shell of her former self. I’d avoid it with kids. Actually, I’d avoid it all around if I were you.New On DVD:Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 71%Rating: PG, for mild rude humor.There’s nothing even remotely scary or inappropriate in this animated 3-D sequel to the 2009 hit, which made $243 million worldwide. This time, the once-peaceful island of Swallow Falls has been taken over by marauding hybrid creatures known as Foodimals. While the original film had fun with disaster-movie conventions, this one plays with monster-movie motifs, with its Shrimpamzees and Tacodiles. It’s big and loud and messy but contains nothing inappropriate – unless you’re offended by the idea of flatulence humor. (Your kids certainly aren’t.) Some of the bad food puns will make you groan, though.Last Vegas 46%Rating: PG-13, for sexual content and language.I highly doubt that your kids will want to see this raunchy comedy about four 70-year-old lifelong friends (Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline) who get together in Las Vegas for a bachelor party. But if your kids happen to be in the room when you rent it or watch it, Last Vegas is probably suitable for tweens and up. Of course, there are some Viagra jokes, but there’s also a subplot about sanctioned extramarital activities. The guys judge a bikini contest by the pool and enjoy a wild night of carousing at a nightclub. And Kline’s character lets loose with one loud, well-timed F-bomb. Surprisingly, the movie itself is funnier and not nearly as painful as it looks, mainly because the four stars provide such great presence and chemistry.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"American, facebook, Extras","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-labor-day-plus-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2-and-last-vegas"},{"id":"47508923005957","title":"Parental Guidance: All Is Lost, Plus Pacific Rim on DVD","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: All Is Lost, Plus Pacific Rim on DVDWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | October 18, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:All Is Lost 94%Rating: PG-13, for brief strong language.Robert Redford gives a tour-de-force performance in an essentially wordless role as a man stranded alone on a small yacht in the middle of the Indian Ocean. When he does allow himself to break down and speak, on the sixth day of his ordeal, he bellows the four-letter word the rest of us would have shouted early and often on day one. Nothing frightening happens in director J.C. Chandor’s powerfully precise film -not in the traditional, horror-flick sense of the word. But Redford’s character’s struggle for survival steadily intensifies with each new problem until it becomes almost unbearably harrowing. Some tweens might find themselves a little bored by the quiet tone and languid pacing. But All Is Lost also could serve as an inspiring tale of resourcefulness and perseverance.New On DVD:Pacific Rim 72%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout, and brief language.Director Guillermo del Toro does not mess around when it comes to creature features, as we know, so the monsters in this spectacularly mounted escape are full of clever, vivid details. This summer blockbuster features giant underwater monsters known as kaiju wreaking havoc on major cities across the globe; only an army of massive robots can stop them and save humanity. It’s big, dumb fun that might be too scary for littler ones but just right for eager tweens. One sequence, however, will be unnerving for viewers of any age: a flashback to a little girl scurrying through the decimated streets of Japan, sobbing as she tries to flee the beast that just killed her parents.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"IFC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-all-is-lost-plus-pacific-rim-on-dvd"},{"id":"47508923001860","title":"Parental Guidance: Halloween Edition","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Halloween EditionThis week, Christy offers up some family-friendly alternatives for October 31st.by Christy Lemire | October 25, 2013 |  CommentsGreetings, parents seeking guidance. Since Halloween is coming, I thought I’d devote this week’s column to some films and TV shows you could watch with your kids that are spooky/silly/suspenseful/all of the above. Cuddle up under a blanket in front of the TV and let’s go:It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown 94%My almost-4-year-old son is totally into classic Peanuts cartoons lately, which makes me very happy. What’s so great about these old clips — and this one in particular — is the way it depicts the sweetly funny confusion and angst of childhood. This TV special finds Linus waiting for The Great Pumpkin (as usual) and having no one believe in its existence (as usual). Hopefully when you and your kids go trick-or-treating this year, no one gets a rock.Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride 84%Wondrous, strange, poignant and beautifully reflective of Tim Burton’s distinctive, darkly humorous style. With an all-star voice cast led by Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, the film follows the romantic troubles of a shy young man torn between the woman his parents have arranged for him to marry and the woman who rises from the Land of the Dead and accidentally becomes his wife. At a brisk 74 minutes, the whole family can enjoy it.Frankenweenie 87%I swear, I will do more than just pick Tim Burton movies, but so many of them are so very fitting in this category. Like Corpse Bride, this comedy features painstakingly detailed stop-motion animation. Based on his 1984 live-action short of the same name, Frankenweenie follows what happens when a science-obsessed 10-year-old brings his dead dog back to life. This is not really a movie for little kids. But it’s heartwarming, I promise.Edward Scissorhands 90%This one’s probably best for tweens and older – I saw it with my mother when I was 18 and home from college for Christmas break and we just cried and cried. This is probably still my favorite Burton film; absurdly funny and achingly melancholy, it’s the perfect crystallization of his signature themes and aesthetic. It’s also an excellent example of his longtime collaboration with Depp.9 57%Not to be confused with Nine, based on the Broadway musical, which isn’t scary in the slightest. The animation is breathtakingly original in this dark family tale of roughhewn rag dolls who represent the last vestige of humanity in a post-apocalyptic world. The story itself is rather thin but it’s always gorgeous to watch (although it’s probably not suitable for the littlest kids). Elijah Wood, Christopher Plummer and John C. Reilly are among the strong voice cast.Sleeping Beauty 89%Or if you really want to give your kids nightmares, show them Fantasia (1940) – it still scares me and I’m a grown woman. All classic Disney animated films contain some serious element of danger: a fire in the woods, an evil queen. Sleeping Beauty is my childhood favorite of the genre. The imagery is so vibrant and lush, it makes the film’s villain — the snubbed witch Maleficent, out for revenge against our fair heroine — that much more vivid and frightening.Stand by Me 91%Not exactly a horror movie per se, although it does originate from a Stephen King novella. What Rob Reiner’s film does so well is capture the sensation that there’s adventure and danger lurking in the prosaic activities of daily life when you’re growing up. Set in the summer of 1959, it’s also one of the best coming-of-age films you can show your kids as well as a wonderful (and poignant) time capsule of its stars, including the late River Phoenix.The Wizard of Oz 99%&nbsp;&nbsp;","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Brie, ESPN, Annual, shows, docudrama, Cannes, Critics, indie, leads, Extras, motion, breaking, scary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-halloween-edition"},{"id":"47508921439233","title":"Parental Guidance: Geography Club, Plus Turbo and Man of Steel","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Geography Club, Plus Turbo and Man of SteelWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | November 15, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Geography Club 67%Rating: PG-13, for thematic material involving sexuality and bullying, sexual content including references, language and teen drinking.This high school drama is opening in limited release in a few cities this weekend but it’s also available on demand, and is very much worth seeking out – especially if you have pre-teens or teenagers in your family. An adaptation of a young adult novel of the same name, Geography Club follows the unlikely (and undercover) romance that blossoms between a shy high school student (Cameron Deane Stewart) and a closeted jock (Justin Deeley). When a fellow student catches them kissing, she invites them to join the Geography Club, a clandestine group of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered kids who meet once a week after class. There are some cringe-inducing stereotypes but for the most part the film has a sweet, light touch and an important message of self-acceptance for adolescent viewers. You may have to have a frank discussion with your kids afterward, but perhaps that’s not such a bad thing.New On DVD:Turbo 67%Rating: PG, for some mild action and thematic elements.An extremely mild PG-rated animated adventure about a pokey but plucky garden snail (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) who dreams of being fast. After being caught up in a drag race (and sucked into a car’s nitrous oxide tank) he gets his chance, and ultimately competes in the Indianapolis 500. There he finds himself in constant danger of being run over by all of the big, vrooming racecars (one of which is driven by a generically menacing, foreign bad guy), which might be vaguely stressful for young viewers. But come on! Even a 4-year-old knows nothing terrible could befall this mouthy mollusk.Man of Steel 56%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of sci-fi violence, action and destruction, and for some language.In contrast with Turbo, this is a really hard PG-13. It’s much more serious in tone and theme than previous incarnations of the Superman legend (a shift I actually appreciated), but it also has serious superhero violence – which results in serious destruction. Henry Cavill as Superman and Michael Shannon as General Zod try their hardest to beat each other to a pulp, which results in the decimation of major city blocks in a way that uncomfortably recalls 9/11. The image of strangers grabbing each others’ hands and scurrying in fear as chunks of debris crumble all around them is especially unsettling. Sure, it’s all the work of blockbuster special effects, but it may be disturbing to some viewers. Then there’s that whole pesky conversation you may have to have with your comics-obsessed kids about some of the choices Superman makes here. This one’s probably better for older kids.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"rom-coms, Kids, technology, best, pirates, and, Travel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-geography-club-plus-turbo-and-man-of-steel"},{"id":"47508923014154","title":"Parental Guidance: Salinger, Stories We Tell and From Up on Poppy Hill","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Salinger, Stories We Tell and From Up on Poppy HillWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | September 5, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Salinger 36%Rating: PG-13, for disturbing war images, thematic elements and smoking.J.D. Salinger, who famously went into hiding in the New Hampshire woods after the smash success of his 1951 debut novel, The Catcher in the Rye, is the subject of this exhaustive documentary. Director Shane Salerno spent nine years working on the film, which feels like an overstuffed, overlong mish-mosh of all his research and interviews. If your kid hasn’t already read the novel in 10th-grade English class, that rite of passage surely is coming, making Salinger a useful educational exercise. All that’s disturbing here — and it is indeed disturbing — is the use of archival photographs of the World War II combat and concentration camps that so deeply moved Salinger as a man and a writer.New On DVD:Stories We Tell 94%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements involving sexuality, brief strong language and smoking.Canadian actress-turned-filmmaker Sarah Polley turns her lens on her own family for this documentary in which she explores truth, identity and the fleeting nature of memory. Through a dryly amusing mix of interviews, narration, archival footage and seamless reenactments, Polley examines her family’s past to reveal who they — and she — have become today. She offers some revelations that are mature in nature involving infidelity and pregnancy, but nothing that would be inappropriate for older tweens and teens. Cleverly structured and constantly surprising, it’s one of the absolute best films of the year.From Up on Poppy Hill 86%Rating: PG, for mild thematic elements and some incidental smoking images.One of the kinder, gentler offerings from Studio Ghibli, which brought us Hayao Miyazaki’s animated classics including Spirited Away and Howl’s Moving Castle. Goro Miyazaki, his son, directs this superbly drawn if slightly dull tale set in early-1960s Japan as the country prepares to host the Summer Olympics while still reeling from the effects of World War II. Two schoolmates (voiced by Sarah Bolger and Anton Yelchin) join a group that’s fighting to save a clubhouse and find that there might be even more than binds them. There are brief discussions of war and death, but otherwise the colorful visuals and youthful energy make this suitable for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"disaster, travel, Carpet, PBS, festival, show, women, rotten, Stephen, YA, spanish","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-salinger-stories-we-tell-and-from-up-on-poppy-hill"},{"id":"47508923009031","title":"Parental Guidance: Gravity and Parkland","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Gravity and ParklandWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | October 4, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:Gravity 95%Rating: PG-13, for intense perilous sequences, some disturbing images and brief strong language.The sense of tension and the possibility of death are constant in Alfonso Cuaron’s minor masterpiece about a veteran astronaut (George Clooney) and a medical engineer on her first mission (Sandra Bullock) who find themselves lost in space. It’s an incredibly beautiful and harrowing film – technically flawless and emotionally resonant. Yes, there is some language — you’d probably curse, too, if you were floating around in the vast blackness, cut off from Earth — and some violent images as one terrifying thing after another occurs. Older kids — especially those with an interest in space exploration — will totally dig this.Parkland 50%Rating: PG-13, for bloody sequences of ER trauma procedures, some violent images and language, and smoking throughout.This star-studded drama (Zac Efron, Marcia Gay Harden, Paul Giamatti, Billy Bob Thornton, Jacki Weaver, the list goes on) depicts the assassination of President Kennedy from the perspective of various people caught up in that horrific event. They include Secret Service and FBI agents, Abraham Zapruder (who famously shot the film that captured the killing) and the trauma surgeons at Parkland Hospital, where the president ultimately was pronounced dead. Although director Peter Landesman takes a detached, matter-of-fact tone — and doesn’t show us the shooting itself — he still depicts a graphically bloody scene, which would be uncomfortable for anyone to watch. Thematically, this is probably best for older kids.New On DVD:The Croods 72%Rating: PG, for some scary action.A visually sublime but thematically simple animated film about a prehistoric family on a road trip. Dad (voiced by Nicolas Cage) is afraid of everything. His daughter, Eep (Emma Stone), constantly makes him nervous with her sense of daring – especially when she meets a guy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who introduces them all to a thing called fire. The overly facile message here is: Trying new things is good. It’s a useful notion for kids in the crowd to chew on, but their older companions may be longing for something more substantive. Toward the end, there are some seismic shifts that create a few moments of danger, but otherwise this colorful, vibrant 3-D adventure is suitable for all ages.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"TV, heist, movies, park, All, Toys, Kemper, your, toy, Set","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-gravity-and-parkland"},{"id":"47508921437184","title":"Parental Guidance: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Delivery Man, Plus Planes and Paranoia","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and Delivery Man, Plus Planes and ParanoiaWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | November 22, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 90%Rating: PG-13, for intense sequences of violence and action, some frightening images, thematic elements, a suggestive situation and language.The sequel to last year’s smash-hit The Hunger Games is every bit as violent and suspenseful as its predecessor. But this time, there’s an even greater sense of dread as a bloody revolution is sweeping the districts of dystopian Panem. The full force of the totalitarian regime against which the masses are rebelling also feels clearer — and more frightening — than in the original film. At its center is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, the co-victor of the last Hunger Games who must fight for her life once more. At its core, all of these films based on the Suzanne Collins novels are about young people being forced into an elaborate and sadistic competition in which they must kill each other for the greater good of their people. It’s a heady and disturbing concept. As executed here, it’s often a bloody and gruesome one, as well. Older kids only – anyone younger than Katniss’ little sister, Prim, should probably wait a bit longer to enter the arena.Delivery Man 40%Rating: PG-13, for thematic elements, sexual content, some drug material, brief violence and language.Vince Vaughn stars in this feel-good comedy as a middle-aged underachiever who discovers he’s the biological father of hundreds of children from the many sperm donations he made two decades ago. This inspires a series of jokes in which the act of masturbation is described in colorful ways. Vaughn’s character finds the need to insert himself surreptitiously in his kids’ lives and perform kind deeds for them, which leads to some dramatic situations. One of his daughters nearly overdoses on heroin, for example; we see her passed out on a bed before paramedics arrive to rush her by ambulance to a hospital. Thematically, this is probably best for older tweens and up.New On DVD:Planes 25%Rating: PG, for some mild action and rude humor.This is an extremely gentle PG-rated animated film. It’s a spin-off of the Cars world, which explains why those big eyes in the planes’ windshields look so familiar. Dane Cook provides the voice of a crop-duster who dreams of competing in an around-the-world air race. He finds himself in a couple of potentially dangerous situations, including a severe storm, which might seem mildly distressing. There’s also a flashback to a World War II combat sequence. And of course, there is the obligatory poop joke. Because kids love poop. Totally suitable for all ages.Paranoia 7%Rating: PG-13, for some sexuality, violence and language.Between Hunger Games movies, Australian hunk Liam Hemsworth starred in this techno-thriller which would be completely forgettable except for the presence of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman in juicy supporting roles. I’m not sure why your kids would want to see this movie — it’s a clichéd, shiny bore — but if for some reason it pops up on your television, there are a few potentially mature elements to look out for. They include fast-paced chases, staged car accidents and heavy firepower. There’s also a healthy amount of language and a tasteful sex scene between Hemsworth and Amber Heard.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"LGBT, on, service, CBS, Kaling, The, toy, Hallmark, History, Video, FX, TCA, Bowl","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-and-delivery-man-plus-planes-and-paranoia"},{"id":"47508924127255","title":"Parental Guidance: The Internship, Warm Bodies, and Escape from Planet Earth","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Internship, Warm Bodies, and Escape from Planet EarthWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | June 6, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;There’s something new for everyone in the fam in theaters and on DVD this week, from a goofy workplace comedy (The Internship) to a zombie-tastic love affair (Warm Bodies) to an animated alien extravaganza (Escape from Planet Earth). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:The Internship 35%What’s it about? In the midst of the Cold War, a bunch of Navy pilots with names like Maverick and Iceman talk trash and play volleyball.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “sexuality, some crude humor, partying and language.” In other words, expect a much milder brand of comedy from the Wedding Crashers stars, one that should be safe for high schoolers.Is it any good? Critics say The Internship gets plenty of mileage out of its amiable leads, but it’s pretty predictable and slackly paced.New On DVD:Warm Bodies 81%What’s it about? Warm Bodies is the tale of a star-crossed love affair between a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer), a human, who meet in the wake of a zombie apocalypse. It’s kinda like a certain Shakespeare play, only with more brain-eating.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for zombie violence and some language.” It’s based on a popular YA novel, and while it might be a little too intense for younger kids, it’s safe for teens.Is it any good? Critics say the Certified Fresh Warm Bodies puts a funny and charming twist on both the zombie and forbidden teen romance subgenres.Escape from Planet Earth 35%What’s it about? Alien astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is tricked into landing on earth and subsequently held captive at Area 51, so it’s up to his nerdy brother Gary (Rob Corddry) to rescue him — and their home planet.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “action and some mild rude humor.” Some of the action scenes may be too intense for sensitive children, but it’s mostly safe for most in the elementary school set.Is it any good? Critics say Escape From Planet Earth is passable family entertainment that should satisfy young kids, but their parents are likely to find it pretty bland.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Pacific, pirates, Superheroes, Go, Freeform, zero, monsters, Mary, El, visit, Comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-internship-warm-bodies-and-escape-from-planet-earth"},{"id":"47508924134424","title":"Parental Guidance: After Earth and Now You See Me","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: After Earth and Now You See MeWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | May 30, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week’s two wide releases have a lot in common: they’re both rated PG-13, and they’re both hitting theaters with few advanced reviews.

Dane Cook provides the voice of Dusty, a crop-dusting plane who dreams of taking part in an around-the-world race. Kind of like a snail who dreams of competing in the Indianapolis 500…but anyway. This is extremely kid-friendly, to the point of being colorfully bland. True danger only exists briefly in a couple of scenes: a bad storm that threatens Dusty’s survival over an ocean and a quick World War II flashback. Your kids may be bored (my 3 ½-year-old was — and eventually, he fell asleep) but they’ll never be truly frightened. Oh, and of course there’s the obligatory poop joke, right at the end. ‘Cause poop is funny.Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters 42%Rating: PG for fantasy action violence, some scary images and mild language.It’s rated PG but there’s actually some legitimately scary stuff in this sequel to 2010’s Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. Monsters kill a little girl in the opening scene. A giant, transforming robot bull rampages through an idyllic forest community, trying to trample, gore and shoot fire at the pleasingly multicultural mix of demigod teens and satyrs who live there. And after taking on a fearsome Cyclops, Poseidon’s son Percy (Logan Lerman) and his pals must conquer the giant, stomping, child-eating Titan Kronos. The theater was packed with families, but this Harry Potter knock-off is probably suitable for kids ages 7 or 8 and up.New On DVD:Oblivion 53%Rating: PG-13, for sci-fi action violence, brief strong language, and some sensuality/nudity.A visually dazzling but narratively derivative sci-fi thriller starring Tom Cruise as a drone mechanic in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world (as if there were any other kind). Machines think for themselves in ways that may seem a little startling. The decimation of the planet provides some arresting imagery, but it probably won’t seem too disturbing for older kids who are interested in this genre. There are some intense chase sequences, some confrontations with predatory alien creatures, a bit of language and a glass-bottom space pool where Cruise cavorts with his live-in work partner/love interest. Overall, suitable for older kids.Mud 97%Rating: PG-13, for some violence, sexual references, language, thematic elements and smoking.One of the best movies of the year also happens to be a really strong pick for older kids — say, tweens and up — who are capable of handling some sophisticated subject matter. Director Jeff Nichols’ Southern coming-of-age drama follows a couple of 14-year-old boys who befriend a fugitive killer played by a charismatic and frightening Matthew McConaughey. These are not pretentious, cutesy moppets but rather tough kids who end up in danger — which includes being shot at by bad guys. One of the boys also finds himself in serious peril when a deadly snake bites him. Just as startling for these kids, though, is the shattering of their illusions about the way the grown-up world really works.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"comedies, drama, Dates, Fox, fast, GLAAD, Century, Plus, 2021, Esquire, awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-planes-and-percy-jackson-sea-of-monsters"},{"id":"47508923029521","title":"Parental Guidance: Turbo, R.I.P.D., and More","content":"\n\n                                            Parental Guidance\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Parental Guidance: Turbo, R.I.P.D., and More\n                        We give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.\n                        by Christy Lemire | July 19, 2013                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                In Theaters This Week:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurbo\n 67%\nRating: PG, for some mild action and thematic elements.\nWhy this family-friendly animated film gets a PG rating is sort of baffling. It’s colorful, lively and has a positive (if overly simplistic) message for all ages: Dream big. Ryan Reynolds provides the voice of a garden snail who wants to be fast. After getting mixed up in a drag race (and sucked into a car’s nitrous oxide tank) he gets his chance, and eventually ends up competing in the Indianapolis 500. There, Turbo is in constant danger of getting squished by cars, but even that doesn’t play out in terribly frightening fashion. I took my 3 ½-year-old son and a couple of his friends to see it and they were all enraptured the entire time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed 2\n 44%\nRating: PG-13, for pervasive action and violence including frenetic gunplay, and for some language and drug material.\nThere’s an insane amount of gunfire in this sequel, which finds the aging special agents from Red — played by Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren — getting dragged out of retirement, again, to save the world, again. Yes, it’s intentionally over-the-top, given that the original source material is a graphic novel. Countless rounds fly through the air but there’s nary a drop of blood to be found when they hit their targets. Mirren’s character takes out a bad guy in a bathtub full of acid, but the carnage is merely implied. Oh, and a nuclear weapon goes off. No biggie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR.I.P.D.\n 13%\nRating: PG-13, for violence, sci-fi/fantasy action, some sensuality and language including sex references.\nRyan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges play mismatched buddy cops who’ve been killed in the line of duty during different centuries but are thrown together in a sort of purgatory to keep the dead from infiltrating the living world. It’s based on a graphic novel but feels like an inferior Men in Black rip-off, complete with grotesque and menacing beasts who transform before our eyes. They’re disgusting to look at but are never really scary, partly because the 3-D conversion is so shoddy. There’s also quite a bit of gunfire but it’s of the cartoonish variety coming from souped-up, supernatural weaponry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirl Most Likely\n 23%\nRating: PG-13, for sexual content and language.\nKristen Wiig stars in this overly wacky comedy as a once-promising Manhattan playwright who quickly loses her boyfriend, job and apartment. When she pretends to commit suicide, she’s placed in the care of her gambling-addict mother (Annette Bening) and forced to return to her tacky childhood home on the Jersey shore. The more mature themes of suicide, frisky sex and infidelity are probably fine for pre-teens if you don’t mind having some potentially awkward conversations with them to talk them through. There’s also the one F-bomb you get with a PG-13 rating, delivered in subtitled Chinese.\n\n\n\n\nNew On DVD:\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n 81%\nRating: PG-13, for thematic elements including language.\nThe language is really the only thing to be concerned about in this uplifting, well-made drama recounting Jackie Robinson’s historic breaking of Major League Baseball’s color barrier. Chadwick Boseman exudes quiet but forceful dignity as the Brooklyn Dodgers star who suffered intolerable cruelty from opponents and his own teammates alike. One scene in particular is incredibly uncomfortable to watch, as Philadelphia Phillies manager Ben Chapman hammers Robinson with an increasingly vitriolic tirade of racial epithets. It’s difficult for any viewer, regardless of age, but it’s also a great example of how 42 can serve as a teaching moment.\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Lucasfilm, TBS, TV, sports, Family","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-turbo-ripd-and-more"},{"id":"47508924136473","title":"Parental Guidance: Epic and Beautiful Creatures","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Epic and Beautiful CreaturesWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | May 23, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;Two of this week’s major releases (Fast &amp; Furious 6 and The Hangover Part III) skew toward an older crowd, but there’s still a little something in multiplexes for the whole family: Epic, a fantasy adventure with voice work from Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, and Beyonce Knowles. Read on to find out more.In Theaters This Week:Epic 65%What’s it about? While looking for her missing father in a forest, a teenage girl stumbles across fantastical creatures and finds herself in the midst of a battle between good and evil.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “mild action, some scary images and brief rude language.” A parent is separated from his child, and some of the tiny magical characters might spook younger children, but it’s probably safe for ages eight and up.Is it any good? Critics say Epic‘s plot will seem familiar even to children, but it’s an exciting, beautifully animated fantasy that’s witty and often inspired.New On DVD:Beautiful Creatures 47%What’s it about? Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) is instantly smitten by Lena (Alice Englert), who’s just moved to his small southern town. But their budding love affair is endangered by Lena’s supernatural powers.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “violence, scary images, and some sexual material.” Beautiful Creatures isn’t super racy or intense; in fact, the bigger concern is that it will make teens go all swoony.Is it any good? Critics say the cast is likable, but the plot is predictable, and the whole thing plays like a (slightly) smarter, Dixie-fied version of Twilight.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Plus, films, &, Peacock, Games, TBS, Star, psychological, vampires, globe","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-epic-and-beautiful-creatures"},{"id":"47508924140571","title":"Parental Guidance: The Great Gatsby, Jack Reacher, and Safe Haven","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Great Gatsby, Jack Reacher, and Safe HavenWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | May 9, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week, Baz Luhrmann’s jazzy, stylized adaptation of The Great Gatsby hits theaters, giving families a golden opportunity to compare and contrast the differences between the film and the book. Plus, the action-packed Tom Cruise vehicle Jack Reacher and the romantic drama Safe Haven head to DVD shelves. Read on to find out what’s appropriate for family viewing.In Theaters This Week:The Great Gatsby 48%What’s it about? Yale grad and World War I vet Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) is drawn into the orbit of Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a mysterious millionaire who throws lavish parties and flaunts the trappings of affluence in an effort to win the heart of Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), who’s married to a rich jerk.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for some violent images, sexual content, smoking, partying and brief language.” It’s certainly safe for young teens, particularly those who would like a visual companion to their English homework.Is it any good? Critics say Baz Luhrmann’s take on The Great Gatsby is visually stylish, and features a strong performance from DiCaprio, but overall it misses the spirit and the emotional weight of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel.New On DVD:Jack Reacher 64%What’s it about? Tom Cruise stars as the title character, a former Army M.P. who is called upon to investigate a mass shooting and uncovers a web of intrigue.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for violence, language and some drug material.” Given that it’s a story about a sniper, Jack Reacher might be a tough sell to some parents after the recent shooting in Newtown, but it’s probably safe for teens.Is it any good? Critics say that while Jack Reacher doesn’t reinvent the wheel, it’s an above-average crime thriller with a charismatic performance from Cruise.Safe Haven 14%What’s it about? Katie (Julianne Hough) arrives in town haunted by a dark secret from her past. Eventually, she falls for widowed single dad Alex (Josh Duhamel). But will the aforementioned dark secret intrude on her new life?Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for thematic material involving threatening behavior, and for violence and sexuality.” Safe Haven is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, so expect it to get all kissy-kissy.Is it any good? Critics say Safe Haven is schmaltzy, conventional, and fluffily romatic. In other words, it’s like most other movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"All","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-great-gatsby-jack-reacher-and-safe-haven"},{"id":"47508923027472","title":"Parental Guidance: The Wolverine and Blue Jasmine","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Wolverine and Blue JasmineWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Christy Lemire | July 26, 2013 |  CommentsIn Theaters This Week:The Wolverine 71%Rating: PG-13, for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence, some sexuality and language.This is an incredibly violent film, which isn’t all that shocking given that its central character is a volatile, immortal mutant with giant metal claws that sprout from his knuckles. Still, The Wolverine really pushes the limits of what you can get away with in a PG-13 film. Hugh Jackman plays X-Men hero Logan/Wolverine for the sixth time here in an adventure that takes the Marvel Comics character to Japan. There, many, many people die in efficient and elegantly choreographed ways. But we see actual blood come from Wolverine himself, when he finds out what it feels like to ache and bleed without instant healing. A breathtaking fight atop a speeding bullet train also results in some peril and serious injury. Older kids who’ve played a lot of video games and/or read a lot of comic books probably won’t be bothered by any of this, but it’s probably too intense for those under tween age.Blue Jasmine 90%Rating: PG-13, for mature thematic material, language and sexual content.For those sophisticated, artsy kids who are into Woody Allen films, this is one of his best in the past decade. Cate Blanchett stars as a Blanche DuBois-type figure who’s forced to leave the high-society comfort of New York to live with her sister in a tiny San Francisco apartment. Flashbacks reveal the stuff that earns the movie a PG-13 rating: frank discussions about infidelity and the financial schemes that destroyed Blanchett’s cushy life. In the present-day scenes, there’s also profanity and major pill popping and vodka guzzling, but nothing terribly startling.New On DVD:Ginger &amp; Rosa 78%Rating: PG-13, for mature disturbing thematic material involving teen choices — sexuality, drinking and smoking — and for language.It’s a coming-of-age drama set in London in the early 1960s, so naturally the two young women of the film’s title are going to experiment with drinking, and smoking, and boys. What gives Ginger &amp; Rosa a disturbing undercurrent, though, is the relationship that drives a wedge between these childhood best friends, as Rosa (Alice Englert) becomes romantically entwined with Ginger’s father, a charismatic bohemian played by Alessandro Nivola. Elle Fanning gives the performance of her young life as Ginger, which includes a dramatic breakdown that’s difficult to watch.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"The, documentaries","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-wolverine-and-blue-jasmine"},{"id":"47508924141596","title":"Parental Guidance: Iron Man 3 and The Guilt Trip","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Iron Man 3 and The Guilt TripWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | May 2, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in family filmgoing, we’ve got an action-packed superhero adventure (Iron Man 3) and a tale of mother-son bonding (The Guilt Trip).

Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is still recovering from the events of The Avengers, while leaving the management of Stark International to Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Pepper is approached by an old colleague of Tony’s about a new organic technology, but will it be a blessing or a curse — and how will Iron Man respond to threats from a ruthless terrorist?Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout, and brief suggestive content.” Expect more raffish behavior from Tony and a bunch of loud explosions and perilous situations that are probably ok for middle schoolers but too intense for younger kids.Is it any good? Critics say the Certified Fresh Iron Man 3 is a witty, entertaining adventure and a strong addition to the Marvel canon.New On DVD:The Guilt Trip 37%What’s it about? Seth Rogen stars as an inventor who plans to drive cross-country to pitch his newest product. He invites his overbearing mom (Barbra Streisand) along in an attempt to fix her up with an old boyfriend in San Francisco.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “language and some risqué material.” It’s probably safe for teens.Is it any good?

Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi star as outlandish Vegas stage magicians whose popularity is threatened by big egos, personal animosity, and the rise of a hip street magician (Jim Carrey).Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “sexual content, dangerous stunts, a drug-related incident and language.” The Incredible Burt Wonderstone is a little raunchy in spots, though its violence is mostly slapsticky; 13-year-olds should be fine.Is it any good? Critics say The Incredible Burt Wonderstone serves up some goofy laughs, but for such an outrageous conceit, it’s surprisingly safe and predictable.New On DVD:Rise of the Guardians 75%What’s it about? In this animated feature from DreamWorks, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Jack Frost, and other folkloric types team up to battle a nightmare-purveying baddie named Pitch.Who’s it for? Rise of the Guardians is rated PG “for thematic elements and some mildly scary action.” Kindergarteners and above will probably be able to handle it, though the film does demystify its protagonists, which might be troubling to more sensitive children.Is it any good? Critics say the little ones will probably like it just fine, and that their guardians will probably be mildly amused as well. It’s got some solid gags and terrific visuals.Life of Pi 86%What’s it about? A guy survives a shipwreck only to end up in a lifeboat with a tiger.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG “for emotional thematic content throughout, and some scary action sequences and peril.” It will almost certainly bore little kids, but it should be fine for eighth graders up.Is it any good?

After the cave they call home is destroyed, a stone-age family journeys across its pre-historic environs, encountering wild beasts and learning to love and trust each other along the way.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “some scary action.” Despite it’s title, The Croods is pretty wholesome fare, though some little kids might be frightened by various animal attacks.Is it any good?

Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf go on a journey to recapture the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from an evil dragon, meeting some wild characters — including the mischievous Gollum — along the way.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for extended sequences of intense fantasy action violence, and frightening images.” The film features beheadings, stabbings, characters in peril, and scary orcs and trolls, among other things, so you should probably leave the little ones at home, though teens will be fine with it.Is it any good? Critics say The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a notable step down from the Lord of the Rings trilogy — though it’s visually stunning and well acted, it’s also overlong and sometimes feels overextended.Les Misérables 70%What’s it about? Hugh Jackman stars as Jean Valjean, an ex-con turned factory owner who takes care of his ex-employee Fantine (Anne Hathaway) and her daughter while avoiding the ruthless Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe).Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “suggestive and sexual material, violence and thematic elements.” It’s got a couple brutal beatings, and it delves into the world of prostitution, so this is probably one for young high schoolers and up.Is it any good? Critics say Les Misérables is often over-the-top, but the performances are excellent, and director Tom Hooper injects a sense of grit and passion to the proceedings.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"shows, Amazon, witnail, screen","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-croods-the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey-and-les-miserables"},{"id":"47508925837348","title":"Parental Guidance: Oz the Great and Powerful and Wreck-it Ralph","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Oz the Great and Powerful and Wreck-it RalphWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | March 8, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in new family films, we’ve got a pair of protagonists who must journey to unfamiliar lands, be it a magical realm (Oz the Great and Powerful) or a different arcade cabinet (Wreck-it Ralph). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for family viewing.In Theaters This Week:Oz the Great and Powerful 57%What’s it about? James Franco stars as a roguish carnival magician who finds himself transported to a magical world. There, he meets a trio of witches and is treated like a king. Can our hero summon the courage and smarts to bring peace to the land of Oz?Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “sequences of action and scary images, and brief mild language.” Oz is certainly too intense for younger viewers; the film includes hordes of bloodthirsty baboons, people turning into witches, and a spooky graveyard scene, among other things.Is it any good? Critics say Oz the Great and Powerful doesn’t approach the magic of the 1939 Wizard of Oz, but it carves out a personality of its own, with breathtaking special effects and witty performances.New On DVD:Wreck-it Ralph 87%What’s it about? Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the bad guy in a retro arcade game, but he longs for acceptance and love from his fellow video game characters. So he ventures out of his game in search of adventure and respect — a trek that could have devastating consequences for his pixilated peers.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “some rude humor and mild action/violence.” It’s probably safe for second graders – as a movie about video games, it’s decidedly less intense than your average first-person shooter.Is it any good? Critics say the Certified Fresh Wreck-it Ralph is a visual phantasmagoria with a clever story and heartfelt characters that should appeal to kids and their parents.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"and, DirecTV, parents, Pacific, TV, of, lord, Toys, Universal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-oz-the-great-and-powerful-and-wreck-it-ralph"},{"id":"47508925850666","title":"Parental Guidance: Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Hansel and Gretel: Witch HuntersWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | January 24, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in theaters, we’ve got a big screen fairy tale adaptation about a pair of vigilante witch killers. Now, we all know that much of the Grimm brothers’ bibliography is filled with violent tales, but is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters safe for the whole family? Read on to find out.New In Theaters:Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters 16%What’s it about? Years after escaping from the gingerbread house, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are a sibling vigilante squad, ridding the German countryside of witches with the same relish displayed by Charles Bronson in Death Wish.Who’s it for? It’s rated R “for strong fantasy horror violence and gore, brief sexuality/nudity and language.” Don’t be fooled by the fairy tale title — we’re pretty far from Mother Goose territory here.Is it any good? We’d love to tell you more about this one, but it doesn’t screen for critics until later in the week, which is never a good sign.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"werewolf, universal, Games, on, HBO, japanese, FX, king, Sneak, 24, Mystery","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-hansel-and-gretel-witch-hunters"},{"id":"47508925845543","title":"Parental Guidance: A Good Day to Die Hard and Skyfall","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: A Good Day to Die Hard and SkyfallWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Ryan Fujitani and Tim Ryan | February 13, 2013 |  CommentsThis Presidents Day, there’s a little something for everyone in the family, in both the multiplex and on home video. We’ve got four new wide releases (A Good Day to Die Hard, Safe Haven, Escape From Planet Earth 3D, and Beautiful Creatures), plus some choice rentals (Skyfall, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Bully) that should hold appeal to family members of various ages. Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:A Good Day to Die Hard 14%What’s it about? John McClane (Bruce Willis) goes to Russia to help his son (Jai Courtney), a CIA agent in the midst of an undercover operation. Subsequently, stuff gets blowed up real good.Who’s it for? It’s rated R for “violence and language.” Some folks made a big deal about that R-rating, especially since it comes on the heels of the PG-13 Live Free or Die Hard. Either way, it’s probably fine for teens, though a little raw for middle schoolers.Is it any good? The critics say A Good Day to Die Hard is unequivocally the worst entry in a storied franchise, and even Bruce Willis’ smirking demeanor can barely enliven a clichéd, uninspired script.Safe Haven 14%What’s it about? Katie (Julianne Hough) arrives in town haunted by a dark secret from her past. Eventually, she falls for widowed single dad Alex (Josh Duhamel). But will the aforementioned dark secret intrude on her new life?Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for thematic material involving threatening behavior, and for violence and sexuality.” Safe Haven is based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, so expect it to get all kissy-kissy.Is it any good? Critics say Safe Haven is schmaltzy, conventional, and fluffily romantic. In other words, it’s like most other movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels.Escape from Planet Earth 3D 35%What’s it about? Alien astronaut Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is tricked into landing on earth and subsequently held captive at Area 51, so it’s up to his nerdy brother Gary (Rob Corddry) to rescue him — and their home planet.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “action and some mild rude humor.” Some of the action scenes may be too intense for sensitive children, but it’s mostly safe for most in the elementary school set.Is it any good? Probably not, since it wasn’t screened for critics.Beautiful Creatures 47%What’s it about? Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) is instantly smitten by Lena (Alice Englert), who’s just moved to his small southern town. But their budding love affair is endangered by Lena’s supernatural powers.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “violence, scary images, and some sexual material.” Beautiful Creatures isn’t super racy or intense; in fact, the bigger concern is that it will make teens go all swoony.Is it any good? Critics say the cast is likable, but the plot is predictable, and the whole thing plays like a (slightly) smarter, Dixie-fied version of Twilight.New On DVD:Skyfall 92%What’s it about? Daniel Craig returns as James Bond, hot on the trail of a former agent (Javier Bardem) with a vendetta against M (Judi Dench) and MI6.Who’s it for? Skyfall is rated PG-13 for “intense violent sequences throughout, some sexuality, language and smoking.” Content-wise, it’s pretty much like every James Bond movie ever, though it’s worth noting that while smoking has declined since Sean Connery’s time, the franchise has undoubtedly gotten more risqué. Parents should probably take the rating to heart.Is it any good? Critics have rated it Certified Fresh, and just last weekend it took home the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film and Best Original Music, so chances are strong you’ll like it.The Perks of Being a Wallflower 85%What’s it about? An awkward high school freshman befriends a pair of stepsibling seniors who help him to navigate issues of adolescent acceptance and love.Who’s it for? The Perks of Being a Wallflower is rated PG-13 for “mature thematic material, drug and alcohol use, sexual content including references, and a fight — all involving teens.” These are pretty common features of the contemporary coming-of-age film, but some of the material may feel a bit too grown-up for pre-teens.Is it any good? Perks is another Certified Fresh film, and critics have praised it for its heartfelt earnestness and strong performances. If your kids are mature enough to handle some mildly adult themes, this is worth a watch.Bully 85%What’s it about? Documentarian Lee Hirsch follows one school year in the lives of five students in different states who have been the victims of bullying, offering a sobering commentary on the hot-button issue.Who’s it for? Bully is rated PG-13 for “intense thematic material, disturbing content, and some strong language — all involving kids.” The film initially received an R rating due to its uncensored language, which drew criticism from those who feared audiences who most needed to see the film — children — wouldn’t be allowed. The studio toned down the language a bit to get the PG-13, but we are talking about school bullies here, so expect some coarse dialogue, as well as heated exchanges and physical altercations.Is it any good? Bully is yet another Certified Fresh movie on this week’s list, and critics say it’s a gracefully filmed, character-driven doc that carries a powerful message and arguably should be watched by anyone old enough to know what a bully is.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Avengers, Elton","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-a-good-day-to-die-hard-and-skyfall"},{"id":"47508925847592","title":"Parental Guidance: Top Gun and Here Comes the Boom","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Top Gun and Here Comes the BoomWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | February 7, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in family viewing brings the theatrical re-release of an iconic 1980s action flick (Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer) and a mixed martial arts comedy on DVD (Here Comes the Boom, starring Kevin James and Salma Hayek). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:Top Gun 57%What’s it about? In the midst of the Cold War, a bunch of Navy pilots with names like Maverick and Iceman talk trash and play volleyball.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “action Sequences, language and some sexual content.” Top Gun was pretty racy for those of who came of age in the 1980s, and some of the language is pretty coarse, but on the whole the movie is safe for young teens.Is it any good? Top Gun helped to make Tom Cruise the biggest star on the planet, and it features some exhilarating flight sequences, but critics found it to be more stylish than emotionally involving.New On DVD:Here Comes the Boom 41%What’s it about? Kevin James stars as an indifferent high school teacher who is roused into action when the school is threatened with budget cuts. His solution: raise money by battling on the mixed martial arts circuit.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “for bouts of MMA sports violence, some rude humor and language.” It’s likely to seem pretty mild compared to a typical night of televised UFC.Is it any good? Critics say James is surprisingly convincing as a fighter, but Here Comes the Boom is a little too bland and predictable to work as a whole.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"television, documentary, Guide, movies, Seed, lord, indie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-top-gun-and-here-comes-the-boom"},{"id":"47508927454259","title":"Parental Guidance: The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 and Brave","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 and BraveOur new weekly column takes a look at the best bets for family movie night.by Tim Ryan | November 15, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;This week is relatively slim pickings for family-friendly moviegoing. In theaters, we’ve got The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2, the conclusion to the teen-centric vampire franchise; and on DVD we’ve got Brave, Pixar’s animated ode to girl power. In addition, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln, which we profiled last week, opens in wide release. However, other noteworthy releases, including Anna Karenina (in limited release) and The Watch (on DVD) are rated R, so proceed with caution. Without further ado, check out the best bets for family viewing this week!In Theaters This Week:The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 49%What’s it about? It’s the concluding chapter of a wildly popular franchise in which vampires and werewolves do battle for the affections of a stubborn teenage girl.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “sequences of violence including disturbing images, some sensuality and partial nudity.” Several media reports indicate it came close to getting an R, so you might think twice about letting middle schoolers see it, but it’s probably fine for young teens.Is it any good? The Twilight movies have never been critical darlings, though that matters not a whit to Twi-hards. For what it’s worth, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is getting the best reviews in franchise history, so it looks like they saved the best for last.New On DVD:Brave 78%What’s it about? It’s the story of a Scottish princess who eschews stereotypically girly pursuits to ride horses and shoot arrows in the forest – and who must rescue her mother from a magic spell.Who’s it for? Brave is rated PG “for some scary action and rude humor.” Take that seriously, especially if you’ve got Kindergartners — there are a couple dark moments that are likely to give the wee ones nightmares.Is it any good? Brave is Certified Fresh, and though some critics found it to be a step down from previous Pixar triumphs, they largely appreciated its visuals and its strong female characters — a rarity in the studio’s output.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Central","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-2-and-brave"},{"id":"47508927445040","title":"Parental Guidance: Playing for Keeps and The Dark Knight Rises","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Playing for Keeps and The Dark Knight RisesCheck out our rundown of what is (and isn't) kid-friendly this week.by Tim Ryan | December 7, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;This week in new family films, we’ve got a sports flick, a superhero blockbuster, and a fantasy film. The week’s lone wide release in theaters is Playing for Keeps, starring Gerard Butler as a desirable soccer coach. On DVD, we’ve got The Dark Knight Rises, starring Christian Bale as the Caped Crusader, and The Odd Life of Timothy Green, a modern fairy tale about a mysterious boy. Read on to find out what’s appropriate for family viewing.In Theaters This Week:Playing for Keeps 4%What’s it about? Gerard Butler stars as a washed-up soccer star who tries to bond with his son by coaching his junior league soccer team; soon, the other players’ moms are looking to score with the coach.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “for some sexual situations, language and a brief intense image.” Despite a sports angle, it’s mostly about a divorced dad hitting the dating scene, which will probably have limited appeal for kids and teens.Is it any good? The critics say Playing for Keeps is largely a missed opportunity; its talented cast is squandered on a mediocre script.New On DVD:The Dark Knight Rises 87%What’s it about? With Batman (Christian Bale) in self-imposed exile, a couple of costumed criminals — cat burglar Selina Kyle and the muscle-bound terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) have run wild in Gotham City.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “intense sequences of violence and action, some sensuality and language.” The Dark Knight Rises is far too dark and violent for small children: Bane is straight out of your kids’ nightmares, and the movie is filled with fighting, death, and destruction.Is it any good? The Dark Knight Rises is a rousing and emotionally satisfying conclusion to Christopher Nolan’s exemplary Batman trilogy that features fine performances, visceral thrills, and stunning visuals.The Odd Life of Timothy Green 36%What’s it about? Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton star as a childless couple that is visited one stormy night by a lad with leaves on his legs.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “for mild thematic elements and brief language.” Younger viewers will probably find it to be both dark and sad, if these kids are any indication.Is it any good? Critics found The Odd Life of Timothy Green to be a well-meaning but schmaltzy and thinly scripted fantasy.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Avengers, toy, award, movies, cats, 007, monster, President, justice, the","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-playing-for-keeps-and-the-dark-knight-rises"},{"id":"47508925855789","title":"Parental Guidance: Promised Land, The Impossible, and Looper","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Promised Land, The Impossible, and LooperWe give you what you need to know about the family-friendliness of this week's new releases.by Tim Ryan | January 3, 2013 |  Comments&nbsp;With the holiday season officially behind us, we’re relatively short on family-friendly viewing this week. In wide release is the eco-drama Promised Land starring Matt Damon and the family disaster thriller The Impossible starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. And on DVD, we’ve got twisty time travel with Looper, starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Read on to find out what’s appropriate for the whole family.In Theaters This Week:Promised Land 53%What’s it about? Corporate salesman Steve Butler (Matt Damon) is dispatched to an economically depressed town to secure drilling rights for an energy company. However, he meets resistance from a grassroots effort by local residents.Who’s it for? It’s rated R for “for language.” Though there’s nothing in the film that teens probably haven’t heard before, it’s likely they may be bored by this issue-driven drama.Is it any good? Critics say Promised Land contains strong performances, but it’s tonally uneven and overly earnest.The Impossible 81%What’s it about? Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor star as parents on vacation in Thailand with their three children when a brutal tsunami hits and forces them to fight for their lives.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “intense realistic disaster sequences, including disturbing injury images and brief nudity.” In addition to its portrayal of a family in danger, it has a few scenes of graphic gore, so it’s probably not safe for kids below high school age.Is it any good? Critics say The Impossible is a powerful, inspiring tale of survival, and it’s Certified Fresh to boot.New On DVD:Looper 93%What’s it about? It’s 2044, and control of time-travel technology is in the hands of the mob; when they want somebody rubbed out, they send them back 30 years for an assassin to kill. But when one such “looper” (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) is tasked with killing a future version of himself (Bruce Willis), he finds himself on the run from perhaps fate itself.Who’s it for? It’s rated R for “for strong violence, language, some sexuality/nudity and drug content.” Looper also features a home invasion and a child in constant danger, so it’s too much for kids, but thoughtful older teens will find much to savor here.Is it any good? Critics say Rian Johnson’s Certified Fresh third feature pulls off that rarest of trifectas — it’s at once a provocative head trip, a tense thriller, and an intriguing character study.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"ESPN, Studios, Britbox","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-promised-land-the-impossible-and-looper"},{"id":"47508927457332","title":"Parental Guidance: Skyfall, Lincoln, and New DVDs","content":"Parental Guidancevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Parental Guidance: Skyfall, Lincoln, and New DVDsNew column: each week we'll be bringing you the best bets for family viewing.by Tim Ryan | November 9, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;Welcome to the inaugural edition of Parental Guidance! Each week, we’ll be bringing you the best bets for new movies in theater and on DVD and Blu-ray to help you make informed decisions about what films are appropriate for family viewing. This week, we’ve got Skyfall, the newest installment in the James Bond franchise, as well as Steven Speilberg’s historical drama Lincoln and some brand new DVDs. Read on for more information!In Theaters This Week:Skyfall 92%What’s it about? After going off the grid for a bit, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is summoned back into action when MI6 comes under attack. Chases, fights, and blows to 007’s confidence ensue.Who’s it for? Skyfall is rated PG-13 for “intense violent sequences throughout, some sexuality, language and smoking.” Content-wise, it’s pretty much like every James Bond movie ever, though it’s worth noting that while smoking has declined since Sean Connery’s time, the franchise has undoubtedly gotten more risqué. Parents should probably take the rating to heart.Is it any good? It’s Certified Fresh with thecritics, so there’s a good chance you’ll like it.Lincoln 89%What’s it about? Lincoln is an up-close-and-personal look at Honest Abe’s political maneuvering over the course the Civil War, during which time he attempted to end the conflict and abolish slavery.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for an intense scene of war violence, some images of carnage and brief strong language.” It’s also likely to bore the wee ones to tears. However, for history buffs middle school-age and up, Lincoln is sure to embody the “history lesson come to life” concept in the best way possible.Is it any good? Daniel Day-Lewis is getting rave reviews for his portrayal of the Great Emancipator, and the critics say Steven Speilberg’s direction is typically fine; the result is a compelling, nuanced recreation of a pivotal moment in American history.New On DVD:The Amazing Spider-Man 72%What’s it about? It’s the story of how Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) gets bitten by a radioactive spider, becomes a superhero, develops a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and battles a supervillain named the Lizard.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 for “scenes of action and violence.” It’s certainly too much for little kids, but it’s probably fine for pre-teens and up.Is it any good? The Amazing Spider-Man got solid, respectful reviews, but some critics and fans were slightly miffed that the franchise was rebooted so soon after Sam Raimi’s three installments. Newcomers to the world of Spider-Man will probably pick fewer nits than Marvel fanboys, though.Arthur Christmas 92%What’s it about? It’s the story of Santa Claus’ son Arthur (voiced by James McAvoy), who must deliver a present to a sad little girl after Papa Noel neglects to visit her house. Along the way, we learn about Santa’s state-of-the-art headquarters up at the North Pole.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG for “some mild rude humor,” but this clever, colorful animated tale is probably safe for little kids.Is it any good? The good folks at Aardman Animations have a strong track record of delightfully offbeat family-friendly films (including Chicken Run and Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit), and critics say the Certified Fresh Arthur Christmas is no exception.The Muppet Christmas Carol 20th Anniversary 76%What’s it about? A retelling of Charles Dickens’ timeless morality play, The Muppet Christmas Carol stars Michael Caine as curmudgeonly cheapskate Ebenezer Scrooge, who is visited by the spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Future after mistreating his long-suffering employee Bob Cratchit (Kermit the Frog) on Christmas Eve.Who’s it for? Who doesn’t love the Muppets? The Muppet Christmas Carol serves as a fine introduction to a classic holiday tale of darkness and redemption. Plus, Statler and Waldorf prove they can “bah humbug” with the best of ’em.Is it any good? It’s one of the worst-reviewed Muppet movies, but Christmas Carol is still solidly fresh at 68 percent.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"visit","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-skyfall-lincoln-and-new-dvds"},{"id":"47508928976950","title":"SAG Awards 2020 Red Carpet Arrivals","content":"Red Carpet Roundupgoogletag.cmd.push(function(){googletag.unitIds.push(\"article_sponsorship_ad\"),googletag.defineSlot(\"/55153744/rottentomatoes/article/sponsorship\",[[150,80]],\"article_sponsorship_ad\").addService(googletag.pubads())})SAG Awards 2020 Red Carpet ArrivalsSee all the stars, celebrities, and artists who showed up on one of the biggest nights in Hollywood!by RT Staff | January 19, 2020 |  CommentsWelcome to the SAG Awards, where your favorite screen actors celebrate the best and brightest in Hollywood: themselves!

For the little kids, there’s Rise of the Guardians, featuring Santa and the Tooth Fairy. For older teens, there’s the visually sweeping Life of Pi. For brothers and cousins who want an action fix, there’s Red Dawn. And for home viewing, there’s a sparkling new Blu-ray of one of the greatest Anime films ever. Without further ado, check out the best bets for family viewing this week!In Theaters This Week:Rise of the Guardians 75%What’s it about? In this animated feature from DreamWorks, Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, Jack Frost, and other folkloric types team up to battle a nightmare-purveying baddie named Pitch.Who’s it for? Rise of the Guardians is rated PG “for thematic elements and some mildly scary action.” Kindergarteners and above will probably be able to handle it, though the film does demystify its protagonists, which might be troubling to more sensitive children.Is it any good? Critics say the little ones will probably like it just fine, and that their guardians will probably be mildly amused as well. It’s got some solid gags and terrific visuals.Life of Pi 86%What’s it about? A guy survives a shipwreck only to end up in a lifeboat with a tiger.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG “for emotional thematic content throughout, and some scary action sequences and peril.” It will almost certainly bore little kids, but it should be fine for eighth graders up.Is it any good? Critics say Life of Pi is visually masterful and philosophically intriguing; it’s the type of thing that could entrance thoughtful teenagers.Red Dawn 15%What’s it about? Foreign troops invade a small town in the Pacific Northwest. A group of photogenic teens fight back.Who’s it for? It’s rated PG-13 “for sequences of intense war violence and action, and for language.” In any incarnation, Red Dawn is every teenage boy’s dream come true, and will probably delight less than discerning middle schoolers.Is it any good? If you’re looking for an evening of father-son bonding over a cheesy action movie, you’re probably better off renting the original.New On DVD:Grave of the Fireflies 100%What’s it about? In the waning days of World War II, a brother and sister attempt to survive on their own amidst the barren landscape of war-torn Japan.Who’s it for? Grave of the Fireflies is unrated, but with its scenes of starvation, death, and destruction, it’s not appropriate for children. It’s probably ok for young teenagers and up.Is it any good? Grave of the Fireflies is a monumental work of animation and an anti-war masterpiece. It’s profoundly sad, touching, and beautiful. You should probably watch it, but beware: it’s a bona fide tearjerker.","section":"Parental Guidance","tags":"Fire, Cosplay, based, GIFs, werewolf, worst","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"parental-guidance-rise-of-the-guardians-life-of-pi-and-red-dawn"},{"id":"47508930602056","title":"Red Carpet Roundup Feat.

Johnson/HBO; Frank Ockenfels/FOX; SyFy; Netflix)100 BEST SCI-FI TV SHOWS OF ALL TIMEScience fiction is often celebrated as a forward-thinking genre that promotes peace among all life forms. But deciding which sci-fi TV series is the best? That debate could start an intergalactic war.To determine which series is the supreme ruler of the sci-fi genre, we took into consideration Tomatometer data culled from critics’ reviews, plus a number of reputable “best of” lists, and sprinkled the effort with some editorial discretion, asking ourselves which shows have stood the test of time, inspired spin-offs and copycats, and even made their influence known on the big screen.Some usual suspects naturally came out on top: Doctor Who, Fringe, Firefly, Orphan Black, and creator Ronald D. Moore’s mid-2000s re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica received high marks across the board —&nbsp;not surprising, since they all also have high Tomatometer scores, as do&nbsp;relative newcomers like Westworld, The Expanse, and Black Mirror.One of the toughest calls we had to make was what exactly constitutes science fiction. Fantasy, mystery, horror, and postapocalyptic genres can appear to enter the sci-fi realm, but we had to create some boundaries. David Lynch and Mark Frost’s Twin Peaks, which famously popularized the dead-girl murder-mystery trope before dovetailing into something more complicated, was deemed horror-fantasy (so don’t bother “Where’s Twin Peaks?!”–ing us in the comments). What about shows in the Marvel Cinematic Universe like Jessica Jones and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.? Superhero shows were deemed a separate category.Ranking each of these shows is a Gorn wrestling match all its own – especially when it comes to now-classic titles whose scores are so Rotten, they threaten to stink up the whole list. Have fond memories of 1979’s Buck Rogers in the 25th Century? Hate to ruin any childhood reverie, but it stands at a ripe 33% with 15 reviews on season 1. It still makes the list because of its nostalgia value and the relatively low number of reviews available.Disagree with our ranking of the best sci-fi TV series?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The answers run the gamut from long-running series with hundreds of episodes that you’ve watched 50 times or so&nbsp;to shows in their first couple of seasons (with many&nbsp;fewer episodes), plus all that binge-goodness in between.You’re probably not going to binge The Office&nbsp;in the same way you’re going to re-watch Game of Thrones, but both series made the top five. Stranger Things topped the list, with a pretty even split between men and women and all age demographics.Women tended to prefer shows like Downton Abbey (16 percent of women vs. 5 percent of men) and Lucifer (14 percent vs. 7 percent), while men went for The Mandalorian (33 percent vs. 19 percent) and Breaking Bad (31 percent vs. 18 percent). The biggest generational split? That would be The Office —&nbsp;22 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds picked the NBC sitcom versus only 2 percent of the 55 and over crowd. Conversely, 21 percent of the 55+ demographic chose Downton Abbey versus just 4&nbsp;percent of the 18-34 demo.Plenty of network sitcoms made the list, but prestige cable dramas also scored many spots on the list. The oldest series is Friends, while the newest entry is Amazon’s meta comic book series The Boys.Check out the list below and let us know if your favorites rank where you think they should.The Haunting of Hill House (2018) 93%#25Synopsis: Flashing between past and present, a fractured family confronts haunting memories of their old home and the terrifying events that...

Sadly, plenty of series that were initially supposed to premiere in 2020 are now being pushed to 2021 (and potentially beyond). So, while Rotten Tomatoes users were most pumped about the first Disney+ MCU series, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, it looks as though they’re going to have to wait a little longer for the Anthony Mackie–Sebastian Stan vehicle.But there’s still plenty of great television hitting the small screen this year: The&nbsp;No. 1&nbsp;new show that Rotten Tomatoes users are most looking forward to seeing is The Stand, CBS All Access’ take on the post-apocalyptic Stephen King story that premieres later this year. In second is The Haunting of Bly Manor, the follow-up to The Haunting of Hill House from the same creative team (and much of the same cast).The gender splits were pretty even, with men and women anticipating each of the titles in pretty similar amounts, though more women are excited for the latest Ryan Murphy–Sarah Paulson collaboration, Netflix’s Ratched (inspired by One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest), and more men are looking forward to Hulu’s remake of the beloved animated series Animaniacs.Disagree with the survey results?

But did the new service from Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman&nbsp;bring an A-game to match all those A-listers?Critics&nbsp;have now weighed in on&nbsp;Quibi’s current offering of shows&nbsp;and “movies in chapters,” and as would be expected, Tomatometers are running the gamut from the super Fresh (hilarious slice of variety&nbsp;Gayme Show) to the middling (Turner’s big-budget thriller&nbsp;Survive) to the very Rotten (treacly&nbsp;Thanks A Million, executive-produced by Jennifer Lopez). Some of the big-name bets are definitely paying off – the horror critics are really digging the Sam Raimi–produced epic anthology series&nbsp;50 Shades of Fright, and James’ documentary series,&nbsp;I Promise, is currently Fresh at 100%. Others, not so much: Migos rapper Offset’s&nbsp;Skrrt&nbsp;is currently stuck in the green end of the Tomatometer.As well as grappling with the content in the new programming, critics&nbsp;across the board are adjusting to Quibi’s novel approach to streaming: No show or episode available on Quibi runs more than 10 minutes — thus the Quick Bites — and each can be watched in two formats, vertical and horizontal, with each giving you a different perspective on the action.So far, critics have mostly focused on two of Quibi’s programming streams: Its prestige “movies in chapters,” which include&nbsp;Survive&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Most Dangerous Game, starring Hemsworth, as well as its&nbsp;unscripted originals, which include Teigen’s&nbsp;Chrissy’s Court&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gayme Show. None of Quibi’s news and lifestyle Daily Essentials shows — which include The Rotten Tomatoes&nbsp;Watch List&nbsp;—&nbsp;have received Tomatometer scores as yet.We’ll be updating as new shows are released and more scores become available, so stay tuned to this page to keep on top of the best shows Quibi has to offer.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext.

There are plenty of feature-length films heading our way, as well. The most highly anticipated, according to Rotten Tomatoes users, is&nbsp;Enola Holmes, the Netflix film starring&nbsp;Stranger Things’&nbsp;Millie Bobby Brown as Sherlock’s spunky younger sister. (Sherlock Holmes, we should mention, is played by another Netflix star, The Witcher’s Henry Cavill.)The top 10 most anticipated TV and streaming movies is a good mix of scripted and documentary —&nbsp;both Belushi, about the late comedian Jim Belushi, and Crazy, Not Insane, about what makes a serial killer , made the list. In addition to the grown-up fare, there are a few films tailor-made for a younger-skewing audience (Disney+ original Secret Society of Second-Born Royals among them).Two high-profile remakes are also on the list —&nbsp;Black Beauty, with Kate Winslet lending her voice to this contemporary adaptation of the novel, and Netflix’s highly anticipated, star-studded remake of Daphne du Maurier’s thriller Rebecca, featuring Armie Hammer and Lily James in the first feature film take on the book since Alfred Hitchcock’s 1940 version.Disagree with the survey results?

Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The second season of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag&nbsp;takes the top spot, but don’t feel bad for season 1; it appears at&nbsp;No. 1 our list. Fellow Amazon Prime series Catastrophe, from creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, tops the list for number of total seasons&nbsp;on the list with three of its four seasons Certified Fresh at 100% on the Tomatometer placing at Nos. 14, 15, and 25. Netflix title&nbsp;Master of None&nbsp;is the only show with two seasons in the top 10.All of the seasons are Certified Fresh at 100%, by the way. We’re showing 50 here, but there are a total of 94 TV seasons from the decade that have 100% Certified Fresh scores. We ranked them according to the number of reviews each had at the season level. Fleabag season 2, for instance, has 95 season-level reviews with Insecure season 1 hot on its heels with 94 reviews. Meanwhile, season 2 of anthology series Fargo, which starred Patrick Wilson and Kirsten Dunst,&nbsp;has a total of 230 reviews total across the season and 10 episodes, but only 58 at the season level, and so the title appears lower on the list. But getting episode-level reviews is an accomplishment in itself; most shows don’t get enough reviews on each episode to get episodic scores.Broad City and Jane the Virgin — girl power! — have the most seasons in the top 200 seasons of the decade with four each. Fan favorite&nbsp;Breaking Bad&nbsp;is represented twice, while&nbsp;Cobra Kai, which surprised audiences with its 100% Tomatometer score last year is at No. 11. The highest-ranked superhero series is&nbsp;Marvel’s Agents of Shield&nbsp;season 3. Meanwhile, some incredible TV seasons – many of&nbsp;Game of Thrones’, the current season of&nbsp;Watchmen – missed the list, because of just a few dissenting reviews.Read on to find out which titles placed in&nbsp;the best TV of the decade.Which is&nbsp;your favorite 100%&nbsp; Certified Fresh season of TV?

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

The World, would be directing Paul Rudd in a feature film adaptation of Marvel’s cult comic book character Ant-Man, it created a whirlwind of excitement among comic book fans. At the very least, this particular team promised a low-level cult classic.But the pairing of Wright and Rudd in a mega-budgeted blockbuster about one of Marvel’s quirkiest do-gooders delighted non-comic book fans just as much, if not more, than it did superhero geeks. With a bona fide auteur like Wright in the director’s chair and a brilliant comic actor like Rudd in the lead, Ant-Man promised to be something much more than a typical superhero movie. It promised to break the mold the way Deadpool, Logan,&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok, and&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;later would.Unfortunately, Wright and Marvel parted ways over the proverbial “creative differences.” Wright rebounded niftily with his first flat-out box office smash, the groovy sleeper hit Baby Driver, and after replacing Wright with the&nbsp;dependable Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down With Love),&nbsp;Ant-Man went on to become&nbsp;a critical and commercial success, even if it didn’t quite shatter the mold as expected. Reed’s&nbsp;Ant-Man wasn’t bad by any means, but there was no way it could possibly have compared to the Edgar Wright-directed potential masterpiece that, alas, exists only in the minds and fevered imaginations of the writer-director’s fans.For his part, Rudd was an inspired, if unexpected, choice to play Ant-Man. He’d appeared in a number of box-office hits like Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and Knocked Up, but as an invaluable member of the repertory companies of Judd Apatow and David Wain, he was generally best utilized as a&nbsp;supporting character, rather than a conventional leading man, much less an action hero. Rudd is, after all, legendary for showing a de-contextualized clip of the hilariously terrible E.T.&nbsp;knock-off Mac &amp; Me every time he appears on Conan, rather than a clip from whatever movie he’s supposed to be promoting. He’s obviously more interested in amusing himself and satisfying his wandering id than in pursuing conventional movie stardom.(Photo by Universal Pictures)Yet Rudd has emerged as a star almost in spite of himself, thanks to movies like 2008’s Role Models, which he co-wrote and in which he starred, just as he co-wrote Ant-Man and its sequel and co-created the beloved cult TV comedy Party Down. Role Models began life as a directorial vehicle for The Animal helmer Luke Greenfield before Wain, who directed Rudd in Wet Hot American Summer and The Ten, and would go on to direct him in They Came Together, Wanderlust, and A Futile and Stupid Gesture, came onboard as director, co-screenwriter, and supporting player.The family-unfriendly comedy feels like a latter-day descendant of Bad News Bears, another wonderfully profane, irreverent, hard-R comedy about brash, irresponsible, foul-mouthed kids and the even more brash, even more irresponsible, and even more foul-mouthed adults mentoring them.Rudd stars as Danny, a 35-year-old curmudgeon eking out a silly, embarrassing living traveling from school to school in a truck designed to look like&nbsp;a minotaur and encouraging children to stay off drugs by substituting the toxic, caffeine-plagued energy drink poison he and his sidekick are cynically peddling.&nbsp;American Pie’s Seann William Scott plays said sidekick, Wheeler, as a gleeful doofus, a sex-crazed man-child so ferociously unambitious that, by his own admission, he’d be content to wear a minotaur&nbsp;costume and quasi-entertain children&nbsp;“forever.”Danny’s already crappy life as an underemployed depressive takes a turn for the worse when his ambitious live-in girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks, one of many Apatow and Wain fixtures in the cast) tires of his stormy moods and persistent negativity and breaks up with him. A despondent Danny enters a state of freefall and, in despair, nearly kills a security guard when he drives the promotional minotaur truck into a statue.Role Models’ central conceit demands suspension of disbelief, so instead of doing hard time for a pretty serious crime, these world-class screw-ups are instead sentenced to&nbsp;150 hours of community service at Sturdy Wings, a Big Brothers/Big Sisters-like organization that pairs kids in need with older mentors.(Photo by Universal Pictures)Superbad&nbsp; breakout star Christopher “McLovin” Mintz-Plasse proves he’s more than just a sentient meme here with a surprisingly textured performance as Danny’s charge, Augie, a gawky teen misfit who finds escape from the tyranny of everyday life by disappearing into a world of fantasy live-action role-playing (i.e. “larping”). Wheeler, meanwhile, whose life&nbsp;is a never-ending, frequently successful hunt for sexual conquests, is paired with the hilariously profane Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson), who is every bit as obsessed with sex as his mentor but is somehow even cruder than Wheeler. Scott is a profoundly limited actor, but his role here plays to his strengths as a lovable slob, and Thompson is an impish, ribald delight, stealing scenes from a cast full of ringers and seasoned professionals.Wain filled the rest of the film with fellow alumni from sketch-comedy show&nbsp;The State, including co-screenwriter Ken Marino and Kerri Kenney-Silver as Augie’s tacky parents and Joe Lo Truglio as a role-playing fanatic who has internalized the faux-medieval aesthetic of his pastime to a pathological degree. Bit parts are filled out by people like Louis C.K., The Lonely Island’s Jorma Taccone, and Keegan-Michael Key, while Ken Jeong scored one of his juiciest roles as the king of the make-believe world Augie is obsessed with, a petty tyrant who hangs out at The Burger Hole with his royal sycophants and hangers-on, flagrantly abusing his imaginary power.Rudd’s The 40-Year-Old Virgin co-star Jane Lynch steals the film as Gayle, the lunatic head of Sturdy Wings and an emotional exhibitionist who finds a way to shoehorn references to her former life as a drug-addicted prostitute into every conversation. Lynch infuses the character with her trademark weird intensity and loopy aggression; if Gayle goes easy on our ramshackle heroes, it might be because she’s even more glaringly inappropriate than they are.Role Models depicts the rigidly hierarchical, rule- and protocol-obsessed realm of&nbsp;LARP as inherently ridiculous and laughable but also as a source of comfort, identity, and community for a lonely misfit in desperate need of all three. It laughs at its characters’ foibles and absurdity, but like its heroes, it moves from a place of glib mockery to empathy and understanding.(Photo by Universal Pictures)The film’s use of music and mythology is similarly nuanced and savvy. Wheeler’s obsession with KISS is a tribute to the crazy, theatrical world of make-believe and pretend — not terribly dissimilar, really, from the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;— created by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, as well as a loving send-up. Role Models accomplishes the formidable feat of making the famously cynical and mercenary rock outfit seem incongruously lovable by association.Danny may initially look askance at Augie and his dorky passions, but he’s ultimately saved by taking the big leap and embracing his inner geek, his inner freak, his inner Kiss Army rock-and-roll warrior. For a movie centered on a cynical, ornery bastard, Role Models is ultimately very inclusive and welcoming in its warm depiction of underdogs triumphing through cooperation and acceptance.&nbsp;The wonderfully sardonic underachiever Rudd plays here feels like the sarcastic yet charming stepbrother/love interest he played in his star-making turn in Clueless —&nbsp;after fifteen years of failure, low-level depression, and resignation have all but extinguished his inner light and rendered him a joyless crank. For much of the film, he’s a sour misanthrope deeply unimpressed with everything life has to offer, but because he’s played by Rudd, we end up sympathizing with him and feeling his pain despite his prickliness and rough edges.Role Models is a goofy, commercial, feel-good comedy, but its portrayal of depression — as represented both by Danny’s never-ending mid-life crisis and personal/professional funk — and Augie’s clammy discomfort in his own skin, that palpable anxiety when he’s around his parents and bullies, rings surprisingly and refreshingly true.Rudd can currently be seen playing a tiny hero in a giant movie, but Role Models’ enduring appeal and growing cult is inextricably linked to its modest scope and ambition. Role Models is not too big or too small. It’s the perfect size, an eminently rewatchable sleeper destined for a long, happy life as the kind of casually irresistible charmer you can’t help but finish watching every time you come across it on basic cable.Nathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

Despite bombing in theaters and with critics, The Boondock Saints has gone on to attract a huge and alarming cult enamored by its toxic brand of hyper-masculinity and “Tarantino For Dummies” macho posturing, and it&nbsp;was successful enough to inspire a tardy 2009 sequel in The Boondocks Saints: All Saints Day.But Duffy is just as well-known — if not better known — as the subject, star, hero, anti-hero, and villain of Overnight, a movie so utterly damning in its depiction of Duffy as a boozy, obnoxious monster of id and ego that it’s surprising it&nbsp;didn’t kill his&nbsp;film career in its infancy.The success of Pulp Fiction and the cult of Quentin Tarantino very briefly made auteurs the rock stars of the 1990s in the same way the comedy boom made stand-ups the rock stars of the 1980s. Duffy, however, didn’t just think of himself as a rock star of independent film, he thought of himself as a rock star, period. Not only did his script for The Boondock Saints briefly make him one of the hottest properties in Hollywood, but he was also part of a band called The Brood that was the subject of intense interest from labels like Madonna’s Maverick Records.Around the same time, Duffy was making headlines for a deal in which Miramax head Harvey Weinstein, the all-powerful mogul who helped make Tarantino and Kevin Smith happen, bought the script for The Boondocks Saints for hundreds of thousands of dollars&nbsp;and additionally agreed to purchase the bar where Duffy worked (and where he wrote The Boondock Saints)&nbsp;so they could run it together.Overnight is not the story of a good man corrupted by money, power, and success. Oh God, no. It’s pretty clear that Duffy was always a narcissistic dictator in the making. The money, power, and instant&nbsp;fame merely empowered Duffy further to be as horrible and destructive a human being as he could possibly be.Overnight&nbsp;is not the story of a good man corrupted by money, power, and success.Duffy’s situation in&nbsp;the beginning of Overnight is genuinely unprecedented, ridiculous, and extreme. He briefly seems poised to rise from roughneck bouncer with a drinking problem to hotshot auteur with a major label recording contract and a documentary about his incredible ascent. If all that weren’t exciting and dramatic enough, he and one of the most powerful men in entertainment were about to become co-owners of the dive bar where he worked.If Duffy ever experienced a moment of gratitude for being plucked from obscurity and elevated to great heights, he never expresses it here. The would-be auteur behaves as if the movie and music industries should be grateful he has chosen to favor them with his singular genius, and if the mindless peons he’s forced to interact with on his way up are appropriately deferential, then maybe he’ll show them mercy after he’s attained the Spielbergian power and influence he is absolutely guaranteed to achieve.Duffy is so arrogant and naive that when he’s dealing with Harvey Weinstein, one of the most feared and intimidating men in the history of film, he behaves as if he’s negotiating with an equal, or even someone beneath him. Usually it’s depressing to see Weinstein crush the dreams and egos of young, ambitious filmmakers, but when the filmmaker in question is as unbearable (and seemingly anti-Semitic) as Duffy is, it’s hard not to take a certain evil delight in Weinstein’s Machiavellian power plays. Weinstein and Duffy are both bullying, arrogant monsters, so their battle is a little like Godzilla versus King Kong, only if Godzilla were actually Godzilla and King Kong were a child in costume. Needless to say, Duffy is the kid in the monkey suit.When Weinstein fails to take&nbsp;concrete action to get The Boondock Saints made on a meaty $15 million budget (ostensibly enough to attract stars like a pre-Boogie Nights Mark Wahlberg), Duffy makes one of a series of astonishingly tone-deaf professional decisions and begins bad-mouthing him&nbsp;all around town.If you were to make a list of people you would never want to antagonize as an aspiring filmmaker, Harvey Weinstein would be number one for decades. Yet Duffy seems convinced that his script is perfect, a guaranteed moneymaker, and that executives would happily knife each other for the right to bring his masterpiece to the big screen.Not amused or impressed by his antics, Weinstein drops Duffy, who subsequently goes from red-hot to ice-cold. No matter how arrogant they are, a lot of filmmakers would learn from such an intense, traumatic experience. It would&nbsp;engender some sense of perspective, or gratitude, or an attitude adjustment. Not so, with Duffy.There’s something inherently fascinating about oblivious narcissists.After Weinstein exits the picture, both literally and figuratively, Duffy somehow still manages to get the movie made, albeit with less than half the budget and no guaranteed distribution. It’s nevertheless&nbsp;enough to muster a relatively slick production with&nbsp;recognizable stars like Willem Dafoe. But instead of being humbled by his earlier experiences with Miramax and Harvey Weinstein, Duffy doubles down on his conviction. There’s no way his movie — and debut rock album — could ever be anything other than a success on par with&nbsp;Pulp Fiction, or Thriller.There’s something inherently fascinating about oblivious narcissists. Duffy has no idea how the world sees him. He seems to think the documentary chronicling the making of his debut film will portray him&nbsp;like Francis Ford Coppola in Hearts of Darkness, the essential behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of&nbsp;Apocalypse Now, or Werner Herzog in the equally essential The Burden of Dreams. He labors under the delusion that he will come across as a fiery and passionate anti-hero, a larger-than-life genius willing to go through hell — and to subject others to torment — to&nbsp;realize his uncompromising vision. If the egos of lesser creatures have to be destroyed for this to happen, then that’s a sacrifice he’s happy to make.Duffy bullies, taunts, and insults a whole lot of people over the course of Overnight, including the co-managers of his band, both of whom he financially screws over once his band finally lands a recording contract. In another example of Duffy’s poor judgment, the fired co-managers also happen to be the directors he hired to chronicle the making of The Boondock Saints — and that film eventually became Overnight. What&nbsp;Duffy clearly thought would be a celebratory demonstration of his genius instead became a delicious form of revenge exacted by&nbsp;two dudes who had even more reason to hate Duffy than most. Overnight is a fitting title, but Schadenfreude: The Movie&nbsp;or Screw Troy Duffy! would have been equally perfect.Overnight&nbsp;goes further to recount&nbsp;the rise and fall of&nbsp;The Boondock Saints&nbsp;after it’s barely released and more or less goes direct to video, as well as the&nbsp;trajectory&nbsp;of Duffy and his band’s major label debut, which sells an impressively pathetic grand total of 690 copies. The film&nbsp;ends on an intensely satisfying note, though the poor members of Duffy’s former band are reduced to working day jobs, as Duffy is unable to secure work as a writer or director in the six years following&nbsp;The Boondock Saints.Duffy’s downfall is an archetypal&nbsp;journey fueled by ego and booze and self-delusion.Overnight luxuriates in the downfall of a man who thought the world owed him everything (and better not be slow in delivering) crushed by the realities of the entertainment business and his own ego. It’s the story of a man convinced he would become the world’s greatest success and&nbsp;failed despite all of the hype of his Horatio Alger story-turned-harrowing cautionary tale.Yet, in a way, Duffy hasn’t really failed at all, and that might actually be the most depressing aspect of his story. He was certain The Boondock Saints deserved an audience and would find one. He clearly saw it attracting a Pulp Fiction-sized blockbuster following, but instead it inspired a much smaller, much less discriminating cult of fans.The&nbsp;self-mythologizing scumbag bouncer from Boston got to make his movie with stars like Willem Dafoe and Billy Connolly, and then he got to make a sequel. Now&nbsp;Variety has &nbsp;announced he’s got another film in the chamber, in addition to something called Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em and a comedy project called&nbsp;Black Ghost&nbsp;he co-wrote with Cedric the Entertainer. Oh, and in case you’re worried that Duffy is abandoning his beloved Boondock Saints franchise, don’t be: a TV spin-off series is on the way as well.Duffy’s downfall, as documented in Overnight, is pure show-biz, an archetypal&nbsp;journey fueled by ego and booze and self-delusion. The entertainment industry’s apparent willingness to welcome Duffy back despite his horrific and very public failings as an artist and human being in hopes of cashing in on more Boondock Saints-style cult success is equally show-biz. There is no crime, moral or otherwise, that Hollywood can’t forgive if they think there’s a big payday in it for them.Though Duffy has a pretty full slate ahead of him, I suspect that the only way he could ever make a good movie again would be if he signed on to star in a sequel to Overnight, but even a man as arrogant and deluded and in love with himself as Duffy clearly seems to be must know that that would be a terrible idea.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;78 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

He more or less succeeded, but because he was Stanley Kramer, he also sought to make one of his big trademark social statements. Unsatisfied with merely scoring big belly laughs, he used the film to comment on the way money and competition can transform normal, ordinary Americans into crazed monsters of greed and ruthless self-interest. It was not a&nbsp;particularly subtle or sophisticated message, nor a particularly original one, but that element of social commentary has proven important to the film’s surprising longevity and influence.More than six decades&nbsp;later,&nbsp;It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is still arguably&nbsp;the biggest comedy of all time. It’s so vast in every sense that a number of movies have been able to live healthy, vigorous lives entirely in its outsized shadow. Kramer’s film inspired an entire subgenre of movies about disparate groups of kooky characters all chasing after the same prize: 1979’s Scavenger Hunt, 1980’s Midnight Madness,&nbsp;1981’s The Cannonball Run and its sequel,&nbsp;1987’s Million Dollar Mystery, and 2001’s Rat Race all qualify.In their frenzied machinations and central quests for tacky, tawdry prizes, these zany comedies represent something approaching capitalism in its purest form. Movies like Jerry Zucker’s Rat Race don’t just tacitly imply that a wild, irrational lust for money is endemic to our national character — they argue that greed is the American character.Rat Race is both a celebration and a spoof of American greed&nbsp;and the desperation it engenders.Rat Race is both a celebration and a spoof of American greed&nbsp;and the desperation it engenders. The film was released to lukewarm reviews and decent box office returns, but it has since become something of a basic-cable classic. Its remarkable&nbsp;durability is attributable at least partially to the public’s enduring love of It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but it’s also an unfortunate reminder how rare solidly funny mainstream studio comedies with a few memorable set-pieces are.Like Kramer’s film,&nbsp;Rat Race quickly whips itself into a fine, frothing frenzy of automotive destruction and naked desperation. But it starts off slow, introducing the various players who will be competing for the $2 million&nbsp;stashed in a locker in New Mexico by billionaire hotel magnate&nbsp;Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), who operates in Las Vegas, that most American of American cities.Sinclair decides to pit six teams against each other in a mad dash to be the first to retrieve the fortune. There’s an additional element of social commentary present in the fact that no one asks why he’s so eager to give away so much money in the first place. He only volunteers that he’s eccentric (something that, to be fair, does seem to explain and/or excuse a lot of strange, egregious behavior), and they’re so blinded by money-lust that they’re not inclined to prod much further.In actuality, this tall, sinister hotel mogul named Donald is running a much bigger game than the rubes sweating over his money realize. The chase is merely an elaborate play to make an even bigger payday by inviting his casino’s high-rollers to&nbsp;bet on which team will win the money. Sinclair tells the gamblers he’s offering nothing short of a “horse race with animals who can think and plan and lie and cheat and play dirty.”The competitors include Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a referee who begins the film desperately trying to live down a famously bad call. It’s but one of a series of humiliations that the film inflicts on&nbsp;his character. When he’s not pretending to be a bus driver ferrying around a gaggle&nbsp;of Lucy Ricardo impersonators, he&nbsp;spends much of the film running around the desert in his underwear. It’s a role that plays to his&nbsp;bottomless eagerness to humiliate himself, as well as his flair for physical comedy and his knack for&nbsp;enduring the torments of the damned, all for the sake of a paycheck.Rowan Atkinson&nbsp;— a bona fide British comedy icon (like Cleese) — plays Enrico Pollini, a broadly sketched, elfin, Italian man-child and narcoleptic that feels simultaneously like an affectionate and damning parody of Roberto Benigni’s persona as an oblivious sprite happily bumbling through a charmed life. Breckin Meyer, meanwhile, is typecast as the token square of the group, a responsible businessman roped into the craziness, and&nbsp;Seth Green plays half of a pair of con artist brothers opposite a character whose defining feature is that his tongue is pierced, forcing him to&nbsp;spend the entire film in a state of semi-comprehension.(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)Lovitz and his family figure prominently in the film’s funniest running gag.The six teams of schemers are rounded out by an estranged mother-daughter duo led&nbsp;by an uncharacteristically restrained Whoopi Goldberg and, finally, Jon Lovitz&nbsp;as a mild-mannered husband who ignores his wife’s pleas not to gamble when he works out the 1-in-6 odds of winning Sinclair’s millions.Lovitz and his family figure prominently in the film’s funniest running gag, one so weird, so inspired, and so brilliantly sustained that it goes a long way toward setting Rat Race apart from other comedies like it. Early in the film, he&nbsp;and his family spy a sign for something called “The Barbie Museum” and eagerly pull over, only to discover that, to their shock and terror,&nbsp;this particular Barbie museum is not devoted to the insanely popular fashion doll beloved by American girls, but to Klaus Barbie, a somewhat infamous Nazi.There’s something about the specificity of the gag that elevates it and makes it&nbsp;unforgettable. It’s not just any unassuming roadside Nazi museum this Jewish family stumbles into. No, this one is&nbsp;intensely focused on one particular Nazi and staffed by men who dress like typical skinhead punks, but who approach their jobs as museum guides with hilariously misplaced solemnity. The eventual reveal that the “Barbie” in question is Klaus Barbie is explosively funny, thanks in particular to&nbsp;Lovitz’s appropriately mortified expression and body language.What follows is almost as funny, as the milquetoast Jewish family man&nbsp;decides to exact a bit of belated&nbsp;revenge on the Nazis for that whole “holocaust” thing by stealing Hitler’s car, which also happens to carry&nbsp;such unexpected wonders as Eva Braun’s lipstick and Hitler’s harmonica. The idea of Hitler blowing gritty blues riffs is funny enough in its own right, but Rat Race ratchets up the weirdness until, through a series of unfortunate&nbsp;accidents, Lovitz ends up addressing a group of World War II vets looking and sounding for all the world like the reincarnation of the Führer himself.Green, meanwhile, handles a lot of the film’s vehicular slapstick, barely surviving an endless series of near-fatal scrapes. It’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that about half of the actor’s dialogue is “Ahhhhh!!!” and “No!!!” That goes for much of the rest of the cast as well. Like a true child of It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Rat Race features some gags expertly executed by veteran funnymen and women, but also&nbsp;some gags executed by veteran stuntmen.Also similar to Kramer’s film, the tone here is one of unrelenting zaniness. Even before Goldberg’s character and her daughter avail themselves of the kind of rocket car Wile E. Coyote uses extensively (always to unfortunate ends), Rat Race still feels unmistakably like a live-action version of a classic Warner Brothers cartoon, and that is never a bad thing.(Photo by Paramount Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)The tone here is one of unrelenting zaniness.Rat Race does come up short, however, on star power, at least compared to its distinguished predecessor. It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World had everybody. For a bit part, it was able to&nbsp;roll out Jack Benny or Groucho Marx. Rat Race, in sharp contrast, has to settle for the likes of Paul Rodriguez and Dean Cain. Thankfully, some of the superstar cameos connect in a big way, like Kathy Bates in a hilarious role&nbsp;as a small town eccentric who goes to&nbsp;extreme lengths to punish people for not buying the squirrels she’s selling.Rat Race feels less like an early aughts movie than a very late 1990s movie. The music cue that sets off the craziness is, of course, Baha Men’s “Who Let The Dogs Out,” which feels strangely perfect, and the ending,&nbsp;during which&nbsp;the competitors all decide to do something deeply un-American&nbsp;and give the money away to charity, takes place in&nbsp;the best possible forum for such a gesture: a giant charity concert headlined by Smash Mouth.Yes, Smash Mouth. And if you think Smash Mouth is going to appear in a film — or anywhere, really — without performing “All Star”, then you are a fool. So “All Star” ends, as it must, and this goofy, oddly timely and trenchant delight closes with the cast dancing and crowd-surfing to the feel-good anthem. If there is a moment in American cinema, or cinema as a whole, that is more sublime and artful than Cuba Gooding Jr. breakdancing alongside the members of Smash Mouth as they perform “All Star” for a Woodstock-sized crowd, I am not familiar with it. Also, I am certain that it does not exist.A lot of people are desperately bummed right now for reasons I probably don’t need to go into. What better way to forget recent events than by watching a solid, at times explosively funny, sneakily satirical popular favorite about an eccentric, sadistic billionaire hotel mogul named Donald who pits a bunch of desperate Americans against each other, all for the benefit of his own bottom line and his greedy, debauched billionaire cronies? It’s escapism at its finest!Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;44 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

I should know. As a child, Burton was one of my favorite filmmakers, if not my favorite.Then again, I was at a perfect age both to fall rapturously in love with Burton’s aesthetic and then for that passion to turn ice-cold. When I was nine years old, Burton’s 1985 debut, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure, was my all-time favorite movie. It was one of those magical films that single-handedly engender a lifelong passion for the arts, and 31 years later, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure is still in my top 10. Just three years later, Beetlejuice rocked my 12-year-old self’s world to an equivalent degree. I was so geeked about the prospect of Tim Burton making a Batman movie (starring the guy from Beetlejuice,&nbsp;no less!) that I bought the novelization and saw the movie on opening day.As a 13-year-old, I liked Batman, of course, but I didn’t love it because it just didn’t feel enough like a Tim Burton movie to me. Burton brought a lot of personality to the film, but it still felt like a superhero blockbuster directed by Tim Burton, not a real Tim Burton movie. 1990’s Edward Scissorhands spoke to the ferocious romanticism and sense of otherness I experienced as an angst-ridden 14-year-old, and as a dyspeptic 16-year-old, 1992’s Batman Returns spoke to me in ways that Batman never did. If Batman didn’t feel enough like a Tim Burton movie to me, Batman Returns had the opposite problem.If anything, Batman Returns, which finds Gotham covered in snow as Christmastime approaches, is too much of a Tim Burton movie. Burton took a big-money studio assignment and transformed it into something so weird, so dark, and so personal that it belongs more in a column like this one about weird cult movies than it does in one about big blockbusters, despite the film being one of 1992’s top grossers.I’m still amazed that Burton managed to get Siouxsie and the Banshees to record the theme song instead of, oh, I dunno, literally anybody else. I’m sure Warner Brothers would have preferred Paula Abdul or U2 or MC Hammer, but Burton stuck to his guns. I like to imagine that Burton fought to replace Pat Hingle with Morrissey as his Commissioner Gordon, but Batman Returns is still about as Goth as a superhero movie can be, even without the surly frontman of the Smiths in a major supporting role.(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Batman Returns&nbsp;was sexy and dark and disturbing in a way that both concerned and titillated adults.Yes, Batman Returns made a lot of money because a sequel to Batman was destined to gross a fortune no matter how bad or good it was. But the film did not make as much money as anticipated because there was a culture-wide sense that Burton had gone too far with what was ultimately a gritty, revisionist take on the Bruce Wayne mythology, but also, fundamentally, an action movie for boys who would then go and buy all of the related toys.Batman was certainly dark for a tentpole blockbuster, particularly when compared to something like Richard Donner’s achingly wholesome, red, white, and blue&nbsp;Superman, but it was dark within an acceptable range. Batman Returns, on the other hand, was sexy and dark and disturbing in a way that both concerned and titillated adults.The movie begins with two parents unsuccessfully attempting to murder their baby. The baby in question is Oswald Cobblepot, the scion of an aristocratic family who is born so hideously disfigured and viscerally disturbing to look at that his father and mother (Paul Reubens and Diane Salinger) send the unfortunate tot to meet a cold, watery death in the Gotham river after he attacks their cat.Oswald does not die, however, and grows up to be the Penguin (Danny Devito), a crime kingpin whose disconcertingly round body makes him look like a rancid, monochrome human M&amp;M with dirty, scraggly hair and the most atrocious penis-nose this side of Dan Ackroyd’s judge in Nothing But Trouble.DeVito plays the Penguin as a feral, monstrous creature whose sexuality is overbearing and off-putting. He represents a sexual threat to any woman unfortunate enough to be within groping distance of him. He’s a creature of the shadows, of the sewer, of darkness and rejection and pain and ugliness.But if the Penguin, with his phallic proboscis and grabby hands, was too disturbing for a film for whom a fast-food tie-in was inevitable, then Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle/Catwoman was way too sexual for the pre-pubescent set, although I imagine that one look at Pfeiffer in her skin-tight leather fetish wear was enough to kick-start adolescence in plenty of boys and girls.The word “badass” is thrown around so gratuitously these days that it has lost what little meaning it once possessed, but Pfeiffer, in perhaps her defining role, is legitimately badass. She’s a feminist anti-hero who begins the movie as the meekest of milquetoasts. Pfeiffer spends much of the film’s first act talking to herself, because within the world she inhabits, she’s not just powerless, but invisible. She captures the existential despair of someone who is so used to being ignored that she all but disappears even before her crazy-haired, malevolent billionaire boss Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) hurls her out of a window in a fit of rage and she is nursed back to life by helpful felines. Out of this small, sour sadness, the ferocious force of nature known as Catwoman is born.Catwoman and the Penguin become super-villains by virtue of trauma and rejection. They were the target of unfathomable cruelty by people who were supposed to help and protect them, so their rage towards humanity is both understandable and justified. Max Schreck, on the other hand, comes about his super-villainy purely through greed and cynical calculation. In that sense, capitalism is really the movie’s fourth super-villain. Heaven knows three villains just aren’t enough.&nbsp;(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Batman Returns isn’t really a superhero movie. It’s a twisted dark comedy combined with a tragic, gothic romance.It’s money after all, that brings together the Penguin, the violently rejected progeny of a prominent family, and Max Schreck, a man of extraordinary wealth, power, and privilege. Schreck decides he’d have an easier time achieving his business goals if he had ultimate political and financial power in Gotham, so he convinces the Penguin to run for Mayor as the ultimate outsider, a vulgar, grope-happy creep who promises to make Gotham great again and speaks the language of the sewers because, well, that’s his true home.In a development with absolutely no current cultural or political resonance, however, this marriage of convenience between a crazy-haired, evil billionaire who enters the political arena solely for his own mercenary ends and a rage-filled pervert launching an unlikely campaign for political office comes to an end when Batman tapes the Penguin bragging about his contempt for the people of Gotham and then plays it for the horrified populace. With his political dream destroyed, the Penguin then sets about killing Gotham’s first-born sons in a campaign that employs militarized penguins in a vengeance-fueled rage of biblical proportions.Walken plays Schrek as a pragmatist above all else, an oily pretender who is hilariously unconvincing and disingenuous when he tries to play the role of the good-hearted public benefactor. Even in understated mode, it is absolutely gut-busting to hear Walken deliver the line, “I’m just a poor schmoe; got lucky.”It’s the cold-bloodedness Walken brings to the character that makes him so unexpectedly terrifying. People mean nothing to him, least of all a woman like Selina. They’re just chess pieces to be moved around a board. The only thing that matters is winning, and if that means getting into bed with a man-beast like Oswald Cobblepot, then that’s what he’ll do.As a superhero movie, Batman Returns is a mess. For the first hour, Batman shows up so infrequently that you almost want to stick a question mark at the end of the title. Does Batman really return? I mean, he shows up every once in a while to remind you this isn’t a Catwoman spin-off, but for the film’s first half, Batman Cameos would be a more honest title. For an action movie, Batman Returns doesn’t seem particularly interested in action scenes, although it does seem awfully interested in the complicated political landscape of Gotham and the illicit union of financial might and political power.Thankfully, Batman Returns isn’t really a superhero movie. Oh sure, it’s based on one of the best loved comic book characters in existence but it’s really a twisted dark comedy combined with a tragic, gothic romance. Burton did not make a Batman movie for the masses. No, he made a Batman movie for the gothic, angst-ridden, teenaged malcontent he used to be, and the gothic angst-ridden, teenaged malcontent in all of us.The film only seems interested in&nbsp;Batman when its second hour pushes Schrek and his machinations to the back-burner so that it can focus on the sizzling sexual chemistry between both Bruce Wayne/Batman and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne are two lost souls, hiding from themselves as well as the world, who see in each other the flickering promise that they might not be alone in the universe. It’s a tiresome cliche for the hero and villain in superhero movies to be mirror images of each other, but Batman Returns takes that groaning convention and makes it sexy and fun and fresh all over again.(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)It&nbsp;is so personal, so overreaching, and so agreeably weird and Tim Burtony that it seemingly left him&nbsp;nowhere to go.Like Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises, Tim Burton’s Batman Returns is too long, too self-indulgent, too shapeless, too messy, and has too many characters and subplots. Yet it’s pretty great all the same. Perhaps not coincidentally, The Dark Knight Rises also brought back Catwoman, and while Anne Hathaway was fine in the role, the difference between her Catwoman and Pfeiffer’s is the difference between solid and transcendent, between something that’s good enough and something that will be spoken about in hushed tones fifty years from now, the same way Heath Ledger’s Joker will be.Batman Returns is a film of deliberate excess, less concerned with fulfilling audience expectations and the demands of the hyper-commercial Christmas superhero movie than it is in realizing its director’s idiosyncratic vision. It&nbsp;is so personal, so overreaching, and so agreeably weird and Tim Burtony&nbsp;that it seemingly left him&nbsp;nowhere to go, just as the Dark Knight trilogy realized the full extent of Christopher Nolan’s vision for the character.As I stated earlier, Batman Returns is a dark comedy. It’s also a tragic romance that really drives home that there are only two letters separating “Gotham” from “Gothic.” It’s also, perversely but appropriately enough, a Christmas movie, not unlike the all-time favorite Yuletide classic Die Hard. The film takes place in the weeks leading up to Christmas and ends on Christmas day. This makes everything that happens in the movie a nightmare before Christmas.Speaking of which, Burton would release The Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;— which he produced but didn’t direct — the very next year;&nbsp;for all its morbid charms, it marks the beginning of the filmmaker’s long, slow descent into fruitless self-parody. He’s done good work since then:&nbsp;Ed Wood is a masterpiece, Mars Attacks is a snarky, subversive delight, and I like Big Fish and Sweeney Todd more than most. But when a project looks Tim Burtony these days I almost invariably see it as a negative, particularly if Burton is actually involved.So part of the pleasure of revisiting Batman Returns, beyond the four leads’ charisma and the amazing, Mad Men-by-way-of-The Fountainhead production, lies in returning to a time when a movie being very Tim Burtony was not only unambiguously a good thing, but in the eyes of a teenager who grew up worshiping him, the very best thing.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;80 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

But movies must tread lightly when animals are involved, because there are few things more likely to enrage audiences than the unnecessary death of an animal, particularly a dog. Dogs are borderline sacred in American society, and our treatment of onscreen mutts reflects that.Thankfully, the 2014 instant cult classic John Wick, directed by former stuntmen Chad Stahelski and David Leitch,&nbsp;has the most necessary and meaningful death of a cinematic canine since Old Yeller, and one nearly as mourned. The dog is the key to John Wick’s magic. Without it, the movie is merely an extraordinarily well-made, skillfully directed and performed action neo-noir starring Keanu Reeves. That’s not a bad place to start, but the dog’s death elevates John Wick to the level of lurid pop tragedy. It transforms a movie for action-film buffs into a movie for anyone&nbsp;likely to be deeply affected by the death of an adorable dog. That is to say, everyone.I usually find the revenge genre morally abhorrent and emotionally empty, but when vengeance is exacted on behalf of&nbsp;a four-legged charmer instead of a person, it changes everything. In that case, the very universe itself howls for justice, and in John Wick, the title character is the instrument of its fury.The film opens with the death (by natural causes) of John Wick’s wife (Bridget Moynahan), a woman good and decent enough to inspire her adoring husband to abandon his life of violence and criminality, even though he is&nbsp;to killing people what Meryl Streep is to acting: the gold standard by which all others are judged. A lesser film would have dragged out the wife’s death, but John Wick deals with her as quickly, smoothly, and efficiently as it does everything else.(Photo by David Lee/Summit Entertainment)He’s no mere killer for hire. He’s more like a contemporary folk hero.Before her light is permanently extinguished, though, she arranges to have a puppy named Daisy shipped to her husband’s home to help him deal with his impending grief. John doesn’t get to spend a whole lot of time with the dog, but he doesn’t need to. Daisy immediately makes an indelible impression and worms her way into the hearts and minds of everyone in the audience. Seldom has a badass action movie been so defined by the adorableness of one of its principals. With the exception of the Death Wish series, of course.John Wick himself is a familiar action-movie archetype: a man of violence who has figured out a way to leave his past behind and enjoy the simple pleasures of an honest, law-abiding existence. Then one day, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the degenerate son of Russian mob kingpin Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), attempts&nbsp;to buy John’s 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 from him&nbsp;at a gas station. Wick politely declines the offer, but Iosef is used to having his way, so he and his men follow John home, where they murder his dog and steal his car. This makes John Wick angry. And you wouldn’t like John Wick when he’s angry. Because first he gets angry, and then he starts murdering people. And once he starts, he&nbsp;doesn’t stop until his thirst for vengeance has been sated.Wick now has something to live for, and more importantly, something to kill for. From that point on, Viggo and John are on a collision course only one of them will survive, if anyone survives at all. In one of the film’s few&nbsp;bits of exposition, Viggo explains that John’s nickname was “The Boogeyman,” but even that undersells his badassery, because, as Viggo clarifies, John Wick is not the boogeyman so much as he’s the one you send to kill the boogeyman.&nbsp;He’s no mere killer for hire. He’s more like a contemporary folk hero.In Viggo, John Wick boasts&nbsp;a villain worthy of its anti-hero. Nyqvist plays the mob boss as an inveterate philosopher who regards his life and death with a wry sense of world-weary resignation. His respect for Wick borders on awe, and he seems to know, deep down, that it is his existential destiny to be killed by him.&nbsp;He seems resigned to his fate.But something deeper also seems to be at work. There’s a sense that Viggo wishes John Wick were his son, and he’s come to terms with his death — and the death of his own son — as an appropriate price to pay to the universe for the unforgivable, unpardonable crime of killing Wick’s dog and stealing his&nbsp;car. To put it in Network terms, when snot-nosed Iosef and his boys killed Wick’s dog, they meddled with the primal forces of nature, and Wick quite simply is not having it.(Photo by David Lee/Summit Entertainment)The genius of&nbsp;John Wick lies in its tough-guy minimalism.Derek Kolstad’s crackerjack screenplay is as notable for all of the things that aren’t said as it is for the few things that are. It boldly and brazenly eschews exposition — the&nbsp;elaborate backstories and speeches and arbitrary love interest and all of the other crap that makes action movies so forgettable and interchangeable — so that it can focus monomaniacally on all the things that make action movies awesome.The film allows John Wick to remain a mystery throughout and surrounds him with characters who are every bit as enigmatic and tantalizingly unknowable as him. We learn, for example, almost nothing about the underworld figures played by the likes of heavyweights&nbsp;Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane, but the way they treat each other says more about them and the dark, ominous, honor-bound world they inhabit than reams of dialogue ever could. Because John Wick leaves so much unsaid, we don’t have any choice but to fill in the blanks.These weary survivors flesh out the film’s vision of a criminal world that functions as an alternate universe that exists&nbsp;within our own world, complete with an elaborate code of ethics that, like everything else in the film, is never explicitly spelled out. This shadow world has gods and demons and legends of their own, and John Wick qualifies as all three. He’s a righteous angel of vengeance.The genius of John Wick —&nbsp;and I do not use that word lightly — lies in its tough-guy minimalism, in the way it strips the revenge melodrama down to its raw, potent core. That minimalism extends to the dialogue. The more Keanu Reeves says here, the less badass he seems. Thankfully he says almost nothing, so when he does speak it’s more forceful. Likewise, we don’t need to hear about what a force of nature John Wick is because it’s apparent in every punch, every kick, and every bad guy murdered; the film is admirably committed to showing rather than telling.Just about the only time John Wick says more than is absolutely necessary is when he’s captured by Viggo and explains the urgency and necessity of his particular path. He describes what Daisy meant to him, how she gave him his first taste of hope in ages, only to have that hope extinguished by a bullet. In John Wick, the criminal world is no place for tourists: either you’re in the life 100 percent or you’re out completely.John murders a small nation’s worth of glowering Russians over the course of the movie, so he’s not exactly tip-toeing shyly back into his old ways. Yet it isn’t until John is captured by Viggo and roped to a chair, when he tells him and his armed thugs, “People keep asking if I’m back and I haven’t really had an answer. But now, yeah, I’M THINKING I’M BACK!” that his bloody comeback becomes official.(Photo by David Lee/Summit Entertainment)There’s a Zen calm to John Wick that comes as much from the actor as the script.Reeves delivers those instantly iconic lines with ragged breath and visceral, overpowering rage. Like Philip Seymour Hoffman in Mission Impossible 3, he’s a deadly threat to everyone around him even when bound and captured by his enemies.But there’s a Zen calm to John Wick that comes as much from the actor as the script. Reeves possesses a sweetness and vulnerability that, in the past, has worked against his efforts to come across as tough and imposing. But that likability, as well as his&nbsp;androgynous good looks, makes it easy to buy the title character as a man who will never recover from the personal losses he’s suffered, no matter how many Russians he murders. Just as importantly, at this stage in his career, Reeves has the presence and physical chops to pull off playing this&nbsp;virtuoso of bloodshed, this Mozart of righteous mass murder. Style-wise, John Wick is a marvel of clean, unadorned efficiency. The film’s alternately black-grey and lurid neon color scheme and visceral brutality suggest Only God Forgives if Nicolas Winding-Refn’s film was intent on entertaining audiences rather than repulsing them.The world of John Wick is full of mystery and empty spaces, so while the film is perfect in its own right, its universe begs to be expanded with sequels and a TV spin-off and graphic novels and comic books and novelizations. Accordingly, the sequel did&nbsp;even better with critics and audiences than the original film, and it seems like there’s an awful lot that can still be done with the character, as evidenced by plans for a John Wick TV series.But why stop there? If any blood-splattered action movie franchise invited an officially licensed line of dog toys and bulletproof puppy vests, it’s this one. Hell, if Billy Jack got four movies, then John Wick deserves at least eight.John Wick transformed Keanu Reeves (who had a little bit of success in action via the popular Matrix films) from a wannabe badass to the real thing. John Wick is the hero we need, and a hero for our times, even if we have done little, if anything, to deserve him.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;85 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

But cult movie fans know that Boyega’s evolution into a genre superstar began not so long ago in a land not so far away when he lent his charismatic presence to the 2011 British science fiction&nbsp;thriller&nbsp;Attack the Block.Writer-director Joe Cornish’s lovely, small-scale directorial debut is another iconic story of kids on bikes who encounter creatures from another world, but it&nbsp;doesn’t try to appeal to the broadest, most international audience possible. It’s content being a very British riff on some very American movies. This ends up working in its favor, lending it a cultural specificity that grounds the action in a very distinct sociopolitical reality.For example, instead of the soothingly nostalgic American suburbs of E.T.&nbsp;and its ilk —&nbsp;Gremlins, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Explorers — Attack the Block takes place amidst the graffiti-scarred concrete and runaway crime of a British high-rise in a bit of a dodgy neighborhood. It’s also set&nbsp;during Guy Fawkes Night, when bonfires are ceremonially set ablaze and fireworks fill the night sky, so it feels like the world is violently coming to an end even before space aliens show up.It’s content being a very British riff on some very American movies.Likewise, instead of apple-cheeked white children,&nbsp;the film’s&nbsp;heroes are a streetwise gang of mostly Black teenagers — led by Boyega’s Moses —&nbsp; who while away the hours pulling stick-ups, smoking weed, riding bikes, and chasing girls. They’re low-level juvenile delinquents whose heavily accented slang is so thick that the film could intermittently benefit from a British street slang-to-American English translator.&nbsp;&nbsp;And instead of kindly extra-terrestrials, the kids encounter scary monsters with glowing teeth uninterested in Reese’s Pieces or calling home. These beasties from beyond seem pretty monomaniacally focused on killing everything they encounter, and the only thing standing in their way is a ragtag group of street kids armed with bats and fireworks and everyday tools.Even as a first-time director, Cornish is confident enough in himself, his characters, his actors, and his material to introduce Moses, the film’s hero, and his pack attempting to rob Samantha Adams (a tough, terrific Jodie Whittaker), a nurse who lives in the building where most of the action takes place, knowing that by the end of the film, we’ll be enthusiastically rooting for them. Cornish takes a&nbsp;big risk in making his heroes not just small-time criminals, but small-time criminals who terrorize a vulnerable young woman.&nbsp;It’s a bold move that pays off when Moses slowly but surely emerges as a hero for the ages.Moses and his buddies’ natural habitat is perilous even before aliens descend upon it. In the film’s most clear-cut social commentary, Moses bleakly posits the aliens as one more conspiracy&nbsp;perpetrated by the powers that be to destroy the black man, a process that previously involved herding them into dispiriting high-rises and flooding their communities with drugs.That said, Attack the Block is radically non-moralistic. The story finds a criminal joining forces with someone they have every right to see as their natural enemy for the sake of their mutual survival. It does not seem coincidental that characters willing to put aside their differences fare a whole lot better than those who don’t.But the film also doesn’t treat Moses and his buddies as criminals so much as bored kids doing whatever it takes to pass the time. It’s similarly non-judgmental about many of its heroes either smoking or selling marijuana. Heck,&nbsp;it&nbsp;doesn’t even seem particularly bothered by the opening crime that unhappily brings Samantha together with Moses and&nbsp;his crew.Cornish makes particularly brilliant use of shadows; his alien monsters are inky figures of pure darkness.Over the course of Attack the Block, of course,&nbsp;Moses earns his would-be victim’s trust and her respect. He begins in a place of complete selfishness, prioritizing his own needs and wants over the emotions of the people around him, and ends in a place of selflessness,&nbsp;more or less, as a hero willing to risk it all for the sake of defending what’s his. He is a thief with honor, a thief with a moral code, and as the alien invasion continues, he becomes something much more.Cornish clearly didn’t have a lot of money to work with, so he transformed his limitations into strengths.&nbsp;He makes particularly brilliant use of shadows; his alien monsters are inky figures of pure darkness&nbsp;with big, garish, glow-in-the-dark fangs. The longer we look at a monster, the less scary it tends to become — that’s one of the many lessons of Jaws — but&nbsp;Cornish is adept at continually conveying the ominous presence of&nbsp;his&nbsp;monsters through their glowing fangs while&nbsp;depicting their bodies largely through&nbsp;shadow and silhouette.Attack the Block is also claustrophobic in the best possible sense. Cornish and his exceedingly game, largely untested cast make the shoddy, grey, depressing high-rise&nbsp;of its setting&nbsp;a universe unto itself, with its own rules, players, and unspoken codes of conduct. Instead of blasting into outer space, Attack the Block offers a street-level action comedy of survival.Movies like this walk a fine line tonally. Inject too much goofy comedy and the movie becomes too silly to be scary. A dour, straight-faced approach to a premise like this, on the other hand, risks provoking an avalanche of unintentional laughs. Thankfully, Cornish and his collaborators strike the perfect balance between silly and scary, tongue-in-cheek yet full of legitimate tension. It’s scary, sure, but also a lot of fun.Attack the Block&nbsp;was executive produced by&nbsp;Edgar Wright&nbsp;and shares the loving geekiness and sly wit of his best work. Given their simpatico sensibilities, it’s not surprising that Wright later teamed up with Cornish to work on the screenplays of&nbsp;Ant-Man&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Adventures of Tintin.&nbsp;It’s similarly unsurprising that Wright fixture&nbsp;Nick Frost&nbsp;steals his scenes in&nbsp;Attack the Block as Ron, a droll drug dealer who looks like a roadie from the 1980s and who isn’t about to let something as minor as an alien invasion ruin his high. Incidentally, this is not the only time Boyega, Wright, and Cornish have worked together: after Cornish’s name was tossed around as a possible director for a&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;movie,&nbsp;he had to settle for a cameo in&nbsp;The Last Jedi alongside Wright.Boyega is a master of minimalism,&nbsp;a man of few words.As noted earlier, John Carpenter is also a clear influence on the film, a delightful British take on warmly remembered 1970s and 1980s classics&nbsp;whose sense of cross-cultural fusion is epitomized by a terrific Basement Jaxx score that puts a squiggly, electronic twist on the icy, menacing atmosphere of Carpenter’s early film scores. Its themes also closely echo&nbsp;Assault on Precinct 13, and Carpenter’s own feature debut, 1974’s&nbsp;Dark Star, is a masterpiece of the broad science fiction stoner comedy genre in which&nbsp;Attack the Block belongs.And like Carpenter’s stoic heroes/anti-heroes — most notably the ones played by his favorite leading man, Kurt Russell — Boyega is a master of minimalism, a man of few words who can convey more with an angry scowl than lesser actors get out of pages of dialogue. Attack the Block is a star-making vehicle in the truest sense. Boyega began the film an unknown and exited it a star whose magnitude has only grown in the intervening years.Like all great science fiction movies, particularly those involving aliens, Attack the Block cries out for a sequel, but it’s pretty perfect as a funky stand-alone sleeper that takes the smart-ass grit of early John Carpenter into unexpected but inspired new places. Besides, considering his recent success, it seems like Boyega might be booked solid for the next couple of decades or so.Oh, and Whittaker, who is also fantastic in a less showy role, looks to be awfully busy for the indefinite future as well, since she was recently named the first female Doctor Who. Boyega obviously wasn’t the only one destined for distinctly genre-specific greatness.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;90 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

For the masses that Barris entertained for decades before embracing life as a semi-recluse, he was “Chuckie Baby,” the seemingly stoned host of The Gong Show, a lovable goof whose hipster-beatnik antics conveyed just how little he cared about everything around him. On The Gong Show, everything was a lark, Barris’ genial presence most of all.Show business professionals also knew Barris as the creator of not just The Gong Show but also such insanely lucrative, venerable game show institutions as The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game. These were profoundly bifurcated accomplishments: Barris created television shows that caught on with audiences like few shows before or since.&nbsp; Yet these shows were eviscerated for not just being bad entertainment, but rather for lowering the level of discourse on television. That’s no mean feat, considering the level of discourse on television generally hovers between “rodeo at a state prison” and “three-year-old’s birthday party.”However, to folks like me, Barris was the author of Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind, a game-show memoir unlike any other. It was as much, if not more, about Barris’ claims to be&nbsp;a CIA assassin as it was about his real-life history as a reviled yet extraordinarily successful trash-culture maven. Like Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck during the making of I’m Still Here, Barris toyed extensively with the idea that Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind was real, and that during the heyday of The Dating Game he was out assassinating Communist agents when he wasn’t clowning around with Gene Gene the Dancing Machine or the Unknown Comic.Confessions wasn’t real, but it became an object of intense cult fascination.The idea that Confession Of A Dangerous Mind was real was absurd, of course, but it became an object of intense cult fascination. Barris wasn’t just some celebrity&nbsp;who traded on his fame and success to get his kooky idea for a quasi-tell-all published. He&nbsp;was a real writer. Confessions took its cues less from straight-faced memoirs by fellow game show mavens like Dick Clark or Merv Griffin than from the intense self-hatred and unrelenting sexual neurosis of Phillip Roth and the demented, surrealistic game-playing of Phillip Dick. The book was also presumably inspired by other ambitious authors not named Phillip.Barris seems to have written Confessions&nbsp;primarily to amuse himself, but also to prove to the world that he was a bona fide self-loathing Jewish intellectual and not the cynical, calculating hack of the public imagination. The book particularly caught on with Hollywood because God knows there’s nothing show business people would rather read about than show business.The film adaptation of Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind&nbsp;spent what felt like an&nbsp;eternity in development hell. Bryan Singer and Johnny Depp were initially on board as director and star, but the film ultimately ended up getting made on a relatively modest budget, with the wonderful Sam Rockwell in the lead as Chuckie Baby and George Clooney behind the camera for his directorial debut. Clooney also tackled&nbsp;the crucial supporting role of Jim Byrd, a glowering CIA handler who recruits the game show king into the shadowy world of international espionage.Chuck begins the movie in a state of profound emotional disrepair. He stands before us, shaggy and pot-bellied, both emotionally and physically naked. He is a man of darkness. He’d seem to be the antithesis of the smiling goofball Chuck Barris played on TV, but really he’s just the flip side, the deep, depressive funk following a manic high that lasted decades.We are then transported from this bleak ending to a similarly bleak beginning, as young Chuck Barris grows up and tries to find himself — a process that mostly involves trying unsuccessfully to get women to have sex with him. When he begins to work in television, his passes are increasingly reciprocated to an almost disconcerting degree.But there’s more to the up-and-coming Chuck’s life than ambition, television, and sex. There’s also incoherent rage, the kind of bottomless, visceral anger that leads to bar fight after bar fight after bar fight, even though he’s really bad at bar fighting. Then one day, this struggling young man is approached by Clooney’s Jim Byrd, who informs him that “he fits the profile” of the kind of young man the CIA is interested in (violent, angry, directionless, devoid of close emotional attachments) and offers him an unusual opportunity to serve his country as an independent contractor killing people for the agency.Jim Byrd is less a man than a sinister force, the terrifying darkness in Barris’ soul rendered human. He understands that Barris will kill people for him not because he needs the money but because killing satiates the beast within like nothing else. Jim serves as the devil on our protagonist’s shoulder whenever Chuck is tempted to leave his double life behind and go straight.Penny&nbsp;perfectly suits the sunny vulnerability and naked sincerity at the core of Barrymore’s persona.If Jim is the devil, then Chuck’s longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend Penny (Drew Barrymore) is the angel on the other side, forever trying to gently nudge him towards the light. She’s the only person in our anti-hero’s secretly sad world and lonely existence who can penetrate his formidable shields and connect with him on a profound human level. Penny roars joyously into Chuck’s life as the embodiment of both the 1960s counterculture and the sexual revolution, but her aspirations are profoundly old-fashioned: she genuinely loves Chuck — a man who cannot reciprocate that love because he hates himself — and wants to marry him.Barrymore is heartbreaking as Chuck’s best, last, and only chance for happiness. The role perfectly suits the sunny vulnerability and naked sincerity at the core of Barrymore’s persona. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind finds her at her most ebullient, but even when she’s beaming a radiant movie star smile, there’s something deeply sad about her character and her impossible love for an impossible man.Penny is understandably none too overjoyed about having to share Chuck with the rest of the world, but also with glamorous femme fatale Patricia Watson, played by&nbsp;Julia Roberts&nbsp;not as a human being but as an overly recognizable type: the glamorous woman of mystery who is endlessly seductive yet completely unavailable. It’s a character and a performance devoid of nuance, humility, and humanity. Patricia’s been pulled straight from spy movies and paperback novels rather than real life, and she&nbsp;epitomizes the frustrating artifice and over-stylization that keeps Confessions&nbsp;from being as funny and dark and poignant as it should be.The script was written by Charlie Kaufman, and as Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze and Kaufman himself understand, the key to filming his writing lies in playing up the ugly and painful but achingly human emotions at play in his screenplays, in making all of the craziness as real and authentic and realistic as possible. Clooney, though, takes an antithetical approach. Instead of embracing harsh reality, he plays up the artificiality, transforming everything into a cinephile fever dream from the late 1960s and 1970s. It makes sense on one level, because the action largely takes place in those decades, but that era also spawned the overwhelming majority of the movies Clooney shamelessly steals from as well.Clooney directs Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind as if he’s never going to get another chance to work behind the camera again,&nbsp;as if he had to fit in every shot he’s ever dreamed of, admired, or wanted to pay tribute to in a single movie. The resulting style becomes oppressive and distracting; instead of drawing us into the world of the characters and their emotions, Clooney’s direction continually draws attention to itself in ways that work against the material.Clooney directs Confessions&nbsp;as if he’s never going to get another chance to work behind the camera again.It also&nbsp;betrays a profound lack of confidence in his actors, his story and his screenplay. It’s as if he feels that Sam Rockwell playing a game show host/CIA assassin in a movie written by Charlie Kaufman just won’t be enough to hold the audience’s attention on its own, and it’s up to him to keep them alert and awake with some really ambitious crane shots and 1970s-style zooms.&nbsp;Barris is a true original and Kaufman certainly is a true original, but&nbsp;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is so deeply indebted to Clooney’s favorite films that it feels like a pastiche, full of reverence but with distressingly little personality of its own.&nbsp;The glibness makes more of an impression than the comedy, which is both too clever and not quite clever enough, as in a winking sequence where a Dating Game beauty chooses a fat, sad-looking blob of a man over contestants played by Brad Pitt and Matt Damon in cameos.Confessions of a Dangerous Mind works best as a deeply sad meditation on how money, fame, and success ruin and corrupt us, how they make us selfish and self-absorbed and single-mindedly devoted to our own unquenchable needs and desires. There’s a sadness to Rockwell’s performance even at his goofiest that conveys the profound costs his character has paid for a life of sex and success but little authentic human connection.Scattered throughout Confessions&nbsp;are documentary-style “talking head” segments where real people from Barris’ life and career, like Dick Clark and The Gong Show sexpot Jaye P. Morgan, talk about Barris and his enigmatic ways. It doesn’t pay off until the very end, when we finally see the real Chuck Barris. Unlike the rest of the talking heads, Barris doesn’t say anything, although we do hear his final bleakly funny, bleakly philosophical words via off-camera narration. In choosing not to address the camera as the film ends, Barris ends up saying so much more than any of the others.Well into old age, Chuck Barris’ face retained an elfin, mischievous quality, but it also effortlessly conveyed pain and darkness and sadness. It was the face of a man who has lived, if not quite the surreal misadventures chronicled in the book and film, then a long and hard, joyous and traumatizing life all the same. You don’t have to kill dozens of people for the United States government to end your life with a face that betrays a life full of despair and regret. Sometimes it’s enough to be a man who made a lot of terrible television, or a man who has lived a life full enough to accommodate a whole lot of sadness and regret. That’s our Chuckie baby, as well as the killer doppelgänger found here.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;79 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

It was a way for Disney to release a movie with, say, something as horrifying as a brief glimpse of the nipple of a beautiful naked woman in a playful and innocent context, or a child saying “sh–,” without engendering a flood of angry mail from apoplectic parents vowing to defrost the cryogenically frozen corpse of Walt Disney and kick him hard in the testicles, should his minions ever traumatize their innocent urchins that way again.But as a latchkey kid whose fondest memories are all pop-culture-based, I appreciated that Touchstone made movies for adults that weren’t really for adults at all. Oh sure, they may have contained “adult” elements like the aforementioned five second flash of nudity or some casual swearing, but really they were for kids, teenagers, and emotionally stunted adults.Though Touchstone has released some great films through the years — like Rushmore and Who Framed Roger Rabbit —&nbsp;and films that have captured the public’s imagination in a fierce way — like Good Morning, Vietnam, Pretty Woman, Ernest Saves Christmas,&nbsp;and Turner &amp; Hooch —&nbsp;the banner’s house style favored cheerful, family-friendly mediocrity. The films released by first Touchstone Films and then Touchstone Pictures ran towards brightly colored, high-concept, modestly budgeted comedies and light dramas with fizzy pop soundtracks and familiar if affordable stars like Martin Short.In many ways, these movies were descendants of the live-action movies Disney cranked out for kids in the late 1960s and 1970s — pleasant distractions sometimes bumped up to classics through the generous, myopic lens of childhood nostalgia. I loved these bland, undistinguished time-wasters and basic cable slot-pluggers so much that I would go to the library and read the novelizations of movies I couldn’t rent, so the youthful me was able to experience the Mark Twain quasi-adaptation Unidentified Flying Oddball in multiple forms. In a related development, I was a friendless child who did not lose his virginity early.Captain Ron‘s poster is a glorious train wreck of all the worst poster-making tropes of the past 30 years.As a kid and teen, I didn’t enjoy Touchstone movies like the Marlon Wayans/Kadeem Hardison vehicle and supernatural basketball film&nbsp;The Sixth Man or the James Belushi/Charles Grodin mismatched buddy romp Taking Care Of Business despite their mediocrity. I enjoyed them precisely because of their sunny, moronic mediocrity. I appreciated that when the Touchstone logo came onscreen at the start of the movie, chances were good I would then be able to turn off many of the critical faculties of my brain and give myself over to a slick, silly bit of formula that wouldn’t tax me intellectually any more than a sitcom might.It is this odd affection for the Touchstone aesthetic that led me in the direction of Captain Ron, although I was just as inspired by Captain Ron’s poster, which is, in its own unspeakably awful way, perfect.&nbsp;It’s a glorious train wreck of all the worst poster-making tropes of the past 30 years. First and foremost, it is an unintentional masterpiece of wonderfully unconvincing photoshop. Judging by the results, it’s as if the designers simply borrowed a family member’s vacation photo and crudely replaced everyone’s heads with those&nbsp;of the film’s stars. The logistics are all wrong. Nobody even seems to be looking in the same direction or inhabiting the same universe, let alone the same physical space. Then there’s the aqua blue and red color scheme and the poster-maker’s need to drive home that Captain Ron is, in fact, a comedy, and a goofy and lighthearted one at that — what screams “comedy” louder than a tight shot of people laughing hysterically for no discernible reason?It epitomizes the sensibility behind so many terrible VHS covers: shove as many of the stars into a tiny space and deliver a sense of the plot and premise as artlessly and ham-handedly as possible. In this case, the poster lets us know that Kurt Russell and Martin Short are in a tropical-looking comedy where a bland family encounters a shaggy pirate-looking dude. It goes without saying that shenanigans ensue.What the poster does not convey is that Captain Ron is essentially a watery knock-off of What About Bob?, which not so coincidentally was also a Touchstone release, and a very successful one. Both films center on uptight, control-obsessed family men (Richard Dreyfuss in What About Bob?, Martin Short as Chicago businessman Martin Harvey here) whose dull, orderly lives are turned upside down when they come into conflict with an eccentric kook their families embrace as replacement patriarchs.In What About Bob? the kook in question is Bill Murray’s neurotic uber-patient. Here, it’s Kurt Russell as Captain Ron, perhaps the only white man in the world who can pull off a Rasta beanie/eye-patch/partial cornrows look. When Martin inherits a boat from a relative and needs to transport it from its current location to the Island of Saint Pomme de Terre, where it can be sold, he hires Captain Ron to help him with the task.Captain Ron is an R-rated anti-hero in a PG-13 family comedy that keeps hinting at a darker, more adult movie hidden within.Captain Ron is a man with a past. He is a man who has lived. He is a man with character who benefits tremendously from the iconic baggage that Russell brings to the role. The eye-patch he&nbsp;sports is a throwback to Russell’s signature character Snake Plissken in Escape From New York; the shipbound setting recalls Overboard, another light comic favorite that would have been unbearably creepy with someone less effortlessly charming than Russell in the lead. Even the naughty-Disney vibe can be traced back to Russell’s early days as a teen actor in brightly colored live-action Disney movies overseen by dear old Uncle Walt.Russell turns Ron into a lovable rapscallion, a scalawag, a ne’er do well and a consummate kook. He calls Martin “Boss” in a simultaneously condescending and insulting way that implicitly conveys that men like Captain Ron have no bosses, just jerks willing to pay them for their time. Nothing seems to get under his&nbsp;skin, least of all his own immense incompetence as a sailor and small businessman.He’s also an R-rated anti-hero in a PG-13 family comedy that keeps hinting at a darker, more adult movie hidden within, just as it regularly hints at a past for Captain Ron that is equal parts immoral and illegal. He&nbsp;drinks too much, he gambles, he steals other men’s vehicles and their wives. Hell, he seems pretty dead set on stealing Martin’s wife Katherine (Mary Kay Place).Captain Ron epitomizes the strange tonal middle ground that Touchstone occupies. It almost feels like there were two conflicting visions of the film: one, a raunchy adult comedy about a proud degenerate who corrupts a white bread family; and the other, a proudly retro Disney comedy about the innocent misadventures of a wholesome clan and the raffish but good-hearted interloper who teaches them to lighten up, have fun, and embrace the adventure of existence.The film is weirdly smutty and adult in oddly fascinating ways. Most notably, there is a jarringly incongruous bit of PG-13 nudity when the happy couple are having excruciatingly uncomfortable-looking stand-up shower sex (as people do in the movies, but not in real life) and the pervert of a cinematographer decides to film the action from above, so that in at least one of the shots Mary Kay Place’s nipples are clearly visible.Comedically and thematically, there is very little purpose to this particular shot, but if you were a young teenager when Captain Ron came out, as I was, a burst of nudity, particularly in a PG-13 movie, was like an unexpected gift from the movie gods. This shot doesn’t necessarily make the movie any better. But when you’re trying to figure out what separates a forgettable, garden variety bit of&nbsp;silly, ephemeral fluff from a special, transcendent bit of silly, ephemeral fluff that hangs on tenaciously and makes an impression (which is a big part of what this column is about), something as seemingly minor and inconsequential as a glimpse of a wildly out of place naked nipple can make a big difference.Pretty much through star power alone, Russell makes a fairly reprehensible character immensely likable and fun.But the film is smutty in other ways as well. The defining feature of the teenaged daughter is that she’s boy-crazy, the kind of 16-year-old who has learned most of her life lessons in the back seats of cars with the wrong boys. At one point, Captain Ron is filming the jean-shorts-clad backsides of the wife and daughter of his boss (not cool, bro, not cool) with a primitive camcorder from a secret perch, which would be enough to turn audiences against the character if he were played by anyone less lovable than Russell. And if Ron were to spend his time lusting nakedly after a 16-year-old, he’d come across as much creepier, but the film makes it clear that, no, he’s instead lusting over his boss’ attractive middle-aged wife, to the point where he latin-dances with her to the mortification of her children, leers down her shirt, and generally does a terrible job of hiding his sexual longing for her.Pretty much through star power alone, Russell makes a fairly reprehensible character immensely likable and fun. There’s a bit of a proto-Jack Sparrow quality to Captain Ron; The Pirates Of The Caribbean (a late-period Touchstone production, don’t you know?) even figure prominently in the narrative. He carries himself as if he has a big beer belly even though he’s thin and seems perpetually, agreeably sloshed.He’s a bad influence everyone wishes they had in their lives at a formative stage, and in one of the film’s slyer visual gags, Martin’s bookish 11-year-old son Ben (Benjamin Salisbury) not only takes to Ron to the point where a bottle of beer can be seen in his hand in multiple scenes, but he actually looks more and more like Captain Ron as the film progresses.The film’s arc calls for Captain Ron’s freewheeling ways to antagonize Martin to the point where he’s driven to physical violence against the man who has taken over his life and stolen his family. Short makes for an affable straight man but Captain Ron belongs to Russell, who swaggers through the film like a man who has won the game before it even began and is now just agreeably running out the clock.Captain Ron taps into a common fantasy among both cinephiles and pop culture obsessives: that Kurt Russell will enter their lives and become a surrogate father figure. And while it’s regrettable that Captain Ron subscribes to the worldview that if white people from the United States ever venture South of the border, they’ll probably be kidnapped, menaced, or terrorized by people with skin darker than their own, Captain Ron is too breezy and enjoyably inconsequential to be offensive.Kurt Russell is a true movie star. He’s not a chameleon or character actor who disappears into roles and becomes other people. No, he simply goes ahead and does his Kurt Russell thing, and that is almost invariably enough. It certainly is all that’s keeping this ramshackle but oddly lovable vehicle upright and sea-worthy.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;24 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin is a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

For writers, the death of a major artist is immediately followed by feverish pitching of think pieces, as ink-stained wretches scramble to say something profound about the legend who just passed before their colleagues can beat them to it.In turn, readers are flooded with odes to the latest celebrity whose passing shocked and saddened us, as well as television and live tributes and reverent covers by artists who were all deeply, if conveniently, influenced by whoever just passed.&nbsp;There’s something wonderfully cathartic about being able to share your grief with the world, in realizing that you’re not alone in having been profoundly touched by a great artist. It makes the awfulness and terrible finality of death seem a little less oppressive.In that vein, when an iconic musician&nbsp;dies, Facebook and other forms of social media are transformed instantly into places of mourning and remembrance, as fans fill their walls with videos of the dearly departed&nbsp;at the height of their powers.&nbsp;Thanks to Youtube, seemingly the whole of pop music is forever at our fingertips, just waiting to be rediscovered at the right moment and shared with like-minded fans.I write “seemingly” because Prince’s astonishingly vast and important discography and videography is not available on Youtube.&nbsp;If you see a Prince video on Youtube, that’s only because his&nbsp;lawyers haven’t gotten around to having it taken down yet. But it goes beyond that: a lot of great work he&nbsp;did is perversely, frustratingly unavailable, including his 1987 concert film Sign o’ the Times, which astonishingly has never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray in the United States and can only be seen illegally.Prince was so staggeringly, inconceivably brilliant at so many things in his lifetime that it almost felt like being a genius bored him, and just to make life interesting, he constantly had to sabotage himself professionally. He&nbsp;always seemed willing — even eager — to seek out the&nbsp;weird and defiantly non-commercial.For example, when Prince made&nbsp;Sign o’ the Times,&nbsp;he had long since established himself as one of pop’s greatest hit-makers, with monster hits the world never tires of hearing. But if fans come to Sign o’ the Times to hear the smashes from top-selling&nbsp;albums like Purple Rain and 1999, they’ll have to settle for two minutes or so of “Little Red Corvette” (as a medley with Sign o’ the Times’ “Housequake”), because otherwise the Prince-directed concert film excludes almost all of the hits he was known for in favor of deep cuts from Sign o’ the Times the album.For all of his fabled otherworldliness, Prince was at heart a soul singer.Like so much of Prince’s life and work, Sign o’ the Times is intoxicatingly odd and unexpected. It&nbsp;was billed as a Prince solo album following the dissolution of the Revolution.&nbsp;On that album, Prince played pretty much all the instruments on all the songs (with the exception of the saxophone). Yet in the film based on Sign o’ the Times, a gracious, supremely confident, and unexpectedly and endearingly goofy Prince is continually ceding the spotlight to individual band members so that, for example, the drummer, the bassist, and back-up singer all get extended solos.Prince clearly envisioned the film&nbsp;as a star-making vehicle for a dancer named Cat Glover. She’s perpetually at the center of the action, and the star of weird little sketch-like interludes that thread through the film. Yes, I suppose you could say that Prince was a real Cat fancier, but despite his&nbsp;best efforts, he failed to&nbsp;make Cat happen, even on the level of lesser proteges like Carmen Electra.Sign o’ the Times opens with its title track and the album’s first single, a message song so preposterously over the top in its depiction of a grim world that it borders on self-parody. It’s a song that exaggerates the social ills of the time into a feverish comic book depiction of the world as a nightmarish hellscape of endless suffering. In other words, it’s a bit of an odd choice to kick off an energetic concert film, but then the film is full of odd choices that are also oddly inspired.Watching Sign o’ The Times in the shadow of Prince’s unexpected death, I was reminded throughout of David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust &amp; The Spiders From Mars, which similarly captured one of the most important artists of the 20th century both at the peak of his&nbsp;creative powers and in a fascinating state of transition. Prince and Bowie&nbsp;combined the cerebral, aesthetic genius necessary to think up a persona as powerful, enduring, and enigmatic as Ziggy Stardust or&nbsp;Purple Rain-era Prince&nbsp;with the sweaty, primal sexual rock and roll charisma necessary to pull it off.For all of his fabled otherworldliness, Prince was at heart a soul singer, and a great soul singer has a connection to his audience that goes beyond sex, beyond adulation, beyond appreciation. For Prince and others like him, music isn’t just the perfect sonic backdrop for sex and a source of infinite fashion: live performance is sex. Here he wields his guitar as a potent weapon of both aggression and seduction.Prince didn’t reduce women to sex objects, though. He held sex — and women and female sexuality — in such high regard that he elevated the beautiful women he was understandably obsessed with to angelic beings of divine sexuality. Besides, Prince would never ask one of his proteges to wear anything more sexually provocative than he himself would wear.“If I Was Your Girlfriend” is at once philosophical and emotional, a dissertation on the fluidity of gender cunningly Trojan-horsed as a great R&amp;B song.Like Michael Jackson, his biggest rival, Prince inhabited a world beyond race, beyond gender, beyond sexuality, beyond black music, beyond pop music. But he was just as interested in&nbsp;inhabiting a space between gender, between race, between sexuality, between black music and pop music.On that note, Prince’s performance here of “If I Was Your Girlfriend” feels like one of the most seminal performances of his career. It’s a quietly audacious, even revolutionary song (and single) where Prince contemplates an emotional intimacy that exists only between women and ponders whether this intimacy might be more powerful than sexual intimacy. Prince isn’t just interested in women’s bodies, he was interested in their minds as well, and “If I Was Your Girlfriend” is at once philosophical and emotional, a dissertation on the fluidity of gender cunningly Trojan-horsed as a great R&amp;B song.“If I Was Your Girlfriend” is all about exploring and challenging the barriers between man and woman, platonic love and sex, heterosexuality and everything else. Prince is baring his soul in a way he does throughout Sign o’ the Times,&nbsp;the album and movie. He runs the gamut of emotions here, from the grim blues of the title track to the ebullient optimism of “Play In The Sunshine” to the playful sensuality of “Hot Thing” and “U Got The Look” and finally, the brooding, purposeful evangelizing of “The Cross.”With Sign o’ the Times,&nbsp;Prince struck a perfect balance between the demands of being a major rock star and the dictates of his complicated muse. Sign o’ the Times was a creative apex, but the seeds of Prince’s long commercial and creative slide were already planted. Sign o’ the Times is almost too much of a good thing — it’s more Prince than even some of his most ardent fans can handle — but it’s grounded in the undeniable pop genius of “If I Was Your Girlfriend,” “U Got The Look,” and “I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man.” Prince’s subsequent albums would be, if anything, even more sprawling and messy and outsized than Sign o’ the Times,&nbsp;but the hits stopped coming early in the 1990s and never returned, and Prince found himself performing for an increasingly small and devoted cult.Like Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars, Sign o’ The Times ends not with a song so much as a statement as bold and profound now as it was at the time of its release. Bowie’s concert film ended with “Rock and Roll Suicide” and its iconic, desperate, yearning cry of “You’re not alone!” He found transcendence and salvation in the secular churches of sex and rock and roll. Similarly, Prince didn’t just know a little something about sex and rock and roll; he knew everything about them.But for Prince, the church of rock and roll and the divine&nbsp;ecstasy of sex could never compare to spiritual salvation. For Prince, everything came down to Jesus. At the core of his being wasn’t nihilism or decadence or hedonism but a fierce spirituality and unshakable faith that informed everything he did. He was the sexiest man alive for decades running, but that intense sensuality coexisted with an equally intense spirituality.Prince ends Sign o’ the Times with “The Cross,” a powerfully direct expression of his&nbsp;Christian faith that implores listeners and fans and acolytes and worshippers (of both Prince and Jesus) not to die without knowing Jesus’ salvation. It’s a song with one eye on a corrupt materialistic world full of sin and the other on the promise of Jesus’ return, and with it the redemption of all mankind.He was the sexiest man alive for decades running, but that intense sensuality coexisted with an equally intense spirituality.Sign o’ The Times begins with a bluesy dirge of weary social protest, but closes with a hypnotically intimate appeal to accept Jesus as your lord and savior before the ultimate spiritual reckoning of death. In between, it’s one hell of a party, albeit one that finds one of the greatest hitmakers of the 1980s perversely choosing not to play his most popular songs&nbsp;in favor of letting some deep album cuts really breathe. Among the film’s many strange qualities is one of patience; Prince takes his time with these songs, confident in his ability to control his audience even with lesser-known material.In other words, it’s a Prince kind of shindig, mystifying and magical and wonderfully befuddling all at the same time. While still in his twenties, Prince Rogers Nelson knew exactly who he was and his final message here is the same message he was promoting at the time of his death. His peculiar, personal Christianity will be his legacy as much as the incredible songs he wrote and the unforgettable shows he played.This otherworldly genius wanted us to accept Christ as our lord and savior, as he had. He explicitly devoted the last song of his greatest movie based on his greatest album to making sure we’re good with God before we meet Her. I take comfort in knowing that Prince was at peace with the lord when She called him home, possibly because heaven was getting just too goddamned boring, and She needed to call up another of Her personal favorites to make it more interesting.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;85 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin if a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

See Jar Jar Binks. Or the Ewoks. Or The Brady Bunch’s Cousin Oliver. Or The Simpsons’ &nbsp;Poochie, the outrageous, in-your-face, rapping, surfing, original Kung-Fu hippie from Gangsta City.The same holds true of 3-D. When it was resurrected a little over a decade ago, I was geeked about the return of a format I associated with the airy, goofy escapism of my childhood, both because the early 1980s, when I was a boy, marked the last big 3-D boom (as seen in such movies as Jaws 3) but also because, with its whirring, zooming, eye-dazzling spectacle, the 3-D format has special appeal for kids (and those who enjoy the practice of smoking marijuana).&nbsp;This helps explain why 3-D is more likely to be employed in an animated film or a superhero movie pitched to younglings than in, say,&nbsp;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.It did not take long for 3-D to go from delighting children and inner children to insulting them. The thinking went from, “Why should this be 3-D?” to “Why the hell shouldn’t this be 3-D?” seemingly overnight. The wave of 3-D movies that followed in the wake of Avatar’s record breaking success didn’t just fail to advance&nbsp;the technology; they failed to succeed even as a gimmick for children and stoners. They failed as art, but they weren’t enthusiastically, energetically artless enough to be fun.I came to love it when 3-D was employed in cheesy and pandering ways, like when platoons of bubbles and balloons soared towards the audience during the big production number in Step Up 3-D, one of the rare films to actually justify the expense and inconvenience of it.&nbsp;And when Step Up 3-D is damn near the gold standard for what can be done with the format seemingly all of Hollywood suddenly decided should be ubiquitous, something has clearly gone awry.“Kumar looks a little like a hipster hobo, and his mind is focused on getting stoned.”With the exception of outliers like Gravity and Guardians Of The Galaxy, not a whole lot of good came out of the last big 3-D boom, but I am glad that it coincided with the deathless Harold &amp; Kumar saga, and the cross-pollination of the two resulted in 2011’s A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas.Now this is a film that understands and respects the true value and importance of 3-D, most notably in its ability to throw all sorts of crazy stuff at the screen and the audience either in wicked cool slow motion or super-fast in a way destined to delight the deeply stoned and moderately baked&nbsp;alike.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas isn’t enormously fun despite its use of&nbsp;3-D in such a cheesy, ham-fisted way: it’s enormously fun precisely because its 3-D is so cheesy and ham-fisted. It understands that 3-D can be used to create vivid and amazingly detailed alien worlds beyond imagination, but more importantly, that it can be used to show&nbsp;a Santa Claus played by Patton Oswalt blow pot smoke rings at the screen, or have Danny Trejo ejaculate on the Christmas tree of his dreams in all three dimensions, as baby Jesus intended when he invented Christmas and 3-D in the same youthful frenzy of inspiration, then waited two thousand and eleven years for both of his creations to live up to their extraordinary potential.There are a number of meta jokes about 3-D in Christmas, from characters pondering whether the medium had already jumped the shark at that point (it had) to an uptight buddy played by Thomas Lennon — in a delightful homage to Jack Lemmon — explaining that he’s in charge of his progeny for the day thanks to it being “3-D” (Daddy-Daughter Day). But really, the film seems to find the idea pretty damn hilarious that a franchise that began as a purposefully modest quest for two stoners to find sub-par meat products to shove in their impaired gullets would, seven years later, be using the same technology as Avatar or the latest mega-budget Marvel or CGI animated movie. More importantly, it’s able to make the idea of a 3-D stoner Christmas comedy funny to audiences as well.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas benefits from the seven years that have passed since&nbsp;2004’s Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle. Harold (John Cho) and Kumar’s (Kal Penn, who took a break from his job in the Obama administration to reprise his role here) lives have taken them in such different directions that their friendship is more of a complicated memory than it is an ongoing concern.Kumar has defiantly refused to grow up, and after failing in his bid to become a doctor for predictably weed-related reasons, he has seemingly embraced the grand gestalt of giving up. With his shaggy beard, apathy and weed-fueled gut, and stupid winter hat, he looks a little like a hipster hobo, and while everyone else’s thoughts are with family as Christmas approaches, his mind is monomaniacally focused on getting stoned.&nbsp;When his girlfriend tells him she’s pregnant, something she clearly hopes will kick-start the long overdue process of growing up, he handles it poorly.Harold, meanwhile, suffers from an antithetical set of problems. If anything, he’s too grown up, and he’s traded in his slacker-stoner ways for a well-paying but soulless Wall Street job and a wife whose Christmas-obsessed father (Danny Trejo) makes no secret of his dislike for his son-in-law.“A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is animated by a sense of infinite possibilities.”Once best buds, the pair’s lives have led them on vastly different paths until one day the mysterious gift of a joint addressed to Harold but delivered to Kumar’s apartment serves as the catalyst for these former friends to reunite. The Harold &amp; Kumar movies cast serious actors instead of comedians and in their first scene together, Penn and Cho nail the fumbling awkwardness of two people who were once good friends attempting to reconnect with a bond they’re understandably concerned may not exist anymore.The mysterious joint brings them together even further when it’s hurled out a window by an indignant Harold, who does not smoke anymore, and boomerangs back into Harold’s home, setting his Christmas tree ablaze. Terrified of his father-in-law’s reaction if he even attempts a satisfying Christmas without an appropriately epic tree, Harold then finds himself reuniting with his estranged friend on a journey through the night to find and bring back a majestic tree.This quest, as heroic and historic in its own right as the journey to procure sliders in the original, leads to a gauntlet of wacky tableaus involving an enraged Russian mobster with a sexually voracious virgin daughter; a friend who accidentally gets his daughter high on pot and cocaine; a pair of Christmas tree salesman (one played by RZA) locked in a good cop/bad cop dynamic; and perhaps most auspiciously, a Claymation sequence during which a deeply f—ed up Harold and Kumar imagine that they are being chased by an evil giant snowman monster who destroys much of New York in hilariously graphic and over the top fashion.A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is animated by a sense of infinite possibilities. After all, the rules are different both on Christmas and when you’re messed up on various&nbsp;illegal mind-altering substances, so why not include a pot-dealing&nbsp;mall Santa played by Patton Oswalt (who deals in such strains as “Rudolph The Red Eyed Reindeer” and “It’s a Weederful Life”), a guest appearance by Jesus, and a central supporting turn by Waffle-Bot, a heroic waffle-making robot that may have a crush on Kumar, or maybe just really likes him?It just wouldn’t be a Harold &amp; Kumar movie without Neil Patrick Harris (really, it should be Harold &amp; Kumar &amp; Neil but Harris apparently isn’t bucking for star billing) and sure enough, deep into their journey, Harold and Kumar run into him&nbsp;while he’s rehearsing a big Christmas extravaganza, and he&nbsp;gives them crucial assistance when not fiending for crack cocaine or trying to seduce a chorus girl.In the seven years between White Castle and 3D Christmas, Harris went from being the has-been from that teen doctor show to a national institution.&nbsp;The film has to deal with Harris’ fame and household name status, and its answer is to turn his very public real-life homosexuality on its head by depicting him not just as an inveterate heterosexual, but as a deranged, borderline feral sex freak who probably belongs in jail rather than at the very apex of the socioeconomic ladder. The man branded a prostitute in the last film, for the love of god. How do you outdo that?“Harris delights here in subverting his wholesome image, really tearing into wonderfully filthy lines.”Harris delights here in subverting his wholesome image, really tearing into wonderfully filthy lines like “Clay [Aiken]’s the biggest cooze-hound I know. He gets mad gash,” and “I am gay, gay for that p—y.” He also&nbsp;gets the full star treatment here, playing both the razzle-dazzle real-life NPH, who delights his adoring public in a big Christmas live spectacular, and an insane, over-the-top parody of show-business decadence, a man so debauched that, after getting murdered in the last movie, he’s kicked out of heaven in this movie for stealing Jesus’ chicks.&nbsp;As is invariably the case, Harris gets the best lines, like when he says of his posthumous trip to heaven, “Chicks were hot. The music was sick. There were lasers! It was like being famous in the early 1990s.” He’s not onscreen for long but he makes every filthy line, lascivious leer, and outsized gesture count.With a little help from Harris and a little more from Jolly Old Saint Nick, Harold And Kumar save the day. The film follows a predictable arc as Harold learns to loosen up a little while simultaneously standing up to Trejo’s glowering patriarch, and Kumar learns the value and necessity of growing up and embracing responsibility.But if Christmas ends in a predictable place, the journey to get there is unexpectedly funny, sweet, and rife with comic invention. A Very Harold &amp; Kumar&nbsp;3D&nbsp;Christmas is at once a twinkly, shiny 3-D spectacle and a cheeky, meta parody of twinkly, shiny 3-D spectacles.It’s a testament to how extensively the film makes shameless use of the format that on my 2-D laptop screen,&nbsp;Christmas still felt infinitely more 3-D than 90&nbsp;percent of the films I’ve seen on an actual 3-D movie screen. Harris teases another entry in the Harold &amp; Kumar saga when he tells the titular duo he’ll see them in “the fourth one,” but Christmas would be a fine way for the franchise, which has gone much further than anyone had any right to expect, to end.Christmas is a holly jolly tribute to the glory and child-like wonder of 3-D that also illustrates the absurdity of other, lesser films misusing the format for less inspired reasons, like world-building and chases and similar nonsense.My Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;68 percentFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"Pop, thirty, RT21, and, TLC, GIFs, Crunchyroll, Skip, comedies, cinemax, technology, 2017, Tyler, Network","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/22162645/HaroldKumarXmasSub-Cult.jpg","slug":"why-a-very-harold-and-kumar-3d-christmas-deserves-cult-status"},{"id":"47508944878803","title":"Why John Waters’ Cry-Baby Deserves More Attention","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why John Waters' Cry-Baby Deserves More AttentionNathan Rabin attempts to separate the art from the artist while rewatching this oddly touching ode to Eisenhower-era outsiders.by Nathan Rabin | July 19, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;When I first heard that Johnny Depp had been accused of domestic violence against soon-to-be ex-wife Amber Heard, my response was as human as it was idiotic. My brain cried out with clueless fanboy defiance, “No! That can’t be true! Ed Wood would never beat his wife! Edward Scissorhands would only accidentally harm a partner, due to his scissor-hands and whatnot! Cry-Baby would never throw an iPhone in anger (in part because he probably died decades before smartphones were introduced, but still)!”It was dumb, but it was a natural response. It’s hard to care deeply about pop culture and not be invested in the totality of our favorite artists’ lives, on screen and off. My secondary awful yet human response to the domestic violence allegations was that I found them disturbing, but not as disturbing as they would have been if they’d come out 15&nbsp;years ago, when Depp was still one of my favorite actors and not mired in bloated, joyless, excessively costumed self-parody.I’m not proud to have thoughts like that, but it makes sense that we’d be more invested in the lives of artists we admire. If Chet Haze destroyed several entire hotel chains during a coke-and-hooker-heavy rampage that ended in a police shootout, I doubt anyone would be surprised — or care — with the possible exception of his family. Haze is a second-generation entitled baby-man screw-up. That’s what entitled baby-man screw ups do. But if Tom Hanks — beloved American, preeminent pop culture icon, and, to a much lesser extent, Chet Haze’s profoundly embarrassed father — were to do the same thing, I think we’d all be disappointed and horrified. This unexpected orgy of bad behavior would instantly and permanently change Hanks’ reputation for the worst.Something similar to my initial reaction to the Depp news seems to be at play in the media.&nbsp;Online comments on stories about the divorce and domestic violence accusation are tilted disproportionately in Depp’s favor. Heard is demonized as an evil, scheming gold digger while Depp is defended as the innocent victim of a conscienceless schemer decades younger than him.Watching Cry-Baby,&nbsp;you get a sense that Depp had attained a state of perfection that was inherently impossible to sustain.It doesn’t help that Heard often plays femme fatale types while Depp has made himself and Disney a fortune playing lovable rogues. Domestic violence doesn’t fit with Depp’s persona, but it’s worth noting that he&nbsp;has had a series of personas over the course of his career. He began as a non-ironic bad boy with a heart of gold and teen idol on 21 Jump Street. Then he segued smartly into satire, independent film, and offbeat choices when he starred&nbsp;in the utterly charming 1990 musical comedy&nbsp;Cry-Baby,&nbsp;John Waters’ loving and eminently re-watchable follow-up to his mainstream breakthrough Hairspray.I suspect that Depp wouldn’t mind escaping the ugly mess of his personal and professional life and traveling back decades in time to the era of Cry-Baby, when he radiated all the promise in the world. The decades ahead would bring mo’ money, and with it, the requisite mo’ problems, and watching Cry-Baby,&nbsp;you get a sense that Depp had, physically at least, attained a state of perfection that was inherently impossible to sustain.In&nbsp;Cry-Baby, Depp spoofs his 21 Jump Street persona as Cry-Baby Walker, a pouty-lipped,&nbsp;perfectly cheekboned heartbreaker who rules as the unofficial leader of the Drapes, a contingent of proud juvenile delinquents, outcasts, and ne’er do wells lovingly looked after by Ramona Ricketts (Susan Tyrell) and her partner Belvedere (Iggy Pop). They’re menaces to society, but because this is a John Waters film, they are also a wonderfully diverse and open-minded bunch that includes an African American gent with a towering pompadour, a pregnant woman, a woman nicknamed Hatchet Face for reasons that quickly become apparent, and even a pair of adorable children on hand as pint-sized mascots.Cry-Baby is relentlessly pursued by Lenora (Kim Webb), a bosomy bad girl intent on ensnaring him in her man-trap, but he only has eyes for Alison Vernon-Williams (Amy Locane), a good girl who undergoes a profound sexual awakening the moment she first sets eyes on him. Cry-Baby may be PG-13, but the smoldering looks Alison shoots Cry-Baby are strictly NC-17, and though Locane is lovely in a role that didn’t do anywhere near as much for her career as it should have, Depp is the one who is relentlessly sexualized, who is treated as eye candy as much as a flesh-and-blood human being. The camera doesn’t just love him; it obsesses over him in a way that would probably result in a restraining order if it were human. And Locane’s character is more than merely attracted to Cry-Baby; he seemingly keeps her in a state of perpetual erotic infatuation — and he does the same for the audience. As Cry-Baby Walker, Depp is sex incarnate, a gorgeous creature who is as pretty as a girl but blessed with a rugged masculinity.In Waters’ world, sex is not dirty or corrupt. Sex is innocent. Sex is joyful. Sex is the essence of being young and alive.The film&nbsp;honestly and lovingly captures the hormonal haze of adolescence and the sexual yearning behind so much of our fetishization of 1950s and 1960s greaser culture. Yet in Waters’ world, at least, sex is not dirty or corrupt or even particularly naughty. Sex is innocent. Sex is joyful. Sex is the essence of being young and alive. Cry-Baby is, on some level, an extended riff on Grease, the&nbsp;big difference being that Grease has a reputation as&nbsp;clean-cut, wholesome Americana but is actually incredibly smutty, while Cry-Baby &nbsp;professes to be naughty and ribald but is surprisingly wholesome underneath.Waters’ affection&nbsp;for the days of his youth is refreshing largely because it is devoid of the maudlin, sentimental phoniness that defines most nostalgia, particularly of the 1950s variety. There’s an underlying sincerity to his yearning for a simpler past as well as an admirable desire to recreate the Eisenhower era in his own idiosyncratic image.The film epitomizes what makes Waters such a weirdly inclusive and beloved figure. In the eternal battle of the slobs and snobs, Waters’ sympathies will always be with the slobs. Hell, he even gives his greasers and punks and rockabilly no-hopers a veritable wonderland to inhabit in the form of their Turkey Point homestead, which is like Pee-Wee’s Playhouse reimagined as the ultimate greaser hangout. Waters began on the fringes of both film and society, but with Cry-Baby, which was produced by big-timer Brian Grazer and released through his and Ron Howard’s powerhouse Imagine Entertainment, he was given the kind of budget he could only fantasize about in the early days, and he made the most of his resources.Cry Baby is a quintessential ensemble film. Many of its best moments involve Waters lovingly observing his 1950s bad boys and squares in their natural environment while one of Waters’ beloved half-forgotten oldies makes an unholy racket in the background. The film&nbsp;moves to a ramshackle musical rhythm, and Depp accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of matching the charisma of Elvis Presley back in his Jailhouse Rock days, when his androgynous sexiness posed an implicit challenge to an uptight nation that was both aroused and confused by the swiveling of his hips.If Cry-Baby is an extended valentine to juvenile delinquents, greasers, and AIP exploitation movies about teenagers running amok in sinful and titillating ways, it has a sneaky and surprising amount of affection for squares as well. When the preppy boys croon doo-wop classics in casual harmony with big, goofball smiles on their faces, it’s supposed to be ridiculous and hopelessly dorky, particularly when contrasted with the nuclear bomb force of the title character’s sex appeal. But the film takes a distinct pleasure in that squareness, and encourages audiences to do the same.Waters’ affection&nbsp;for the days of his youth is refreshing largely because it is devoid of the maudlin, sentimental phoniness that defines most nostalgia.The Squares that the Drapes face off against are white to the point of being translucent. Waters has a lot of mischievous fun creating an over the top burlesque of uptight, gee-whiz retro whiteness. Cry-Baby is the kind of film where the exemplars of cultural conformity giddily Bunny Hop down the street and propriety isn’t just an obsession; it’s damn near a religion, which makes Cry-Baby and his lot heretics.For a man who began his career in the field of profoundly filthy, X-rated gay provocations, Waters has unexpectedly come to represent childhood innocence. There is a reason he’s become one of the most beloved figures in American culture despite not having made a movie in twelve years. For Waters, naughtiness and innocence are hopelessly intertwined. When Cry-Baby mocks both sides of the 1950s square/greaser divide, it’s from a place of profound understanding and affection.Is it possible to enjoy Cry-Baby in light of the ugliness of its star’s personal life? For me and my wife at least, the answer is yes. Acting is not autobiography. Though we like to imagine that movie stars are the people they play, acting is the art of pretending to be someone you’re not. If Depp undoubtedly invested elements of himself into his most beloved roles and performances, he is ultimately not Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood or Captain Jack Sparrow or Cry-Baby Walker. Nope, he’s just the guy who played them. Re-watching Cry-Baby, I found myself falling in love with the film, its title character, and Depp’s performance all over again, even if my affection for the actor has diminished to the point of non-existence in light of Heard’s allegations.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;73 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin if a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

For you non-math majors out there, that’s an increase of 5,500 percent, or slightly more than factors like inflation might warrant. This act of flagrant douchebaggery would compel&nbsp;most executives to keep a low profile and let&nbsp;their publicists try to change the public perception that they represent evil in its purest form, but Shkreli decided that, dammit, this was his time to shine. Forget hiding in shame; this pharma bro was ready for his closeup.Instead of shrinking away, Shkreli went on the offensive, conducting interviews, tweeting up a storm, and doing everything in his power to change his public image.&nbsp;Shkreli understood that we live in a world where the line between fame and infamy has become blurry to the point of meaninglessness. He intuited that becoming famous for the wrong reasons oftentimes results in even more publicity&nbsp;than becoming famous for the right reasons. And at this point, it seems like that&nbsp;was as much of an endgame for Shrkeli as were money and power.The more the world hated Shkreli, and the more it wanted to punch him right in his smug, smirking face, the more Shkreli put himself out there. It was as if he imagined that, with enough money, he could buy the public’s love and approval. He tried to donate $2,700 to Bernie Sanders, only to have Sanders turn around and reject the offer as hopelessly tainted.Then Shkreli turned around and purchased the only copy of Wu-Tang Clan’s new album, Once Upon A Time In Shaolin, for $2 million (which is roughly $2 million more than most hip hop fans would be willing to pay for recent Wu-Tang Clan albums) and when Ghostface Killah, one of the super-group’s more outspoken members, expressed regret that the album ended up in Shkreli’s claws, the hoodie-wearing, video game-loving bro had the chutzpah to publicly tough-talk the hip hop legend.What I find fascinating about Shkreli is not that he’s evil or shameless or conniving. Those are pretty common qualities for successful businessmen. No, what I find fascinating about Shkreli — and why I find myself sometimes identifying and empathizing with him — is because more than anything, he just seems sad. You don’t have to delve deep to see the lost, lonely little boy in Shkreli who imagined that with enough money and power, he could finally get the love and validation he so nakedly craved. It’s all there on the surface: the squirmy, human tragedy behind the braying public awfulness. As befits a man whose love for emo is part of his weird brand, Shkreli is the boy with the thorn in his side.“Television wasn’t just Harris’ best friend, it was his only friend.”Shkreli’s strange, Warholian infamy would make me recall Ondi Timoner’s 2009 documentary We Live In Public even if he&nbsp;hadn’t recently decided that the world needed the kind of exhaustive documentation of his existence that only a Youtube account live-streaming his days could provide. In this respect, he’s following in the footsteps of We Live In Public subject and fellow rich weirdo Josh Harris, who decided to create a massive online “human terrarium” where the lives of the participants would be webcast to a voyeuristic public 24/7.Like Shkreli, Harris’ life as an obscenely rich entrepreneur ultimately became something like&nbsp;an elaborate performance art experiment gone awry. His need for attention similarly came to take on a deeply unhealthy, pathological edge, as he was no longer able, or interested, in distinguishing between good attention and bad.That need for attention&nbsp;and&nbsp;inability to obtain&nbsp;it healthily began during a lonely childhood during which television wasn’t just his best friend, it was his only friend. Harris confesses that Gilligan’s Island creator Sherwood Schwartz played a bigger role in his childhood than his own parents did. Harris was a latchkey kid, a little boy who embraced sitcom characters and television as an early form of virtual living. In its own lo-fi, cheesy manner, television provided virtual friends you could see all the time but never actually meet in person, in addition to distant mentors like Schwartz, whose objectively terrible creations affected Harris’ life and work in striking ways.Most disturbingly, at the height of his power, fame, and riches during the dizzy days of the dot-com&nbsp;boom, Harris developed a freakish alter-ego he named “Luvvy” after “Lovey” Howell, the wife of millionaire Thurston Howell III on Gilligan’s Island. But that wealthy matron was only part of the bizarre stew of influences that went into the character, who was a toxic, difficult-to-watch cross between a dizzy high society matron (that would be the Lovey Howell part), a nightmare-inducing clown of the John Wayne Gacy variety, and an insufferable improv character that amuses only the person subjecting the audience to it.Harris was no comedian or actor, and by all accounts everyone was horrified and disturbed by Luvvy, particularly Harris’ business partners, who responded to an important financial ally inexplicably showing up for events dressed like an insane, androgynous Juggalo about as well as you would imagine. Even in a dot-com&nbsp;boom with a seemingly bottomless tolerance for eccentricity and bad behavior as long as the money kept rolling in, Luvvy struck a lot of people as repellent. People thought they were doing business with a forward-thinking business and technology visionary (which, for all his faults, Harris most assuredly was) and were understandably chagrined to be confronted with a character that was Harris’s raw, rampaging id in its purest form.The best that could be said about Luvvy was that underneath the creepiness and repulsion, it was a sweet attempt to connect with other people from a man who, like Shkreli, was adept with&nbsp;money and technology yet seemed poignantly unable to understand human beings.“Harris had created, in essence, a party that nobody could leave until he said they could.”Harris became as well known for his parties as his innovations in online television. The two were closely interconnected, as his employee base was taken pretty much exclusively from people he met at elaborate parties where, to quote a rubbernecker interviewed in We Live In Public, there were “supermodels sitting in the laps of nerds playing Doom.”&nbsp;At one point this lonely little nerd was worth $80 million (hey, it was the 1990s, and hundred dollar bills fell like manna from heaven to anyone with a halfway feasible idea involving computers), so he decided to leverage his money, wealth, and fame into creating a massive social experiment. The idea was to have a group of artists, bohemians and spiritual seekers live underground in a capsule hotel and have their every moment captured by a vast sea of video cameras maintaining a level of surveillance Stalin would have envied.The plan was to create either a cyber-utopia of total freedom and decadence or a waking nightmare of psychological abuse and total control. From the beginning, the experiment had overtly Fascist overtones. For reasons known only to Harris, for example, there was an official “interrogator” whose job it was to break participants down psychologically, using methods that, if they didn’t constitute torture outright, certainly bordered on it.Guns were freely available at the gun range, as were drugs and alcohol and just about anything someone might want, other than freedom and autonomy. The participants in this experiment did what people almost invariably do when they’re given complete and total freedom: they abused it. The project devolved from a Woodstock-style techno-utopia that combined cutting-edge contemporary technology with the life-is-art-and-art-is-life aesthetic of Andy Warhol’s Factory to an Altamont-esque nightmare, as people who were never too stable to begin with began to crack under the pressure of constant monitoring, claustrophobia, and the distant yet ominous presence of Harris himself.Harris had created, in essence, a party that nobody could leave until he said they could. And by making the rules everyone had to live by, the little boy whose only source of comfort was a television screen grew up to be a man who could control people whose lives were being exhaustively documented.Given the combustible elements at play and Harris’ own awfulness, it’s amazing that this experiment didn’t end with multiple deaths. But after the turn of the millennium, Harris lost interest in his project and decided to embark on a smaller-scale but equally intense exercise in extreme cyber-voyeurism and exhibitionism.Harris decided that he and his girlfriend — an ebullient, charming beauty named Tanya Corrin&nbsp;who deserved so much better than Harris — would be the first couple to live their lives entirely online and in public, wiring his home with surveillance cameras and inviting online rubberneckers to interact with the increasingly unhappy couple online.“Harris refers to himself as one of the first great artists of the century, and it’s clear that he saw his life as his true art form.”Not surprisingly, these cameras ended up capturing the dissolution and destruction of Harris and his girlfriend’s relationship, although toward the end, Harris seemed as worried about the ever-declining number of people watching his life as he was by the end of their relationship.In the documentary, Harris refers to himself as one of the first great artists of the century, and it’s clear that he saw his life as his true art form. Like Shkreli, he considers himself a celebrity; it doesn’t seem to matter that he became quasi-famous for embodying the worst excesses of the dot-com&nbsp;boom, that he’s a cautionary tale rather than a success story. No, all that matters is that, for a while, people were paying attention to him and his crazy experiments, and when people stopped paying attention, a part of him died.Harris anticipated our age of eternal exhibitionism, except that today we document every moment of our lives via the slick, shiny, consumer-friendly mediums of Twitter, Facebook, Vine, and Instagram instead of letting cameras and an unseen overlord broadcast our lives to anyone curious about them.Shkreli and Harris are fascinating monsters in part because they are so achingly human in their mad hunger for love, connection, and meaning and their inability to attain them. Perhaps what I find saddest and most terrifying about these two strange, sinister figures is how deeply I identify with them.You can buy a lot of things with money. You can buy the only copy of a Wu-Tang Clan album. You can buy companies and use your fortune to build a strange little hermetically sealed little world whose dimensions and rules you control. You can buy attention. But there are also things you cannot buy. You cannot buy love. You cannot buy respect. You cannot buy genuine friendship, although fake friends can be bought not only with money but with drugs and power as well.That, ultimately, is the tragedy of Harris and of Shkreli. Love, respect, and genuine friendship are seemingly what they wanted most out of the world, and those were the things that were forever out of their reach.

It was such an awful shock, a terrible blow to the psyches of fans and friends and acolytes throughout the world.Bowie’s family knew that he had been fighting a valiant but ultimately unwinnable war with terminal illness for the last year-and-a-half of his life, but the rest of us were left with the impression that not only was Bowie not on death’s door, he was actually doing spectacularly well.I remember reading that he was turning 69 and releasing a new album (Blackstar) and being incredibly encouraged that someone who had accomplished so much, who had such a massive influence on the world, and was still so relatively young (he wasn’t even in his 70s yet), remained so vital, so productive, and so handsome, charming and well-preserved.Over a matter of days, the world went from marveling at Bowie’s inspiring resilience to facing a future where Bowie would never write another song or perform another concert or joke with his wife or breathe another breath. Seemingly in a heartbeat, he went from the present tense to the past tense. He would never recreate himself again. His story and his amazing, improbable life was over.Like a true rock star and pop icon, Bowie maintained an air of mystery no matter how famous he became or how endlessly chronicled and celebrated his life and career were. And this terrible illness, this godforsaken curse that took him — and so many others — from us was among his last secrets.Bowie was the patron saint of freaks and weirdos and outsiders. He made anything seem possible. He taught us that we could be whoever we wanted to be, that we could take the shabby rags of heredity and geography and biology and, with enough imagination and hard work and determination, transform them into the velvet and lace finery of our wildest imagination. We could be our own heroes. We could create ourselves, and when we tired of our creation, we could reinvent ourselves and become somebody else entirely, as he had done so often and so brilliantly.“Bowie was the patron saint of freaks and weirdos and outsiders. He made anything seem possible.”We couldn’t be Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke, of course. Those identities belonged exclusively to Bowie. But we could be our own creations, and Bowie could help us find our voices, help us locate our beautiful inner freaks. So when we mourn Bowie, we’re also mourning the role he played in our lives. When I woke up to the despairing news that he&nbsp;had died, I was instantly catapulted back to the angst-ridden teenager I used to be, the outcast who spent pretty much his entire adolescence in a group home and would ride his bike to used CD stores and scour them for Bowie’s voluminous back catalog, because listening to Bowie made me feel less alone. It made me feel like being a freak and a weirdo and an outsider was a wonderful thing to be, like not fitting in was a state of grace and not something to be ashamed of or embarrassed by.Bowie had the power to liberate, empower, entertain, and delight, but he also had the power to stun, shock, and devastate, as his death illustrated. The shock and devastation Bowie’s cult (which I like to think includes everyone on earth) experienced upon learning of his death echoed the seismic shock that went through the audience when, on July 3rd, 1973, at the end of a tour promoting Aladdin Sane, Bowie took to the microphone and told the crowd at the Hammersmith Odeon, “Not only is this the last show of the tour, but it’s the last show that we’ll ever do.”The crowd could be forgiven for assuming that their hero was retiring permanently, that he was ending one of the most important careers of the 20th century in its relative infancy. It was a moment of almost inconceivable drama and intensity, captured by the cameras of D.A. Pennebaker, the unassuming genius who earlier had made one of the greatest rock and roll movies ever in Don’t Look Back, about a strange young man named Dylan with a voice like sand and glue.Don’t Look Back captured an enigmatic icon in the midst of a creative transformation whose aftershocks are still being felt. The same is true of the film that would eventually be named Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars: The Motion Picture. However,&nbsp;where Don’t Look Back’s impact was instant, Ziggy Stardust went largely unseen for a decade after production ended, only seeing release on home video in 1983, at which point Bowie had reinvented himself countless times and was now a sleek mainstream pop star whose videos were played on MTV and whose catchy ditties were repurposed for Pepsi commercials. It was Bowie’s most commercial period, literally (in that, you know, he made a commercial for soda pop) and a far cry from the androgynous theatricality of his glam rock days.Business kept this essential document of one of the great turning points in pop music history out of public view for an entire momentous decade: Bowie had split acrimoniously from his management, Tony DeFries and his Mainman company, and was not eager to hand over a big chunk of the film’s proceeds to people he now despised. But art played a role as well; Bowie had shed his skin, creatively speaking, turning Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars: The Motion Picture into an instant nostalgia piece from an artist who was always pushing forward instead of looking back.Ziggy Stardust certainly did not sit on a shelf for a decade for reasons having to do with quality, because the movie isn’t just good — it’s damn near transcendent. It’s not the same as being there, obviously, but it’s the next best thing, and because it is a film, it is permanent, whereas part of the wonder and majesty and melancholy of a truly great rock and roll show (and this sure qualifies) is that it’s ephemeral — experienced in the moment, then lost to the ages.Watching Ziggy Stardust, it’s easy to see why Bowie might feel ambivalence towards it despite its brilliance and importance. After a bitter break-up with DeFries, he couldn’t have been happy to see the film (which boasts a 1982 copyright despite being filmed nearly a decade earlier) posited as a Mainman production Executive-Produced by DeFries, or that DeFries himself is mentioned within the first few minutes of the film.“Bowie is the white-hot epicenter around which everything revolves, a master showman bathed in red light as he glides across the stage like a tiger on vaseline.”Bowie begins the film having his make-up put on as he smokes a cigarette and drinks from a cup. It’s an oddly life-sized, modest introduction to a man who is as larger-than-life as King Kong the moment he steps onstage, sporting an eccentric succession of clothes that would look more at home in the wardrobes of Lady Gaga or Nicki Minaj than on another male rock star: skimpy kimonos that barely cover his ass, skin-tight onesies, giant boots and a catsuit that clings to Bowie’s gaunt frame and, like his famously tight pants in Labyrinth, aggressively highlights his package.It’s the calm before the storm, as Bowie jokes and flirts with his wife Angela and reflects on the palpable excitement of the crowd, an endless expanse of beautiful kids for whom being at a Bowie show is the best kind of altered state, the most exquisite kind of natural high, although, to be fair, it’s safe to assume much of the audience is zonked out of their minds on less natural highs as well.Bowie sports a mullet in a shade of orange not seen in nature and black-ringed raccoon eyes, but as soon as he steps onstage, his strange/regrettable fashion choices stop mattering, and the oddly calm man preparing to go to work becomes a towering, brash, and confident rock god, a titan whose fiercely tight band the Spiders From Mars roars their way through an exhilarating early assault of glam-rock anthems: “Hang On To Yourself,” “Ziggy Stardust,” and “Watch That Man.”Just about every song comments, obliquely or not, on the essence of performance and this particular show, where Bowie will dramatically end one of the greatest creative periods of his or anybody else’s career. Bowie is the white-hot epicenter around which everything revolves; he’s both&nbsp;a master showman bathed in red light as he glides across the stage like a tiger on vaseline, and an outsider commenting on the action from a cerebral distance.Ziggy Stardust would be worth seeing if only for the rare opportunity to witness the electric chemistry between Bowie and guitarist Mick Ronson, a bleached blonde stud wielding his guitar like a glistening metal phallus. Though it’s Bowie’s show, Ronson makes an indelible impression both with his magnetic stage presence and his slashing, virtuoso guitar playing. That’s part of what makes the film so simultaneously magical and melancholy: this incredible band is calling it quits, but giving fans one last masterclass in musicianship and theatricality on its way out.Bowie’s covers are never random or arbitrary: they always say something meaningful about Bowie as an artist and a man, about the forces that molded and shaped him and the heroes on behalf of whom he never stopped evangelizing. Given the finality of the show, it’s easy to read his cover of Jaques Brel’s “My Death” as a requiem for the alter ego he’s about to unexpectedly bury.The finality of the concert gives songs like “Changes,” “Cracked Actor” and “Time” an additional resonance. The audience didn’t know it yet — hell, outside of Ronson, Bowie’s own band didn’t know it yet — but Bowie was choosing songs that were designed as a goodbye, as an elegy to the astonishingly fertile period that gave the world Hunky Dory, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust,&nbsp;and Aladdin Sane in quick succession.But because this is Bowie, it’s full of glorious weirdness, like an epic, almost 10-minute long jam of “The Width Of A Circle” in which Bowie, perpetually the oddball theater kid, indulges in some miming that almost (but not quite) makes being a mime seem cool. Bowie doesn’t say much during the concert, instead letting his music and showmanship speak for him, which makes the gut-punch of his final announcement all the more potent and astonishing.“Ronson makes an indelible impression both with his magnetic stage presence and his slashing, virtuoso guitar playing.”To soften the blow, Bowie and the Spiders from Mars launch into the film- and concert-ending “Rock and Roll Suicide,” yet another anthem rich with meaning and dramatic irony that comments poignantly and powerfully on a night and a show unlike any other. Prowling the stage, Bowie shouts the words “You’re not alone” with equal parts empathy and raw urgency. It’s the essence of his timeless appeal, his message boiled down to its heartbreaking, life-affirming core. It’s the perfect way to end not just a night but an era.Watching Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars: The Movie in the endless shadow of Bowie’s death and the massive worldwide outpouring of grief and appreciation is inspiring and heartbreaking because it allows Bowie to live again, to be young again, even if he never seemed to have gotten old. It seems strange to say this about a 69-year-old man, but it still feels like Bowie died young, that he was taken from us much too soon.But the film is also inspiring because the concert that shockingly killed off his most dazzling, brilliant creation (aside, of course, from David Bowie, the pansexual rock god born, improbably but amusingly enough, as David Jones, a moniker that already belonged to a rock star of a slightly cornier variety) marked an ending, but also a new beginning.Bowie would rise from the ashes of his Ziggy Stardust persona to recreate himself time and time again as everything from a blue-eyed soul man to a cocaine-ravaged art rocker to a shiny MTV-approved mainstream pop star. When Bowie made his bold pronouncement at the end of the concert, it must have felt, to fans who worshipped him and lusted after him and dressed like him and wanted to be him, not just like the end of a concert and a tour and a persona, but like the end of the world.If Bowie had ended everything after that concert, if his recording career was essentially “Space Oddity,”&nbsp;The Man Who Sold The World, Hunky Dory, The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars,&nbsp;and Aladdin Sane, his legacy would still be immense. He’d still be one of the greatest rock stars of the 1970s. He’d be one of those people, like Gram Parsons, Kurt Cobain (who breathed so much soul and tenderness and beauty into his cover of Bowie’s “The Man Who Sold The World”), J-Dilla, 2Pac, or Nick Drake, whose influence belies their short lives and abbreviated careers.Just as that final concert as Ziggy Stardust wasn’t the end, I’d like to think that Bowie’s death is not the end either. Bowie had a way of making people believers, if not in the concept of a higher power, then in the transformative, life-affirming powers of art and music. I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;that while Bowie’s body has breathed its last breath, his spirit has found its rightful home in the heavens, in the stars that he sung about with such grace and eloquence. We may need to leave our own earthly bodies to reconnect with Bowie, to see his next transformation and reinvention, and while that might seem a little scary, I have no doubt that with Bowie, the show would be more than worth the price of admission.Original Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;71 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"Fall, CMT, leads, Turner, fast, American, Day, Studios, Returns","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20021435/ZiggyStardust21.jpg","slug":"why-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from-mars-deserves-cult-status"},{"id":"47508944881877","title":"Why Pure Country Deserves Another Chance","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why Pure Country Deserves Another ChanceIn the wake of country legend Merle Haggard's death, Nathan Rabin looks at a small film that explores the nature of country music stardom.by Nathan Rabin | May 18, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;Country music places a curious, even perverse premium on authenticity and purity, on the concept of “real” or “true” or “pure” country that stands strong in sharp contrast to the watered-down compromises and cynical calculation of the stuff you hear on the radio. Yet country itself is inveterately a mutt — a genre and a state of mind with its roots in folk and blues and Hawaiian guitar and a whole mess of other unexpected and unlikely influences.Merle Haggard, who died recently after a remarkable life and career, represents the impure nature of country. No matter what he sang, it invariably sounded country, even if its roots were in the howling railroad blues of Jimmie Rodgers, the jazz-infused western swing of Haggard’s beloved Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys, or the more conventional jazz of a song like “It’s All In The Movies.” It was the very lack of purity that made Haggard so compelling and so difficult to pin down culturally and musically.During&nbsp;the Countrypolitan days of the 1950s and 1960s, producers dressed up the hillbilly sentiments of country crooners with strings and fancy background vocal groups in an attempt to appeal to a more cosmopolitan audience. In the decades that followed, a never-ending battle raged for the soul of the genre. When Garth Brooks brought country to the masses in the late 1980s, he was vilified by purists as a man who had made country more popular than ever at the cost of the genre’s everlasting soul.So when country superstar and Brooks rival George Strait made his film debut with a movie called Pure Country at the height of Garth Brooks’ gaudy Vegas-style crossover success, it sure felt like an overt commentary on Brooks’ appeal. Pure Country is about a country superstar played by a country superstar, but on a more symbolic level, it was about the uncertain state of country music in the early 1990s.Was country the righteous rebel music of the white Southern underclass, or something to entertain Wal-Mart managers during their commute to work? Was it the music of honky-tonks or arenas? Was it a form of folk music sacred to its true believers, or money-making pop? Pure Country has strong, unsurprising opinions on this subject,but in star George Strait, it had the best of both worlds. Strait was the arena-ready superstar of the Garth Brooks/Shania Twain era who was also widely respected&nbsp;by those&nbsp;who worshiped gods like Haggard, Johnny Cash, and Hank Williams.In his first and final lead performance as a film actor, Strait acquits himself quite nicely.Pure Country opens with some&nbsp;kitschy&nbsp;Americana, as we’re ushered into the film’s country-fried world by images of a clean-cut boy growing up, set to the tune of a child’s off-key voice warbling about all of the following subjects, among others:twin fiddlesa steel guitarthe heartlandthe American heartOpry musicsmilingtearsa good man’s work ethicconventional moralitydecent common folkThen, about halfway through, something remarkable happens. The child’s voice is replaced by the strong, confident crooning of a man named George Strait, and the song stops feeling like a silly, borderline embarrassing burlesque of country corn and begins to feel like a country song, and a pretty solid, convincing one at that.I spent two years exploring the heart worn highways of country music history for a column I wrote for The A.V Club called Nashville or Bust, and in that time I came to develop not just a tolerance but an appreciation for&nbsp;country schmaltz. Cornball Americana and shameless pandering are such core elements of the genre&nbsp;that to complain about them is a little like griping&nbsp;that a blues song or artist isn’t chipper enough. When something is a central aspect of a genre, it seems a little silly to single it out as a fault.We then segue from the past to the present, where Strait’s character, “Dusty” Chandler, is rampaging his way through the massive arenas of God’s own United States in a furious hurry, like he’s freakin’&nbsp;Kiss or something. Unlike his own superstar persona, Strait is cast&nbsp;as a man with Garth Brooks’ over-the-top, Branson-on-acid stage show and Billy Ray Cyrus’ regrettable follicular situation.Director Christopher Cain layers the stadium-sized performances of Dusty and his band in a way that conveys how exciting it must be for fans to hear these songs and how draining and tedious it might be to play them over and over again, night after night. Dusty isn’t just bigger than he’d like to be. Like Garth Brooks in the early 1990s, he’s probably bigger, commercially, than anyone should be, particularly someone whose music and roots and aesthetics can be traced to honky-tonks.Dusty’s manager Lulu Rogers — played by a scene-stealing, scenery-devouring Leslie Anne Warren as a show-business anti-Christ in the devil’s red leather — just wants to keep the money train running&nbsp;smoothly. She’s already moved on, psychologically and professionally, to the next handsome man in a cowboy hat she plans to make a star, a squirrely ball of scheming professional ambition played with brash charisma by a pre-stardom, pre-Friday Night Lights Kyle Chandler.The tacky glamour of bright lights and packed houses have lost all appeal for Dusty. After a particularly frustrating performance, he decides to just walk out, to turn his back on stardom and return to his roots, both geographical and cultural, by heading back to his hometown in a bid to win back his soul and regain his love for music.Pure Country feels fundamentally honest and convincing despite the ridiculously melodramatic nature of its plot and its corny themes and messages.Pure Country takes the notion that the glitz and spectacle of the Garth Brooks aesthetic were so blinding that it almost didn’t matter who was up on stage to its logical extreme by literally replacing Dusty with Buddy without anyone noticing. This might seem unrealistic, but remember that at the height of his fame, Garth Brooks himself was replaced onstage by a lookalike roadie with a weight problem for as many as 30 dates a year without a single person noticing.While Lulu tries to keep Dusty’s tour going even after he mysteriously goes AWOL, our disgruntled and dissatisfied protagonist re-learns the simple pleasures and homespun joys of small town life. He even begins dating&nbsp;a small town girl (Isabel Glasser) with aspirations to win the big rodeo so that she can save the family farm from those meanies over at the bank.Pure Country was made with a light touch that allows it to simultaneously tap into the homey&nbsp;conventions of country music, which deify the dewy innocence and goodness of common folk, and&nbsp;demonize and vilify fancy-pants big-money city slickers, having fun with them all the while.&nbsp;There’s a quietly wonderful scene, for example, when Dusty’s drummer and sidekick, Earl Blackstock (character actor and X frontman&nbsp;John Doe), visits Dusty’s grandmother in his efforts to track down his boss and get him to return to the tour. Rather than offer a direct answer, grandma dispenses metaphorical homespun country wisdom about roots and branches and whatnot.&nbsp;Doe, who brings to the role a sense of authenticity that can only come from&nbsp;a lifelong musician playing&nbsp;a lifelong musician, handles the scene perfectly. His goofy smile and sense of incredulity conveys that the grandma may, in fact, be the wise guru she appears to be, or she could just be a crazy old lady babbling gibberish that people mistake for wisdom.Strait has a nice chemistry with Doe that makes it easy to believe that the two of them have been performing together for decades; their&nbsp;musical and non-musical bond is so strong it borders on telepathic. He brings an ingratiating prickliness to the role, particularly in the first act when he’s getting ready to leave his gilded cage in search of the America of pick-up truck commercials and Republican campaign ads.&nbsp;In his first and, it turns out, final lead performance as a film actor, Strait acquits himself quite nicely.Like country itself, Pure Country is in love with cliches, particularly the one&nbsp;about country music being all about soul and sincerity and personal expression, about the music, man, and not the glitz and the glamour and the fireworks shows and flying harnesses and concept albums where bored country-pop powerhouses pretend to be fictional Australian rockers with soul patches.Pure Country is largely devoid of surprises, but that doesn’t make it any less emotionally satisfying.Here’s the thing about country music, pure or otherwise. It doesn’t matter if the words, sentiments and ideas being expressed are original or shocking or bold or new. No, it only matters that the emotions being expressed feel honest and sincere and true. On that level, Pure Country feels fundamentally honest and convincing despite the ridiculously melodramatic nature of its plot and its corny themes and messages.As a movie star as well as a musician, George Strait has a real gift for selling even the tritest of sentiments through presence, directness, and effortless charisma. Pure Country has the good sense to put Strait next to a microphone with a guitar in his hands for much of the film. As a country music morality tale where the spirit of Willie, Waylon, and Hank triumphs over the crass vulgarity of the Garth Brooks phenomenon, Pure Country is largely devoid of surprises, but that doesn’t make it any less emotionally satisfying.Pure Country was not a hit, but today it has a distinct cult among people like my father-in-law, a South African neurologist in suburban Atlanta who loves nothing more than to pick up a guitar while howling a Bob Dylan song. Culturally, his roots are a ways removed, but he feels the music in his soul. That’s what really matters.He must not be alone in his love of Pure Country,&nbsp;because almost two decades after it disappointed at the box-office, a direct to video sequel was released, featuring a cameo from Strait as himself, confusingly enough. Aside from that, Strait hasn’t starred in any more movies, and considering how confidently and ably he carries Pure Country, that’s a bit of a shame. After Pure Country (whose soundtrack&nbsp;is the most successful album of Strait’s extraordinarily accomplished career), Strait went back to being one of the biggest, most loved country stars in existence, which is a heck of a consolation prize for a commercially unsuccessful movie that looks more and more like a success with each passing year.Early in Pure Country, I had an intense feeling of deja vu before I remembered what half-forgotten bit of cornball cornpone Pure Country reminded me of. Then it hit me: Pure Country bears a suspiciously close resemblance to a masterpiece of the cinematic arts known as Hannah Montana: The Movie, which was similarly about a big star rediscovering what’s important while revisiting her small town roots.Hannah Montana: The Movie costarred Strait’s Pure Country doppelgänger (at least before Dusty shaves and gets a good Christian hair-cut) Billy Ray Cyrus, as well as his musician daughter Miley. Cyrus’ roots are in country, but these days she’s all things to all people (with the exception of the proper church folks what cottoned to her in the first place), a bold pop icon whose persona transgresses all manner of boundaries involving culture and gender and sexuality and race and performance and authenticity. Like good old Merle Haggard, Miley Cyrus is a mutt who takes inspiration from all over. In that respect, she’s held on to her country roots all the same, albeit a strain of country that is boldly, defiantly, and sometimes transcendently non-pure.Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;38 percentRe-Certification:&nbsp;FreshNathan Rabin if a freelance writer, columnist, the first head writer of The A.V.

The Room occupies a weirdly rarified place in the trash cinema realm as, to quote the title of a documentary about Troll 2&nbsp;(a previous honoree), the “best worst movie.”The Room is the gold standard for exquisitely, transcendently, historically unself-conscious awfulness, but in recent years its position has been threatened by Neil Breen’s Fateful Findings. The movie has an unmistakable The Room quality, if only because both films are the works of homely middle-aged men the world might otherwise ignore, but who look in the mirror and clearly see a younger, sexier Ryan Gosling with Steve McQueen’s swagger and James Dean’s effortless, timeless cool.Like The Room‘s&nbsp;Tommy Wiseau, Breen is unwisely obsessed with sharing his unclothed body with the world, but while Wiseau thrust the image of his naked ass grinding into the minds, subconsciouses, and nightmares of his audiences with brutal, nightmarish force, Breen treats his audience to&nbsp;scene after scene where his top is ripped off in a sexual frenzy, revealing a hairless, bird-like chest Breen apparently imagines will send women into fits of erotic ecstasy.Astonishingly, Breen seems to understand the mechanics and psychology of sex even less than Wiseau does. Wiseau at least seemed to have seen a few Cinemax erotic thrillers and surmised that roses, forgettable R&amp;B music, sexy red dresses, and ass-thrusting are essential to the act of making love. The sex scenes in Fateful Findings feel like they were ghost-written by a 10-year-old boy who has yet to be&nbsp;given the “facts of life” speech and imagines that babies are the product of two adults awkwardly hugging each other standing up, sometimes in a shower with one party rocking a dinner plate-sized bandage on his face, and sometimes in the presence of the many laptops that are Fateful Findings’&nbsp;primary set dressing.“Imagine a version of The Room that’s 10&nbsp;times as ambitious and twice as incompetent.”To get a sense of the film’s delirious lunacy, imagine a version of The Room that’s 10&nbsp;times as ambitious and twice as incompetent. Wiseau might have sought out to be Marlon Brando and Tennessee Williams in the same disturbing-to-look-at package, but Breen sets out to be Marlon Brando, David Lynch, a Nicolas Sparks romantic hero (and for good matter, Nicolas Sparks), a Spike Lee-style provocateur with a kitchen-sink approach to social commentary, Alan Pakula when he made All The President’s Men,&nbsp;and Douglas Sirk in the 1950s.Wiseau made a movie about the duplicity of women and the tragic futility of being a nice guy. Breen made a movie about everything, including magic. The film opens with a pair of children — a boy named Dylan and a girl named Leah — on a hike through the woods who discover some rocks that have some manner of magical power, though the exact nature of that power remains ambiguous throughout the film. Many thrillers thrive on an underlying sense of mystery; with Fateful Findings, that mystery often takes the form of, “What the hell&nbsp;is going on?” Having now seen it, I can only offer a feeble and insufficient answer to that question.Dylan grows up to be a best-selling author played by Breen himself, who looks like someone was molding a replica of David Duchovny’s face and, after getting 10&nbsp;or 11 crucial things wrong — a turkey-like expanse of wobbly neck fat where his chin should be, a weird, unruly net of hair — just decided to give up and leave the mess unfinished. Breen is not bad looking (if your tastes run towards unattractive middle-aged men), but in the strange world of Fateful Findings, Dylan is sexually irresistible to women of multiple generations, despite his predilection for yelling at them as if he were&nbsp;a hectoring Jewish grandma, not a moody cross between Edward Snowden, M. Night Shyamalin’s character in The Lady In The Water (you know, the one whose next book will benefit all of humanity with its genius), and sexy cyber-Jesus.The now adult Dylan is perambulating about one uneventful day when a Rolls-Royce barrels down the road and hits him with a cartoonish force and velocity that can only be deemed “hilarious.” It’s never encouraging when the formative trauma in a film engenders the kind of sustained belly laugh that comedy professionals dream of scoring at least once in their life.Dylan ends up in the hospital and the prognosis is grim. Nobody thinks he has much of a chance of survival, including an attractive blonde woman in scrubs who volunteers, apropos of nothing, that this strange mystery man is not her patient but she’ll check in on him anyway.This at first appears to be a wonderfully unnecessary, irrelevant detail, like The Room tossing in a character with cancer as an afterthought, but in the world of Fateful Findings, there are no coincidences. It turns out that this comely&nbsp;medical professional is Leah (Jennifer Autry) from the opening scenes, despite the fact that she looks a&nbsp;good 20&nbsp;years younger than the haggard-looking middle-aged man with whom she once shared a childhood. Apparently those magical stones caused one of the young sweethearts to age and wither at a markedly faster rate than the other.“Breen’s&nbsp;conception of politics is as childlike as his conception of sex and romantic relationships.”Unfortunately for Dylan, he already has a partner in Emily (Klara Landrat), who he slinks out of the hospital to have bloody, bandaged, stand-up shower sex with after making a miraculous, possibly magic stone-powered recovery. Alas, Dylan’s relationship with Emily is not magical in nature, nor have the schmaltzy forces of fate designated her his soulmate, so their coupling is innately doomed, especially after Emily proves herself unworthy of a genius sex bomb like Dylan by getting addicted to the pain pills he heroically refuses to take.Dylan is supposed to be writing a follow-up to his debut novel, but he’s got more important things to do. It seems he’s got a side gig as the world’s greatest hacker, using the many laptops littered around his office to hack into government and corporate files, and he’s discovered more incriminating information than any hacker in the history of the universe.What kind of incriminating information? Fateful Findings doesn’t bother&nbsp;wasting its time specifying exactly what Dylan is doing as a whistleblower. He’s blowing the whistle! He’s delivering a lid-blower that’s blowing a lid off all the bad stuff the bad guys are doing, with the money and the lies and the corruption!&nbsp;Dylan’s revelations are so shocking and profound that when he announces&nbsp;them in a press conference (where he is hilariously and unconvincingly green-screened in front of a Washington, D.C. tableau), they compel all of the bad people who are doing the bad things to confess publicly, and then commit suicide in dramatic fashion as penance. The film&nbsp;is, remarkably, a political thriller with no politics. Breen wants to expose the covert machinations of the powerful, but his conception of backroom statecraft&nbsp;is as childlike as his conception of sex and romantic relationships. He&nbsp;comes out against the stealing and the cover-ups and the hypocrisy and the lies and whatnot, but that’s the extent of his political commentary.Fateful Findings is paced and scored like a massage so sleepy and glacial that it puts even the masseuse to sleep. It&nbsp;has the hypnotic, disorienting quality of a waking dream, in part because it’s difficult, if not impossible, to regard the action as anything vaguely resembling reality. Really, the only way Fateful Findings would make any sense at all would be as the elaborate, narcissistic fantasy of power and sexual virility experienced by a sad baby-man just before he dies after getting slammed by a Rolls-Royce at what appears to be a hundred miles an hour.&nbsp;I haven’t even mentioned Dylan’s beer- and car-loving best friend, whose wife kills him and makes it look like a suicide, or the sexy teenage girl out to seduce Dylan, because honestly, there is far too much craziness in Fateful Findings to chronicle completely in a mere 2000 word essay.On an episode devoted to the film,&nbsp;one of the commentators on the glorious bad-movie podcast The Flop House noted that what truly great films and truly terrible films have in common is an exhilarating element of unpredictability. You literally never know what’s going to happen next. That’s true of Citizen Kane. It’s also true of Fateful Findings. Because it inhabits so many different genres and understands so little about each one, it’s impossible to predict whether a specific scene in Fateful Findings will be devoted to Breen’s weird sexual issues, his messianic sense of specialness, the weird splashes of David Lynch-style gothic surrealism, or his child-like understanding&nbsp;of romance, whimsy and magic. The Room is a slave to convention by comparison.“Fateful Findings doesn’t want to be a great bad movie; it just wants to be great.”That’s what makes the film so endlessly fascinating. Breen isn’t just free of&nbsp;the rules and dictates of professional filmmaking. No, he’s also free of&nbsp;the rules and dictates of logic, sanity, and rational, adult thinking. In Fateful Findings, there is a gulf both tragic and poignant between the man Breen clearly imagines he is and the reality, as well as between the film Breen imagines he’s making and the film he actually produced.The promise of outsider art is that, whether through neurology, psychology or history, there are some people who see the world differently than everyone else does, and they create art or entertainment or psychodrama that powerfully reflects that unique understanding or, in the case of the Wiseaus and Breens, lack of understanding.Like The Room, Fateful Findings is less fascinating as a coherent, comprehensible work of art or entertainment than as a revealing window into its creator’s rampaging madness. As such, its rewards are infinite, its mysteries captivating. It’s a worthy successor to&nbsp;The Room in part because it never aspires to be the next great bad movie. Fateful Findings doesn’t want to be a great bad movie; it just wants to be great.That almost embarrassing sense of intimacy is only enhanced by the fact that you cannot buy a DVD of Fateful Findings on Amazon, nor rent it from Netflix, although you can stream, rent, or buy a digital copy of the film on Amazon. I purchased this much buzzed-about cult sensation directly from fatefulfindings.biz. Breen shipped it out in a screener with no packaging, just a no-nonsense case, which added to the feel that I was procuring Fateful Findings straight from its creator’s warped mind.Nothing destroys a great bad movie like an excess of winking self-consciousness, by a need to let the audience know you’re in on the joke. Not only is&nbsp;Fateful Findings not&nbsp;in on the joke, it inhabits a world where jokes do not exist, only trembling sincerity and tone-deaf earnestness. It is this earnestness that makes Fateful Findings something special. A movie that does everything right is an absolute miracle, but so is a movie that gets everything wrong, and now that I have been introduced to Breen’s surreal world, I can’t wait to delve back into it again and again.My Certification:&nbsp;FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;N/A (Audience Score: 30 percent)Follow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"what, laika, cults, Prime, TBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/09012229/FatefulFindings.jpg","slug":"why-fateful-findings-deserves-cult-status"},{"id":"47508946388197","title":"Does Grandma’s Boy Deserve Cult Status?","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Does Grandma's Boy Deserve Cult Status?In our new feature, Nathan Rabin revisits films on the cusp of becoming cult favorites.by Nathan Rabin | September 2, 2015 |  CommentsWelcome to the first entry in Sub-Cult, a series devoted to weirdly infectious cinematic oddities on the cusp of becoming the cult films of tomorrow. One of my inspirations for this column is my former colleague Scott Tobias’ wonderful AV Club column New Cult Canon, but this will not be about proposing a new cult canon. Instead, it will be about exploring movies that have caught on in unexpected ways, and have attracted devoted, even obsessive followings despite a widespread consensus that they are terrible.I will not be writing about Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Room, or Birdemic. Do not expect the usual suspects, or, for that matter, The Usual Suspects, here. I’m calling the column Sub-Cult partially because cult movies are particularly subculture-friendly, while some, like Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Big Lebowski and The Room, have attracted genuine subcultures of their own. It’s also called Sub-Cult because it’s about movies that have tenaciously hung around without rising to the level of clear-cut cult favorites. Lastly, it’s called Sub-Cult because there is a widespread consensus that just about every film I’m writing about here isn’t a cult movie that was misunderstood at the time of its release and went on to become treasured, but rather a movie that is sub-par, sub-standard and just plain not up to snuff.I want the entries in this column to be on the provocative side. When you write about cult movies, you’re writing about audiences, time, and the way public perception shifts through the decades as much as you’re writing about the movies themselves. Cinematic cults are a glorious tribute to the diversity of human opinion. One man’s “crappy movie that rightly failed because it’s terrible” is another’s “favorite movie ever,” a movie they feel so passionately about that they’re eager to evangelize on its behalf to anyone who will listen, and even people who won’t.I will be writing extensively here about movies that I myself panned over the course of my nearly 20-year career as a film critic who finds himself inextricably drawn to the dregs of cinema. That includes this column’s inaugural entry: Grandma’s Boy, a 2006 vehicle for Allen Covert, a member of Adam Sandler’s Happy Madison Mafia who owes his career as a producer, writer, and supporting player to staying on the boss’ good side.“With no real persona or blinding charisma to get in the way, it’s easy for fans to project themselves onto either Allen Covert or Alex, the character he plays.”Lesser members of the Madison Mafia like Rob Schneider, David Spade, Kevin James, and Nick Swardson at least have well-defined personas to translate to film: Schneider’s a silent-movie slapstick schmuck; Spade is smarmy and condescending, even when playing a hillbilly dumbass; James is a sappy, sad sack oaf; and Swardson’s an effeminate weirdo. But the strange appeal and limitation of Covert as a movie star is that he comes across as just some guy.Even Sandler fans who have seen Covert in multiple movies might have a hard time picking him out of a lineup or even describing him in useful terms. He’s, I dunno, handsome-ish? Or at least not bad looking, in a forgettable way? As for his comic sensibility, he’s sarcastic, I guess? And kinda immature and goofy, not unlike pretty much every lead character in a lowbrow comedy?Yet the very features that make Covert a perverse choice to star in a theatrically released movie also make him an oddly relatable everyman. When I originally saw the movie, I quipped that it felt&nbsp;like Covert had won a “Star In Your Own Happy Madison Movie” contest, or that the film was the product of a month Covert spent with some very indulgent counselors and fellow campers at Happy Madison Comedy Movie Fantasy Camp.I meant it in a pejorative way, but it also captures the film’s curious appeal. With no real persona or blinding charisma to get in the way, it’s easy for fans to project themselves onto either Allen Covert or Alex, the character he plays. On one level, that is not a tantalizing proposition. Alex is no Don Draper alpha male; he’s a 35-year-old video game tester who moves in with his grandma. And Covert was no Orson Welles when he made his starring debut, but a journeyman comedy lifer who had managed to be involved in lots of Sandler projects, dating back to his 1989 debut Going Overboard, without distinguishing himself in any way.On another level, both Covert and Alex lead enviable existences, at least by the standards of the slackers and stoners attracted to the Happy Madison universe. Covert lucked out by starring in a movie where he gets to hang out with his Happy Madison buddies, pretend to smoke weed and play video games, and make out with Linda Cardellini.Alex is an even luckier devil. A 35-year-old man who lives with his grandma, he’s got supportive friends always happy to smoke pot and play video games with him (preferably at the same time), a grandmother (Doris Roberts as Lilly) who adores and spoils him, and the slacker/stoner dream job of testing video games, which sounds like a career a dying child would invent as part of the Make-A-Wish program.Alex’s dream job gets even dreamier when he discovers that his new boss is Samantha (Cardellini), a hip, sexy and fun figure of complete male nerd fantasy tasked with ensuring that a video game designed by former prodigy and current off-putting weirdo J.P. (Joel David Moore) is finished on time. In a rare nod to realism, the mere presence of a woman who looks like Samantha in a characteristically male realm like video games reduces pretty much every man she encounters to a state of drooling, open-mouthed infatuation. Alex is among those instantly love-struck and tries to find the way to his boss’ heart despite his less than ideal living arrangements. There’s also a plot of sorts involving J.P. stealing the game Alex has been developing covertly in his spare time, but it’s better to simply ignore it entirely.Grandma’s Boy has a wonderfully endearing quality that later Happy Madison productions would fatally lack: it likes its characters and invites audiences to share that affection, instead of treating its characters like the worst kind of human garbage. It’s a much better vehicle for Swardson than Bucky Larson: Born To Be A Star, and while his emotionally stunted virgin falls squarely into Swardson’s well-wrought persona as a Manic Pixie Nightmare Boy, he emerges as a funny, likable character who is even afforded a moment of triumph when he absolutely destroys at a game of Dance Dance Revolution.“The mere presence of a woman who looks like Samantha reduces pretty much every man she encounters to a state of drooling, open-mouthed infatuation.”The DDR sequence is a standout, a casual masterpiece of intricately choreographed physical comedy, but Swardson isn’t the only member of the Happy Madison B-team whose gifts are uniquely well-suited to the film. Covert makes for an unexpectedly likable and appealing straight man, and perennial supporting player Peter Dante is hilarious as “Dante,” a perma-tanned, weed-dealing space cadet with a weakness for importing dangerous animals from Africa to protect his pot stash.Even J.P. strikes a strangely sympathetic figure because his defining characteristic isn’t arrogance or a complete inability to understand how human beings function, but rather a desperate loneliness and poignant, innately doomed desire to connect with other people. J.P. communicates partially through a stereotypical “robot” voice that seems to belong to a split personality within him, giving the character a distinct “Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Robo-Hyde” vibe. He seems to want to live not just in the world of The Matrix but inside the Matrix itself, and decorates his office,&nbsp;computer style, with an endless series of zeros and ones. It’s telling that Grandma’s Boy invites more sympathy for its robot-emulating wannabe-android villain than the vast majority of Happy Madison productions do for their protagonists.A young Jonah Hill also makes an indelible impression as one of Alex’s co-workers, in no small part because he spends much of his screen time suckling lustily at the breast of a stripper he meets at a wild party. Jonah Hill’s predilection for adult breastfeeding even makes it into Kool Keith’s surprisingly comprehensive&nbsp;theme song “Grandma’s Boyee,” which doesn’t just lay out the entire plot, it pretty much covers every subplot and story beat as well. If I were Hill, having Kool Keith rap about my character’s unusual habit would be as big an honor, if not bigger, than getting nominated for multiple Academy Awards.Grandma’s Boy is wonderfully inclusive in its comedy; it’s the kind of film where, with the notable exception of J.P., damn near everyone gets laid, damn near everyone smokes weed, everyone plays video games, and everyone has friends who like them, no matter how geeky or socially inept they might be. The relationships here are drawn tenderly and with affection, from Alex’s sweet bond with his loving grandmother to Alex and Jeff’s friendship. Covert’s lack of a persona or star-power ends up working in the film’s favor, giving it a scruffy, underdog charm Happy Madison has lacked since Sandler’s early films. This is a movie about a loser who manages to make his loserish lifestyle work for him, starring the least distinctive and well-known member of Adam Sandler’s crew, and it ends up succeeding as a strange form of nerdy wish-fulfillment.When it flopped in theaters, the film was at the mercy of two demographics least likely to view it kindly: film critics inclined, both by profession and disposition, to view lowbrow stoner comedies involving kung-fu fighting monkeys and stoned grandmas harshly and without compassion, and audiences asked to pay bloated movie ticket prices to see a frigging Allen Covert vehicle. Meanwhile, the film’s success as a sub-cult film and home video smash (according to the-numbers.com, it has grossed over $30 million on DVD, more than five times its theatrical take) is attributable to the fact that it’s now at the mercy of demographics most inclined to view it kindly: stoners who see it in the low-cost, low-expectation world of home video or on cable, where it seems to be playing on a constant loop.“A young Jonah Hill also makes an indelible impression as one of Alex’s co-workers.”Grandma’s Boy is what Quentin Tarantino has described as a “hang out movie,” a genial romp filled with quotable lines and fun characters it’s a pleasure to spend time with. After panning the film originally, I came to warm up to it in this new context. As a movie I caught parts of at my buddy Paul’s house, or on cable late at night, I developed a grudging fondness for it that blossomed into outright, genuine appreciation when I re-watched it in its entirety for this column.Adam Sandler executive produced Grandma’s Boy but does not appear. Sandler can currently be seen onscreen in another video-game movie, the more or less universally reviled Pixels. The strange voyage of Grandma’s Boy from inexplicably theatrically-distributed vehicle for one of the dimmest lights in the Happy Madison galaxy to well-liked fan favorite illustrates that you can never really tell how a film will ultimately be received by audiences. Yet I can say with absolute certainty that nine years from now, I will not be writing an appreciation of Pixels as a misunderstood, under-appreciated sleeper.I thoroughly enjoyed Grandma’s Boy but I’m not too eager to see Covert in a lead role again. Much of the film’s charm comes from its modest scope, and I quite like Grandma’s Boy as an overachieving one-off rather than the beginning of a career. As Sandler and a public increasingly exhausted with his antics can attest, it’s better to not star in enough movies than to exhaust the public’s tolerance for your shtick by starring in way too many movies.My Original Certification: RottenMy Re-Certification: FreshTomatometer: 18 percentUp next: Grease 2","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"CBS, Academy, TruTV, international","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/GrandmasBoy2b.jpg","slug":"sub-cult-grandmas-boy"},{"id":"47508947646699","title":"All Pixar Movies Ranked From Best to Worst","content":"(Photo by Pixar / courtesy Everett Collection)All Pixar Movies Ranked By TomatometerWhen Disney distributed Pixar’s Toy Story as an autumn alternative to traditional 2D animated features in 1995, could the studio have predicted that it would instead set the gold standard and template for theatrical cartoons for decades to come? After all, the slide from peak Disney Renaissance had only just begun (their releases that year were Pocahontas and A Goofy Movie) and Pixar&nbsp;was up to that point&nbsp;a studio that only made commercials and shorts; a feature-length 3D animated movie was a miracle in of itself, and they were not equipped to churn out quality yearly releases like Walt Disney Animation.Pixar’s follow-up took three years to hit theaters, and though A Bug’s Life is looked back on in the canon as a minor Pixar effort, everyone in 1998 rushed out to see it, and it again ended up grossing more than Disney’s then recent works like Hercules and Mulan. 1999’s Toy Story 2 was a cultural event, and established Pixar as the one to take animation to the highest heights in the new century. What followed was a then-unprecedented run of Certified Fresh hits and box office smashes, from Monsters, Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Finding Nemo to The Incredibles,&nbsp;WALL-E, and&nbsp;Up.2011’s Cars 2 broke the streak with Pixar’s first Rotten film, and the studio has since spent the past decade oscillating between returning to the sequel well (Monsters University, Finding Dory) and pulling up original property (Coco, Inside Out), closing out with Toy Story 4. For 2020, Onward was pulled from theaters after two due to the pandemic, while Soul went straight to Disney+ in hopes of salvaging a year of chaos.

There’s clearly no time like the present to take a fond look back at some of his Oscar-winning thespian’s brightest critical highlights, and you know what that means: it’s time for Total Recall!1. Sicario (2015)  92%(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr./Lionsgate)Some pretty powerful films have been made about the international drug trade — look no further than&nbsp;Traffic, right next door to this entry, for proof — and at this point, if you’re going to throw your cinematic hat in the ring, you’d better be prepared to add a singular statement to the genre. Director Denis Villeneuve managed to pull it off with 2015’s&nbsp;Sicario, starring Emily Blunt as an FBI agent who teams up with a pair of CIA operatives (Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro) to bring down a Mexican cartel. In terms of plot outline, it’s boilerplate stuff — but in Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan’s hands, and through the stellar efforts of the well-chosen cast, the end results are elevated considerably. “Far from being just another crime story,” wrote the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s Calvin Wilson, “Sicario&nbsp;is cinema at its most ambitious.”2. Traffic (2000)  92%(Photo by USA Films courtesy Everett Collection)One of the more darkly ambitious films to make its way through the studio system over the 20 years, Steven Soderbergh’s&nbsp;Traffic&nbsp;looks at the human cost of the drug trade by following seemingly unconnected stories that slowly converge. In Mexico, a police officer (Benicio Del Toro, who won an Oscar for his work) becomes the unwitting employee of a drug lord; in San Diego, a major dealer (Miguel Ferrer) is targeted by a pair of DEA agents (Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman); and in the Midwest, a crusading judge (Michael Douglas) finds his black-and-white views on drugs challenged when his teenage daughter (Erika Christensen) develops a cocaine addiction. In condensing the six-part BBC series&nbsp;Traffik, Soderbergh had to trim some of the original’s heft, but&nbsp;Traffic&nbsp;was still a four-time Academy Award winner (including Best Director) as well as one of the best-reviewed films of the year, thanks to critics like Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who proclaimed, “The promise of&nbsp;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&nbsp;has been fulfilled.”3. Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017)  90%(Photo by Jonathan Olley/Walt Disney Studios)Decades after Randall from&nbsp;Clerks&nbsp;argued that the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;Empire couldn’t have solidified its rule without the work of countless grunts, wage slaves, and dispassionate bureaucrats who were only trying to make a living, the saga got around to echoing that point explicitly — and doing so with an assist from DJ (Benicio Del Toro), the determinedly morally ambiguous hacker who fills in Finn and Rose on the existence of a galactic arms trade fueling both sides of the war between the First Order and the Resistance. Proving he doesn’t see much of a difference between either ideology, DJ ends up stabbing his new friends in the back for a quick buck, paving the way for an epic set piece while adding another layer to a story once told as a simple battle between good and evil. “Nothing in&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;is allowed to be mundane,” wrote NPR’s Bob Mondello. “Including the places the filmmakers take the story.”4. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)  92%(Photo by Marvel Studios)Over the course of his career, Benicio del Toro has yoinked the spotlight from numerous above-the-title stars in all sorts of ways, from the flashy to the subtle — and although his tenure as the Collector in the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn’t allowed him to (ahem) collect much screentime with appearances in&nbsp;Thor: The Dark World,&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War, and, most prominently,&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy,&nbsp;it’s definitely one of his more memorably outlandish roles. As his name suggests, he’s known for gathering stuff, including a number of priceless and powerful artifacts — including an Infinity Stone, which puts him in the path of the homicidal Thanos on the Mad Titan’s quest to restore order to the universe by wiping out half of all life. His brief (and apparently illusory) appearance in 2018’s&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;might have briefly convinced audiences he was done for, but if it seems unlikely we’ll see the Collector again,&nbsp;Del Toro can at least point to his pivotal role in&nbsp;GotG&nbsp;as a high note. “If you’re old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun,” wrote Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;will be your new favorite movie. If you’re not, it will set a standard for everything you see.”5. The Usual Suspects (1995)  89%(Photo by Gramercy courtesy Everett Collection)The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist, but the greatest one Kevin Spacey might have pulled was scoring the role of Roger “Verbal” Kint, the palsied small-time hood whose post-heist interrogation frames the twisty goings-on of Bryan Singer’s neo-noir ‘90s classic&nbsp;The Usual Suspects. It turned into an Academy Award-winning breakout vehicle for the actor, but he certainly didn’t do it alone:&nbsp;Suspects&nbsp;is a quintessentially ’90s ensemble piece, spinning a number of narrative plates with the aid of an outstanding cast that included Pete Postlethwaite, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollak, and — as the virtually incomprehensible crook Fred Fenster — Benicio Del Toro, who stole every scene he was in even though no one ever had any idea what he was saying. A master class in character actor chemistry,&nbsp;Suspects&nbsp;provided audiences with 106 minutes of water-cooler entertainment in the bargain — and earned some of the best reviews of the year. “For many true movie fiends, noir is the key American movie type, and the most fun when it’s done right,” observed Newsweek’s Jack Kroll. “The Usual Suspects&nbsp;is done right.”6. Fearless (1993)  85%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Cheating death sounds like an incredible gift — but what do you do after you’ve accepted you’re about to die and walked away from the experience? As Peter Weir’s&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;powerfully argues, that second lease on life can sometimes be harder to come to grips with than we might imagine — especially if you’re like protagonist Max Klein (Jeff Bridges), who survives a plane crash that ends up killing almost everyone on board and embarks on a quest that includes reaching out to a fellow passenger (Rosie Perez) who’s coping with survivor’s guilt without assistance from her boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro). The type of thought-provoking adult drama that seems all but extinct in the modern studio system,&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;didn’t make much of a dent at the box office after its 1993 release, but many critics rightly applauded it as a refreshing change of pace. Calling it “the rare commercial movie that raises more questions than it answers,” Newsweek’s David Ansen wrote, “You leave it in an altered state yourself — moved, not quite satisfied, but certain you’ve seen something out of the ordinary.”7. 21 Grams (2003)  80%(Photo by Focus Features courtesy Everett Collection)The second installment in writer-director Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Trilogy of Death,”&nbsp;21 Grams&nbsp;wrings some outstanding performances (not to mention plenty of tears) out of an outstanding cast in service of a gripping — albeit harrowing — tale. Using a handful of seemingly disparate plot threads, Iñárritu plunged viewers into the darkness pooling out of a tragedy unintentionally wrought by an ex-con (Benicio Del Toro) whose irrevocable mistake has a profound impact on a dying math professor (Sean Penn) and a woman with a complicated past (Naomi Watts) — all of whom are drawn irrevocably together by the final act. Watts and Del Toro both earned Oscar nominations for their work, and neither could be accused of holding anything back; as Moira MacDonald wrote for the Seattle Times, “Watching it is a wrenching experience; the usual layers of distance between actors and audience are stripped away, and we not only watch their anguish, but become part of it.”8. Swimming with Sharks (1995)  78%(Photo by Lionsgate)One of two critically acclaimed releases that saw Benicio Del Toro sharing screentime with Kevin Spacey in 1995,&nbsp;Swimming with Sharks&nbsp;revolves around Spacey’s Buddy Ackerman, a bottomlessly selfish studio executive haranguing the naive film-school graduate (Frank Whaley) who unwittingly agrees to enter a waking nightmare when he signs on to become Ackerman’s new assistant. Del Toro, playing Whalley’s predecessor, isn’t seen for long —&nbsp;Sharks&nbsp;is dominated by Spacey’s volcanic performance — but he was already well on his way to “that guy” status, and this is another early example of why. Little-seen during its initial release, writer-director George Huang’s black comedy was a hit with critics like MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher, who deemed it “As fine a ‘revenge on the boss from hell’ movie as the wickedly vindictive&nbsp;9 to 5&nbsp;(and as outrageous a satire on Hollywood as&nbsp;The Player).”9. The Funeral (1996)  79%(Photo by October Films courtesy Everett Collection)With Abel Ferrara behind the camera, an ensemble cast led by Christopher Walken and Chris Penn, and a storyline revolving around occasionally grisly gang violence,&nbsp;The Funeral&nbsp;should rank among the quintessential indie dramas of the ’90s. It’s mostly escaped the spotlight since its release, but even in the context of Ferrara’s typically hard-hitting work, it’s dark stuff — the story of a pair of gangsters who set out to avenge their brother’s (Vincent Gallo) murder by retaliating against the competing mobster (Benicio Del Toro) they suspect of the crime. Naturally, not all is as it seems; the brothers’ quest takes some unexpected turns, and what might have been a simple shoot-’em-up has more on its mind. While audiences didn’t turn out, critics were suitably impressed; as Desson Thomson wrote for the Washington Post, “You’re engaged on a moral level rarely found in movies about violence.”10. The Pledge (2001)  78%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Few who watched Sean Penn’s timeless turn as the affably bewildered stoner Jeff Spicoli in&nbsp;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&nbsp;could have guessed he’d grow up to favor dark dramas — or that when he eventually started directing features of his own, they’d include the sort of harrowing descent into the darkest depths of human nature plumbed by 2001’s&nbsp;The Pledge. The story begins with an alcoholic police detective (Jack Nicholson) whose retirement party is interrupted by the news of a young girl’s murder; pledged to solve the case by the victim’s mother, he doggedly persists in hunting down the killer even after it’s officially closed by the confession — and subsequent suicide — of a local man with a learning disability. Del Toro’s relatively brief (and somewhat controversial) appearance as the suspect is just one of several disquieting things about the film, which was destined for the commercial margins even as it drew applause from critics like Sean Burns of the Philadelphia Weekly, who wrote, “Steeped in an almost unbearable sadness, dense with moral ambiguity, it stubbornly withholds comfort at every startling turn.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Awards, james, vampires, RT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/27181346/Benicio-Del-Toro-Recall.jpg","slug":"benicio-del-toros-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508947486950","title":"Sidney Poitier’s 7 Most Memorable Performances","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sidney Poitier's 7 Most Memorable PerformancesOn his 92nd birthday, we look back at the films of the history-making Hollywood great.by Jacqueline Coley | February 20, 2019 |  Comments(Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images)The great Sidney Poitier turns 92 on February 20, 2019,&nbsp;just shy of 55 years since he became the first Black man to win Best Actor at the Academy Awards.&nbsp;As one of the first African-American film stars, Poitier boasts a career littered with accolades, historical moments, and iconic performances too numerous count. To celebrate the actor’s 92nd year, we at&nbsp;RT thought it the perfect time to single out just a few of our favorite performances from the iconic actor. With 60-plus credits spanning over 60 years, it was a near impossible feat, but here are our&nbsp;seven favorite Sidney Poitier performances.Blackboard Jungle (1955)  76%This was the role that put Poitier on the map. The struggles of educators and students are well documented in this violent and controversial film, based on Evan Hunter’s seminal novel about inner-city school conditions. Modern audiences might struggle to sympathize with the tactics employed by Poitier’s character, Gregory Miller, but the cultural impact his performance had on both society and education are undeniable.The Defiant Ones (1958)  92%Poitier garnered his first Oscar Nomination for his portrayal of Noah Cullen, an escaped black convict shackled to white fellow escapee John “Joker” Jackson, played by Tony Curtis. Motivated to survive and escape, the foes are forced to work together and eventually come to respect one another. The conflict and eventual cooperation between the two men plays out against the backdrop of Jim Crow, underscoring the institutions of oppression that existed at the time that would have prevented their friendship from developing. The final scene of Noah defiantly singing to Joker remains a near perfect ending to the prison break caper.A Raisin in the Sun (1961)  94%In the film adaptation of the eponymous stage play, Poitier plays Walter, the patriarch of the Youngers, a young black family living in 1950s Southside Chicago, trying to better themselves through family and a commitment to give their children a better life. Acting as a cinematic counterpoint to the idealized American dream, the Youngers struggle to combat institutions and individuals dead set on never allowing them to rise above. Walter is met with hostility and apprehension from those outside and within his community as he strives to achieve, but through it all, he and his family persevere.Lilies of the Field (1963)  91%In this Oscar-winning role, Poitier plays Homer Smith, a traveling handyman who stumbles upon a group of German nuns. The nuns believe Homer was sent by God to help them build a chapel, and by the final frames, the audience is all but convinced of the same. Even Queen Oprah Winfrey&nbsp;found herself&nbsp;without words&nbsp;during her Golden Globe acceptance speech as she tried to explain what it was like watching Poitier win that Oscar.&nbsp;Instead, she opted to quote his line from the film and simply said, “Amen, amen, amen, amen.” To which, I say no one could have put it better.Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)  70%If the first role you most closely associate with Poitier is not In the Heat of the Night, the likely winner is Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. Playing a black man meeting his white fiancée’s liberal and affluent parents, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner&nbsp;was one of the first positive portrayals of interracial marriage to hit the big screen. Acting alongside Hollywood legends Spencer Tracey nd Kathleen Hepburn, Poitier made his mark on a verifiable American cinematic masterpiece. The influences and themes of Guess Who Coming to Dinner&nbsp;can be seen in several modern-day adaptations — Jordan Peele brilliantly subverted those themes for social commentary and comedic effect in Get Out.In the Heat of the Night (1967)  95%“They call me Mister Tibbs!”&nbsp;Poitier&nbsp;spoke those words in&nbsp;In the Heat of the Night, and both the&nbsp;film and the line have become synonymous with the actor’s career. Sitting at number 16 on the American Film Institute’s “100 Years… 100 Movie Quotes” list, the rebuke to racist Mississippi Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger)&nbsp;is a thing of beauty. Playing Virgil Tibbs, a Pittsburgh detective charged with solving a homicide in the Deep South, Poitier navigates prejudice and incompetence to gain the respect of his would-be adversary. And with his help, the police attempt to solve the&nbsp;suspenseful, complicated whodunit.Sneakers (1992)  79%(Photo by Universal Pictures)In a refreshing change of pace later in his career, Poitier starred in this ensemble suspense comedy. Robert Redford,&nbsp;Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn, River Phoenix, and Poitier all play former spies working as security consultants. The&nbsp;crew inadvertently get caught up in a web of deception involving a former associate (Ben Kingsley) when they’re tasked with the high stakes retrieval of a very powerful piece of government equipment. Playing Donald Crease as an&nbsp;aging, more-than-over-it former CIA agent and the team’s voice of reason, Poitier showed us that he can be, in fact, quite hilarious.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"America, shows, asian-american, Election","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09155023/Sidney-Poitier-Memorable.jpg","slug":"sidney-poitiers-7-most-memorable-performances"},{"id":"47508946381026","title":"Why Punisher: War Zone Deserves Cult Status","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Why Punisher: War Zone Deserves Cult StatusSub-Cult is Nathan Rabin’s ongoing exploration of movies that have quietly attracted devoted followings and are on the verge of becoming full-on cult sensations.by Nathan Rabin | October 13, 2015 |  CommentsAs its title suggests, Paul Scheer, Jason Mantzoukas and June Diane Raphael’s wildly popular bad movie podcast How Did This Get Made? exists to provide a comedic post-mortem and dissection of flops so terrible, their very existence defies comprehension. It is a podcast about bad movies that, at its best, enthusiastically celebrates the dregs of cinema as much it humorously condemns them.But every once in a while the podcast turns into something much different. That was the case in October of 2011, when national treasure Patton Oswalt and Punisher: War Zone director Lexi Alexander came on the podcast not to derive schadenfreude over a terrible movie’s failure but rather to herald the oft-overlooked virtues of the third attempt to bring Marvel’s bloodthirsty vigilante to the big screen.Alexander told riveting behind-the-scenes stories of how the filmmaker behind the well-respected English soccer drama Green Street Hooligans became the latest caretaker of one of Marvel’s trickiest anti-heroes, providing&nbsp;fascinating insight into the complicated and fraught manner by which filmmakers balance their personal visions with the commercial demands of making a contemporary superhero movie. Oswalt was on the podcast in his capacity as a widely beloved stand-up comedian and podcast fixture, but more than that, he was there in his unofficial but essential role as a pop culture evangelist, a man of deep and deeply informed passions who has devoted much of his life and career to convincing other people to love the art and trash and entertainment that sings to him as much as it does.&nbsp;Oswalt was able to re-contextualize what had been roundly dismissed as another grim mistake as a movie that came closer than the two previous Punisher movies in bringing the Punisher of the comic books to the big screen with his brutal, uncompromising intensity intact.“Ray Stevenson doesn’t just cut an unmistakably bleak and tortured figure; on a physical level, he looks deeply unwell.”As Oswalt articulated on the podcast, Frank Castle/The Punisher, as played by Ray Stevenson, doesn’t just cut an unmistakably bleak and tortured figure; on a physical level, he looks deeply unwell, like the soul-sickness afflicting his spirit seeped into his body as well and contaminated him on a biological level. But it isn’t just Frank Castle’s body that is rotting and unclean. The city he protects has also clearly seen better days, and has devolved into a grim, nightmare dystopia of rust, filth and grime. It’s as if the sun went away the moment Castle’s wife and children were brutally murdered by hoods and never came back, and the haunted expression on Stevenson’s face and his thousand-yard stare convey that grief artfully and effectively.For Castle, action is character, and the Punisher is nothing if not a man of action.&nbsp;Punisher: War Zone doesn’t waste a lot of time on exposition — no mean feat for a movie tasked with re-introducing an iconic comic book character a lot of the audience will not be familiar with — and what little exposition War Zone does possess feels wholly unnecessary.&nbsp;Stevenson does not talk much; he prefers to let his impressive, oft-employed arsenal communicate&nbsp;for him, and its primary message seems to be that there are far too many bad people still alive in this sick, sad world, and that Castle will do everything in his power to change that.&nbsp;In the film’s impressive first set-piece, he furtively infiltrates a massive mob gathering and, lit only by a flare that gives him a demonic, unholy glow, proceeds to slaughter an entire mob family in a gorgeously choreographed symphony of bloodshed. It’s gun-fu at its finest, and highlights Lexi Alexander’s gift for staging action sequences that are visceral and exciting but also clean and comprehensible.As an icon, the Punisher is defined by his eagerness to go too far, to routinely transgress the perpetually blurry boundaries separating good and evil for the sake of both vengeance and justice. So in order for a film adaptation to be true to the character, it similarly needs to make a virtue of going too far. For Punisher: War Zone, that means allowing the Punisher to rack up a body count that approaches the population of a small island nation and to amass that body count in the bloodiest, most graphic manner imaginable. Frank Castle is an artist who paints in gushing spurts of blood and exploding skulls, a mad scientist — complete with a shadowy, nightmarish lair — whose science, as it were, is mass bloodshed.As a result,&nbsp;this&nbsp;is a Marvel movie unlike any other, if only because it isn’t just a distinctly unfamily-friendly R — it’s a hard R, the kind that could easily veer into NC-17 territory with a few more exploding skulls or a little more messy viscera flying in every direction.&nbsp;That R rating goes a long way towards explaining why Punisher: War Zone is, if not the single least commercially successful Marvel film of all time, then at least one of them.“For Castle, action is character, and the Punisher is nothing if not a man of action.”Much of the appeal of the Marvel universe lies in the inter-connected nature of everything, in the sense that Spider-Man, Iron Man, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy for that matter, all share the same universe and could stop by and visit each other if the fancy struck them. That’s true of comic books as well. Hell, the Punisher debuted in an issue of Spider-Man and shares some super-villains with Daredevil (whose Netflix show he is currently a character on) and your friendly neighborhood webslinger.But it’s difficult, if not impossible, to imagine the Punisher of Punisher: War Zone sharing a screen with Thor or the Incredible Hulk or Iron Man. If Hulk were to pop up for a cameo in Punisher: War Zone the way Falcon pops up briefly in Ant-Man,&nbsp;it would be so jarring and surreal that it would completely destroy the brutal realities of the film, a reality rooted in grief and misery but also one that could not, and will not, support appearances from radioactive spider-people or gamma ray-damaged green rage monsters.&nbsp;Castle lives his entire life in the agonizing, endlessly painful shadow of the brutal massacre of the people he loved most in the world, so it would seem pretty damn bizarre if he were to, say, take a break from his endless mourning to joke around with Captain America.Still, Punisher: War Zone benefits from a deep vein of gallows humor that complements the almost cartoonishly over-the-top violence rather than undercuts it. In the film’s most inspired running gag, an insufferable group of parkour enthusiast bad guys leap and sashay their way around a grim urban hellscape, hooting and hollering with glee at their robust athleticism. It’s a loving parody of action movies’ weird momentary fixation on parkour (a fixation that has led to actual parkour-based action movies) exaggerated to comic extremes that has an awesome payoff when the freerunning&nbsp;showoffs are leaping about and Castle kills one&nbsp;with bullets, one with&nbsp;a&nbsp;rocket, and the last one by hurling him off a building and onto a spike. It’s a funny gag, but it’s also a statement of purpose: other action movies can waste their time with trendy nonsense that already looked silly and dated by the time Punisher: War Zone hit theaters in 2008; Alexander’s film understands the power and deadly force of a scowling, stationary man with an arsenal and deadly aim.Since Castle doesn’t do much talking, Dominic West is free to ham it up as Jigsaw in a performance that owes a great deal to Jack Nicholson’s Joker in Batman and is never more compelling than when Jigsaw is buddying around with Loony Bin Jim, the brother he springs from the mental hospital to assist him in his crime spree. And as Loony Bin Jim, a lunatic with an intense interest in human anatomy more homicidal than medical, veteran character actor Doug Hutchinson is incredibly creepy and disturbing, albeit not as creepy or disturbing as in the other role Hutchinson is known for: the “veteran character actor in desperate erotic thrall to nightmare teenage exhibitionist Courteney Stodden” in the tacky, vulgar reality show known as real life, and alternatively, in Couples Therapy.“Dominic West is free to ham it up as Jigsaw in a performance that owes a great deal to Jack Nicholson’s Joker in Batman.”Loony Bin Jim and Jigsaw clearly love each other. In a sweet — if wholly deranged — display of affection, “LBJ”&nbsp;tries to make Jigsaw feel better about the horrifying prospect of being reminded of his grotesque disfigurement every time he looks at his reflection by flamboyantly smashing every mirror he encounters. That familial bond of brotherly love is an endearing quality, even in sociopaths.Thanks in no small part to Hutchinson’s scummily compelling turn, Punisher: War Zone is so unrelentingly nasty, dour&nbsp;and disturbing in its grim take on society and human nature that audiences might want to take a shower after it’s over. Then again, that’s true of any ten-minute stretch of Couples Therapy as well.When projects are rejected by the public the way Punisher: War Zone was, there is an understandable tendency to romanticize and mourn the film fans wanted it to be. While I think Punisher: War Zone is an entertaining, unique and bleakly funny take on well-worn superhero fare, I think there is an element of that at play here as well. Punisher: War Zone is no overlooked masterpiece, but it is a nifty little sleeper that’s better than its reputation suggests.The Marvel cinematic universe is vast, and it seems to grow larger by the day. But the appeal of Punisher: War Zone lies in how small and bleak&nbsp;and claustrophobic it is, too small and bleak&nbsp;and claustrophobic to support guest appearances from other, sunnier heroes. Unfortunately, other things were small when it came to Punisher: War Zone as well, like its budget and a box-office gross that was record-setting for all the wrong reasons. When it comes to racking up a body count, however, Punisher: War Zone wasn’t just huge: it was epic.My Original Certification: RottenMy Re-Certification: FreshTomatometer:&nbsp;27 percentUp next: Trick ‘r’ Treat","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"Arts, anthology, cinematic, History, ID, comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PunisherWarZone.jpg","slug":"why-punisher-war-zone-deserves-cult-status"},{"id":"47508946376928","title":"Does 1967’s Casino Royale Deserve Cult Status?","content":"Sub-Cultvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Does 1967's Casino Royale Deserve Cult Status?Sub-Cult is Nathan Rabin’s ongoing exploration of movies that have quietly attracted devoted followings and are on the verge of becoming full-on cult sensations.by Nathan Rabin | November 4, 2015 |  CommentsLike similarly Texas-sized opuses It’s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Cleopatra,&nbsp;and 1941, the 1967 James Bond spy spoof Casino Royale is notable primarily for its magnitude. It’s distinguished by its Spruce Goose-like size as well as its Spruce Goose-level sleekness and effectiveness. It was less a film than a universe unto itself. Nearly a half century later, it’s still remarkable that enough money and willpower existed in the world to get such a gaudy, endless parade of star power, production values, and dizzying, dazzling eye candy onscreen in one ridiculously overstuffed extravaganza. This is true even if Casino Royale often feels like a one-joke movie whose single gag is, “Isn’t it crazy how much money we’re wasting?”But Casino Royale also took up a lot of cultural space because it was, and remains, inextricably linked to the James Bond franchise, an institution that has ferociously held on to its central place in the pop culture landscape longer than just about any ongoing franchise. It was the first big cinematic adaptation of the Bond series released without the participation of producer Albert R. Broccoli, although it was less a straight adaptation than a spoof that used the bare bones of Ian Fleming’s story as the springboard for a terminally dated goof.The 2006 Daniel Craig version of Casino Royale, which&nbsp;reinvented and reimagined the series, stood out in part because it swung as hard in the direction of grim, grounded seriousness as its quasi-predecessor did in the loopy realm of anything-goes screwball comedy. It&nbsp;benefited from a clear-cut authorial vision, one much bolder and more distinctive than had ever been associated with director Martin Campbell before. But the 1967 Casino Royale feels like it was assembled by an international team of highly paid, highly confused professionals who had no idea what anybody else was doing and precious little interest in how their jagged, weird little contributions would serve a whole that seemed to be steadily slipping away from the filmmakers even before production began.“Casino Royale feels like it was assembled by an international team of highly paid, highly confused professionals.”Casino Royale&nbsp;feels like an anthology film comprised of four or five discrete segments from different filmmakers with different aesthetics that were frantically refashioned into a narrative film at the last minute. That’s not too far from the truth, as the film has a starting basketball team’s worth of credited directors and an army of uncredited script doctors. It’s as if the producers decided the way to create the greatest, most decadent feast in cinematic history would be to invite the greatest chefs in the world all to collaborate on one massive meal, conveniently forgetting the old cliche about too many cooks spoiling the broth.But on to the film itself. In one of Casino Royale’s many intriguing-in-theory, hopelessly muddled-in-execution conceits, its primary&nbsp;James Bond is actually a very proper English gentleman (a Sir, even, in his majesty’s secret service) played by David Niven, who has retired from active duty following a career of extraordinary achievement to enjoy a peaceful existence ruled by classical music, gardening and extreme propriety.Sir James Bond reluctantly agreed to let the Queen use his name and number (and license to kill, it would follow) for the sex fiend immortalized by Ian Fleming in his novels and the Broccoli-produced films, and is none too happy about being associated with someone of such low moral character.In this case, casting is destiny; Sir James Bond is essentially the persona Niven perfected over the course of his career: droll, wry, the very picture of bone-dry British wit. He stutters and stammers but he’s a wiz in a pinch, as evidenced by the fact that an international coterie of bigwigs, including characters played by William Holden, John Huston and Charles Boyer, seek him out when the sinister entity known as SMERSH is liquidating top secret agents from around the world.Niven’s Bond is initially reluctant, but he ultimately&nbsp;ends up spearheading MI6’s campaign against SMERSH. To confuse the enemy, Bond seizes upon the novel notion of renaming all of the agency’s operatives in the field “James Bond” and assigning them all the code number “007,” even the women.&nbsp;For the purposes of Casino Royale, David Niven is James Bond, and Peter Sellers is James Bond as well, and even Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet), Bond’s daughter with legendary female spy and seductress Mata Hari, enters the family profession as another James Bond in an endless sequence rich in exotic, lush sensuality yet almost utterly devoid of jokes.Sellers plays world-famous baccarat expert Evelyn Tremble, who is recruited to square off against Le Chiffre, a sinister heavy (no pun intended) played by Orson Welles, in a high stakes battle of wills at the card table. In a somewhat curious strategy, the famously prickly and unpleasant Sellers decided that the way for him to stand out opposite the high-powered likes of Welles and Woody Allen (who previously tangled with Sellers on the set of What’s New Pussycat&nbsp;and engendered his eternal contempt and hatred by being funnier than him) would be to eschew comedy altogether and deliver a straight-faced performance, where he’d show Niven a thing or two about what it meant to play a dashing continental gentleman of action. So a popular favorite for funniest man alive decided to buck expectations and play it completely straight&nbsp;in one of the biggest comedies of all time.&nbsp;It was a bold, if perverse, choice, but Sellers compounded the curiousness of his involvement with the film by bolting before his scenes were finished, leaving the filmmakers to scramble and figure out a way to coherently end their film without the participation of a man who, with the possible exception of Niven, could rightly be said to be its star.“Sellers seems to make a deliberate choice not to be funny.”Sellers at least seems to make a deliberate choice not to be funny; the rest of the cast arrives in the same place by accident, and often through furious and furiously wasted exertion. For a film committed to excess in all its forms, Casino Royale is peculiarly short on actual gags. Because the James Bond movies delight in winking at audiences as they lovingly recycle the franchise’s tropes, a parody of James Bond almost by definition would come across as a parody of a parody, a spoof of a spoof, a goof of a slightly different, slightly more straight-faced kind of goof. Accordingly, Casino Royale feels like a Mad Magazine parody of itself. It’s not an encouraging sign that the film’s idea of a risque Bond girl name (“Giovanna Goodthighs,” played by a young, pre-stardom Jaqueline Bisset) is less outrageous than actual Bond girl names like Pussy Galore.For all of the smart and talented people who worked on Casino Royale, there is no animating intelligence uniting its disparate strains. It’s a Frankenstein’s monster whose stitches fall apart, leaving behind only a surreal tangle of severed limbs on the ground.&nbsp;The actors and filmmakers all seem to have their own conception of who James Bond is and how he functions in the world, and these conceptions clash violently with each other when they engage with the others at all. And the behind-the-scenes craziness bleeds onto the screen constantly. Characters are introduced then abandoned for endless stretches of time, only to come back just as nonsensically. Sellers’ Tremble simply disappears late in the film, at which point Woody Allen (who is entertaining because he’s a young Woody Allen, albeit not as entertaining as he’d be in just about any other context around this time) takes over as a manic evil genius with a diabolical plan to kill all men taller than him so he can turn the world into his harem.All of this barely controlled chaos&nbsp;climaxes with an endless fight involving the main characters, and Native Americans, and cowboys, and just about everyone else in the world (including George Raft for some reason), which suggests that the filmmakers ultimately gave up on providing any kind of coherent, satisfying ending at all, and simply gave themselves over to the random insanity of the movie. The ending plays out as if the best single stage direction the film’s world-class brain trust could come up with was: “Craziness ensues.”“The behind-the-scenes craziness bleeds onto the screen constantly.”Casino Royale is rich in all of the qualities that do not make comedies funny. It has enough sexy women to stock Playboy clubs in the major cities of the world and substantially more stars than there are in the heavens. It has enormous sets that would look better lovingly photographed and collected into a coffee table book on a surrealistic 1960s go-go set design than relegated to the background of a comedy whose laugh-per-dollar-spent ratio rivals 1941 for sheer waste in pursuit of non-comedy. I would rather admire that coffee table book while listening to Burt Bacharach’s score than have to endure this clattering contraption’s screaming psychedelic sound and frenetic motion.Casino Royale&nbsp;is a lush opus full of&nbsp;Oscar-worthy production values, particularly a costume department whose gorgeous get-ups for exotic lovelies dazzle the eye even as they leave the funny bone untouched. It’s paradoxically way, way too much in every sense, and not much of anything at all. It’s a whole lot of movie, and one big cinematic headache.There is a tendency in our culture to honor things disproportionately just for hanging around. In a world full of fleeting and ephemeral phenomena, we honor resilience. Familiarity may breed contempt, but it sometimes breeds affection as well.In that respect, Casino Royale is like a crappy version of Shel Silverstein’s The Giving Tree that has always been there for me at various points in my life to let me down. When I was a kid obsessed with James Bond, Woody Allen, Orson Welles, crazy comedies and sexy girls in revealing outfits, I was disappointed to discover that Casino Royale somehow managed to combine these irresistible elements in an eminently resistible package. As a teenaged cinephile I was intrigued to see how the fascinating sensibilities of Welles, Allen, Sellers, Huston and behind-the-scenes (and uncredited) contributors Ben Hecht, Billy Wilder, Joseph Heller and Terry Southern came together, and I was frustrated to see that when these incredibly distinctive entertainers collaborated, they did so in a way that negated both their personalities and their brilliance.Finally, I re-watched Casino Royale for this piece through the prism of both the mania for Spectre and my own childhood and adolescent nostalgia for this big, dumb, Day-Glo burst of uber-kitsch; I was disappointed&nbsp;yet again. This elephantine curio stubbornly refuses to transcend the muddled, mercenary nature of its creation and evolve from an ugly and confused duckling (albeit one with great clothes) into a beautiful cult swan.My Original Certification:&nbsp;RottenMy Re-Certification:&nbsp;RottenTomatometer:&nbsp;29 percentFollow Nathan Rabin on Twitter: @NathanRabin","section":"Sub-Cult","tags":"Showtime, female, dark, vampires, kong, festival, Arrangement, hispanic, bond, Awards, show, Arts, LGBTQ, Witch","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/04185107/CasinoRoyale.jpg","slug":"does-1967s-casino-royale-deserve-cult-status"},{"id":"47508949011707","title":"Rank Helen Mirren’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Helen Mirren's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the best-reviewed films of the Winchester star.by Jeff Giles | January 31, 2018 |  CommentsShe’s one of the most highly respected stars of the stage, television, and film, with an Oscar, four Emmys, and membership in the Order of the British Empire to her credit — but Helen Mirren’s eclectic filmography has always had room for more than serious arthouse fare. She’s also appeared in plenty of popcorn flicks, including National Treasure 2, Inkheart, and RED, which found her toting a machine gun and blowing away bad guys alongside Bruce Willis.

In anticipation of that mother of all awards ceremonies, let’s take an appreciative look back at some of the greatest films in Hollywood history that didn’t receive a single Oscar nomination — a list that, as you’ll see, includes more than a few timeless classics. No envelope, please… it’s time for Total Recall!The Big Lebowski (1998)  83%In a filmography studded with cult classics, the Coen brothers’ The Big Lebowski might be the cultiest — which is to say that when it arrived in theaters, it landed with nowhere near the impact you might suspect today. In spite of a top-notch cast that included Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as well as an eminently quotable screenplay whose storyline amiably loped between (often equally surreal) moments of comedy and drama, Lebowski&nbsp;eked out less than $20 million during its theatrical run, and although critics were generally kind, they weren’t exactly falling all over themselves to proclaim its everlasting virtues. The Coens had the last laugh in the long run, however — Oscars are nice, but how many movies have inspired their own religion?Watch it here: Amazon, FandangoNOW, Google Play, iTunesBreathless (1961)  97%When Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless arrived in 1960, there was no way for critics to know they were witnessing one of the most influential works in all of cinema — as well as the arrival of one of the medium’s greatest auteurs. But everyone who saw it — including more than two million French filmgoers — knew they were watching something bold and new, and among cineastes, it was recognized as part of the emerging French New Wave. How it came up empty with the Academy is up for debate, but there’s no arguing its lasting impact; among directors as well as critics, Breathless is regularly cited on lists of the all-time greatest films.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesBringing Up Baby (1938)  93%The Oscars are traditionally fairly dismissive of comedies, and the list of classic laughers that deserved a nod from the Academy is long — but Bringing Up Baby, starring Cary Grant as an uptight zoologist and Katharine Hepburn as the ditz who turns his life upside down, belongs at or near the top. Critics were generally enthusiastic about Grant and Hepburn’s second big-screen pairing, but the audience’s response was decidedly mixed; despite strong receipts in a handful of locations, Baby&nbsp;landed with a thud in many parts of the country, and was only ultimately saved from the cultural dustbin thanks to a second life granted by television screenings more than a decade after it slunk out of theaters.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesHeat (1995)  87%One of a handful of thrillers to make such stylishly effective use of its Los Angeles locations that the city is virtually a character unto itself, Michael Mann’s Heat&nbsp;might be hands down the sleekest cops-and-robbers suspense flick of the ’90s — which is really saying something, considering Mann had to weave a tangled web of plotlines involving a crowded, marquee-topping ensemble that included Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Alas, not even the combined might of two of Hollywood’s greatest thespians could earn this classic heist picture any attention from the Academy. Mann’s next release, 1999’s The Insider, made up for lost opportunities with an impressive seven nominations — none of which, sadly, it won.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesKing Kong (1933)  98%A creature feature so massive that its very title can be used as a colloquialism for “big and powerful,” King Kong&nbsp;has been remade more than once over the years — and is being revisited again this year in Kong: Skull Island — yet the original remains one of the few classic black-and-white movies that many modern filmgoers have seen. A critical and commercial success, Kong set a thrilling new benchmark for special effects; unfortunately, the Oscars didn’t have a category for that type of achievement yet, but what it lacks in awards-season hardware, it’s clearly more than made up in lasting cultural impact.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesM (1931)  100%The way we talk about director Fritz Lang today, you’d think he was swimming in awards during his lifetime, but in reality, he racked up an astonishing zero Oscar nominations — and that includes shameful goose eggs for his twin towers of cinematic achievement, Metropolis&nbsp;and M. The latter, Lang’s first talkie, uses sound in a number of inventive ways, including his enormously influential decision to make Grieg’s “In the Hall of the Mountain King” the recurring theme music for Peter Lorre’s villainous Hans Beckert. It’s gone on to be reissued numerous times, continuing all the while to enjoy near-universal critical acclaim; in fact, it’s one of a small handful of classic films to boast a 100 percent Tomatometer rating. An unfortunate oversight on the Academy’s part, but given that Lang’s name has become synonymous with groundbreaking genius among cinema buffs, it’s safe to say all’s well that ends well.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesMean Streets (1973)  95%Martin Scorsese’s long streak of Oscar futility really got going with 1973’s Mean Streets, which found the young director determined to make a personal film after the frustration of working for hire on Roger Corman’s Boxcar Bertha. Emboldened by disappointment and professional desperation, Scorsese drew on his roots in New York City’s Little Italy neighborhood to tell the story of an ambitious but conflicted young gangster (Harvey Keitel) and his fraught relationships with a young woman (Amy Robinson) and her brother (Robert De Niro), a small-time gambler with a volatile streak. Although Mean Streets&nbsp;whiffed at the Academy Awards, it started Scorsese on his way to elite filmmaker status — even if he did end up having to wait until 2007, and through five nominations, to win his first Best Director Oscar.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesOnce Upon a Time in the West (1968)  95%A mammoth revisionist Western before revisionist Westerns were cool, Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in the West&nbsp;synthesized tropes from the already well-trod genre and fired them back at an audience not yet accustomed to seeing its frontier mythology deconstructed — and represented an artistic leap forward for Leone, who used a much slower pace and more realistic tone to tell the tale of an unsavory hired gun (Henry Fonda) whose campaign of terror against a railroad town is complicated by a lone vigilante (Charles Bronson) with a mysterious vendetta. Better late than never, West has steadily built a devoted following since its release, and influenced generations of America’s most popular filmmakers.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesThe Shining (1980)  84%Like comedy, horror hasn’t always found the warmest reception at the Academy, and a horror movie adapted from a bestseller by Stephen King — who hasn’t always been a critics’ darling himself — probably never stood a prayer of receiving Oscars recognition. On the other hand, the big-screen version of King’s The Shining&nbsp;boasted a stellar pedigree, both onscreen and behind the cameras; with Jack Nicholson starring opposite Shelley Duvall and Stanley Kubrick directing, this terrifying descent into snowbound madness could easily have earned a nomination or three. Alas, it came up empty, forever depriving Nicholson the opportunity to stroll up to the podium and shout, “Heeeeeeeeeeeeere’s Oscar!”Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunesThree Kings (1999)  94%David O. Russell’s movies have piled up a number of Oscar nominations and wins over the years, and it’d be hard to argue he’s been unfairly ignored by the Academy. Still, looking back, it’s a little surprising to note that Russell’s Three Kings didn’t pick up a single nomination. A critical and commercial hit, this pitch-black satire of modern warfare and global American politics is the rare message movie that works as pure entertainment — and it found Russell employing a few nifty visual tricks, too. Any or all of the above might have been good for awards consideration; alas, Russell would have to content himself with the awards-season attention he’d generate in later years with movies like The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle.Watch it here:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes","section":"Total Recall","tags":"LGBTQ, marvel, supernatural, adaptation, LGBT, Vudu, books, lord, Podcast, Signature","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24182410/Oscar-Snubs-Lebowski.jpg","slug":"10-movie-classics-the-oscars-ignored"},{"id":"47508947691764","title":"Rank Emily Blunt’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Emily Blunt's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the most acclaimed work of the A Quiet Place star.by Jeff Giles | April 5, 2018 |  CommentsShe’s only been making movies for a little over a decade, but&nbsp;Emily Blunt&nbsp;has already managed to put together an impressive string of critical and commercial hits — and she looks to add to that list with this weekend’s&nbsp;A Quiet Place.

With that in mind, here are all of the 2018 Best Picture nominees ranked by Tomatometer!1. Get Out (2017)  98%(Photo by Universal Pictures)Horror and comedy have made for fine bedfellows on occasion over the years — and the horror genre has also made plenty of room for hard-hitting social commentary, too. But it takes a certain amount of chutzpah for a filmmaker to try blending all three at once, and first-time filmmaker Jordan Peele was definitely taking a big gamble when he brought his ambitious hybrid&nbsp;Get Out&nbsp;to theaters in early 2017. The story of an unsuspecting young African-American man (Daniel Kaluuya) whose trip to the countryside to meet his white girlfriend’s (Allison Williams) well-to-do parents (Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford) quickly veers into a darkly funny, racially tinged horror show, it arrived at the perfect moment for a wildly entertaining movie that also happened to pack a thought-provoking punch as a look at modern race relations in America — and critics were among the first, and loudest, to praise the year’s first runaway hit. “Peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail,” wrote Stephanie Zacharek for Time. “He’s made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that you’re laughing even as you’re thinking, and vice-versa.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;iTunes,&nbsp;Google Play2. Lady Bird (2017)  99%(Photo by A24)There’s no shortage of coming-of-age movies. But it’s far too uncommon to see one that empathetically depicts the turning corners of adolescence from a female perspective — which is just one reason Lady Bird&nbsp;proved such a critic’s darling in 2017. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, this Saoirse Ronan-led dramedy finds its young title character at a crossroads — and at odds with her mother (Laurie Metcalf), a nurse struggling to keep the family afloat after Lady Bird’s father (Tracy Letts) loses his job. A ’90s-set period piece that struck a current chord for a variety of reasons, it established Gerwig as a triple threat to watch while proving one of cinema’s most well-trodden genres still had fresh stories to tell. Calling it “A sweet, deeply personal portrayal of female adolescence that’s more attuned to the bonds between best girlfriends than casual flings with boys,” Time Out’s Tomris Laffly wrote, &nbsp;“writer-director Greta Gerwig’s beautiful Lady Bird&nbsp;flutters with the attractively loose rhythms of youth.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters3. Call Me by Your Name (2018)  94%(Photo by Sony Pictures Classics)A sun-dappled story of first love as noteworthy for its sumptuous cinematography as for the stellar performances of its well-matched leading men, Call Me by Your Name&nbsp;makes excellent use of familiar ingredients — a young man coming of age, the Italian countryside — to deliver a uniquely transporting romance. Adapted from the André Aciman novel by acclaimed filmmaker James Ivory and directed by Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love), it’s a movie with obvious arthouse appeal, but one whose widespread acclaim got mainstream audiences’ attention — due in no small part to the almost universally positive critical notices earned by Armie Hammer and breakout star Timothée Chalamet in the leading roles. “Call Me By Your Name sneaks up on you,” wrote April Wolfe for the Village Voice. “By the end, it stings with the lingering ache of a late-summer sunburn.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters4. Dunkirk (2017)  92%(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures)The rare director whose lofty cinematic ambitions haven’t kept him from raking in blockbuster grosses, Christopher Nolan has repeatedly proven that challenging cinematic fare can have massive mainstream appeal — and he did it all over again with Dunkirk&nbsp;in 2017, delivering a World War II rescue thriller as noteworthy for its visceral impact as its unorthodox storytelling style. As he’s often done in the past, Nolan uses a non-standard timeline to tell his story, plunging into the real-life evacuation of Allied soldiers from northern France while forcing audiences to think about when the events unfolding onscreen are actually happening. In a genre that’s long since been defined by its straightforward approach, Dunkirk&nbsp;proved rousing and thought-provoking in equal measure; as Alison Willmore wrote for BuzzFeed, “It isn’t a standard war movie, but it sure is some beautiful, difficult thing.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;FandangoNOW,&nbsp;Google Play,&nbsp;iTunes5. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)  90%(Photo by Merrick Morton/Fox Searchlight Pictures)Great cinema provokes discussion, and any discussion that goes on long enough is bound to inspire debate. Witness the conversation surrounding Martin McDonagh’s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, a blackly comic drama about a grieving mother (Frances McDormand) determined to obtain some measure of justice after the horrific rape and murder of her teenage daughter. It’s a story loaded with opportunities for McDonagh’s game cast, all of whom — including Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell as members of the local police force who find themselves in the line of McDormand’s ire — have earned outstanding notices from critics. More problematic elements of the narrative have sparked a Billboards&nbsp;backlash, but whatever its flaws might be, this is far from disposable mainstream filmmaking; as Calvin Wilson wrote for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&nbsp;is entertaining in a way that’s practically unheard of these days.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters6. The Shape of Water (2017)  92%(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)Guillermo del Toro is a man of ideas — so many, in fact, that some of his most intriguing projects have ended up languishing in development hell, while a number of his more mainstream-friendly efforts have failed to truly capture the range and depth of his talents. But even when he isn’t fully on his game, there’s no other filmmaker quite like him — and with The Shape of Water, del Toro is well and truly on his game. A period drama about a lonely lab worker (Sally Hawkins) who finds herself drawn to the amphibian creature (Doug Jones) her superiors have captured, Water&nbsp;takes advantage of del Toro’s greatest gifts: on a visual level, it’s the type of creature feature that highlights his unique eye for alluringly off-kilter detail; on a narrative level, it’s an absorbing, poignant love story about two misunderstood beings discovering common ground. “You never know where The Shape of Water is going,” wrote Moira Macdonald for the Seattle Times. “But, like water, you let it engulf you and sweep you away.”Where to watch it: In Theaters7. Phantom Thread (2018)  91%(Photo by Laurie Sparham/Focus Features)There are surprises in every round of Oscar nominee announcements…and Phantom Thread&nbsp;making the cut among this year’s Best Picture hopefuls isn’t one of them. With Paul Thomas Anderson at the helm and his There Will Be Blood star Daniel Day-Lewis leading the cast — with what’s being billed as his final role, no less — Thread became one of the year’s more obvious awards contenders the moment it was announced. Critics say this period drama about the complex relationship between a womanizing dressmaker and his muse lives up to those daunting expectations, too, thanks to some typically deft writing and direction from Anderson and a suitably strong valedictory performance from Day-Lewis, who’s well-matched with co-star Vicky Krieps. It may not be the odds-on favorite to win this category, but it certainly earned its spot at the table. As Dana Stevens observed for Slate, “This devilishly funny and luxuriantly sensuous film is so successful as entertainment that it’s hard to stop and notice the extreme degree of craft that went into its construction.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters8. The Post (2018)  88%(Photo by Niko Tavernise/20th Century Fox Film Corp.)A uniquely well-timed period drama based on real-life events with obvious parallels to the present, Steven Spielberg’s The Post&nbsp;was pegged as an awards favorite from the moment it was announced. With Spielberg at the helm, a top-notch ensemble cast led by Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, and a politically charged story keyed to these tumultuous times, it looked like the easy pick for the prestige picture of the year — and even if the acclaim it ultimately generated wasn’t quite unanimous, it still pretty much lived up to the hype. There may have been bolder and more unique movies made in 2017, but The Post offers a reminder of the unique pleasures of watching a team of talented old pros in action — not to mention some sobering reminders of the importance of a free press. “The Post&nbsp;may be all-too-easy Oscar bait,” admitted the New York Post’s Sara Stewart, “but it’s as satisfying and polished as you’d expect.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters9. Darkest Hour (2017)  84%(Photo by Jack English/Focus Features)World War II remains one of the most pivotal conflicts in recorded human history, so it’s only natural that Hollywood’s produced so many movies about or inspired by it. On the other hand, that rich cinematic history makes it all but impossible for a new addition to stand out — unless, that is, it’s built from the very best ingredients. For example, here’s Darkest Hour, which finds director Joe Wright working from an Anthony McCarten script to dramatize Winston Churchill’s crucial early days as British Prime Minister — a gambit that succeeded with critics largely because of the titanic performance delivered by Gary Oldman in the central role. Countless actors have played Churchill, but Oldman — working under mounds of makeup — really made the role his own, anchoring Darkest Hour‘s drama and making it more than just another wartime period piece. As Entertainment Weekly’s Chris Nashawaty argued, “I don’t think we’ll ever see anyone else do Churchill this well again unless the man himself comes back from the dead.”Where to watch it:&nbsp;In Theaters","section":"Total Recall","tags":"marvel, Nominations, aliens, Go, halloween, Searchlight, movie, adaptation, Channel, and, all-time, winner, screenings","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/23100125/2018-Best-Picture-Noms.jpg","slug":"all-2018-oscar-best-picture-nominees-by-tomatometer"},{"id":"47508951444743","title":"11 Most Disastrous Movie Thanksgivings Ever","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})11 Most Disastrous Movie Thanksgivings EverWe look at the most awkward, uncomfortable, and downright unpleasant Thanksgivings portrayed on film.by Jeff Giles | November 22, 2017 |  CommentsEveryone has the day off work, there’s a big bird on the table, and relatives you haven’t seen in awhile are sitting around watching parades and football. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!Now, obviously, Thanksgiving doesn’t have quite the rich cinematic tradition that certain other holidays have enjoyed, but we’ve still watched the fourth Thursday in November unfold on the big screen enough times to inspire us&nbsp;to look back at some of the most noteworthy not-so-thankful Thanksgivings in movie history. We’ve gathered together an eclectic group for our list, including old favorites (Hannah and Her Sisters), indie upstarts (The House of Yes), and even a critical dud or two. Plus, as a special bonus, we’ve included the trailer for a movie that never was — so tuck in your napkins, wait for Sis to say grace, and let’s all dig in!Addams Family Values (1993)  77%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)For many, the Addams Family movies trigger memories of MC Hammer more than anything else, but 1993’s Addams Family Values actually received better reviews than its predecessor — and it’s also noteworthy for containing one of the most hysterical Thanksgiving pageants in movie history, one which begins with turkeys singing “Eat me!” and culminates with Christina Ricci’s Wednesday Addams, playing Pocahontas, departing from the script written by unctuous summer camp director Gary Granger (played by Peter MacNicol) to air a list of grievances against the pilgrims before directing her tribe to burn their village to the ground. It might read like a tryptophan-induced dream of Howard Zinn’s, but it’s actually very funny — and certainly a big part of why the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum called Addams Family Values “one of the funniest, most mean-spirited satirical assaults on sunny American values since the salad days of W.C. Fields.”Watch TrailerAlice's Restaurant (1969)  63%Only in the ’60s could an 18-minute talking blues song by a 19-year-old white kid from New England become such a big hit that it inspired a movie helmed by an A-list director like Arthur Penn, but that’s exactly what happened with Arlo Guthrie’s “Alice’s Restaurant.” It’s a rambling tale of a pair of Massachusetts hippies who found themselves dragged to court for illegally dumping garbage on Thanksgiving Day — only to watch the arresting officer break down in tears of frustration when he discovers that the presiding judge is blind and can’t see the glossy color photos meticulously taken of the scene of the crime. And you thought you had it bad, watching the parade on your grandmother’s couch! As a movie, Alice’s Restaurant is arguably most interesting as a ’60s relic, or an early example of meta filmmaking (the real-life Alice makes a cameo, and officer William “Obie” Obanhein stars as himself), but critics have been generally kind to it; as Roger Ebert succinctly put it, the movie is “good work in a minor key.”Watch TrailerBrokeback Mountain (2005)  87%(Photo by Focus Films)Thanksgiving, like any family holiday, can be something of a double-edged blade: It has the potential to both bring loved ones together, but in doing so, it also has the ability to exacerbate tensions — and given that the protagonists in Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain (adapted from the short story by Annie Proulx) spend their adult lives struggling with their barely expressed love for one another, you might expect that turkey and mashed potatoes would serve as a garnish for some remarkably tense moments. You’d be right, too — both Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) suffer through some bleak Thanksgivings, none more awkward than the one which acts as a prelude to Ennis’ wife Alma (Michelle Williams) confronting him about his secret affair. Awk-warrrrd — and all part of what Metromix.com’s Matt Pais called “a gorgeous meditation on the sorrow of finding everything you want and not knowing how to keep it.”Watch TrailerThe Doors (1991)  57%(Photo by TriStar Pictures)The surviving members of the Doors disputed a lot of the material that ended up in Oliver Stone’s wildly over the top Jim Morrison biopic, including the infamous scene that depicts the late Doors frontman locking girlfriend Pamela Courson in a closet and setting it on fire — and the Thanksgiving dinner sequence in which Patricia Kennealy (played by Meg Ryan), the woman who may or may not have been his wife, ends up throwing the turkey at Morrison (Val Kilmer). Critics more or less agreed with the remaining members of the band, shrugging The Doors down to a 54 percent Tomatometer rating, although their main concern was not historical accuracy, but the problem of spending two hours watching the exploits of a guy who, despite his talent and charisma, isn’t terribly likable. As Time’s Richard Schickel noted, “the film really proves only that Jim was a bad drunk and a worse friend, and that in no way was his life exemplary,” while Lawrence.com’s Eric Melin dismisses The Doors simply as “a pretentious movie about a man haunted by a naked Indian.”Watch TrailerDutch (1991)  17%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Like Planes, Trains and Automobiles, 1991’s Ed O’Neill-led Dutch bears the stamp of John Hughes, who wrote the script; unlike its classic listmate, however, Dutch was a commercial non-starter at the box office, and bore the brunt of many irate reviews from critics like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who called Hughes “a man more prolific than Stephen King and less inspired than Aaron Spelling” and declared that Dutch “shouldn’t even be allowed on planes.” The venom is easy to understand — it isn’t that Dutch is a horrible movie, per se; it’s just that Hughes had already written more than one very similar script — and Dutch, which pits O’Neill against his girlfriend’s prepubescent son during a pitfall-laden journey home for Thanksgiving, didn’t benefit from its superficial resemblance to Planes, Trains and Automobiles.Watch TrailerHannah and Her Sisters (1986)  91%Ah, Thanksgiving. What would it be without turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and lustfully eyeing your wife’s sister? Actually, most of us wouldn’t know about that last item on the list, but for Michael Caine in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters, it’s a different story. The film opens with Caine’s Elliot conducting some Allen-esque hand wringing over his secret crush on his sister-in-law, Lee (Barbara Hershey), who he takes every opportunity to “bump into” around town (Manhattan, natch). It makes for a rather uncomfortable holiday for Elliot — but few writers do grown-up angst as well as Allen, and he was near the top of his game here; as Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson wrote, “It’s a masterwork.” (Hannah‘s final act centers around a different kind of Thanksgiving celebration, but we don’t want to spoil the ending for you here.)Watch TrailerHome for the Holidays (1995)  63%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Unlike some of the films on this list, Home for the Holidays doesn’t rely on Thanksgiving as a backdrop or a plot device — it’s actually the whole reason for the movie. In Jodie Foster’s second directorial outing, Holly Hunter plays a beleaguered single mom whose life is falling apart just in time for a holiday feast with her highly dysfunctional family. Despite a solid cast, including Anne Bancroft, Robert Downey Jr., Charles Durning, Dylan McDermott, and Claire Danes — not to mention a November release date and generally favorable reviews — Holidays failed to gain much traction at the box office, going on to gross just over $17.5 million. Still, if you manage to make room for it on DVD, you may have an experience similar to the Palo Alto Weekly’s Jim Shelby, who wrote, “I found myself shaking my head in embarrassed, smiling recognition.”Watch TrailerThe House of Yes (1997)  62%(Photo by Lionsgate)We’ve covered some unbearably awkward Thanksgivings on this list, but Tori Spelling’s holiday in The House of Yes — which finds her joining her fiancee’s family for the meal, meeting them for the first time, only to discover that his relationship with his mentally unstable twin sister is much more, ahem, complex than she’d been led to believe. Matter of fact, pretty much everyone in the family has some something lurking under the surface, and much of it will become known to poor Tori before the weekend is over. And did we mention there’s a hurricane going on during all of this? Don’t feel too bad for Ms. Spelling, though; for one of the only times in her career, she earned some of the movie’s highest marks, including praise from TV Guide’s Ken Fox, who declared her House‘s “real surprise,” calling her “perfectly cast as a lamb among wolves, and her naivete is strangely affecting.”The Ice Storm (1997)  85%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)What do Ang Lee and Christina Ricci have against Thanksgiving, anyway? In her second appearance on this list, Ricci plays Wendy Hood, one in the series of cynical, borderline misanthropic teens she portrayed in the ’90s — and in a slight (albeit far less humorous) echo of her turn as Wednesday Addams in Addams Family Values, she uses Thanksgiving as an opportunity to lift the veil on the holiday’s darker side, delivering a soliloquy about the inherent cruelty of the celebration. Painful to watch? Indubitably — and appropriately, for a film that hinges on crushing ennui and alienation. Lee, who also directed Brokeback Mountain, which appears elsewhere on this list, received high marks for adapting Rick Moody’s tense, sad novel about suburban families in the ’70s; as the Globe and Mail’s Rick Groen put it, Lee manages to “[duplicate] on screen exactly what the writer achieves on the page.”Watch TrailerPieces of April (2003)  84%(Photo by United Artists)Katie Holmes earned critical praise for her brief appearance as a gleefully manipulative murder victim in 2001’s The Gift — and then entered a fallow period, taking roles in little-seen projects like Abandon and The Singing Detective. 2003’s Pieces of April, about a woman who invites her estranged family to her apartment to meet her boyfriend over Thanksgiving dinner, ended up being another non-starter at the box office, but at least in this case, critics applauded the film, sending screenwriter Peter Hedges’ directorial debut all the way up to 84 percent on the Tomatometer. Somewhat stereotypically for an indie production, nothing much really happens in Pieces — but given that Holmes spends much of the film struggling to get dinner made, it could be said that this is one of the few movies on this list that accurately captures the culinary drama behind the holiday. It is, in the words of Empire’s Natasha Aitken, “a shining example of just how compelling and affecting low-budget filmmaking can be when you’ve got a good story and strong cast.”Watch TrailerPlanes, Trains and Automobiles (1987)  92%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Perhaps the quintessential Thanksgiving film, Planes, Trains and Automobiles represents a critical and commercial high point for all of its principals, including Steve Martin (as repressed ad executive Neal Page), John Candy (as unintentionally obnoxious shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith), and John Hughes (as the writer and director of a film not starring Molly Ringwald). On its face, there’s very little about Planes to distinguish it from other films — how many ’80s movies feature an uptight ad exec going on some kind of transformative journey, anyway? — and where John Hughes goes, broad humor inevitably follows. But Martin and Candy play off one another brilliantly, and if any movie deserves to have a big, gooey heart beating at its center, shouldn’t it be one about the true meaning of Thanksgiving?Watch TrailerFinally, here’s the trailer for Eli Roth’s fake slasher film Thanksgiving, which promises “you’ll come home for the holidays… in a body bag.”[The following clip is highly NSFW.]","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Teen, TV, renewed, thriller, show, globes, kids, psychological, Sneak, Stephen, Year","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/22172720/Worst-Thanksgivings.jpg","slug":"11-worst-movie-thanksgivings-ever"},{"id":"47508951440645","title":"6 Classic Movies That Clearly Inspired Star Wars","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})6 Classic Movies That Clearly Inspired Star WarsWe look at some of the films that influenced George Lucas' epic space opera.by Jeff Giles | December 6, 2017 |  CommentsTo the kids of the 1970s and 1980s, George Lucas’ original Star Wars&nbsp;trilogy seemed like it came soaring, fully formed, out of that galaxy far, far away, and its intoxicating blend of classic mythology and souped-up, effects-fueled action has made it one of the most widely influential sagas to come out of Hollywood over the last 40 years — as evidenced by the deafening buzz that accompanies every new installment in the franchise.&nbsp;But of course Lucas, like every filmmaker, stood on the shoulders of giants to build his masterpiece, and with this feature, we look back on some of the most obvious strands of Star Wars‘ DNA.The Hidden Fortress (kakushi-toride No San-akunin) (1958)  97%A princess and a scoundrel on a mission behind enemy lines, with a pair of squabbling nincompoops helping them along the way. Sound familiar? To anyone who’s seen Star Wars, Akira Kurosawa’s 1958 classic The Hidden Fortress&nbsp;will bear several distinct similarities, not the least of which is the way that — as George Lucas later pointed out — they’re both told from the point of view of “the two lowest characters.” Loose narrative similarities aside, there are other parallels between Star Wars and The Hidden Fortress, perhaps most notably Kurosawa’s deft way with kinetic action (there’s a horse chase whose swooping thrills aren’t altogether dissimilar from the Death Star battle) and their shared fondness for screen wipe transitions. It’s been argued that the similarities between The Hidden Fortress&nbsp;and Star Wars&nbsp;have been overstated over the years, but there’s no denying there are several good reasons why the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley called Fortress&nbsp;the “panoramic odyssey that inspired” Lucas’ saga.Watch TrailerThe Searchers (1956)  96%Director John Ford inspired a slew of filmmakers across multiple generations — including the aforementioned Akira Kurosawa&nbsp;— and his shadow looms large over the Skywalker family saga told across the first six Star Wars films, primarily during the chapters that take place on the desert planet of Tatooine. Its desolate landscape bears distinct echoes of Ford’s The Searchers, in which a homesteader embarks on a grueling quest for revenge after his family is taken by natives — just as Anakin does in the prequels upon discovering the kidnapping of his mother Shmi. Anakin’s return to Tatooine and slaughter of the Tusken Raiders who took Shmi is essentially a sped-up version of The Searchers, and our glimpses of Tatooine in A New Hope&nbsp;— particularly the unforgettable sight of young Luke returning to his family farm to find it in smoldering ruins — owe an obvious debt to Ford’s somber, sun-baked classic.Watch TrailerThe Dam Busters (1954)  100%George Lucas drew on plenty of war movies for inspiration while crafting the climactic battle sequences for Star Wars, but while watching the Rebels’ first run on the Death Star, there’s one film that stands out in particular: 1955’s The Dam Busters, in which a squadron of Allied fighters sets out to blow up German dams by flying through a trench and dropping bombs at just the right time, angle, and velocity to send their payloads skipping across the water and into the wall. The story sets up an almost unbearably tense final act, from which Lucas borrowed liberally — not only visually (with the help of A New Hope&nbsp;cinematographer Gilbert Taylor, who managed The Dam Busters’ special effects) but fundamentally, lifting lines of dialogue like “Get set for your attack run” and “Look at the size of that thing.”Watch TrailerMetropolis (1927)  97%Metropolis&nbsp;serves as a fundamental building block for cinematic sci-fi in general, so it’s basically a matter of course that Fritz Lang’s classic magnum opus would exert some substantial influence on Star Wars&nbsp;— and on narrative grounds, that’s arguably very true, from Metropolis’ depiction of a fringe element desperately at odds against a ruling class to the inclusion of a main character with a mechanical hand. But Star Wars’ biggest debt to Metropolis&nbsp;might be the visual design of Maschinenmensch, the iconic female robot whose looks were obviously never far from artist Ralph McQuarrie’s mind while he was creating his concept art for C-3PO. Of course, at this point, George Lucas’ lovable jabbering droid is far better known to the mainstream audience than anything from Metropolis, but even if you’ve never seen it, take our word for it — Luke’s trusty golden-plated companion is a descendant of cinema’s first iconic robots.Watch TrailerFlash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940)  88%George Lucas was so enamored of the 1936 Flash Gordon&nbsp;film serial that he tried optioning the rights to a new adaptation from producer Dino de Laurentiis — and if those meetings had turned out differently, he might have put his own stamp on the venerable comic franchise instead of opting to set out on his own with Star Wars. It’s therefore unsurprising that Lucas’ trademark trilogy ended up bearing the distinct stamp of the Gordon&nbsp;films, utilizing familiar filmmaking touches like the opening title crawl and “soft wipe” scene transitions as well as narrative components, such as Chewbacca (an analog of Flash’s leonine pal Prince Thun) and our heroes’ infiltration of the Death Star in disguise. Given how well things turned out with Star Wars, he probably would have put together a killer Flash Gordon, but don’t feel too bad for Flash — he did, after all, get his own 1980 movie, along with something Luke Skywalker never had: Queen on the soundtrack.Watch TrailerTriumph des Willens (Triumph Of The Will) (1935)  87%The original Star Wars&nbsp;trilogy’s arc pits insurgent rebels — our heroes — against a plainly authoritarian regime, but the overall saga’s point of view regarding power and those who wield it isn’t anywhere near as absolute as the kids of 1977 might have guessed while watching X-wing fighters swoop into those Death Star trenches. In fact, as we saw in the prequel trilogy, the Empire was once the Galactic Republic, and only morphed into the police state of A New Hope&nbsp;and beyond through a matter of lawfully enacted degrees. The line between democracy and fascism isn’t always as airtight as we’d like to think — which is why it’s sort of fitting that the joyous denouement of the first episode, in which our protagonists are paraded through a room full of Rebel soldiers and given medals for their heroism, bears direct visual echoes of a scene from Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will, in which Hitler and his generals march before a huge army standing at attention.Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Fantasy, fresh, MCU, your, transformers, romance, Oscars, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/06172053/Movies-That-Inspired-Star-Wars.jpg","slug":"6-movies-that-inspired-star-wars"},{"id":"47508949030145","title":"Rank the 10 Best Horror Franchise Fourths","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank the 10 Best Horror Franchise FourthsWe look back at the best-reviewed fourth installments of various horror franchises.by Jeff Giles | January 3, 2018 |  CommentsInsidious&nbsp;fans have had to wait a few years for the franchise’s fourth installment, but with this weekend’s&nbsp;The Last Key, the story of Elise Rainier (Lin Shaye) finally has its next chapter.

We’re talking, of course, about&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;— and in honor of its return, we decided to dedicate this feature to a look at some of the many films that helped inspire the streaming service’s ’80s-set horror hit. Toast up some Eggos, because it’s time for Total Recall,&nbsp;Stranger Things&nbsp;style!Alien (1979)  98%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)Stranger Things‘ setting of Hawkins, Indiana is clearly quite different from the reaches of deep space where we meet the crew of the Nostromo in Alien. Still, it’s easy to see how the Duffer brothers took inspiration from Ridley Scott’s sci-fi/horror classic — most obviously in the way those imprisoned in the Upside Down are forcibly used as incubators for the offspring of its monstrous denizens, and in the way the Demogorgon’s nightmarish face opens like the world’s worst flower (or a xenomorph’s egg). Given the way poor Will yarfed up a nasty remnant of his time in captivity, we’re guessing we’ve seen far from the last instance of Alien‘s body horror influence on the show.Altered States (1980)  85%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)The first time Eleven is plunged into her sensory deprivation tank in order to access the Upside Down, film buffs saw a clear parallel to this 1980 cult classic, in which William Hurt plays a psychologist who uses a similar apparatus to explore the theory that human consciousness is far more vast and complex than we’re able to understand in our waking hours. Using a combination of drugs and sensory deprivation, he undergoes a series of progressively more profound transformations, until — like Eleven — crossing the line between realities threatens to consume him altogether. Stranger Things&nbsp;hasn’t given us primitive man or a many-eyed goat yet, but as the second-season teasers have shown us, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Upside Down.E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)  98%Steven Spielberg’s classic 1982 hit is a lot of things, but underneath everything, it’s the story of a group of kids banding together to protect their powerful yet vulnerable — and decidedly unusual — new friend from an encroaching adult menace. It’s a fight that comes with no small amount of peril, and one that’s destined to demand some heartbreaking sacrifice before it’s over, but our brave protagonists still insist on standing up for what’s right, and doing it largely without (deliberate) assistance from the unwitting adult authority figures in their lives. And okay, so Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) never made a bike fly across the night sky, but she did flip a freakin’ van&nbsp;with the power of her mind — and just like E.T. loved his Reese’s Pieces, she can’t get enough Eggo waffles.Firestarter (1984)  37%This is a little bit of a cheat, because although the Duffer brothers were clearly influenced by Firestarter&nbsp;— along with an assortment of other Stephen King stories, including IT&nbsp;— they took their inspiration from the bestselling horror master’s books rather than their film adaptations. Still, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention the story of young Charlie McGee (Drew Barrymore), a young girl whose growing pyrokinetic powers are the inherited result of a shadowy government program… and very much desired by the men in pursuit of Charlie and her dad, who’ve fled their captors’ grasp and are determined to live in freedom rather than be forced to use their gifts for potentially nefarious purposes. Eleven did a pretty bang-up job of evading Dr. Brenner during Stranger Things‘ first season, but if she ends up back on the run in season two, Charlie’s adventures might offer a few tips for staying a step ahead of special agents.The Gate (1987)  60%(Photo by New Century Vista Film courtesy Everett Collection)You never know what’ll be waiting when you open a portal to another dimension, but it’s always a pretty safe bet that at least one nasty surprise will be waiting on the other side. We’ve seen it happen in sci-fi over and over again for years, and 1987’s The Gate&nbsp;offers a perfect (and perfectly ’80s) example of those dangers in action. Like the foolhardy crew at Hawkins National Laboratory who coerce poor Eleven into mucking around with the Upside Down, the boys in The Gate&nbsp;(played by Stephen Dorff and Louis Tripp) end up getting more than they bargained for when they poke a hole in the barrier between worlds — heck, we even see the old “stretching wall” trick in action.The Goonies (1985)  76%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)Long before Stranger Things&nbsp;rounded up a gang of junior misfits to tell a tale of adventure with horror overtones, dozens of directors made memorable use of that familiar dynamic for films that thrilled audiences while making them nostalgic for their misspent youth (or, for younger filmgoers, sent them home with dreams of doing anything half as cool as the stuff they’d just seen). But given the Duffer brothers’ fondness for all things ’80s, we’re inclined to point to The Goonies&nbsp;and The Monster Squad&nbsp;as two of the show’s more obvious sources of inspiration. Like the Goonies, our Hawkins heroes aren’t the coolest kids in school — and like the Monster Squad, they’ve experienced stuff that would send many of the adults in their lives straight into therapy. Strength in numbers always counts for a lot, but it’s even more meaningful during the years before you get your driver’s license.The Manhattan Project (1986)  50%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)The post-Watergate years were great for paranoid, politically tinged thrillers — particularly in the early ’80s, when rapidly advancing technology mingled with Cold War fears to produce cinema that imagined computer-driven conspiracies lurking behind even the most innocuous-seeming suburban landscapes. That paranoia fueled 1986’s The Manhattan Project, in which a government scientist’s top-secret lab is disguised as a medical company in upstate New York… and a particularly smart kid ends up bogarting plutonium from the facility so he can build a bomb for his big science fair project. The kids in Stranger Things&nbsp;haven’t had to defuse a warhead yet, but the secret misdeeds going on inside the Hawkins National Laboratory could end up being far more explosive.A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)  94%(Photo by New Line Cinema)The Demogorgon doesn’t have a razor-clawed glove, a fedora, or a ratty striped sweater. Still, there are some clear parallels between A Nightmare on Elm Street‘s Freddy Krueger and Stranger Things‘ big bad from the Upside Down — first spotted in the second episode of the first season (titled “The Weirdo on Maple Street”), during which the wall of Will Byers’ room is seen stretching with the strain of something trying to get in, Krueger style. In the season climax, Jonathan and Nancy decide to do battle against the Demogorgon by outfitting the Byers home with booby traps and luring the monster in — much the same way Freddy met his (first) demise in the original Nightmare.Poltergeist (1982)  86%(Photo by MGM)After poor Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) gets trapped in the Upside Down, and his mom Joyce (Winona Ryder) struggles to communicate with him — first via freaky phone connection, then through messages sent by Christmas lights — it is, like much of Stranger Things, both scary and poignant. But it’s also kind of familiar, at least to anyone who’s ever watched Poltergeist: poor Carol Anne Freeling (Heather O’Rourke) spends much of the movie separated from her desperate parents, held captive by a supernatural evil and only able to reach out through the static on the family TV. And like Carol Anne, Will is ultimately drawn back to life by the power of his mother’s love — although it isn’t enough to prevent lingering traces of the other side from coming with him.Scanners (1981)  70%To see the influences exerted by some of the movies on this list, you need to have a fairly observant eye. Not so David Cronenberg’s 1981 sci-fi horror classic Scanners, which — like Stranger Things&nbsp;— involves a shadowy group of powerful people determined to maintain control over a powerful telepath. Stranger Things&nbsp;has included a lot less head-exploding action thus far, but hey — we’re only up to the second season so far. You never know what might happen next.Stand by Me (1986)  91%(Photo by Columbia Pictures courtesy Everett Collection)It would be easy enough to draw parallels between Stranger Things&nbsp;and any classic movie about kids on a potentially life-threatening adventure. Still, Stand by Me&nbsp;stands out as one of the more obvious points of reference — not least because it was adapted from a Stephen King story. And while there may not be a straight line between Stranger Things&nbsp;and King’s tale of four friends braving local bullies to catch a glimpse of a dead body, there are a number of visual references, and there’s still plenty of overlap; both are period pieces, albeit set in different eras, and both delve into the darker elements of that fraught area between childhood and the adult world. (Also, they both boast a killer soundtrack.)","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Food, comiccon, Turner, adaptation, crime, Hear, GIFs, shows, Sci-Fi, Out","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/25165912/Stranger-Things-Movies-Recall.jpg","slug":"eleven-movies-that-inspired-stranger-things"},{"id":"47508951442694","title":"James Franco’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})James Franco's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the director and star of The Disaster Artist.by Jeff Giles | November 29, 2017 |  CommentsHe’s a performance artist, published author, gala host, former soap star, college student, professor, and one of the most prolific film actors currently working in Hollywood. This week,&nbsp;James Franco is keeping busy as the director and star of The Disaster Artist, which dramatizes outsider hero Tommy Wiseau’s efforts to bring his infamous The Room to the big screen, so we decided now would be the perfect time to take a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from Franco’s bustling career. From indie flicks to blockbusters, he’s been in just about every kind of picture — and we’re ranking them here while inviting you to rank your own favorites. It’s time for Total Recall!1. Memoria (2016)  100%(Photo by Monterey Media)As if it weren’t enough that Memoria&nbsp;served as one of a whopping nine movies&nbsp;Franco released in 2016, it’s also based on a short story he wrote — all of which might make it sound like the vanity project to end all vanity projects, if not for the universally positive critical reception it earned during its limited release. Granted, at five reviews, we’re dealing with a limited sample size — at a certain point, Franco becomes too prolific even for people paid to watch the movies — but a rave is a rave, and this quiet character study about a troubled Bay Area teen earned its share, with its author’s supporting turn as a concerned teacher helping anchor the drama. “Despite clocking in at a scant 70 minutes,” &nbsp;wrote Michael Rechtshaffen for the Los Angeles Times, “Memoria&nbsp;manages to make a hauntingly poetic impression.”2.&nbsp;Milk (2008)  93%(Photo by Focus Features)Sean Penn rightly received most of the many accolades afforded this 2008 biopic of assassinated political activist Harvey Milk, but director Gus Van Sant wasn’t content to let his movie rest on its star’s performance — he rounded out the cast of Milk&nbsp;with a number of actors whose seamlessly committed performances helped make it one of the most lauded films of the year. Franco fills a supporting role here as Scott Smith, Milk’s onetime lover (and, eventually, the executor of his will), who moves to San Francisco with him during the first act and helps him start his political career. Franco’s work earned him an MTV Movie Awards nomination for Best Kiss — and helped inspire Tom Long of the Detroit News to write, “Progress is slow, but Harvey Milk was one of the first to set the wheels in motion. He more than deserves a movie this good.”3.&nbsp;127 Hours (2010)  93%(Photo by Chuck Zlotnick/Fox Searchlight Pictures)&nbsp;By 2010, James Franco had been making movies for well over a decade, and had flirted with leading man status fairly early in his career, but it never really seemed to suit him — until Danny Boyle came along with 127 Hours. A dramatization of the horrible ordeal overcome by mountain climber Aron Ralston, who devised his own gruesome rescue from certain death after being pinned by a boulder during an expedition, 127 Hours&nbsp;gave Franco the opportunity to carry a movie on his own terms — and earned him some of the best reviews of his career, not to mention a pile of awards and a Best Actor Oscar nomination, in the process. Mike Scott of the Times-Picayune was just one of the many critics who loved the film, calling it “A masterful slice of four-star cinema, featuring an irresistible performance by James Franco, breathtaking cinematography, and the kind of deep, searching soul that is absent from so much of what comes out of Hollywood.”4.&nbsp;The Spider-Man Franchise (82%)(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Long before Tom Holland swung into the MCU as Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brought Marvel’s wall-crawler to the big screen in director Sam Raimi’s blockbuster trilogy — and&nbsp;Franco&nbsp;joined the core ensemble cast as Harry Osborn, Peter Parker’s best pal and the future Green Goblin. Harry’s tortured arc helped form the backbone of Raimi’s overarching narrative throughout the three films, and although Spider-Man 3&nbsp;proved a dissatisfying low note for the end of this chapter in Spidey’s big-screen life, the movies together helped pave the way for the looming great golden age of superheroes at the box office; more importantly, as Mick LaSalle observed for the San Francisco Chronicle, they offered “Smart, fun entertainment made by people who took nothing for granted, including the audience.”5. This Is the End (2013)  83%(Photo by Suzanne Hanover/Sony Pictures)If an actor is playing themselves in a movie, should it count as one of their best performances? More often than not, we’d say no — but we’re making an exception for the gloriously loopy This Is the End, in which some of Hollywood’s sharpest young talent play exaggerated (or straight up invented) versions of themselves against the backdrop of the apocalypse. The end of the world, naturally, is witnessed from Franco’s abode, where he’s hosting a house party (including Seth Rogen, Danny McBride, Jonah Hill, and Emma Watson) when things go haywire. The end result, while decidedly not for all tastes, hits its comedic targets far more often than it misses; as Dana Stevens observed for Slate, “This Is the End, true to its subject matter, is as funny as hell.”6. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)  82%(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.)&nbsp;While it would certainly be fair to say that the human actors have never been the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;franchise’s biggest draw — and that goes at least double for the recent prequel trilogy — it definitely helps to ground the drama if you’re working with actors who can bring the sci-fi saga’s more fantastical elements believably to life. With Rise of the Planet of the Apes, director Rupert Wyatt rounded up a talented flesh-and-blood ensemble that included John Lithgow, Brian Cox, Freida Pinto, and — as Will Rodman, the biologist whose quest for an Alzheimer’s cure unwittingly triggers the virus that sets the story in motion — James Franco. It all added up to a blockbuster that set the bar surprisingly high for its successors, and although Andy Serkis’ mo-cap work would deservedly come to define the trilogy, Franco helped lay the groundwork with an opening installment that the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s Colin Covert deemed “first-class entertainment, packed with clever, unsettling and even inspired ideas.”7.&nbsp;Goat (2016)  79%(Photo by Paramount Pictures)In addition to taking a supporting role, Franco also donned his producer’s hat for Goat, a harrowing drama from director/co-writer Andrew Neel about a college freshman (Ben Schnetzer) whose efforts to fit in on campus include pledging his older brother’s fraternity — a fateful decision that soon goes violently wrong, further complicating a young life already shadowed by horrific violence. Like a good number of Franco’s film efforts, it was destined for limited release and aimed outside the mainstream, but for many of the critics who screened it, this hard-hitting coming-of-age story — distinguished by a scene-stealing turn from former pop idol Nick Jonas — proved difficult to shake. “This isn’t an easy film to watch,” admitted the Washington Post’s Stephanie Merry. “But it’s even harder to forget.”8. Yosemite (2016)  77%(Photo by Monterey Media)One of several films drawing from Franco’s 2010 short story collection Palo Alto, this 2015 indie drama weaves together “Yosemite” and “Peter Parker,” a pair of stories from the book, to observe moments in the lives of three fifth-grade boys in 1985. As with other Palo Alto-derived movies, Franco produced and starred but didn’t write or direct; here, he handed the reins to writer-director Gabrielle Demeestere and appeared in one segment as Phil, a father taking a trip to the titular park with his son (Everett Meckler). While certainly not one of his more widely seen efforts, it ranks among his most satisfying for the majority of critics who reviewed it — including the Village Voice’s Alan Scherstuhl, who wrote, “Yosemite&nbsp;mines Franco’s fiction for its most vital quality: his unsentimental depiction of youthful insecurity, this time among fifth-graders.”9. The Dead Girl (2006)  76%(Photo by First Look International)&nbsp;It wasn’t seen by many people during its brief theatrical run, but this dark ensemble piece from writer/director Karen Moncrieff gave a strong stable of actors (including Franco, Brittany Murphy, Marcia Gay Harden, Josh Brolin, Toni Collette, and Kerry Washington) a chance to plumb the emotional depths of the mystery surrounding a woman’s grisly death. While far from Franco’s showiest role, his turn as a kind-hearted mortician helped anchor The Dead Girl’s unrelenting grimness with a small ray of something like hope — and helped move the Oregonian’s Shawn Levy to write, “Moncrieff manages to get beneath the skin of several of these characters, a nifty trick considering what a crowded world she’s created. In all, it’s a grueling, emotionally taxing, discomfiting film.”10. In the Valley of Elah (2007)  74%(Photo by Warner Bros. courtesy Everett Collection)In this Paul Haggis drama, Franco took a supporting role alongside Jason Patric as one of two politely dismissive Army officers who interfere with the efforts of a grieving father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) to uncover the facts of his son’s gruesome murder. Though its Iraq War overtones didn’t do it many favors with audiences, and some critics felt Haggis took an excessively heavy-handed approach, most were able to appreciate In the Valley of Elah’s message — and the hard questions it asked in a time of war. “After the potent final image faded to black,” wrote Aisle Seat’s Mike McGranaghan, “I had that very special tingle I get when I know I’ve just seen a great movie.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Horror, Out, spy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/29172753/James-Franco-Recall.jpg","slug":"james-francos-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508951439620","title":"The Best Films Starring the Star Wars: The Last Jedi Cast","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Best Films Starring the Star Wars: The Last Jedi Castby Jeff Giles | December 13, 2017 |  CommentsMark Hamill’s long-awaited return to active duty as Luke Skywalker is the big story for Star Wars&nbsp;fans heading out to see The Last Jedi&nbsp;this weekend, but he’s far from the only talented member of the cast — and to prove it, we’re taking a look at some of the other fine features credited to the members of this installment’s ensemble. Unfortunately, some Last Jedi&nbsp;stars are just too new to include (all apologies, Kelly Marie Tran!), but with the saga showing no signs of stopping, we’ll no doubt end up adding their later films to this list after Star Wars&nbsp;sequels to come. It’s time for Total Recall!Daisy Ridley&nbsp;– Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)  93%Ryan FujitaniIs it cheating to fall back on The Force Awakens&nbsp;for Daisy Ridley’s entry on our list? Well, maybe — but it was only a couple of years ago that she made her big breakthrough in this movie, and she hasn’t had a ton of time to do much else since. Ms. Ridley isn’t the first previously unknown actor to skyrocket out of obscurity in a blockbuster film, but few have carried the weight of a massive franchise so gracefully; once she’s done with the Star Wars&nbsp;saga, her performance as Rey suggests we’ll be seeing a lot of her for years to come. “Han Solo is back,” Pete Hammond wrote of the franchise’s long-awaited seventh installment, “but it is Daisy Ridley’s Rey that is the heart of The Force Awakens. She’s a keeper.”Adam Driver&nbsp;– Paterson (2016)  96%(Photo by Bleecker Street Media)Adam Driver’s performance as Ben Solo, a.k.a. Kylo Ren, is appropriately over the top for a character grappling with internal conflict as he stands at the forefront of a movement poised to reshape the entire galaxy. He can be still and centered when the material calls for it, however — as exemplified by Paterson, Jim Jarmusch’s gently unfolding drama about a poet who supports himself as a bus driver while resisting his wife’s encouragement to publish his work. It’s the type of film that may not have a lot going on in terms of plot, but has a lot to say to viewers quiet enough to listen, and Driver’s work in the title role is a big part of what makes it so gratifying. As Tom Keogh wrote for the Seattle Times, “Driver’s performance as an uncertain man getting through the day-to-day prosaic, quietly buoyed by passion and artistic commitment, is exquisite.”Mark Hamill – The Big Red One (1980)  90%(Photo by United Artists courtesy Everett Collection)As far as generations of filmgoers are concerned, Mark Hamill is&nbsp;Luke Skywalker — and maybe the voice of the Joker too, during his downtime from a galaxy far, far away. But his acting gifts encompass more than just a Jedi and/or the Clown Prince of Crime, and 1980’s The Big Red One&nbsp;offers compelling proof. This World War II drama from director/co-writer Samuel Fuller, inspired by Fuller’s own experiences on the front lines, combines the talents of a solid ensemble cast led by Lee Marvin — and including Hamill, who plays a gifted yet reluctant sharpshooter. “The cast smartly underplays things, with Marvin being as charismatic as usual playing a man of few words,” wrote Jeff Vice for the Deseret News. “And Hamill, an actor given to over-the-top outbursts, reins it in here; this may be his best big-screen performance.”Carrie Fisher – Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)  91%From the moment A New Hope&nbsp;hit, Carrie Fisher was forever linked with Princess Leia, but to her credit, she flat-out refused to be pigeonholed. In addition to an impressive career as an author and playwright, she spent years as one of Hollywood’s most in-demand script doctors — and that’s all while managing to turn in reliably scene-stealing supporting appearances in a handful of non-Star Wars&nbsp;classics. Take, for example, Fisher’s work in Woody Allen’s Hannah and Her Sisters, an Oscar-winning box office triumph that found the writer-director weaving together the lives and loves of mid-’80s Manhattanites with an ensemble that also included Barbara Hershey, Michael Caine, Dianne Wiest, and Mia Farrow. “Allen’s writing and directing style is so strong and assured in this film that the actual filmmaking itself becomes a narrative voice,” wrote Roger Ebert. “Just as we sense Henry James behind all of his novels, or William Faulkner or Iris Murdoch behind theirs.”Andy Serkis&nbsp;– The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)  95%(Photo by Warner Bros.)Andy Serkis is Hollywood’s reigning king of motion capture, with services so in demand that actually seeing his face onscreen is fairly rare; for every straight up live-action role like the MCU’s Ulysses Klaue, there’s a blockbuster production asking him to play a mo-cap creation like King Kong, Caesar in the recent Planet of the Apes&nbsp;trilogy, or nasty old Supreme Leader Snoke. It all started with Serkis’ boundary-shattering performance as Gollum in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings&nbsp;trilogy, which used cutting-edge technology — and Serkis’ dramatic gifts — to imbue the character with shockingly lifelike movements and expressions. “Andy Serkis’s work in creating Gollum deserved an honorary Academy Award,” wrote Nick Rogers of Suite101. “His gestures and voice, not computer software, make Gollum so memorable as he wrestles with his inner homicidal maniac. A soaring, searing tale of wonderment.”Oscar Isaac&nbsp;– Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)  92%(Photo by CBS Films)Oscar Isaac scored some notable roles early in his film career, including appearances in Sucker Punch, The Bourne Legacy, and Ridley Scott’s Robin Hood. They were all just a warmup, however, for the major coming-out party he threw for himself with Inside Llewyn Davis. Starring as the titular ’60s folk singer in this acclaimed Coen brothers comedy, Isaac inhabited one of the less likable protagonists in recent memory — but even as Llewyn made a mess of his life and alienated friends, acquaintances, and enemies with equal aplomb, he remained relatable on some level, largely thanks to the actor’s judgment-free portrayal. “The film’s centerpiece,” wrote Joe Morgenstern for the Wall Street Journal, “is Mr. Isaac’s phenomenal performance.”John Boyega&nbsp;– Attack the Block (2011)  90%(Photo by Matt Nettheim/Screen Gems courtesy Everett Collection)Before he traveled to a galaxy far, far away — and was conscripted into the First Order as the stormtrooper-turned-Resistance hero Finn — John Boyega had a very different type of extraterrestrial experience in 2011’s Attack the Block. A sci-fi action thriller from director Joe Cornish, Block&nbsp;imagines what might happen if aliens invaded a rough part of London, unwittingly wedging themselves into the ongoing conflict between local gangs, law enforcement, and ordinary citizens just trying to live peaceful lives — all of them willing to take extreme measures to protect what’s theirs. Not even in his 20s when the movie was released, Boyega amassed an impressive assortment of award nominations for his portrayal of a gang leader, setting up the worldwide breakthrough he’d enjoy just a few years later as Finn. As Leah Rozen wrote of Attack the Block&nbsp;for TheWrap, “This spunky, low-budget British action-comedy proves once again that a smart script can breathe new life into even the most tired of subjects.”Domhnall Gleeson&nbsp;– Brooklyn (2015)  97%(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)For a guy who isn’t yet quite a household name, Domhnall Gleeson has racked up a pretty impressive string of appearances in acclaimed films. From Never Let Me Go&nbsp;to the Harry Potter&nbsp;franchise and the Coen brothers’ True Grit&nbsp;remake, he displayed an uncommon early knack for picking film scripts, and that’s only continued — in 2015, he joined the Star Wars&nbsp;saga as the villainous General Hux while also landing roles in Ex Machina, The Revenant, and Brooklyn.&nbsp; The latter effort proved Gleeson didn’t need magic, space battles, or AI to keep an audience’s interest; playing the thoroughly decent Jim Farrell, a prospective love interest for Saoirse Ronan’s Eilis Lacey, he helped add an extra dash of romantic angst to this Oscar-nominated period piece’s heart-tugging story. “Brooklyn is a story for anyone who has ever left home,” wrote Lindsey Bahr for the Associated Press. “It’s a story for those who’ve waffled in indecision, for those forming their identities and forging their own paths. And it’s one of the loveliest films to grace cinemas this year.”Gwendoline Christie – Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015)  93%(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)It may seem crazy to those of us who’ve seen her slay (literally) as Brienne of Tarth on Game of Thrones, but Gwendoline Christie really doesn’t have much of a filmography to speak of — before breaking out as Captain Phasma in The Force Awakens, she was briefly seen in The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, The Zero Theorem, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. But as anyone who’s seen Christie’s work knows, she has quite the commanding presence onscreen — and she can steal scenes even when her face is hidden behind a chrome helmet. Relive Phasma’s debut this weekend, and prepare to see Christie’s name in the credits of many features to come.Benicio Del Toro&nbsp;– Sicario (2015)  92%(Photo by Richard Foreman Jr./Lionsgate)Some actors come to Star Wars&nbsp;looking for their first major role; for others, it’s a cool franchise stop in a career that already had plenty of its own momentum. With scads of other roles (and an Oscar) to his name, Benicio del Toro falls firmly in the latter camp — from his debut as Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Big Top Pee-wee&nbsp;to classics like The Usual Suspects&nbsp;and beyond, a person could keep their queue busy with nothing but his movies for days at a time. If you want to start at the top, begin your Benicio binge session with 2015’s Sicario, a harrowing crime thriller from director Denis Villeneuve (working from a script by Taylor Sheridan) about United States federal agents working to bring down a Mexican cartel. As a member of the team with seemingly questionable loyalties, del Toro adds an extra layer of tension to the story — and drew acclaim from critics like the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s Christopher Lawrence, who wrote, “Then there’s Del Toro’s turn as Alejandro. Simultaneously tragic and terrifying, it’s the type of subtly menacing star turn that should keep him busy throughout awards season.”Laura Dern&nbsp;– Rambling Rose (1991)  100%(Photo by New Line Cinema courtesy Everett Collection)Lots of people have known for a very long time that Laura Dern is an incredible talent — in fact, she was only in her early 20s when she picked up an Oscar nomination for her work in the title role of Rambling Rose. Dern’s dramatic chops might be in her genes — her Rose&nbsp;Oscar nomination came alongside one for her mother Diane Ladd, who had a supporting role in the movie — but she’s definitely made a name for herself over the course of a screen career that spans decades and shows no signs of slowing down. (Earlier this year, in fact, she won an Emmy for her work in HBO’s Big Little Lies.) Few could have truly foreseen the type of career Dern would create for herself after Rambling Rose&nbsp;was released, but she wowed more than a few critics with her portrayal of a woman who finds acceptance with a rural Georgia family after fleeing a life of forced prostitution. “Dern accomplishes her effects so invisibly and with such graceful ease that her skills may be under-appreciated, but pay attention,” wrote Hal Hinson for the Washington Post. “This is a spectacular actress arriving at the very peak of her talents.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Fall, halloween, Arrangement, casting, Wars, Dark, of, sitcom, Family, name, Avengers, IFC, canceled, laika","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/13144914/Star-Wars-Last-Jedi-Cast-Recall.jpg","slug":"the-best-films-starring-the-star-wars-the-last-jedi-cast"},{"id":"47508953899288","title":"Rank Woody Harrelson’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Woody Harrelson's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the War for the Planet of the Apes star.by Jeff Giles | July 12, 2017 |  CommentsWoody Harrelson has come an awfully long way since he joined the cast of Cheers in 1985, originating the role of hayseed bartender Woody Boyd and kicking off a career that has grown to encompass one of the more eclectic, unusual, and just plain interesting filmographies in modern Hollywood.

Of course, decades before the Wonder Woman&nbsp;movie, the character had her own TV series, which got us thinking about all the other superheroes who started out in live action on the small screen before making the jump into theaters.

Whether he’s making good use of his expert comic timing or lending dramatic gravitas to a scene, Goodman has become a reliable indicator of quality for whatever project he happens to be involved with — and this weekend, given that the project in question happens to be Kong: Skull Island, we figured now would be the perfect time to pay tribute to Mr. Goodman with a look back at his best-reviewed films. All hail King Ralph, it’s time for Total Recall!10. The Big Easy (1987)  89%An early and enduring critical favorite, The Big Easy&nbsp;was a concerted move to the mainstream for director Jim McBride, who cut his teeth on stuff like the X-rated apocalyptic fantasy Glen and Randa. It captured Dennis Quaid at his Hollywood heartthrob peak, chucking him and Goodman into the bayou with a never-sultrier Ellen Barkin for a sex-drenched neo-noir about police corruption (and, it must be noted, really good music). Easy&nbsp;wasn’t a huge hit — it grossed less than $18 million during its theatrical run — but its cult has grown over the years, affirming the words of critics like the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, who enthused, “This is one movie that lives up to its billing; it’s easy all right. Like falling off a log.”9. Raising Arizona (1987)  91%Something of a palate cleanser for the Coen brothers after the rich darkness of their previous effort, Blood Simple, 1987’s cockeyed comedy Raising Arizona&nbsp;united a motley crew of character actors to tell the tale of a well-meaning ex-con (Nicolas Cage) who hatches a plan with his police officer wife (Holly Hunter) to cure their childless condition by kidnapping a baby from a furniture magnate (Trey Wilson) who publicly jokes that his five infants are more than he knows what to do with. The kidnapping coincides with the unfortunate reappearance of Cage’s criminal associates (Goodman and William Forsythe), who complicate the situation with plans of their own — and then there’s the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse (Randall “Tex” Cobb) to contend with. Perhaps less a movie than an artfully assembled compilation of quirks, Arizona&nbsp;quickly ascended to cult classic status; as Time Out’s Geoff Andrew enthused, “Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet.”8. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)  90%Goodman’s cuddly frame and avuncular smile have made him a natural for a number of kindly characters, but he also has a unique intensity that makes him great for villains — dual gifts that were both put to effective use in 2016’s 10 Cloverfield Lane. As Howard Stambler, a mysterious doomsday prepper who saves (or maybe kidnaps) our heroine (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) after a car accident, Goodman has to play a lot of character notes: is he a loony with outlandish end-of-days beliefs and nefarious plans for his guest/captive, or does he really represent safety in a world gone wrong? From scene to scene, the audience is never quite sure, and the end result is — as Jeannette Catsoulis put it for the New York Times — “A master class on narrative pacing and carefully managed jolts.”7. Arachnophobia (1990)  93%Frank Marshall (backed here by his longtime production partner Steven Spielberg) made his directorial debut with this affectionate, cheerfully creepy tribute to classic Hollywood creature features, in which a deadly breed of spider terrorizes a small town whose residents include a lunatic exterminator (John Goodman) and, of course, a doctor with the titular phobia (Jeff Daniels). “That sound you hear in the background is the ‘ugh!’ heard round the world,” chuckled Janet Maslin of the New York Times, adding, “luckily, Arachnophobia&nbsp;will also be generating its share of boisterous, nervous laughter.”6. Barton Fink (1991)  90%Goodman has delivered more than his share of memorable supporting performances, but his work in Barton Fink&nbsp;is near the top of a distinguished list, helping anchor an early Coen brothers picture that uses the uneasy partnership between art and commerce as a backdrop for a surreal drama about sex, lies, and a shotgun-toting traveling salesman (played by Goodman, natch). Calling the end result “Gnomic, claustrophobic, hallucinatory, just plain weird,” Time’s Richard Schickel lauded it as “the kind of movie critics can soak up thousands of words analyzing and cinephiles can soak up at least three espressos arguing their way through.”5. Matinee (1992)  92%Goodman’s outsize personality was a perfect fit for 1993’s Matinee&nbsp;— not only because it lent itself well to the leading character, the William Castle-inspired film producer Lawrence Woolsey, but also because Goodman proved an excellent on-screen foil for director Joe Dante’s equally boisterous style. Sadly, Dante’s fond look back at the politics and culture of the early ‘60s — which framed Woolsey’s efforts to debut a half-man, half-ant horror movie called Mant&nbsp;against the shadow of the Cuban Missile Crisis — failed to resonate with audiences, who ignored it to the tune of a paltry $9.5 million domestic gross. But it hit a home run with critics like Jeffrey M. Anderson of the San Francisco Examiner, who called it “A riot, and Joe Dante’s most touchingly personal movie at the same time.”4. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013)  92%Goodman’s work with the Coen brothers hasn’t always translated to a ton of screen time, but his association with the duo has given him the opportunity to play some truly memorable, scene-stealing characters. Case in point: Roland Turner, the unforgettably noxious jazz artist who shares a ride to Chicago with the titular protagonist during Inside Llewyn Davis. Turner’s passing presence in the film is just one of a handful of regrettable misadventures, but as he has so often in his career, Goodman adds an expert dash of seasoning with his performance — and rounds out what the Arizona Republic’s Bill Goodykoontz called “one of the strangest yet most satisfying movie experiences of the year” and “one of those films in which you can’t really appreciate what you’ve seen until it’s over.” Concluded Goodykoontz, “You just have to trust that the trip is worth the trouble. And it is.”3. Monsters, Inc. (2001)  96%The saga of Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (Goodman), two employees of the titular kiddie-scaring company, Monsters, Inc.&nbsp;(and its belated prequel, Monsters University) vividly imagines a world in which children’s screams are the energy source that powers the secret city of Monstropolis — and one in which the monsters themselves are just 9-to-5 clock punchers with problems of their own. After meeting up in college and having some wacky academic adventures, Mike and Sulley go to work together — and ultimately discover that not only is inter-species harmony possible, but it may hold the key to their civilization’s looming energy crisis. “The analogy to our dependence on, say, oil is soon abandoned, the better to blur the distinction between abstract and concrete,” wrote Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader, pointing out that it’s “something older viewers of this 2001 animated adventure may appreciate more than younger ones.”2. The Artist (2011)  95%Given all the success he’s had with voicework, it might seem a tad ironic that one of John Goodman’s top-rated films is a silent movie. But aside from having an instantly recognizable voice, Goodman’s also been blessed with a marvelously expressive face, which made him a perfect choice for writer/director Michel Hazanavicius when casting The Artist, a Best Picture-winning romantic dramedy about a pair of silent film stars (played by Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo) whose careers — both managed by studio boss Al Zimmer (Goodman) — diverge sharply with the advent of the talkies. A somewhat unlikely box office hit, The Artist&nbsp;also earned nearly unanimous praise from critics; as Mark Rabinowitz enthused for CNN, “There is literally nothing wrong with it. I don’t have a single nit to pick, minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last.”1. Argo (2012)  96%The lion’s share of the attention for this Best Picture Oscar winner went to star and director Ben Affleck, and rightly so — but Argo&nbsp;also offered Goodman one of the many crucial supporting roles he’s enjoyed during his career: real-life Hollywood hero John Chambers, the award-winning makeup artist whose clandestine involvement was critical in assembling the phony science fiction movie whose “film crew” sneaked into Iran and rescued a crew of refugee diplomats during the 1979 hostage crisis. Offering some well-timed comic relief, Goodman and his partner Alan Arkin helped provide a safety valve for the often excruciatingly tense Iranian scenes. “The movieland satire is laid on thick, but it’s also deadly accurate,” observed Peter Rainer for the Christian Science Monitor. “Schlock has never seemed so patriotic, and Arkin and Goodman have rarely been so good.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"CBS, 20th, canceled, fast, Lionsgate, poppins, Freeform","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/08162703/John-Goodman-Recall.jpg","slug":"john-goodmans-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508953914657","title":"Rank Kurt Russell’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rank Kurt Russell's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 star.by Jeff Giles | May 3, 2017 |  CommentsWhen he strolls on the screen this weekend as Ego the Living Planet in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Kurt Russell will be bringing one of Marvel’s wackiest characters to life in the MCU — and adding another big hit to a filmography that already boasts more than a few. Over the course of a screen career that spans more than 50 years and shows no signs of slowing down, Russell’s racked up blockbusters, cult classics, and pretty much everything in between, and we knew there was no time like the present to take a fond look back at some of his brightest critical highlights.

It’s further evidence that the Irish actor’s career consists of so much more than just characters with a certain set of skills; in fact, he’s been part of a long series of critically acclaimed — and eclectic — projects. How many of your favorites match up with the critics? Let’s start the countdown and find out!10.&nbsp;Evelyn (2002)  64%Brosnan reunited with Mister Johnson director Bruce Beresford for 2002’s Evelyn, a fact-based drama about an underemployed single father in 1950s Ireland (Brosnan) whose struggle to find a steady job ends up costing him custody of his three children — and inspires him to take on the system by fighting to get them back in court. While some critics dismissed Evelyn as manipulative, well-meaning fluff, others succumbed to the undeniable pull of a well-acted, heart-tugging drama. “From any other filmmaker, Evelyn would be merely a forgettable good intention,” admitted the Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday, “but when you consider that Beresford is the man who brought us Black Robe and Breaker Morant, it approaches heartbreak.”Watch Trailer9.&nbsp;The Thomas Crown Affair (1999)  70%You’ve gotta have chutzpah to try remaking a Steve McQueen classic, so even if director John McTiernan’s 1999 update on The Thomas Crown Affair had turned out to be a complete dud, you’d have to give Pierce Brosnan credit simply for agreeing to step into the iconic tough guy’s shoes. Happily for all concerned, the new-look Crown turned out to be not only a worthwhile diversion for caper flick fans, but a relatively rare example of an action-adventure movie that isn’t overpopulated with twentysomething stars. Opined Jeffrey Overstreet for Looking Closer, “For those who still have a shred of sophistication left, and an appreciation for mind games rather than mere shock-treatment, here’s a summer movie for you.”Watch Trailer8.&nbsp;The Fourth Protocol (1987)  74%The 1980s brought us countless spy thrillers with portentous-sounding titles, starring steely countenanced, suavely accented dudes wielding pistols in pursuit of microchips, bombs, and the like, so a person could be forgiven for passing over 1987’s The Fourth Protocol in the mistaken belief that it was just another one of the many generic entries in that oft-abused genre. They’d still be missing out, however, because Protocol is an uncommonly smart 1980s spy thriller, adapted by Frederick Forsythe from his own novel and starring Brosnan and Michael Caine as, respectively, the evil Russian and the British agent who’s trying to catch him. Foreshadowing Brosnan’s cinematic future, the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson wrote, “Protocol is espionage as exhilarating as the better Bond, but with less of the winky camp. This is deadly stuff: We see just how easy atomic terrorism would be.”Watch Trailer7.&nbsp;Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)  71%It was Robin Williams who undoubtedly got most of Mrs. Doubtfire‘s laughs — and carried the movie, as well as several pounds of latex, while wearing a dress — but when considering the vast appeal of this hit 1993 comedy, we must not discount the charming, subtly bewildered work of Pierce Brosnan as Stuart “Stu” Dunmire, a guy who just wants to date Sally Field but ends up the victim of cinema’s first and only run-by fruiting. “In terms of plot, the film is rather feeble,” admitted ReelViews’ James Berardinelli. “But sometimes there’s more to a movie than story, and this is one of those rare occasions when all the other elements pull together and lift the production.”Watch Trailer6.&nbsp;Love Is All You Need (2013)  75%Bond films notwithstanding, Brosnan’s spent a significant portion of his film career taking on roles that downplay his rakish charm. But every so often he’ll sign up for a project like Love Is All You Need, director Susanne Bier’s gorgeous, souffle-light romance about the beautifully shot sparks that fly when an English widower living in Denmark (Brosnan) crosses paths with a jilted hairdresser (Trine Dyrholm). While Bier may not have been able to resist a number of rom-com cliches, the end result proved sufficiently fresh to melt most critics’ hearts, chiefly because of the seemingly effortless chemistry between Love‘s two eye-pleasing leads. “We’ve seen enough romantic comedy to know these two are destined to fall for each other,” wrote the Miami Herald’s Connie Ogle, “but Bier is that rare filmmaker who can make you wonder if there will actually be a happy ending.”Watch Trailer5.&nbsp;The Matador (2006)  75%What could an ordinary businessman and a worn-out hitman possibly have in common? In the real world, maybe not much. But in Richard Shepard’s The Matador, that unlikely-seeming setup provides the grist for a quirky, darkly funny buddy flick starring Greg Kinnear as the businessman and Brosnan as the assassin. His post-Bond work generally hasn’t been as high-profile as the films he starred in as 007, but Brosnan’s success on her majesty’s secret service has freed him up to take offbeat roles in offbeat projects, and here, critics argued that the results were richly rewarding. According to eFilmCritic’s Rob Gonsalves, “Brosnan’s work as a monster who’d like to become human, but has no idea how, is painfully funny.”Watch Trailer4.&nbsp;The Tailor of Panama (2001)  77%When you sit down to watch a John le Carré spy movie, you know you aren’t going to get a lot of the stuff we tend to depend on for our espionage thrills; gunplay, car chases, and general derring-do are downplayed in favor of literate, relatively dense plots that derive their quietly building tension from small, impeccably performed moments. The results tend not to cause much of a stir at the box office, where The Tailor of Panama failed to make a major dent, but they’re generally well-received by critics, and this is no exception: Director John Boorman’s adaptation of le Carré’s 1996 novel about a disgraced spy (Brosnan) who gets mixed up with a tailor (Geoffrey Rush) he tries to convert into an MI6 asset won praise from writers eager to absorb a smart thriller for grownups. As Peter Rainer warned for New York Magazine, “If you think the spy-thriller genre has been streamlined and spoofed and subverted until nothing new can be done to it, think again.”Watch Trailer3.&nbsp;GoldenEye (1995)  78%Years after missing out on the opportunity to play James Bond due to his Remington Steele commitments, Brosnan finally grabbed the martini glass for 1995’s GoldenEye, restoring the layer of suave menace and playful humor that many viewers felt the character had been missing for far too long. Like most Bond flicks, it was a sizable hit, but it also struck a chord with critics, most of whom pointed to Brosnan’s performance as a key component of GoldenEye‘s success. Calling him “Lean, dark and graceful,” TV Guide’s Maitland McDonagh wrote, “Brosnan wraps his perfectly calculated accent around all the standard phrases without making us hear quotation marks.”Watch Trailer2.&nbsp;Mister Johnson (1991)  82%For his follow-up to the Oscar-winning Driving Miss Daisy, director Bruce Beresford returned to matters of race, taking viewers to West Africa in the 1920s to tell the story of the titular clerk (Maynard Eziashi) of a British administrator (Brosnan). Johnson’s desperate need to fit in with white society drives him to ill-advised actions — and although they benefit Brosnan’s character greatly in the short run, Johnson tragically fails to understand that his social status will always leave him vulnerable to the whims of others. While many critics accused Beresford of taking the same unaccountably light hand with Mister Johnson‘s themes that he had with Daisy, the majority felt that the end justified the means; as Chris Hicks argued for the Deseret News, “We care about Mister Johnson even while he’s annoying. And we hope for him to acknowledge his weaknesses, even while we anticipate his downfall.”Watch Trailer1.&nbsp;The Ghost Writer (2010)  84%Brosnan stepped in front of the cameras for Roman Polanski with 2010’s The Ghost Writer, a political thriller that takes veiled shots at former British Prime Minister Tony Blair with a deep vein of black humor. Starring as a former PM whose potentially duplicitous deeds threaten to come to light during the writing of his memoirs — possibly threatening the life of his ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) — he was clearly having a good time, and that light touch helps keep Writer‘s tension from becoming overbearing. “The great thing about Brosnan’s performance is that his character’s shadow looms over the entire film,” wrote Matt Neal for the Standard, “yet Brosnan never resorts to chewing the scenery or becoming a Blair caricature.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Martial, VICE, Reality, Society, 21st, elevated, The, toy, movies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/04165519/Pierce-Brosnan-Recall.jpg","slug":"pierce-brosnans-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508956369199","title":"Zhang Yimou’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Zhang Yimou's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the best-reviewed work of the director of The Great Wall.by Jeff Giles | February 15, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend’s The Great Wall&nbsp;unites Matt Damon and Willem Dafoe as imprisoned mercenaries embroiled in a battle against monsters in ancient China — and if that plot description isn’t enough to pique your interest, it’s also the latest from director Zhang Yimou, whose esteemed filmography includes some of the most globally acclaimed features to come out of China over the last 30 years. In honor of this talented filmmaker’s return, we’re taking a fond look back at some of his brightest critical highlights — and you know what that means. It’s time for Total Recall!The Story of Qiu Ju (Qiu Ju da guan si) (1992)  86%Zhang’s films aren’t necessarily known for having a particularly light touch, but with The Story of Qiu Ju, he tried his hand at something like satire, unspooling the story (adapted from Chen Yuanbin’s novella The Wan Family’s Lawsuit) of a pregnant woman’s determined quest to obtain legal reparations for her husband after he’s kicked in the crotch by a village chief he impugned by mocking his all-daughter brood. It isn’t exactly laugh-a-minute stuff, and Zhang couched his observations on Chinese life in a quasi-documentary format in order to avoid further trouble with censors, but Qiu Ju‘s impact was still keenly felt; as Janet Maslin wrote for the New York Times, “The Story of Qiu Ju reaffirms Zhang Yimou’s stature as storyteller and sociologist extraordinaire, and as a visual artist of exceptional delicacy and insight.”Watch TrailerShanghai Triad (Yao a yao yao dao waipo qiao) (1995)  90%Seeking a bit of a breather after To Live‘s political themes landed him in hot water with Chinese authorities, Zhang opted to play things a little safer with his next feature, 1995’s Shanghai Triad — a 1930s-set period look at the criminal underbelly in the titular city over a one-week span. Although the beats of the storyline, largely focused on a gangster and his dame, weren’t anything audiences hadn’t seen before, Zhang elevated the material with his distinctive eye — and the last in a long series of performances from Gong Li, whose creative and personal relationship with the director had reached its end. The duo wouldn’t work together again for over a decade; in the meantime, wrote Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, Li “swaggers it up with a flourish” here — “a rare opportunity, given Zhang’s usual stateliness, for the serious, expressive actress to shake her booty.”Watch TrailerHouse of Flying Daggers (2004)  87%After making some more modern detours, Zhang returned to his period-piece wheelhouse with 2004’s House of Flying Daggers, a ninth-century drama about a pair of Chinese police officers (Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro) tasked with rooting out rebellion during the waning days of the Tang Dynasty. Given a handful of days to dispatch the leader of a group called the Flying Daggers, they focus on a blind dancer (Zhang Ziyi) they suspect of having ties to the insurrectionists — but find themselves tangled in intrigue as the case wears on. “This,” marveled Moira Macdonald for the Seattle Times, “is the sort of film we’re intended to wallow in, barely coming up for air — so dazzled, we barely need to breathe.”Watch TrailerThe Road Home (Wo de fu qin mu qin) (2001)  89%A decade after introducing viewers to Gong Li, Zhang was fortunate enough to make a similarly fortuitous discovery in Zhang Ziyi, whose starring role in The Road Home&nbsp;served as the first installment in a widely acclaimed and still-prolific career. Here, the two joined together to tell the story of the bumpy courtship and passionate marriage between a teacher (Zheng Hao) and a local girl in rural China — as well as their son’s journey to understanding the legacy of his parents’ love after his father passes away. “This,” wrote Chris Vognar for the Dallas Morning News, “is a film that rescues love from the world of cliché and treats it with the awakening passion it deserves.”Watch TrailerTo Live (Huo zhe) (1994)  86%After helping usher modern Chinese cinema onto the world stage — and acquiring no small amount of clout for himself as a filmmaker in the bargain — Zhang put it all on the line with 1994’s To Live, the decades-spanning story of a family (led by Ge You and Gong Li) torn apart by personal circumstance and the increasingly pervasive influence of the Chinese Communist apparatus. The film’s strong performances earned a wave of positive reviews from critics worldwide, but its critical stance against the state got it banned in China — even as it won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes. “To Live&nbsp;is a simple title,” conceded Roger Ebert, “but it conceals a universe.”Watch TrailerComing Home (2015)  89%China’s political upheaval during the Cultural Revolution had profoundly personal effects, explored to heartrending effect in Zhang’s acclaimed 2014 effort Coming Home. Working again with Gong Li, he adapted Geling Yan’s novel The Criminal Lu Yanshi, about a couple separated when the husband (Chen Daoming) is held at a labor camp; he ultimately wins release, only to find his wife (Gong) stricken with amnesia and unable to remember him. A timeless tragedy set in unique circumstances, Home&nbsp;earned the director a fresh round of hosannas from critics like the Toronto Star’s Bruce DeMara, who wrote, “Chen and Gong, two of China’s most respected actors, offer two great performances in a film about love, loss and perseverance that will nearly break your heart.”Watch TrailerNot One Less (2000)  96%In marked contrast to many of his better-known films, Not One Less finds Zhang telling a story set in the modern era — yet retaining the sharp sociopolitical awareness that elevates much of his best work. In another change of pace, Zhang employed largely untrained actors, many playing thinly altered versions of themselves, to tell the story of a young substitute teacher (Wei Minzhi) charged with a class’s welfare for a month. If you know anything about Zhang’s oeuvre, it’s spoiling nothing to note that things take some dark and difficult turns — or that critics, by and large, were impressed. “With Not One Less,” wrote the Village Voice’s Leslie Camhi, “Zhang Yimou has fashioned what feels like an uncannily accurate portrait of a culture where Communist ideology has vanished like a brief dream, as traditional community values clash with the burgeoning cult of money.”Watch TrailerHero (2004)  94%Zhang earned his fourth Academy Award nomination for this 2002 period drama, starring Jet Li in a lavishly filmed period epic inspired by the story of an attempt on the King of Qin’s life in 227 BC. A hugely expensive (and hugely successful) record-breaking release in China, Hero&nbsp;earned further accolades — and box-office receipts — during its delayed American run, as much for its patiently told saga as for its artfully arranged action. “The result,” wrote Anthony Lane for the New Yorker, “is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture.”Watch TrailerRaise the Red Lantern (Da hong deng long gao gao gua) (1992)  96%Gong Li continued to serve as Zhang’s muse with Raise the Red Lantern, another period drama — set in the China of the 1920s — that used entrenched social and gender dynamics to fuel a gorgeously filmed collision between expectation and reality, dreams and despair. The story focuses on a young concubine (Gong) whose arrival at her new husband’s estate sparks a series of events that will ultimately pit the women of the house against one another in a conflict no one — except the viewer — can truly win. The end result, wrote John Hartl for Film.com, is “A near-perfect movie that often recalls the visual purity and intensity of silent films.”Watch TrailerJu Dou (1990)  100%After winning the Berlin Film Festival’s Golden Bear with Red Sorghum, Zhang returned to the world cinema stage with 1990’s Ju Dou, which earned the distinction of becoming the first Chinese release to earn a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Reuniting with Gong Li, Zhang took viewers to rural China in the early 1990s, where a traveling salesman (Li Baotian) returns to his uncle’s home and discovers the older man — who has a reputation for beating his wives to death — has remarried. Naturally, the pair fall in love, setting in motion a web of domestic intrigue that seems destined from the outset to end in tragedy — and add up to what Chris Hicks of the Deseret News called “an emotionally fulfilling and viscerally rewarding adult film.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Summer, Festival, Set, dceu, Paramount","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15155442/Zhang-Yimou-Total-Recall.jpg","slug":"zhang-yimous-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508956346665","title":"Elizabeth Banks’ 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Elizabeth Banks' 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Power Rangers star.by Jeff Giles | March 22, 2017 |  CommentsIt takes a certain amount of chutzpah to sign up for a sci-fi action thriller in which you’ll pursue something called a Zeo Crystal while wearing a form-fitting green shell — which is exactly what Elizabeth Banks is up to in this weekend’s Power Rangers movie. In honor of Banks’ bravery, we decided to dedicate this week’s feature to a fond look back at some of the brighter highlights from her filmography, and you know what that means…it’s time for Total Recall!10. Lovely, Still (2010)  73%Elizabeth Banks is no stranger to big-budget filmmaking, but even after breaking through to the A list, she’s continued to seek out parts in smaller-scale productions. Case in point: 2010’s Lovely, Still, in which she plays a woman whose neighbor (Martin Landau) pursues a relationship with her mother (Ellen Burstyn) — thanks in part to some encouragement from his boss (Adam Scott). It’s the type of setup that often leads to overly aggressive tugs at the heartstrings, but critics credited debuting writer-director Nik Fackler with largely resisting cheap sentiment while imparting poignant observations on aging and the human condition. As Prairie Miller wrote for NewsBlaze, “It was Bette Davis who said ‘growing old ain’t for sissies.’ And this film reiterates that notion from which no human being lucky enough to survive that long is exempt, framing old age as perhaps the greatest superhero screen manifestation of all.”Watch Trailer9. Invincible (2006)  72%He isn’t a household name, but Vince Papale is a legend among hardcore football fans — particularly in Philadelphia, where he overcame the odds to earn a spot on the Eagles’ roster and became one of the oldest rookies in the history of the NFL — as well as a living embodiment of the team’s scrappy, blue-collar image. That legend was brought to life in 2006’s Invincible, starring Mark Wahlberg as Papale, Banks as his eventual wife Janet, and Greg Kinnear as Eagles coach Dick Vermeil. The movie’s fairly boilerplate arc — fully embraced by the Disney execs bankrolling the film — might have prompted a few eyerolls from more cynical critics, but the end result still enjoyed a sweaty leg up on the many inspirational sports dramas in theaters at the time. “There’s a sugar coating to the way Papale’s story unfolds,” admitted the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips, “but not so much that you’ll spoil your dinner.”Watch Trailer8. Definitely, Maybe (2008)  70%A romantic comedy with a twist, Definitely, Maybe&nbsp;finds its protagonist looking back on the love affair that led to marriage and a child — by telling the story to his young daughter, with some names changed and facts adjusted, while in the midst of a divorce. Thanks in part to those narrative curveballs, most critics applauded Maybe&nbsp;— and even if it still ultimately traced a rather familiar arc, it was difficult to find too much fault with a resolutely charming production that made smart use of a likable ensemble cast that included Banks, Ryan Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz. “As the movie is about a character’s growing into his own truth rather than discovering some preordained truth, Definitely, Maybe&nbsp;is hard to outguess,” wrote Mick LaSalle for the San Francisco Chronicle. “For once in a romantic comedy, you won’t be able to tell after five minutes who will end up together.”Watch Trailer7. Seabiscuit (2003)  77%The horse took top billing, but Banks played a pivotal role in Gary Ross’ Oscar-nominated biopic about the Depression-era thoroughbred racing sensation, appearing as Marcela Zabala, whose wedding to Charles S. Howard (Jeff Bridges) turns Howard’s life around before he enters the horse-racing world. Part of an ensemble that also included Chris Cooper as expert trainer Tom Smith and Tobey Maguire as scrappy jockey Red Pollard, Banks helped round out the cast responsible for one of the year’s bigger critical and commercial successes, and an inspirational drama that managed to transcend its easily predictable (albeit fact-based) arc. “[It] may be too airbrushed for its own good,” wrote David Ansen for Newsweek, “but in the end nothing can stop this story from putting a lump in your throat.”Watch Trailer6. Role Models (2008)  77%Strictly speaking, the world probably didn’t need yet another comedy about grown men acting like children when Role Models&nbsp;came along — yet there’s no denying Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott made the most of this 2008 comedy’s fairly standard story about a couple of knuckleheads sentenced to community service. Along those lines, there’s certainly been no shortage of disapproving girlfriend roles in these movies over the years, and it’s a part that doesn’t necessarily call for someone with Banks’ estimable talent — but her presence brought a little extra depth to the movie, not to mention added dimension to what could have been a shrewish one-note character. “A formulaic movie can be lifted out of its built-in rut by making it look like it invented the formula,” argued Dave White for Movies.com. “Almost everything works here.”Watch Trailer5. Pitch Perfect (2012)  81%Loosely inspired by author Mickey Rapkin’s nonfiction look at the collegiate a cappella circuit, 2012’s Pitch Perfect&nbsp;raked in more than $115 million — and Banks, who co-produced and played a small part as competition commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden, took on an even more impactful role for the sequel, making her feature directorial debut with Pitch Perfect 2. Critics weren’t quite as entranced by the second installment, which reunited much of the original cast (including Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson) while adding new arrivals like Hailee Steinfeld, but it made even more money, guaranteeing a Pitch Perfect 3&nbsp;— and earning the praise of critics like Tony Hicks of the San Jose Mercury News, who wrote, “Pitch Perfect 2 actually is more enjoyable than the original. First-time director Elizabeth Banks manages to move the story forward and wrap it up nicely without killing the concept.”Watch Trailer4. The Hunger Games (2012)  84%The blockbuster adaptations of Suzanne Collins’ bestselling Hunger Games&nbsp;books arrived at a moment in which a flood of YA novels were being made into movies, but this saga differentiated itself on a number of key fronts — including acting, thanks to a powerfully talented cast that included Jennifer Lawrence in the central role and a supporting ensemble that included Banks (as the outlandishly garbed Effie Trinket), Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, and Stanley Tucci. Acting under garish makeup and a series of distracting wigs, Banks acquitted herself admirably — and saw her character take on an expanded role in the penultimate film, Mockingjay Part 1. “Book’s good. Movie’s better,” wrote the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr after the second installment, Catching Fire. “Wait, what?”Watch Trailer3. The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)  85%Technically, Judd Apatow’s The 40 Year-Old Virgin&nbsp;didn’t feature every comedy star to come out of the woodwork over the next decade — but watching the Steve Carell-led hit now, it can definitely feel that way. Banks shows up here in a supporting role as Beth, the bookstore employee whose flirty banter with Carell’s sexually inexperienced protagonist leads to some unexpectedly raunchy shenanigans — and making her mark in the midst of an expertly assembled ensemble that also included Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Jane Lynch, Kat Dennings, and Kevin Hart. “If you’re looking for a successor to There’s Something About Mary&nbsp;and American Pie, look no further. It has arrived,” decreed James Berardinelli for ReelViews. “And, if I may be so bold, this is more enjoyable than either of them.”Watch Trailer2. Slither (2006)  86%There’s nothing like a good creature feature — at least partly because solidly entertaining entries in the genre can seem like they’re so few and far between. Years before his work on Guardians of the Galaxy gave him name recognition with mainstream audiences, writer-director James Gunn wowed genre fans with Slither, a smartly written thriller about a car salesman (Michael Rooker) who becomes infected with a sluglike alien and passes it along to his mistress (Brenda James) before beginning his final transformation — and setting his sights on his wife (Banks), who’s turned to the local sheriff (Nathan Fillion) for help. If this sort of thing is your bag, you’ll find Slither&nbsp;hard to resist — and even if it isn’t, you may be compelled to agree with the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum, who wrote, “Gross-out horror comedy is my least favorite genre, but this movie’s so skillful I have to take my hat off to it.”Watch Trailer1. Love &amp; Mercy (2015)  89%The Brian Wilson biopic Love and Mercy&nbsp;tells the story of the mercurial Beach Boys co-founder’s often tortured journey, but it’s also a love story — one poised on the fulcrum of Wilson’s relationship with Melinda Ledbetter, who entered his life in 1986 and was part of the lengthy process of getting Wilson away from controversial therapist Dr. Eugene Landy. And although director Bill Pohlad’s film earned a lot of attention for the way it divided Wilson’s life into two discrete arcs — one in which he’s played by Paul Dano, and another starring John Cusack — Banks shouldered a lot of responsibility with her performance as Ledbetter; for the movie to work as more than a standard redemption story, the people on screen needed to feel more like their real-life counterparts than characters. “Love &amp; Mercy&nbsp;might not go as deep, or as dark, as it could,” admitted the AP’s Lindsey Bahr, “but it’s a commanding and artful film, that’s full of excellent and worthy performances whether you’re a student of Brian Wilson or just a curious tourist.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"animated, Holidays, spanish, hidden, Studios","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/22174115/Banks.jpg","slug":"elizabeth-banks-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508956361004","title":"Hugh Jackman’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Hugh Jackman's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Logan star.by Jeff Giles | March 1, 2017 |  CommentsAfter nearly 20 years and a slew of X-Men&nbsp;franchise installments, Hugh Jackman&nbsp;walked away from Wolverine (presumably) with this past weekend’s Logan. In celebration of his impressive run as one of comics’ most popular characters, we decided to devote this week’s list to a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from a wonderfully eclectic filmography that looks like it’s only begun to tap into his prodigious potential. Snikt! It’s time for Total Recall!10. Real Steel (2011)  60%Looking at its premise on paper — giant robots boxing! — you might expect Real Steel&nbsp;would be the sort of critic-proof flick that takes a tumble on the Tomatometer while luring action enthusiasts to the cineplex in blockbuster-sized droves. The reality, however, was surprisingly complex; it’s actually a family drama with sci-fi overtones, starring Hugh Jackman as a washed-up boxer who becomes a promoter after robot boxers take over, and Dakota Goyo as the estranged son who helps him build a pugilistic machine that’ll rule the ring. Laced with enough grit to keep from becoming a total CGI fest while still making room for a handful of adrenaline-inducing set pieces, Steel&nbsp;earned a somewhat muted response from audiences, who turned out in respectable but not spectacular numbers — and a surprising amount of admiration from critics like NPR’s Linda Holmes, who argued, “Real Steel&nbsp;is ridiculous, but it is not dispiriting. If you’re going to make this movie, it should be made just this way, with commitment, verve and a complete disregard for physics, robotics and environmentalism.”Watch Trailer9. Les Misérables (2012)  70%Round up a bunch of dramatic actors, hand them a classic musical, and ask them to sing — live in front of the camera, no less — and if nothing else, you’re bound to get points for audacity. Les Miserables director Tom Hooper courted disaster with this approach to his 2012 adaptation of the Broadway favorite, but emerged largely unscathed, winning a pile of Golden Globes and picking up eight Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) while racking up more than $440 million in worldwide grosses. Not bad for yet another version of a story just about everyone had already seen, and although a number of critics were unmoved by the movie’s unabashed efforts to wring tears from the audience, the majority found all that huge drama impossible to resist. An acknowledged singing talent in a cast notably short on them, Jackman earned an Academy Award nomination for his work as the long-suffering Jean Valjean — but Glenn Kenny of MSN Movies thought he “should get a Nobel Prize for the way he carries pretty much the whole undertaking on his shoulders, so protean and virile is his singing and acting throughout.”Watch Trailer8. The Wolverine (2013)  71%The homicidal streak that makes Wolverine such a fascinating character in the comics is also what’s made him relatively problematic on the big screen, and its PG-13 neutering is part of what rendered Hugh Jackman’s previous solo outing as the clawed superhero, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, such a disappointment for longtime fans. Director James Mangold had the benefit of lowered expectations when it came time to helm the follow-up, The Wolverine, but the end result — which drew inspiration from a beloved ‘80s comics story that sent the character to Japan — earned more than a slow clap from critics; as Mick LaSalle enthused for the San Francisco Chronicle, “Somewhere along the line somebody must have had a crazy idea, that The Wolverine required a decent script, and shouldn’t rely only on action, audience goodwill and the sight of Hugh Jackman with his shirt off. The team delivers with this one.”Watch Trailer7. The Prestige (2006)  76%After Batman Begins hit big, Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale had their pick of projects to choose from — and they opted to reunite for The Prestige, a film Nolan had been eyeing since his post-Memento days. In this adaptation of the Christopher Priest novel, Bale stars opposite Jackman in the tale of two early 20th century magicians driven to dangerous lengths in their personal and professional feud. With a plot hinging on a series of progressively more unpredictable twists and turns, The Prestige was bound to provoke a number of divergent responses, but with gross receipts over $100 million and a Certified Fresh 76 percent Tomatometer, it packed enough of a suspenseful flourish to earn praise from scribes such as Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, who observed, “there are nifty tricks galore up the sumptuous sleeve of this offbeat and wildly entertaining thriller.”Watch Trailer6. Eddie The Eagle (2016)  82%An inspirational sports dramedy about a Winter Olympics hopeful with slim chances of success and a coach who also happens to be a disgraced former competitor, Eddie the Eagle&nbsp;has some obvious similarities to Cool Runnings&nbsp;— and in fact its protagonist, real-life British ski jumper Eddie “the Eagle” Edwards, competed at the same Olympics that hosted Runnings‘ Jamaican bobsled team. But no sports movie is purely original anyway, and beyond those undeniable similarities to stories we’ve heard before, this good-natured dramatization of Edwards’ story — starring Taron Egerton in the title role and Jackman as his hard-drinking coach Bronson Peary — has no shortage of individual charm. “A tad sugary sweet,” admitted the Toronto Sun’s Liz Braun, “but thanks to the performances of Hugh Jackman and Taron Egerton, the end result is a family film that’s highly entertaining.”Watch Trailer5. X-Men (2000)  82%Today, Hugh Jackman is pretty much synonymous with the role of Wolverine, but he wasn’t Bryan Singer’s first — or second — choice for the part; in fact, it only fell to him after Russell Crowe’s salary demands and Dougray Scott’s scheduling conflicts kept both of them from bringing the clawed, cigar-chomping antihero to the screen. Jackman, an unknown at the time, represented a bit of a gamble for the long-in-development X-Men&nbsp;adaptation, but with an ensemble cast that included Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Halle Berry as Storm, the summer of 2000 brought Marvel’s favorite mutants to the big screen in style, racking up almost $300 million in worldwide grosses and a healthy stack of positive reviews from critics like New York Magazine’s Peter Rainer, who deemed it “A rarity: a comic-book movie with a satisfying cinematic design and protagonists you want to watch.”Watch Trailer4. Prisoners (2013)  81%How far would you go to find — or find justice for — your child? That dark dilemma sits at the heart of Denis Villeneuve’s Prisoners, a taut 2013 drama starring Jackman as Keller Dover, a father frantic with worry after his daughter disappears. When the police release their first suspect, Dover abducts the man (Paul Dano) and holds him captive, intent on gathering information by any means necessary — even though his prisoner has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old and might not even be responsible for the crime. Surrounded by a stellar cast that included Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, Jackman anchored this unflinching descent into every parent’s nightmare with the palpable anguish needed to make the story tick. “The plot raises complicated moral questions about how far an anguished person will go for the love of a child,” wrote Claudia Puig for USA Today. “At the same time, it sets up an intricate, horrifying mystery with breathtaking skill.”Watch Trailer3. X2: X-Men United (2003)  85%Given the long odds it faced just getting to the screen, let alone pulling off the transition so successfully, it seemed altogether unlikely that X-Men’s inevitable sequel would be able to achieve the same standard, let alone exceed it – but that’s exactly what 2003’s X2: X-Men United&nbsp;did, both at the box office, where it grossed over $400 million, and among critics, who praised it even more highly than its predecessor. This was, appropriately, accomplished two ways: One, the screenplay satisfied critics and longtime fans by tackling the comic’s long-running sociological themes, most explicitly the fear of “outside” elements (in this case, sexy super-powered mutants) and how that fear is channeled by xenophobic authority figures; two, the sequel ramped up the original’s gee-whiz factor by introducing characters like the teleporting, prehensile-tailed Nightcrawler – and daring to tease at the Marvel title’s Phoenix storyline, one of the most beloved, brain-bending plots in the publisher’s history. The result was a film that remains both a fan favorite and a critical benchmark for writers like Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who lauded X2&nbsp;as “bigger and more ambitious in every respect, from its action and visceral qualities to its themes.”Watch Trailer2. X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)  90%Unlike the majority of film franchises that reboot themselves with younger casts, the X-Men&nbsp;series has the built-in advantage of drawing from comics mythology that makes room for time travel as well as superhumanly slow-aging mutants — which is how Jackman found himself called upon to once again do battle as Wolverine in X-Men: Days of Future Past. The plot, which involves Wolverine going back in time to prevent Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) from carrying out a political assassination that spells certain doom for mutantkind, includes all manner of tangled threads that could have sent the movie tumbling into the weeds, but director Bryan Singer tied it all nimbly together in his triumphant return to helming the franchise, uniting the OG X-Men with their younger counterparts in a blockbuster extravaganza that even managed to retcon the much-maligned X-Men: The Last Stand&nbsp;out of the official timeline. “Everything is of a piece,” wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, “and it’s dazzling.”Watch Trailer1. Logan (2017)  93%Third time’s the charm. After whiffing on their first opportunity to give Wolverine a compelling solo outing with the calamitous Origins, then inching a little closer to snikt-worthy cinema with The Wolverine, Fox finally gave fans a properly grim and gritty third installment. Logan&nbsp;peers into a dark future for our favorite mutants, with most of the X-Men dead after a mysterious tragedy and Wolverine reduced to working as a driver while caring for an ailing Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and saving up enough money to buy a boat and sail off into aquatic exile. Fate has less peaceful plans for our heroes, of course; in short order, Logan finds himself embroiled in a dangerous plot involving a mysterious lab and a young girl on the run (Dafne Keen). It’s a classic Wolverine caper, loosely inspired by the Old Man Logan&nbsp;comics arc, and delivered with all the hard-hitting, hard-R panache fans waited patiently to see — not to mention the vast majority of critics. “Entertaining as they are, Marvel movies aren’t expected to be this mature, this dark or this human,” wrote Colin Covert for the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “This is a bold, coherent story inspired by a comic book, not slavishly based on it.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"thriller, GoT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/28150122/Hugh-Jackman-Recall.jpg","slug":"total-recall-hugh-jackmans-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959026486","title":"Sigourney Weaver’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sigourney Weaver's 10 Best MoviesWe look back at the best-reviewed work of the A Monster Calls star.by Jeff Giles | January 4, 2017 |  CommentsSigourney Weaver’s distinguished career includes three Oscar nominations, more than $2 billion in lifetime grosses, and roles in a pair of James Cameron-helmed sci-fi franchises — not to mention an impressively eclectic array of films that runs the gamut from serious dramas to ribald comedies and back again. This weekend, she’s back on the big screen with A Monster Calls, which expands into wide release, so we decided to pay tribute by taking a fond look back at some of her brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Working Girl (1988)  84%Career advancement often has as much to do with who you know — and your gender — as the quality of your work. It’s a sad fact that’s handled with a light touch in Mike Nichols’ Working Girl, a sharply written, solidly cast romantic comedy starring Melanie Griffith as a secretary whose acumen for investment banking is ignored at her firm because she didn’t go to the right school. Using an injury to her boss (Sigourney Weaver) as an opportunity to make her move, she proves her hidden potential — while falling in love, of course, with an executive (Harrison Ford) who doesn’t know she’s “just a secretary.” Portions of the plot seem dated now, but in its day, Working Girl offered audiences a bright blend of screwball comedy and social commentary. As Rita Kempley wrote for the Washington Post, “This scrumptious romantic comedy with its blithe cast is as easy to watch as swirling ball gowns and dancing feet. But oh me, oh my, how much more demanding it is to be a fairy tale heroine these days.”Watch Trailer9. Death and the Maiden (1995)  82%Rich with ambiguity, dark secrets, the looming threat of violence, and a hint of domestic dischord, Ariel Dorfman’s play Death and the Maiden&nbsp;couldn’t have been better suited for the Roman Polanski treatment if Polanski had written it himself. Starring Sigourney Weaver as Paulina Escobar, a woman whose haunting memories of imprisonment and rape are reawakened when her husband (Stuart Wilson) brings home a man she believes tortured her (Ben Kingsley), Maiden&nbsp;united one of Polanski’s strongest casts with some of his most familiar themes. Though it wasn’t one of his biggest financial successes, it signaled a critical return to form after the comparative disappointment of 1992’s Bitter Moon; Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle was one of the writers who offered praise, calling Death and the Maiden “a streamlined razor-ride of a movie: taut, riveting, and a psychological horror show that will leave nail-marks in your palms for days afterwards.”Watch Trailer8. Cedar Rapids (2011)  86%Nobody plays an adorable nerd with unsuspected emotional depth quite like Ed Helms — which made him the ideal leading man for 2011’s Cedar Rapids, a tender comedy about a naive insurance agent who’s called into duty at the last minute when he’s asked to head out to the “big city” and represent his company at the all-important regional convention. As Helms’ girlfriend back home, Weaver didn’t get to join in any of the memorable, John C. Reilly-assisted debauchery that follows, but their relationship helped add poignant overtones to a film that Tom Long of the Detroit News described by saying, “Considering it has to do with infidelity, bribery, drugs, drinking, loutish behavior, fraud and prostitution, Cedar Rapids is really kind of a sweet movie.”Watch Trailer7. The Year of Living Dangerously (1983)  88%Starring Mel Gibson as a journalist whose hunger for a big story leads him into the heart of an Indonesian coup — and earns him a busted eye in the process — 1983’s The Year of Living Dangerously&nbsp;reunited Gibson with his Gallipoli&nbsp;director Peter Weir, earned Linda Hunt an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (and for good reason: She played a half-Chinese dwarf named Billy Kwan), and gave Weaver the chance to have some high-stakes romance in an impeccably crafted war drama inspired by true events. “The Year of Living Dangerously&nbsp;is a flawed film,” wrote Dan Jardine of the Apollo Guide, “but it is richly textured and imbued with enough emotional and intellectual subtlety to make it a rewarding experience.”Watch Trailer6. Eyewitness (1981)  75%It isn’t especially well-remembered today, despite a terrific cast that includes Morgan Freeman as a police lieutenant embroiled in a murder case that’s also being investigated by a TV reporter (Sigourney Weaver) and a janitor (William Hurt), but with that killer cast and a bit of expert late-period direction from Bullitt director Peter Yates, 1981’s Eyewitness is the sort of perfectly serviceable cat-and-mouse mystery thriller that’ll help you pass a painless 103 minutes on your next lazy Saturday afternoon. “Every scene develops characters,” mused Roger Ebert. “And they’re developed in such offbeat fidelity to the way people do behave that we get all the more involved in the mystery, just because, for once, we halfway believe it could really be happening.”Watch Trailer5. Galaxy Quest (1999)  90%Sporting a blonde wig alongside Tim Allen and a heavily made-up Alan Rickman, Weaver helped parody the conventions of the sci-fi genre — as well as, you know, sci-fi conventions&nbsp;— in 1999’s Galaxy Quest, which sends the washed-up cast of a long-canceled TV show on a real-life space adventure. Funny and affectionate, Quest&nbsp;scored a $90 million box office hit while also earning accolades from critics like Film Threat’s Chris Gore, who called it “A hilarious spoof of Trek&nbsp;and Trek&nbsp;fandom” before pointing out, “While Galaxy Quest&nbsp;could have easily taken potshots at geeks, rather the film acts as more of a celebration of these sometimes misguided devotees.”Watch Trailer4. Dave (1993)  95%Dave&nbsp;is nothing if not laughably unrealistic — a temp agency owner (Kevin Kline) stands in for the President, hires an accountant to fix the federal budget, and dreams up a jobs bill that will provide work for anyone who wants it, making the First Lady (Weaver) fall for him along the way — but even in the go-go 1990s, it appealed to our best and brightest hopes for our elected leaders, and in today’s vituperative political climate, it’s more of a funny, warm ‘n’ cuddly fable than ever. Janet Maslin of the New York Times was certainly charmed during its original release, admitting that “In spite of this sogginess, and despite a self-congratulatory, do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave, this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.”Watch Trailer3. Ghostbusters (1984 Original) (1984)  97%No film makes it to the screen as it’s originally envisioned by its writers, but Ghostbusters took a particularly circuitous journey: Originally, Dan Aykroyd planned to assemble it as a project for himself and John Belushi, with all sorts of big-budget shenanigans, and supporting roles for Eddie Murphy and John Candy. It was only after a ground-up rewrite by Aykroyd and Harold Ramis that Ghostbusters became the box office behemoth it was destined to be, racking up an an astounding $238 million tally throughout 1984 and 1985 — and a brilliant ensemble comedy offering memorable characters and quotable lines to a cast that included Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Rick Moranis, and (of course) Weaver as Dana Barrett, the concert cellist whose refrigerator happens to be a demonic gateway. Shrugged the Guardian’s Andrew Pulver, “What’s not to like?”Watch Trailer2. Alien (1979)  98%Weaver’s first leading role in a film turned out to be the one that would stick with her for decades: Ellen Ripley, the astronaut whose close-quarters encounter with a frighteningly smart (and lethal) space creature presages a centuries-long war for the fate of the human race. But as deliberately as it teased at the edges of a broader mythology, Alien&nbsp;also worked as a gripping, gleefully inventive standalone sci-fi action thriller. Calling it “A haunted-house movie set in space,” Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir wrote that it “also has a profoundly existentialist undertow that makes it feel like a film noir — the other genre to feature a slithery, sexualized monster as its classic villain.”Watch Trailer1. Aliens (1986)  97%It seems absurd now, but for a time, execs at 20th Century Fox weren’t interested in a sequel to Ridley Scott’s Alien&nbsp;— they didn’t think it had been profitable enough to justify a second chapter — and even after James Cameron’s persistence earned Aliens a green light, a pay dispute between Sigourney Weaver and the studio almost threw the whole thing off the rails. And even after it officially got started, the production had more than its share of bumps in the road; everything from on-set strife to the sequel’s tonal shift (“more terror, less horror,” to paraphrase Cameron) had the potential to render Aliens&nbsp;just another unnecessary sequel. The end result, of course, was quite the opposite: Ripley’s action-packed return captivated audiences, dominating the box office for a solid month, and earned a near perfect score from critics, who showered it with praise as both a terrific follow-up (Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader said it “surpasses the original,” while Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson called it “everything a sequel should be”) and a solid chunk of sci-fi in its own right (Empire Magazine’s Ian Nathan declared it “truly great cinema”).Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Red, Network, political, History, screen, HBO, Go, mutant, BBC, halloween, Britbox, nightmare, Stephen, lord, Shondaland","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Sigourney-Weaver.jpg","slug":"sigourney-weavers-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508958996788","title":"Tom Hardy’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tom Hardy's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at the best-reviewed work of the Taboo Star.by Jeff Giles | January 6, 2017 |  CommentsThough he made his debut over a decade and a half ago in the celebrated&nbsp;HBO war miniseries Band of Brothers, Tom Hardy has truly broken out&nbsp;over the past few years, making a name for himself in major blockbusters and smaller indies alike. This weekend, he’ll anchor a BBC miniseries called Taboo, which will subsequently air in the U.S. on FX on January 10. It’s a period drama about a London man who returns home from Africa in 1814 to take charge of his late father’s shipping business amid a swirl of dark conspiracy, and it provides Hardy with another complex role to sink his teeth into. With that in mind, we thought it would be appropriate to take an appreciative look at some of the brightest critical highlights from his impressive filmography.10. London Road (2016)  77%While Tom Hardy is best known for a handful of high-profile roles, his filmography is far more eclectic than his blockbuster projects might suggest, and 2016’s London Road&nbsp;is a fine example of just how far afield he’s gone when picking scripts. Part real-life murder mystery, part musical (yes, really), director&nbsp;Rufus Norris’ look at the way a series of murders affected a British community blends jarringly disparate elements into an utterly memorable whole — and enlists the services of stars like Hardy, whose appearance highlights rarely tapped areas of his range. As Dave Calhoun wrote for Time Out, the film adds up to “An exciting, unsettling experience blessed with imagination and compassion.”Watch Trailer9. Layer Cake (2005)  80%It sounds sweet, but Matthew Vaughn’s Layer Cake is anything but — it’s actually a pitch-black morality play about a successful drug dealer (Daniel Craig) who plans to retire from the business without tipping off his powerful supplier (Kenneth Cranham), partly with the assistance of a science-savvy young associate (Hardy). It’s all for naught, of course, and he soon finds himself needing to stay one step ahead from a growing list of enemies intent on doing him in before he can walk away from the business. “Vaughn’s film falls short of Goodfellas,” argued Kyle Smith of the New York Post, “but thanks to his ability to organize a complex story and bold, color-drenched photography by Ben Davis, Layer Cake is a cocked fist of a movie, impossible to ignore.”Watch Trailer8. Warrior (2011)  83%After countless entries — some of them classics — how do you add something new to the professional fighting movie genre in the 21st century? Well, you probably can’t, but if you’re going to add to the list, it definitely helps if you step into the ring with a cast that includes Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte, all of whom answered the bell for director Gavin O’Connor’s Warrior. Starring Hardy and Edgerton as brothers whose separate quests for redemption put them on a collision course that can only be settled by beating people to bloody pulps, it made unlikely believers out of critics who’d seen more than their share of this kind of story — including Roger Ebert, who mused, “This is a rare fight movie in which we don’t want to see either fighter lose.”Watch Trailer7. The Revenant (2015)  78%Hardy was overshadowed here by Leonardo DiCaprio’s ferociously committed performance — and arguably also by a bear — but any old-fashioned revenge quest is only as good as its villain, and as the loathsome John Fitzgerald, Hardy gave DiCaprio’s Hugh Glass a burning need to drag his battered body across the American frontier. One of 2015’s more grueling dramas, Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s The Revenant&nbsp;was also among its most critically acclaimed; as Brian Tallerico argued for RogerEbert.com, “You don’t just watch The Revenant, you experience it. You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little more grateful for the creature comforts of your life.”Watch Trailer6. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)  83%Few novelists have ever been able to match the cerebral layers that John le Carré applied to his take on the spy thriller, and adapting his work for the screen has always been a daunting task, particularly given that he operated in a genre that’s tended to prize action over intelligence. But director Tomas Alfredson (working from an adaptation written by Bridget O’Connor and Peter Straughan) proved himself more than up to the task with this 2011 version of the author’s 1974 classic Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, starring Gary Oldman as a retired spy brought back into active duty to investigate some troubling claims made by a defected MI6 operative (Hardy). Cool-tempered and whip-smart, this Tailor brought the book satisfyingly to life for critics like NPR’s Ella Taylor, who wrote, “Alfredson offers no concessions to hindsight, no lessons for today. Instead, he’s kept faith with le Carré’s bleak, romantically elegiac vision of a moment in 20th century history at once glorious and doomed.”Watch Trailer5. Inception (2010)  87%Hardy’s marvelously committed performance in Bronson put him on the radar for a number of new fans, but it was his appearance in Christopher Nolan’s Inception the following year that announced his arrival into the blockbuster ranks. Part of a large ensemble cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Ellen Page, Hardy played Eames, a member of the team of “extractors” headed up by DiCaprio’s character whose unique method of identity theft involves burrowing into dreams and impersonating people the dreamer trusts. It’s heady sci-fi stuff, punctuated with thrilling set pieces and impressive visuals, and topped off with an ending that viewers are still arguing over years later. “Inception is that rare film that can be enjoyed on superficial and progressively deeper levels,” wrote an admiring Ann Hornaday for the Washington Post. “[It’s] a feat that uncannily mimics the mind-bending journey its protagonist takes.”Watch Trailer4. The Dark Knight Rises (2012)  87%The Dark Knight Rises had a tough act to follow in The Dark Knight, and a fair portion of that burden fell on Hardy’s performance as the movie’s villain, the masked terrorist known as Bane. Forced to act behind a facemask and under the shadow of Heath Ledger’s trilogy-defining turn as the Joker in The Dark Knight, Hardy put his own stamp on the series — and, with some bone-crunching combat in the movie’s big fight scene, on Christian Bale’s Batman. “Give Hardy credit,” insisted Dann Gire for the Daily Herald, “for supplying Bane with plenty of conviction and gravitas in a movie that, frankly, is less about actors than knockout set pieces captured in eyeball-popping spectacles.”Watch Trailer3. The Drop (2014)  89%There have been so many gritty neighborhood crime dramas at this point that narrative twists are few and far between, and the success or failure of a movie like The Drop — directed by Michaël R. Roskam from a Dennis Lehane screenplay — rests more heavily on its stars than most. Happily for Roskam, he hit paydirt with his leading men, casting Hardy as a bartender caught up in an organized crime operation run by his cousin (James Gandolfini in his final film performance) and surrounding them with a supporting cast that included Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts. “With actors as interesting as Hardy, Gandolfini and Rapace,” observed Michael Phillips for the Chicago Tribune, “at least the cliches in The Drop have a fighting chance of holding your attention alongside the odd severed limb.”Watch Trailer2. Locke (2014)  91%It takes place entirely in a moving car, and the camera rarely even leaves his face, yet Locke is as minute-by-minute gripping as any classic action thriller — and none of it would work without the mesmerizing work Hardy delivers in the title role. Starring as a man speeding to a fateful destination while caught between life-altering professional and personal crises, Hardy runs the emotional gamut from pleading to outraged over the course of the movie, and is never less than riveting; as Ty Burr wrote for the Boston Globe, “Hardy rises to the gimmick and grounds Locke with a performance as watchably charismatic as it is minimalist. You can’t take your eyes off him — which is fortunate since there’s no one else there.”Watch Trailer1. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)  97%Hollywood’s franchise hunger has reached the point where any level of cynicism regarding a sequel, reboot, or reimagining is defensible, and given that it had been 30 years since the last Mad Max installment, one could be forgiven for approaching this Hardy-led continuation of the saga with a somewhat jaundiced eye. But all that time away from the franchise clearly gave director/co-writer George Miller plenty of ideas, because Fury Road is that rarest of blockbuster beasts: an action thriller that isn’t content to merely string together set pieces. In fact, it’s a surprisingly thoughtful film, one whose message is afforded equal importance alongside epic action sequences arranged with balletic, eye-popping grace. Amidst all this, Hardy’s Max Rockatansky remains a man of few words – in fact, he spends a good deal of the film with a mask covering his mouth – but alongside co-star Charlize Theron, he grounds the movie’s gonzo outbursts with palpable human emotion. “Believe all the hype,” cautioned Christy Lemire. “This movie will melt your face off.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"and, YouTube, Netflix, Max, Diego, San, history, Fox, book, Exclusive, Plus","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tom-hardys-best-movies.jpg","slug":"tom-hardys-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959067448","title":"Mark Wahlberg’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mark Wahlberg's 10 Best MoviesWe look back at the best-reviewed work of the Patriots Day star.by Jeff Giles | December 21, 2016 |  CommentsDuring the early 1990s, while he was flashing his abs and modeling underwear as Marky Mark, few could have suspected that beneath Mark Wahlberg’s b-boy cap lurked the soul of a thespian. Now, of course, that’s no longer the case — with more than 20 roles and an Academy Award nomination to his credit, Wahlberg has compiled an impressive filmography over the last 15-plus years. With&nbsp;his latest film,&nbsp;Patriots Day, opening this weekend, we thought now would be the perfect time to take a look back at his best-reviewed major roles. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Invincible (2006)  72%He isn’t a household name, but Vince Papale is a legend among hardcore football fans — particularly in Philadelphia, where he overcame the odds to earn a spot on the Eagles’ roster and became one of the oldest rookies in the history of the NFL — as well as a living embodiment of the team’s scrappy, blue-collar image. Though Wahlberg is from Boston, he knows a thing or two about seemingly impossible dreams that come true, and his performance helped give Invincible&nbsp;a sweaty leg up on the many inspirational sports dramas in theaters at the time. “It may seem that Invincible takes too long to get to the football,” wrote Gary Dowell of the Baltimore City Paper. “But by the time it does get down to it, we’ve invested enough in Wahlberg and Kinnear to give a damn about the outcome of the all-important Big Game.”Watch Trailer9. The Italian Job (2003)  73%Part of the wave of heist flick remakes that gave us new versions of The Thomas Crown Affair&nbsp;and Ocean’s Eleven, F. Gary Gray’s “homage” to the 1969 Michael Caine caper The Italian Job&nbsp;put Wahlberg in the middle of a double-crossing, gold-thieving band of criminals that included Charlize Theron, Jason Statham, Mos Def, and Seth Green. Though critics were quick to point out that the new Job&nbsp;didn’t really add much to the original — and the movie was arguably bettern-known for its heavy use of trendy Mini Coopers than anything that actually transpired in the plot — it offered 111 minutes of agreeably undemanding action thrills. As Jon Niccum of the Lawrence Journal-World wrote, “Filled with easy-to-like characters, innovative action sequences and a story rife with momentum, the movie is as endearingly zippy as the BMW MINIs the heroes use to pull off their scam.”Watch Trailer8. Lone Survivor (2014)  75%Having already starred in arguably the definitive Gulf War movie (Three Kings), Wahlberg may have been tempting fate when he signed on for Lone Survivor, writer-director Peter Berg’s adaptation of the nonfiction bestseller from Marcus Luttrell and Patrick Robinson inspired by Luttrell’s experiences in Afghanistan during Operation Red Wings. But looking back, it isn’t hard to see what drew Wahlberg to the project; opening wide in early 2014, it managed to escape the dismal commercial fate afforded many modern-day war movies, as well as drawing praise from the majority of critics, who were able to see past Survivor’s occasionally troublesome subtext and appreciate the film’s genuinely harrowing action sequences and generally persuasive performances. “Lone Survivor‘s lack of suspense never works against it,” argued Dana Stevens for Slate. “If anything, the fact that the outcome is, at least roughly, known in advance only adds to the film’s sickening tension.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;7. The Other Guys (2010)  78%Sometimes it seems like all Will Ferrell needs in order to be funny is a sufficiently broad premise and a solid foil to help ground his lunatic behavior in something like the real world. With 2010’s The Other Guys, he got both — a screenplay from Chris Henchy and Adam McKay (the latter of whom directed) about a serious-but-unlucky cop (Mark Wahlberg) who’s saddled with a milquetoast desk jockey (Ferrell) for a partner. When the best cops in town (played by Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) are incapacitated, the “other guys” step into the breach and blow the lid off a massive conspiracy involving an unscrupulous billionaire (Steve Coogan) and his even more ruthless client (Anne Heche) — firing off belly laughs along the way. Not the most novel setup, perhaps, but it’s all Wahlberg and Ferrell needed to rack up nearly $225 million at the box office, as well as earn the admiration of critics like the Los Angeles Times’ Betsy Sharkey, who chuckled, “The plot doesn’t always hold water and it has a tendency to ramble, but they don’t seem to care. And honestly, neither should you.”Watch Trailer6. Traveller (1997)  79%Truly entertaining stories about con men are difficult to come by — and even the best of the bunch tend to focus on the thrill of the grift, leaving the characters themselves in the background. 1997’s Traveller&nbsp;reversed the formula, examining the knotty feuds and traditions of a tight-knit clan of small-time North Carolina con artists, in particular Bokky (Bill Paxton), a Traveller whose life is thrown out of balance when he crosses paths with the son of an exiled member (Mark Wahlberg) and develops an honest emotional attachment to one of his victims (Julianna Margulies). It isn’t one of Wahlberg’s better-known movies, but it was a hit with critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who wrote, “The script is smart and sneaky — by never telling the audience more than is necessary, it develops a keen sense of suspense that persists until the gritty final reel.”Watch Trailer5. Deepwater Horizon (2016)  83%Mark Wahlberg’s carved out a pretty good career for himself playing heroes, but playing a guy who helped save the day in an actual tragedy — particularly one that resulted in lives lost and the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history — takes a little more tact than your average action thriller. It’s a line he managed to walk fairly successfully with Deepwater Horizon, which saw him reuniting with Lone Survivor&nbsp;director Peter Berg to dramatize the titular oil rig’s 2010 spill with a combination of excitement and respect for the gravity of the situation. Leading an impressive cast rounded out by Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson, Wahlberg played real-life ship worker Mike Williams, giving audiences a hero to root for — and helping outline the case against the corporate malfeasance that created the problem. “Deepwater Horizon achieves that impossible balance,” wrote Lindsey Bahr of the Associated Press, calling it “a tribute to the workers who both perished and survived that day and a searing critique of the rotten system that put them there in the first place.”Watch Trailer4. The Fighter (2010)  91%David O. Russell clearly enjoys working with Mark Wahlberg. After striking critical paydirt with Three Kings and getting him to flex his comedic muscle with I Heart Huckabees, Russell again turned to his former leading man for The Fighter, a dramatization of the real-life story of welterweight boxing champ “Irish” Micky Ward, the Massachusetts legend who teamed up with his brother (and trainer) Dicky (Christian Bale) to duke out a triumph of sorts over their difficult upbringing. Wahlberg was one of the few Fighter&nbsp;stars who didn’t earn an Academy Award nomination for his work — Bale took home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar — but given how long and how vigorously he fought to help bring the movie to the big screen, the movie’s warm critical reception and $129 million box office had to serve as a pretty sweet vindication. “The Fighter deftly manages to be equal parts character drama and sports film without giving short shrift to either,” wrote Joshua Starnes for ComingSoon. “Containing a couple of the best performances of the year, it is in turn harrowing and heartwarming.”Watch Trailer3. The Departed (2006)  90%We love to hate remakes, but not all of them are created equal; for proof, look no further than The Departed, Martin Scorsese’s expertly cast treatment of the 2002 Hong Kong hit Infernal Affairs. On the surface, it might look like just another crime thriller where no one is who or what he seems — but this kind of story is all in the telling, and Scorsese had a tightly wound William Monahan screenplay to work from, as well as a bruising set of leads in Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, and Wahlberg. A four-time Oscar winner, The Departed&nbsp;finally earned Scorsese his long-overdue Best Picture and Best Director honors, and triggered an avalanche of praise from critics like Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, who applauded, “It’s a thinking fan’s thriller, a movie involving multiple fully dimensional characters, multiple story lines and edge-of-your-seat twists and swerves, stylized to just the edge of believability.”Watch Trailer2. Boogie Nights (1997)  93%A year after terrorizing Reese Witherspoon in Fear, Wahlberg made the leap to Serious Actor territory with the starring role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s ensemble opus about life in the porn industry, Boogie Nights. As the genitally gifted Eddie Adams, a.k.a. Dirk Diggler, Wahlberg took a character that could have been a cheesy joke and imbued him with palpable emotion. One of the year’s biggest critical winners, Boogie Nights started Anderson and Wahlberg’s careers in earnest, earned co-star Burt Reynolds some of the best reviews of his career, and enjoyed a thumbs up from Roger Ebert, who wrote, “As a writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson is a skilled reporter who fills his screen with understated, authentic details.”Watch Trailer1. Three Kings (1999)  94%Anyone who wonders why audiences refuse to see movies about the wars raging in the Middle East would do well to study the example set by David O. Russell, who waited eight years before making the Gulf War picture Three Kings&nbsp;— and even then, the conflict served mainly as grist for a heist storyline involving a trio of U.S. Army Reservists (George Clooney, Ice Cube, and Wahlberg) making plans to steal plundered Kuwaiti gold. Widely recognized as a sharp, stylish satire today, Kings&nbsp;wasn’t a huge commercial success during its initial theatrical run, but it earned instant admiration from critics like Sean Means of Film.com, who called it “Possibly the best wartime comedy since Robert Altman’s M*A*S*H.”Watch TrailerWatch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"nfl","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/21143928/Mark-Wahlberg-Recall.jpg","slug":"mark-wahlbergs-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508959118650","title":"Natalie Portman’s 10 Best Movies","content":"(Photo by Columbia Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection)All&nbsp;Natalie Portman Movies RankedFor most actors, a movie like&nbsp;Leon: The Professional&nbsp;would be the peak.

Science-fiction projects gave her first brushes with Rotten ratings (Mars Attacks!) but also global stardom (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace), giving her the clout to work with the biggest name directors; people like Wes Anderson (The Darjeeling Limited), Milos Forman (Goya’s Ghosts), Wong Kar-Wai (My Blueberry Nights), and Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan), the last of which nabbed her the Best Actress Oscar.Portman has also increasingly worked directly behind the camera in recent years, first with her own directed segment in&nbsp;New York, I Love You, and then the feature-length&nbsp;A Tale of Love and Darkness.

From indie flicks to blockbuster franchises, Oldman’s done it all, and we knew we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to look back on some of his filmography’s brightest critical highlights. &nbsp;It’s time for Total Recall!Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)  75%By 1992, the world had seen so many Dracula adaptations — many of them sadly subpar — that the character was in desperate need of a fresh, suitably creepy start. Enter Francis Ford Coppola and his lavishly mounted Bram Stoker’s Dracula, which pitted Oldman as the titular vampire against Anthony Hopkins as his arch-nemesis Van Helsing and threw in a marquee cast that included Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves, as well as an Annie Lennox song over the closing credits, for added megaplex appeal. Given its impeccable pedigree, the fact that Coppola’s Dracula was a financial success didn’t come as much of a surprise — but unlike a lot of previous adaptations, particularly those of recent vintage, it was also a success with critics, many of whom welcomed the opportunity to see a director as talented as Coppola interpret the vampire’s classic tale. In the words of the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “It is Coppola’s most lavish and, certainly, his most flamboyant film; never before has he allowed himself this kind of mad experimentation.”Watch TrailerAir Force One (1997)  78%By the late ’90s, the “action movie in a confined space” subgenre looked like it was pretty much played out, but as Air Force One forcibly demonstrated, there were still thrills yet to be wrung from its seemingly played-out premise. In this case, all it took was adding one last novel twist — namely, putting the action on a moving plane and making the sitting President our terrorist-bustin’ hero — and building the whole thing around a stellar cast led by Harrison Ford as the POTUS and Oldman as the villainous, perfectly named Ivan Korshunov. It all adds up, in the words of ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, to “a roller coaster ride for those who prefer not to think once the theater lights have dimmed.”Watch TrailerTinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)  83%div class=”content-image”&gt;Nearly 30 years after making his film debut, Gary Oldman earned his first Academy Award nomination for his work in Tomas Alfredson’s impeccably cast adaptation of the classic John le Carré novel Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Alfredson’s comma-free screen version surrounded Oldman with an impressive array of talented actors, including Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, John Hurt, Toby Jones, and Mark Strong — and while its languid pace and 127-minute running time annoyed critics accustomed to a little more bang for their spy-thriller buck, the majority agreed with the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, who enthused, “Just watching Gary Oldman and his trenchcoated brethren march down the damp, ill-lit streets of Cold War London is enough to make you shiver.”Watch TrailerState of Grace (1990)  84%Director Phil Joanou opened his career with a better-than-average teen comedy (Three O’Clock High)&nbsp;and a well-intentioned, albeit indulgent rockumentary (U2: Rattle and Hum) — which is to say that few could have expected that he had it in him to helm a drama as tense and gripping as 1990’s State of Grace. Starring Sean Penn as an undercover cop whose latest case tests his loyalty to his best friend (played by Oldman) — not to mention his affection for his friend’s sister (Robin Wright) — Grace&nbsp;exploited an instantly recognizable formula while transcending it thanks to outstanding acting from its leads. Janet Maslin of the New York Times singled Oldman out in particular, writing that he “gives an electrifying performance that both establishes a tragic, terrifying character and explains why that character’s world is such a perilous place.”Watch TrailerJFK (1991)  84%Oldman has made a habit of playing real-life people during his film career, but none of them have been more notorious than the role he took in Oliver Stone’s JFK. Just one in a series of famous faces to pop up during the 189-minute political conspiracy epic, Oldman appeared as Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin whose bullet murdered our 35th president…&nbsp;Or did it? Stone’s undeniably well-crafted film may not have answered any questions, but it was an unqualified hit at the box office and the Academy, where it garnered eight Oscar nominations. Observed Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, “If Stone hasn’t exactly solved the Kennedy assassination, he has captured — with a dark cinematic flair that leaves you reeling — why it still looms like a sickening nightmare.”Watch TrailerThe Harry Potter FranchiseAfter helming the first two films in the Harry Potter series, director Chris Columbus departed — leaving the chair empty for Alfonso Cuarón, who stepped in just in time to take the reins for what was then the franchise’s darkest installment yet, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Introducing Oldman as the mysterious Sirius Black, whose prison escape sets the events of the movie’s plot into motion, Azkaban&nbsp;marked the first of four Potter appearances for Oldman while establishing a new critical benchmark for the franchise. Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek was just one of many to praise Azkaban, calling it “The first true Harry Potter movie — the first to capture not only the books’ sense of longing, but their understanding of the way magic underlies the mundane, instead of just prancing fancifully at a far remove from it.”Watch TrailerThe Dark Knight TrilogyPart of the same career resurgence that found Oldman appearing in the Harry Potter franchise after a few fallow years, Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy made fine use of Oldman as Jim Gordon, the Gotham policeman whose rise to commissioner dovetails with Batman’s arrival as the city’s protector. Offering an everyman’s moral compass and sense of virtue to counterbalance the Caped Crusader’s vigilantism, Oldman’s Gordon helped shine a light in an increasingly bleak franchise — and eventually paid the price for going against his own conscience in the blockbuster finale. Calling The Dark Knight Rises “A disturbing experience we live through as much as a film we watch,” Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, “this dazzling conclusion to director Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy is more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.”Watch TrailerSid and Nancy (1986)  88%One of rock’s most infamous love stories got the biopic treatment with Alex Cox’s 1986 drama Sid &amp; Nancy, starring Oldman as former Sex Pistol Sid Vicious and Chloe Webb as his equally ill-fated girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Initially largely ignored by audiences — and derided by former Pistol John Lydon, who described himself as “appalled” by its many alleged inaccuracies — Sid &amp; Nancy has acquired a cult audience over time, thanks to film fans lured in by its titular duo’s enduring mystique. Derailed by heroin, unfolding in a series of squalid apartment buildings and motel rooms, and ending with Sid being hauled off by police after Nancy’s stabbing death, their tale wasn’t exactly cheerful — but it resonated with critics like Rita Kempley of the Washington Post, who observed, “Though dark and harrowing, explicit and unsparing, the movie proves a riveting biography of these burnt-out icons and their iconoclastic half-decade.”Watch TrailerDawn Of The Planet Of The Apes (2014)  90%CG spectacle is great, but it can only take a movie so far. To really make audiences feel something, it helps to have some recognizably human drama on the screen — and part of the genius of Matt Reeves’ Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;is the impressive array of old-fashioned acting talent brought to bear on the mo-cap heavy second installment in this rebooted post-apocalyptic saga. Oldman spearheaded the cast’s human contingent as Dreyfus, leader of the frightened band of survivors who find themselves in a life-or-death struggle for survival with the planet’s newly advanced simian civilization, helping anchor all the incredibly lifelike action with palpably poignant emotional stakes. “This,” marveled Richard Roeper, “just might be the most engrossing, the smartest and the most daring Apes movie ever put on film.”Watch TrailerPrick Up Your Ears (1987)  94%Oldman earned a BAFTA Best Actor nomination for his widely acclaimed work in Prick Up Your Ears, director Stephen Frears’ biopic about British playwright Joe Orton — and his tragic murder at the hands of his mentor-turned-lover, Kenneth Halliwell, played here by Alfred Molina. Neither the subjects nor the subject matter had much draw for American audiences, but for critics, it presented an irresistible collection of acting talent, working at their peak. “The great performances in the movie are, of course, at its center,” argued Roger Ebert. “Gary Oldman plays Orton and Alfred Molina plays Halliwell, and these are two of the best performances of the year.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Pictures, popular, live, Annual, Pictures, Arrowverse, 2018, PaleyFest, books, street, Endgame, the, Crackle, to","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/01144846/Gary-Oldman-Recall.jpg","slug":"gary-oldmans-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508960867648","title":"Emily Blunt’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emily Blunt's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the star of The Girl on the Train.by Jeff Giles | October 5, 2016 |  CommentsShe’s only been making movies for a little over a decade, but Emily Blunt has already managed to put together an impressive string of critical and commercial hits — and she looks to add to that list with this weekend’s The Girl on the Train. In honor of its arrival, we decided to take a fond look back at some of the brighter highlights from Ms. Blunt’s fast-growing filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!10.&nbsp;Sunshine Cleaning (2009)  74%If you’re going to film a quirky indie comedy about a cheerleader-turned-hardworking single mom who decides to clean crime scenes for a living so she can send her son to private school, you could hardly find a better person for the role than Amy Adams — and it would be just as hard to improve upon Emily Blunt as her not-so-sunny sister. While critics carped that the Christine Jeffs-directed Sunshine Cleaning&nbsp;was ultimately a little too burdened with quirky indie clichés to achieve its full potential, they had nothing but kind words to say about its stars. The Toronto Star’s Peter Howell &nbsp;reflected the opinions of many of his peers when he wrote, “Adams and Blunt rise above the clunky premise and execution to once again demonstrate why they’ve become the go-to girls for any director seeking smart, versatile and warm-blooded talent.”9.&nbsp;The Adjustment Bureau (2011)  71%Star-crossed lovers are nothing new at the cinema, but The Adjustment Bureau&nbsp;— adapted from the 1954 Philip K. Dick short story “Adjustment Team” — adds a novel sci-fi twist by literally pitting its lovers against the agents of fate. Budding politician David Norris (Matt Damon) meets a mysterious woman (Blunt) on the eve of his unsuccessful campaign for the U.S. Senate, and becomes determined to find her after they share a kiss — a desire that only intensifies after he meets members of the “Adjustment Bureau” who inform him that he has to stay away from her in order to fulfill “the Plan.” It’s the type of loopy premise that can easily spin off into melodramatic gobbledygook, but according to most critics, Bureau stayed pleasantly grounded thanks to the palpable spark between its leads. As Peter Rainer wrote for the Christian Science Monitor, “Because the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is so strong, what might have been a jumble of Matrix-style oddments comes across instead as ardent.”8.&nbsp;The Young Victoria (2009)  76%Blunt received a raft of award nominations — including one from the Golden Globes — for her work in the title role of this Jean-Marc Vallée period drama, which dramatizes the power struggle leading up to Queen Victoria’s ascension to the throne as well as the contentious political atmosphere that surrounded her afterwards. Of course, political intrigue will only get you so far with a movie about a queen — you also need a good old-fashioned romance, and Victoria’s tale offered up a doozy in her courtship with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Rupert Friend), who sparked a real romance with the young monarch after being sent to the royal court as part of a would-be seduction ploy by his uncle, the King of Belgium. It all added up to just the sort of beautifully mounted period piece that tends to hit a reliable home run with critics and arthouse audiences, and The Young Victoria&nbsp;did pretty well on both fronts, with Blunt earning copious praise for her performance. “Blunt, her eyes sparking, her manner playful, smart, and proud, shines in the title role,” wrote the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea. “If the film itself isn’t brilliant, its star most definitely is.”7.&nbsp;The Devil Wears Prada (2006)  75%Two years after making arthouse audiences swoon with My Summer of Love, Blunt made her second trip to the big screen — and scored her first blockbuster success. Of course, The Devil Wears Prada‘s $300 million-plus gross had a lot more to do with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway’s names on the marquee, but Blunt’s supporting appearance proved she could hold her own with those talented ladies (and displayed a gift for comedy she hadn’t necessarily had a chance to display with her first film). Starring Streep as fashion magazine editor and all-around hellish boss Miranda Priestly, Hathaway as Priestly’s fresh-out-of-college new assistant, and Blunt as Hathaway’s far more experienced co-worker, Prada&nbsp;poked fun at the fashion industry while unabashedly embracing its glamour — and the gambit worked with critics as well as audiences. “The Devil Wears Prada is a movie that revels in pleasure,” wrote Slate’s Dana Stevens. “The pleasure of fashion, of luxury, of power and ambition. It’s also a tremendous pleasure to watch.”6.&nbsp;Charlie Wilson's War (2007)  82%Sign up for a movie whose cast includes Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Ned Beatty, and you probably aren’t going to come anywhere near top billing. But even if her supporting turn in Charlie Wilson’s War&nbsp;isn’t one of Blunt’s biggest roles, it rates a mention for a few reasons — it put her in some magnificent closing-credits company, for one thing, and for another, whatever her screentime lacked in quantity, it made up in memorability. Most of all, this Mike Nichols-directed period dramedy about a real-life U.S. Congressman (Hanks) who works with the CIA to try and tilt the balance of the Afghan-Soviet War is pretty all-around entertaining; as Rene Rodriguez wrote for the Miami Herald, “It is so much fun watching these actors enjoy bouncing off each other, it’s almost too easy to forget the importance of the story being told.”5.&nbsp;Your Sister's Sister (2012)  83%Ah, the love triangle — always good for a bit of drama. That’s exactly what you get out of Lynn Shelton’s Your Sister’s Sister, an absorbingly low-key drama starring Mark Duplass as a guy who borrows a cabin from his deceased brother’s ex-girlfriend (Blunt), only to show up and find her sister (Rosemarie DeWitt). Questions of grief, unspoken feelings, and sexual identity soon follow — as well as a generous helping of the well-rounded characters and naturalistic dialogue fans of the filmmaker have come to expect. “Even when the storyline tries to wrench the characters in a certain direction, they keep returning to something real and honest,” wrote Deadspin’s Will Leitch. “I want these people to be my friends.”4.&nbsp;My Summer of Love (2004)  90%After acclaimed early performances on the stage and on television, Blunt continued her winning streak with her big-screen debut, 2004’s My Summer of Love, in which she played an upper-class British teen who embarks on a seemingly star-crossed relationship with a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Although it wasn’t a huge commercial hit, Love&nbsp;was consistently acclaimed — Blunt and co-star Natalie Press shared an &nbsp;Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer — and it led directly into more high-profile roles, something predicted by more than a few critics. “Remember these names,” wrote Moira MacDonald for the Seattle Times. “Remember this strange, lovely movie.”3.&nbsp;Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow (2014)  91%By the time Edge of Tomorrow&nbsp;arrived in theaters, we’d all seen Tom Cruise play action hero countless times — and he’d even helped save the world from an alien invasion, as his character was called upon to do in this Doug Liman-directed sci-fi flick. But Tomorrow&nbsp;came with a couple of fairly nifty twists: one in the form of a timeloop plot device that sent Cruise plummeting back into the same chaotic day on the battlefield until he could manage to get it right, and the second with a story that made Cruise an unwilling and borderline incompetent hero who needed to be trained to fight by the movie’s true badass, played by Blunt. The end result, as critics were fond of pointing out, was a little like Starship Troopers&nbsp;meets Groundhog Day, and all kinds of blockbuster fun. As Kenneth Turan put it for the Los Angeles Times, “It’s a star-driven mass-market entertainment that’s smart, exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions.”2.&nbsp;Looper (2012)  93%On a superficial (and wholly enjoyable) level, Rian Johnson’s 2012 sci-fi hit Looper&nbsp;is about one man’s life-or-death struggle against his future self. But underneath all the twisty time travel narrative and cool set pieces, it’s really a surprisingly tender drama about a mother’s love — and one grounded by the flinty yet vulnerable performance delivered by Blunt, who plays a homesteading single mom determined to protect her young son at all costs (and maybe unwittingly change the world for the better in the bargain). “That first hour cooks,” marveled the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips. “And the second hour brings Emily Blunt into the story, which is a fine thing for any second half to offer.”1.&nbsp;Sicario (2015)  92%Some pretty powerful films have been made about the international drug trade, and at this point, if you’re going to throw your cinematic hat in the ring, you’d better be prepared to add a singular statement to the genre. Director Denis Villeneuve managed to pull it off with 2015’s Sicario, starring Blunt as an FBI agent who teams up with a pair of CIA operatives (Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro) to bring down a Mexican cartel. In terms of plot outline, it’s boilerplate stuff — but in Villeneuve and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan’s hands, and through the stellar efforts of the well-chosen cast, the end results are elevated considerably. “Far from being just another crime story,” wrote the St. Louis Post-Dispatch’s Calvin Wilson, “Sicario is cinema at its most ambitious.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Pop, child's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/05152555/Emily-Blunt-Recall.jpg","slug":"emily-blunts-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508958979379","title":"Faye Dunaway’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Faye Dunaway's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at the best-reviewed work of the star of The Bye Bye Man.by Jeff Giles | January 11, 2017 |  CommentsAfter retreating from the spotlight for a few years, Faye Dunaway is having something of a moment: aside from a recurring role in Amazon’s Hand of God, the Oscar-winning star has wrapped a handful of new films — including this weekend’s The Bye Bye Man. In celebration of her overdue return to the big screen, we decided to take a fond look back at some of the many critical highlights from Ms. Dunaway’s distinguished career, and you know what that means: it’s time for Total Recall!10. Barfly (1987)  77%After spending a few years in England and focusing on television work in the mid-1980s, Dunaway returned to Hollywood in search of film roles — and found a doozy in Barfly, a semi-autobiographical drama written by Charles Bukowski about a perpetually sozzled writer (Mickey Rourke) whose self-destructive habits put him in the path of a fellow alcoholic (Dunaway) who happens to share a past with his usual bartender/sparring partner (Frank Stallone). It’s far from the cheeriest entry in her filmography, but it offered the chance to dig into a dramatic role Dunaway had been looking for; as Roger Ebert wrote, “The dialogue scenes between Rourke and Dunaway in this movie are never less than a pleasure… Rourke and Dunaway take their characters as opportunities to stretch as actors, to take chances and do extreme things.”Watch Trailer9. The Thomas Crown Affair (1968)  72%Dunaway quickly parlayed her breakthrough performance in Bonnie and Clyde into another classic: The Thomas Crown Affair, Norman Jewison’s heist picture starring Steve McQueen as a wealthy businessman who plans high-stakes robberies as a lark. As the insurance investigator who figures out Crown’s misdeeds — but of course finds herself drawn to him anyway — Dunaway proved herself a leading lady who could stand toe to toe with one of the era’s most effortlessly cool superstars. As James Rocchi argued for Netflix, “Caper films don’t come much better.”Watch Trailer8. The Three Musketeers (1973)  86%Left at loose ends with his idea for an action-comedy retelling of The Three Musketeers&nbsp;after plans for the Beatles to star fell through, director Richard Lester rounded up a showy cast — including Oliver Reed, Charlton Heston, Raquel Welch, Richard Chamberlain, Christopher Lee, and of course Faye Dunaway — to tell the story, which proved so sprawling that he ended up filming two movies’ worth of footage, cutting it in half, and releasing the results six months apart. In the U.S., The Three Musketeers&nbsp;and The Four Musketeers&nbsp;both arrived in 1974, performing respectably at the box office and earning praise from critics along the way; while Dunaway’s appearance as the wickedly seductive Milady de Winter was hardly one of the more progressive roles on her résumé, it’s all part of the movies’ swashbuckling good time. Deeming it “The finest rendering of Dumas’ tale to date,” eFilmCritic’s Brian Mckay called it “A perfect blend of comedy, romance, and no-holds-barred swashbuckling adventure,” and added, “The cast is phenomenally good.”Watch Trailer7. Three Days of the Condor (1975)  87%Dunaway was on a major roll in the mid-1970s, surging on the strength of a career comeback that included Chinatown, the Musketeers&nbsp;movies, and The Towering Inferno. Also among her hits during the period: Three Days of the Condor, a Robert Redford-led spy thriller that draws on the paranoia of the era to tell the story of a CIA analyst who fights back against a shadowy government conspiracy while hiding out in the apartment of a woman (Dunaway) he essentially kidnaps in desperation. In some ways, it’s inescapably an artifact of its era, but it remains fundamentally sound — a suitably tense affair, steered by director Sydney Pollack’s deft hand, that stands among the era’s better entries in the genre. “At its best moments,” wrote Vincent Canby of the New York Times, “Three Days of the Condor creates without effort or editorializing that sense of isolation — that far remove from reality — within which super-government agencies can operate with such heedless immunity.”Watch Trailer6. Arizona Dream (1993)  87%Filmed in 1991, Emir Kusturica’s Arizona Dream&nbsp;languished in limbo for two years before it was released in Europe — and it didn’t reach American shores until the following September, at which point it grossed a little over $100,000 in limited release. It seems like a pretty harsh fate for a movie featuring Johnny Depp, Jerry Lewis, and Faye Dunaway, but if you’ve ever seen Dream, you know it is not, to put it mildly, the type of film Hollywood studios were made to promote. The story of a fish tagger (Depp) who believes he can see the fishes’ dreams, it’s over two hours of absurdist comedy, packed with symbolism-laden dream sequences and oddball characters like Dunaway’s Elaine, a woman who aspires to build a flying machine, and her daughter Grace, a turtle-obsessed young woman played by Lili Taylor. Even the critics that enjoyed it used words like “peculiar,” “odd,” and “bizarre” to describe Dream; as Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, “Even at its full length, showing off a more seductive rhythm and the buoyant humanism that is this director’s calling card, it remains as ripe a subject for therapy as for criticism.”Watch Trailer5. Bonnie and Clyde (1967)  88%Dunaway’s first screen role, opposite Anthony Quinn in The Happening, presaged a period in which she had to fight her way out of an undesirable contract — but it was her work in that movie that attracted the attention of director Arthur Penn, who ended up casting her in his classic biographical gangster drama Bonnie and Clyde. Starring Dunaway as Bonnie Parker opposite Warren Beatty’s Clyde Barrow, the movie exploded into an Oscar-winning smash, with both stars earning&nbsp;Oscar nominations under a cloud of violent controversy that’s continued to shadow its legacy for decades. To some, it represents a glorification of violence that panders to some of humanity’s worst instincts; to others, it’s a thrilling breath of fresh cinematic air. “Bonnie and Clyde&nbsp;is the most excitingly American American movie since The Manchurian Candidate,” wrote the New Yorker’s Pauline Kael. “The audience is alive to it.”Watch Trailer4. Voyage of the Damned (1976)  83%Given its crowded cast and the era in which it was released, 1976’s Voyage of the Damned&nbsp;might look like one of the star-studded disaster movies that were in vogue at the time; instead, however, it’s a fact-based drama about an ocean liner full of Jewish refugees who sailed to Cuba in 1939 in the vain (and ultimately fraudulent) hopes of being accepted as refugees from the Nazi regime. Understandably overshadowed in Dunaway’s career by Network, which was released during the same year, it nevertheless proved a critical success, with PopMatters’ J.C. Maçek III later reflecting, “There is no Indiana Jones to save the day and no pat Hollywood ending to revise history. Voyage of the Damned&nbsp;is unquestionably a serious drama and treats its subject matter with the dignity that it should.”Watch Trailer3. Network (1976)  91%Much as many of our favorite television pundits like to argue that we’re living in one of the medium’s great golden ages, there’s no denying that wide swaths of the dial have been abandoned and given over to lowest-common-denominator fare. But long before anyone started worrying about trashy talk shows or “reality” TV, screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky had an inkling of the dystopian landscape looming on the horizon — and the result was 1976’s Network, a bitingly bitter satire about a veteran news anchor (Peter Finch) whose unorthodox response to being fired serves as the unintended catalyst for a new era of ever-more-provocative nightly news, whipped into a ratings frenzy by a rather unscrupulous exec (Dunaway, who earned her third Best Actress Oscar nomination and first win). “One would assume that a 1976 film about network television would feel dated today,” admitted Forrest Hartman of the Reno Gazette-Journal, “but director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had such a fine concept that Network&nbsp;seems downright contemporary.”Watch Trailer2. Little Big Man (1970)  96%Dunaway suffered through a string of duds after making The Thomas Crown Affair, but enjoyed a rebound of sorts with 1970’s Little Big Man&nbsp;— albeit in a supporting role she reportedly only accepted as a favor to director Arthur Penn. However she got involved, the movie — an adaptation of the Thomas Berger novel about the incredible life story of the world’s oldest man — was a critical and commercial hit that reaped awards and nominations for star Dustin Hoffman as well as actor Chief Dan George. Dunaway’s performance as a sexually frustrated preacher’s wife whose arc ends with a cheeky tribute to Hoffman’s work in The Graduate&nbsp;may not have called for the heaviest dramatic lifting she’s done in her career, but it offered a rare opportunity to flash her comedic chops onscreen. The end result, wrote Scott Weinberg for eFilmCritic, is “Easily one of the most entertaining (and presently overlooked) Westerns of the early 1970s.”Watch Trailer1. Chinatown (1974)  99%In a filmography dotted with triumphs as significant as Rosemary’s Baby&nbsp;and The Pianist, it takes a truly special film to top them all — and 1974’s Chinatown&nbsp;is not only Roman Polanski’s personal best, it’s one of the most highly regarded films of all time. Starring Jack Nicholson as the duped-but-determined gumshoe Jake Gittes and Dunaway as the femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray — both nominated for Oscars — Chinatown&nbsp;explored an oft-forgotten chapter in Los Angeles’ history while bringing film noir back to brilliant life for the 1970s. Though plans for a trilogy were scuttled after the sequel, The Two Jakes, flopped in 1990, Chinatown&nbsp;more than stands on its own; Robert Towne’s script bustles with twists and double-crosses, and the cast, from Nicholson to Dunaway and John Huston, is impeccable. “This film,” crowed the Observer’s Philip French, “is flawless.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"technology, Arts, HBO, The, aliens, Returns, 78th, doctor, female, MSNBC, Interview, tv","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/11154054/Faye-Dunaway-Recall.jpg","slug":"faye-dunaways-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508960884036","title":"Rachel Weisz’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Rachel Weisz's Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look back at the most acclaimed work of the star of The Light Between Oceans.by Jeff Giles | August 31, 2016 |  CommentsSummer is just about over, and the arrival of this weekend’s The Light Between Oceans&nbsp;— a period romance starring Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander, and Rachel Weisz — offers elegant proof. In honor of this year’s exodus from our annual buttery blockbuster season, we decided to dedicate this column to a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from the Oscar-winning Ms. Weisz’s estimable filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!Definitely, Maybe (2008)  70%A sort of How I Met Your Mother for the big screen, Definitely, Maybe stars Ryan Reynolds as an about-to-be-divorced dad whose daughter (Abigail Breslin) demands to hear how her parents met — and who responds by concocting a romantic mystery of sorts, leading her (and the audience) on a rom-com odyssey starring Reynolds alongside the kid’s potential moms: Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz. Setting aside the absurd beauty of that putative gene pool, this bubbly hit has loads of charm, and easily wooed the majority of critics despite a rather ordinary list of narrative ingredients. “Is this movie the best romantic comedy of the year? Maybe not,” admitted the Miami Herald’s Connie Ogle. “Do you walk out with a smile on your face? Definitely.”Watch TrailerRunaway Jury (2003)  73%John Grisham will never be regarded as a quote-unquote Serious Author, but his legal thrillers can make for great paperback fun — and a few of them have been turned into pretty good movies, too. For example, here’s 2003’s Runaway Jury, a boilerplate legal thriller enlivened by a crackerjack cast that included John Cusack, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, and (surprise!) Rachel Weisz. All that star wattage didn’t add up to a major box office hit, but between the talent on display and director Gary Fleder’s deft hand with all the assorted courtroom shenanigans, most critics were duly impressed; as Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote for Entertainment Weekly, “Although the twists are pulpy and the legal foundations feel wildly porous, Fleder, a practiced hand at TV-cop stuff and movie thrills, makes the film a faster, more agile bundle of entertainment than the book.”Watch TrailerSunshine (2000)  74%This list should offer ample proof that Rachel Weisz is about more than sweeping, romantic period epics. But if that’s the genre that comes to mind when you think of her, there are more than a few excellent reasons why — and Sunshine, a sweeping, romantic period epic from director/co-writer István Szabó, is among them. Here, Weisz helps anchor an ensemble cast for a story following three generations of life in a Hungarian Jewish family (each of which features Ralph Fiennes in a different role), unfolding from the turn of the 20th century into the aftermath of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The movie’s three-hour length and Szabó’s fondness for melodrama annoyed a handful of critics who couldn’t get into it, but for others, the end result was well worth the investment. “This is a movie of substance and thrilling historical sweep,” wrote Roger Ebert, “and its three hours allow Szabó to show the family’s destiny forming and shifting under pressure.”Watch TrailerYouth (2015)  71%A great cast isn’t always enough to make a movie worth viewing, but it gives a director a pretty good head start — and when that cast includes Michael Caine, Harvey Keitel, and Rachel Weisz, you’ve just about sealed the deal even if your film includes a handful of head-scratching interludes that include floating monks, dozens of cowbells, and a guy dressed up as Adolf Hitler. Oddball ingredients aside, writer-director Paolo Sorrentino’s Youth&nbsp;offers some fine actors an opportunity to play well-rounded characters grappling with getting older and contemplating the loss of opportunity and the consequences of their choices. Calling it “Quixotic, idiosyncratic, effortlessly moving,” Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, “It’s as much a cinematic essay as anything else, a meditation on the wonders and complications of life, an examination of what lasts, of what matters to people no matter their age.”Watch TrailerThe Whistleblower (2011)  75%Director/co-writer Larysa Kondracki searched for nearly a decade before securing funding for The Whistleblower, a fact-based drama about an ex-cop (Weisz) who took a job with defense contractors training police in Bosnia and Herzegovina, only to discover the company was running a sex trafficking ring — and the UN wasn’t doing anything about it. Fired after pursuing her investigation, she took her findings to the media, prompting promises of a full-scale UN inquiry… which, based on the real-life public record, may or may not have made much of a difference in the end. Not the kind of movie that necessarily makes a person feel good about the human race, in other words, but definitely the type of role that can bring out the best in a performer — and according to critics, Weisz delivered. As Bob Mondello wrote for NPR, “It’s a thriller sobering enough in its graphic portrayal of forced violence against women that it would be tough to watch if not for the controlled fury Weisz brings to her performance as a down-to-earth avenging angel.”Watch TrailerThe Deep Blue Sea (2012)  80%Director Terence Davies drew from distinguished source material when he decided to adapt Terence Rattigan’s play The Deep Blue Sea&nbsp;— and he honored it by rounding up an outstanding cast, led by Rachel Weisz as a woman drifting through a comfortable yet passionless marriage and Tom Hiddleston as an ex-Royal Air Force pilot whose thrill-seeking streak awakens her to a life of passion. The moral of the story might seem somewhat retrograde to modern viewers, but it remains heartbreakingly well-written and performed; the end result, as Jeannette Catsoulis wrote for NPR, is “A shimmering exploration of romantic obsession and the tension between fitting in and flying free.”Watch TrailerThe Constant Gardener (2005)  84%There’s no political thriller quite like a John le Carré political thriller, and The Constant Gardener&nbsp;presents Oscar-winning proof. Weisz took home a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her work in the role of Tessa Abbott-Quayle, a woman whose marriage to a British diplomat stationed in Kenya (Ralph Fiennes) comes to a sudden and tragic end — sparking an investigation that reveals startling truths about the nature of their relationship and who she really was. “This is not a movie that will shock you or thrill you or rock your world,” wrote Tom Long for the Detroit News. “Instead, it will move you, it will stick with you, it will give you pause and affect you in ways not easily described — which is something the best films always do.”Watch TrailerThe Lobster (2016)  87%We’ve all seen countless couples fall in love onscreen, and at this point, it takes a truly special movie to raise the stakes for a relationship in any memorably meaningful way. Enter Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Lobster, which imagines a weirdly dystopian world in which lonely hearts congregate at a hotel for 45 days to find a match — and if they don’t find one, they’re magically turned into the animal of their choice. Our protagonist (Colin Farrell) chooses a lobster, and for a time, it looks like he might just end up gaining a pair of claws and spending the rest of his life in the sea; fortunately, his journey takes an unexpected turn involving a near-sighted woman (Weisz) who… well, we don’t want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say you may never look at courtship rituals the same way. “The Lobster is a droll piece of work lashed with grim humor,” wrote Stephanie Zacharek for TIME. “For every moment that makes you laugh, there may be another that leaves you with your mouth hanging open.”Watch TrailerPage Eight (2011)  93%With this BBC-produced political thriller, Weisz found herself in some pretty stellar company: in addition to her own formidable gifts, the cast included Judy Davis, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, Tom Hughes, and Bill Nighy — and it was written and directed by the playwright Sir David Hare, stepping behind the cameras for the first time since 1989’s Strapless.&nbsp;The plot revolves around an MI5 agent (Nighy) whose involvement with a Syrian-born activist (Weisz) dovetails with his efforts to undermine a Prime Minister (Fiennes) who’s been in collusion with another agent (Davis) — vintage British espionage fare, in other words, especially when you factor in a subplot involving classified information surrounding Weisz’s brother’s death. “I’d happily watch this cast read the phone book,” wrote Maureen Ryan for the Huffington Post. “But fortunately the script by David Hare (who also directed) is intelligent, engaging and generally makes good use of this singular cast’s talents.”Watch TrailerAbout a Boy (2002)  93%What could be better than whiling away your hours in unearned leisure, cashing royalty checks for a song you didn’t even have to write, and idly pursuing a life of serial monogamy? On the evidence of About a Boy, we’d have to answer “dating Rachel Weisz,” because that’s what ultimately cures independently wealthy layabout Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) of his terminal lack of ambition — but only, of course, after he’s lured out of his complacent solitude by an unexpected friendship with a 12-year-old boy (Nicholas Hoult) and his mom (Toni Collette). “Mainstream comedies,” argued David Edelstein for Slate, “should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"DC, CBS","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31150143/Rachel-Weisz-Recall.jpg","slug":"rachel-weiszs-best-movies"},{"id":"47508960892231","title":"Best-Reviewed Live-Action Disney Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best-Reviewed Live-Action Disney MoviesWe take a look back at the Mouse House's best live-action efforts.by Jeff Giles | August 10, 2016 |  CommentsWe tend to think of Walt Disney Pictures as chiefly an animation studio – and with good reason – but the house Uncle Walt built has churned out quality (and often highly profitable) live-action entertainment since the ‘50s, and judging from the early reviews, this weekend’s Pete’s Dragon&nbsp;remake is ready to continue that time-honored tradition. What better time, then, for your pals here at Rotten Tomatoes to devote a Total Recall list to the 12 best-reviewed live-action entries in the Disney canon?Of course, not all of Disney’s live-action efforts have been critical winners – we’re guessing Condorman is discussed as infrequently as possible at the Mouse House – but not everything that missed the list was a dud: You’ll find plenty of the classics you remember (yes, Old Yeller is present and accounted for), but you’re bound to take umbrage with a few omissions. Some movies missed the cut on technicalities – we limited our scope to films without animation (so long, Bedknobs and Broomsticks) and crossed any co-productions off the list, too (thus sparing Operation Dumbo Drop the embarrassment of being disqualified on critical grounds). Others, however, simply didn’t have the reviews – something we think says a lot about the strength of the competition. So let’s see what we ended up with, shall we? The live-action world of Disney awaits!&nbsp;Escape to Witch Mountain (1975)  76%While perhaps not the best-remembered of Disney’s ’70s properties, this adaptation of the Alexander Key novel helped kickstart a mini-franchise that eventually extended to 1978’s Return from Witch Mountain, a 1982 TV movie and 1995 made-for-TV remake, and, of course, 2009’s big-screen reboot Race to Witch Mountain. Placing extraordinary kids in situations of nail-biting, grown-up peril is something Disney has always done well, and Escape is no exception; psychic alien twins Tony and Tia are literally running for their lives from creepy millionaire Aristotle Bolt (Ray Milland). Though not all critics were susceptible to its charm — Vincent Canby of the New York Times called it “a Walt Disney production for children who will watch absolutely anything that moves” — most scribes took its popcorn-flavored blend of action, sci-fi, and family drama at face value, including Roger Ebert, who called it “A sci fi thriller that’s fun, that’s cheerfully implausible, that’s scary but not too scary, and it works.”Watch TrailerSwiss Family Robinson (1960)  82%Even in the context of the other classic films in the Disney vaults, 1960’s Swiss Family Robinson was a huge success — its $40 million gross is equivalent to $367 million in today’s money, placing it proudly among the ranks of the most successful G-rated films of all time. Johann David Wyss’ 1812 novel has been adapted on numerous occasions, for film and television, but Disney’s Ken Annakin-directed treatment is the most well-known; although it doesn’t skimp on the cheesy dialogue and cornpone wholesomeness that came prepackaged with many of the studio’s live-action efforts, Lowell S. Hawley’s screenplay does a fine job of drawing enough swashbuckling action and tropical derring-do out of the source material to guarantee a good time for viewers of all (okay, most) ages. Channel 4 Film’s Alistair Harkness spoke for many of his peers when he wrote, “It’s no Pirates Of The Caribbean, but the spirit of adventure, and Disney’s high production values, means that there’s still some fun to be had watching this wholesome family adapt to island life.”Watch TrailerThe Absent-Minded Professor (1961)  83%No list of the Disney live-action oeuvre would be complete without a mention of Fred MacMurray’s work for the studio. Although he’d been a major film star for decades before making his Disney debut with 1960’s The Shaggy Dog, it’s MacMurray’s late-period string of pipe-puffing father types that he’s arguably best remembered for, particularly among younger film fans. The most critically successful of these movies, 1961’s The Absent-Minded Professor, casts MacMurray in the title role as Ned Brainard, the accidental inventor of an incredible energy-producing substance known as Flubber. Over the course of the film, Brainerd uses Flubber to make himself look like a talented dancer and helps an entire basketball team cheat during the big game, but thanks to MacMurray’s everyman charm, you still believe he’s the good guy. It’s goofy and light as a feather, but Disney has always known how to make the most of those two ingredients; as TV Guide put it, “This is a zanily inventive piece of work, with delightful special effects, which set the style for a long series of live-action Disney films.”Watch TrailerPollyanna (1960)  86%Hayley Mills, like Tommy Kirk before her (and countless fresh-faced Disney teen starlets after her), became a household name thanks to a string of starring roles in Disney live-action films. Mills’ six-movie run got off to a pretty good start with 1960’s Pollyanna; although its box office performance was initially something of a disappointment for the studio, Mills won a special Academy Award for her performance. For many, the film is now considered one of Disney’s earliest live-action classics; though Disney was far from the first to adapt Eleanor Porter’s novel, it’s Mills that people usually think of when they hear the name “Pollyanna” — and for good reason, as even critics who overdosed on the movie’s relentless optimism, like the Time critic who called it “a Niagara of drivel and a masterpiece of smarm,” were often swayed by her performance. Variety, for instance, said her presence “more than compensates for the film’s lack of tautness and, at certain points, what seems to be an uncertain sense of direction.”Watch TrailerThe Rookie (2002)  84%By 2002, the “inspirational sports movie” genre was seen as well past its prime — and so was Dennis Quaid: one of the more bankable matinee idols of the ’80s, Quaid was suffering through a dry spell when he signed on for Disney’s John Lee Hancock-directed dramatization of the brief-yet-noteworthy Major League Baseball career of high school teacher-turned-Tampa Bay Devil Ray pitcher Jimmy Morris. Like Morris himself, The Rookie was initially written off by many as an amiable relic of a bygone era — but try as they might, most critics were too charmed by its true-life inspirational story, and Quaid’s refreshingly low-key performance, to be cynical about the film. The Rookie earned a healthy return on Disney’s $22 million investment, kick-started a new chapter in Quaid’s career, and earned a surprising number of endorsements from critics like Looking Closer’s Jeffrey Overstreet, who called it “one of those rare, wonderful ‘formula’ films that … favors understatement over exaggeration, subtlety over sentimentality.”Watch TrailerCinderella (2015)  83%A fairy godmother, a handsome prince, and happily ever after — once upon a time, if you had those three ingredients, you could bank on making an audience of young girls very happy. Those days are long over, of course, which might be a problem for Disney if they hadn’t embraced the opportunity to reinterpret the fairy tales that made them a household name, adding depth of character and a postmodern spin to the stories. Case in point: 2015’s Cinderella, starring Lily James as the titular princess in a lavish live-action production helmed by Kenneth Branagh and rounded out by Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, and Game of Thrones vet Richard Madden. Not as cartoonish as Disney’s animated Cinderella, yet nowhere near as grim as some of the more revisionist takes on the tale, Branagh’s film presented a less traditional — yet still wholeheartedly magical — side of the story that, in some critics’ eyes, surpassed the studio’s first attempt. “Sixty-five years after a ‘classic’ animated feature that missed the mark, Disney finally got Cinderella right,” wrote Time’s Richard Corliss. “For now and, happily, ever after.”Watch TrailerPete's Dragon (2016)  88%Remakes can get a pretty bad rap, but if you’re going to take a second pass at a movie, it might as well be one with plenty of room for improvement. The original Pete’s Dragon, released in 1977, was one of a handful of Disney flicks to blend live-action footage and animation — a thrillingly novel combination in its day, but not enough to patch over the generally hokey air about the rest of the production. It left an agreeably low bar for director David Lowery to clear with the 2016 version, which does away with some of the first film’s elements — including its early 1900s setting, musical numbers, and cartoonish yokel villains — while retaining the essential magic in the story of a lonely little boy and his magical companion. Aided by beautiful visual effects and a terrific cast led by Robert Redford, Bryce Dallas Howard, and young Oakes Fegley, Lowery’s Dragon took flight with critics, who applauded its seemingly effortless blend of modern storytelling and old-school charm. “The film,” wrote the A.V. Club’s A.A. Dowd, “overhauls its source material into a soulful recovery fable for kids, establishing in the process that bad movies — the kind that squander their premises — are much more ripe for remaking than good ones.”Watch TrailerThe Parent Trap (1961)  90%For a relatively lightweight rom-com, The Parent Trap has enjoyed an incredibly long life; not only was the original film re-released to theaters seven years after its theatrical debut, but Hayley Mills ended up reprising her dual roles for a trio of made-for-TV sequels more than 20 years later — and the career-boosting power of the story of matchmaking twins who play Cupid for their divorced parents proved every bit as potent in 1998, when Lindsay Lohan starred in a remake. Part of Trap‘s appeal no doubt came from its pioneering use of the trick photography that made it appear as though Mills was actually her own twin — a technique later used to notable effect on The Patty Duke Show&nbsp;two years later — but even without special effects, The Parent Trap is a solid albeit proudly corny film that benefits from a strong performance by its winsome star. Mills’ charms were even sufficient to win over more “serious” publications, such as Time, whose reviewer wrote, “Surprisingly, the film is delightful — mostly because of 15-year-old Hayley Mills, the blonde button nose who played the endearing delinquent in Tiger Bay.”Watch Trailer20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)  89%Whether you attribute it to beginner’s luck or the steady hand of one of Hollywood’s most quality-conscious studios, it’s worth noting that Richard Fleischer’s adaptation of Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is both one of Disney’s most highly regarded live-action efforts and its first foray into science fiction. Proving he had an eye for giant squid battles to match his knack for animating adorable fauna, Walt Disney personally produced 20,000 Leagues, helping Fleischer blend an attentive eye to period detail with a rip-roaring action yarn that just happened to have strong Cold War parallels (right down to the mushroom cloud witnessed after the climactic battle). Enlisting the talents of A-list stars like Kirk Douglas, James Mason, and Peter Lorre certainly didn’t hurt Leagues‘ box-office prospects — nor did glowingly positive reviews from the likes of the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who called it “As fabulous and fantastic as anything [Disney] has ever done in cartoons.”That Darn Cat! (1965)  94%Younger filmgoers may be more familiar with the 1997 remake, starring Christina Ricci and Doug E. Doug — which, as illustrated by that film’s woeful 7 percent Tomatometer rating, is a shame. The 1965 original, starring Hayley Mills as the owner of a robbery-foiling feline (and the immortal Frank Gorshin as the robber), was a perfect example of the sort of goofy, animal-assisted middlebrow flick that Disney’s live-action arm became known for in the ’60s — but if it’s silly stuff, it’s at least eminently well-crafted, thanks to the steady hand of director Robert Stevenson and charming performances from a cast that included Disney vets Mills and Dean Jones. Critics were kind, if not exactly effusive (Rob Thomas of Madison’s Capital Times waved it off as “lightweight, forgettable family fun”) — but it was the titular cat that earned some of the movie’s highest warmest praise, including high marks from the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who said “The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. Clark Gable at the peak of his performing never played a tom cat more winningly.”Watch TrailerThe Jungle Book (2016)  94%Did the world really need another Jungle Book movie in 2016? It’s definitely debatable, considering the number of times Rudyard Kipling’s classic had already been adapted — including Disney’s own animated classic and the live-action version the studio released starring Jason Scott Lee in 1994. But it’s hard to argue with results, and despite a near-universal familiarity with the story, the Jungle Book re-remake managed to wow critics while raking in nearly a billion dollars at the box office. With director Jon Favreau at the helm, the 2016 edition held steadfastly to the story’s bittersweet, family-friendly charm while giving the special effects a thrilling 21st-century update that left even the most cynical critics gawping at their digitally induced realism. Add an all-star voice cast that included Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, and Idris Elba, and you’ve got a critical and commercial winner that the Los Angeles Times’ Kenneth Turan described as “the kind of family film calculated to make even those without families wish they had one to take along.”Watch TrailerOld Yeller (1957)  100%A movie so successful that it spawned a sequel, Tommy Kirk’s career, and the heartbreaking on-screen deaths of dozens of beloved critters, Old Yeller is mostly remembered today for its tearjerking final act and cornpone dialogue — and although this Robert Stevenson-directed adaptation of Fred Gipson’s popular novel certainly doesn’t skimp on the familiar plot points and gooey nostalgia so often identified with the Disney films of the era, it also tries to impart some useful lessons about the tough choices that come with growing up. Those lessons were imparted to a huge audience, too — watching Old Yeller was a rite of passage for multiple generations of filmgoers, among them DVDTalk’s Scott Weinberg, who called it “Every bit the warm, comfortable, and tragically bittersweet classic that had you sobbing like a infant the first time you saw it.”Watch TrailerNever Cry Wolf (1983)  100%The best-reviewed of Disney’s late ’70s/early ’80s string of family-friendly live-action flicks, Never Cry Wolf offers a surprisingly mature, unflinching adaptation of Farley Mowat’s memoir detailing the years he spent studying the hunting habits of wolves in the Canadian wilderness. One year later, Disney would spin off Touchstone, an imprint which would eventually be responsible for some fairly racy fare, but in 1983, Wolf director Carroll Ballard’s decision to afford audiences a glimpse of Charles Martin Smith’s bare buttocks was a major step for the Mouse House. Though the film wasn’t a giant hit, it did manage an impressive 27-week theatrical run — all the more notable considering its small cast, exceedingly minimal dialogue, and deliberate pace. Critics were suitably impressed, sending Never Cry Wolf all the way to a 100 percent Tomatometer rating on the strength of reviews from scribes like Time’s Richard Schickel, who raved, “Ballard and his masterly crew of film makers have reimagined a corner of the natural world… They leave us awed.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"live, cooking, cars, teaser, Tubi, Mary, in, FXX, children's, motion, school","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/10145433/Cinderella-Live-Disney-Total-Recall.jpg","slug":"best-reviewed-live-action-disney-movies"},{"id":"47508960890182","title":"Jonah Hill’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jonah Hill's Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look back at the most acclaimed work of the War Dogs star.by Jeff Giles | August 17, 2016 |  CommentsWith this weekend’s War Dogs, Jonah Hill teams up with Miles Teller to tell the reality-inspired tale of two guys out to strike it rich as arms dealers. It’s just the latest in a series of eclectic roles for Hill, who made his name as a member of the Apatow comedy stable before branching out into more dramatic fare, and we’re here to celebrate it with a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from his growing filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!&nbsp;Funny People (2009)  69%Years after they roomed together as young comics with showbiz dreams, Adam Sandler and writer/director/producer Judd Apatow reunited for 2009’s Funny People, which surrounded Sandler with a crowd of comedic talent that included multiple members of the Apatow stable — including Seth Rogen, who plays an aspiring comedian who lucks into a friendship with Sandler’s embittered superstar, and Hill, who plays Rogen’s roommate and a fellow veteran of the stand-up circuit whose own career ambitions end up getting tangled in the complicated relationship between Rogen and Sandler’s characters. The movie’s 146-minute length turned off a number of critics, but it was just right for Ben Lyons of At the Movies, who wrote that “Apatow has always found a balance of heart and humor in his best films, and Funny People is no exception.”Watch TrailerGet Him to the Greek (2010)  72%Hill and Russell Brand triggered a few laughs during their scenes together in Forgetting Sarah Marshall&nbsp;— so when it was decided that Brand would reprise his character in the Marshall&nbsp;spinoff Get Him to the Greek, it was only natural that the duo should be reunited. Here, Brand’s Aldous Snow must be shepherded to a crucial gig through a landmine of bad decisions and irresponsible behavior, with responsibility for his whereabouts falling to an increasingly overmatched label rep played by Hill. “The movie’s a good, rude commercial comedy,” argued the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips. “How many good movies have we even seen this year?”Watch TrailerThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013)  79%Hill earned his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in The Wolf of Wall Street, a luridly over-the-top Martin Scorsese epic that uses the real-life exploits of disgraced stockbroker Jordan Belfort as the launchpad for a wild-eyed look at modern capitalism — and three hours of drug-fueled insanity. Always entertaining as part of a duo, Hill turns in some of his best work as a foil for Leonardo DiCaprio’s Belfort, playing the comparatively less unscrupulous part in a gonzo dramatization of one of Wall Street’s more infamous cautionary tales. “For three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch. You never forget you’re at the circus,” Wesley Morris wrote for Grantland. “You never lose sight of the lawlessness, the reckless pleasure, the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation.”Watch TrailerCyrus (2010)  80%The 21st century has brought us no shortage of comedies about schlubby man-children, but Cyrus&nbsp;is something different. Rather than going broad and over-the-top with the story of an overgrown mama’s boy (Hill) who plants himself squarely between his mom (Marisa Tomei) and her well-meaning new suitor (John C. Reilly), writer-directors Jay and Mark Duplass gave their seemingly tired premise a fresh mumblecore spin, playing up the sphincter-tightening awkwardness of the situation and trusting their talented cast to imbue the characters with three-dimensional honesty. “I’ve seldom seen,” mused the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, “a film in which three intelligent, articulate people make so many penetrating observations about themselves, and address their bizarre situation so directly, without providing, or indeed possessing, the slightest clue.”Watch TrailerThis Is the End (2013)  83%We’ve seen plenty of movies about the end of civilization, but they’ve all focused on the apocalyptic problems of ordinary people while neglecting to imagine what those last few days on earth might be like for celebrities. Enter This Is the End, which imagines what it might be like if disaster struck Los Angeles while James Franco was hosting a house party. Featuring Hill, Franco, Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Danny McBride — among plenty of others — playing fictionalized (and generally obnoxious) versions of themselves, it combines a fresh take on the apocalyptic comedy with the fun of watching movie stars make fun of themselves. As J.R. Jones argued for the Chicago Reader, “Their big joke is to literalize the Book of Revelations, but snaking around this is a biting contempt for the entertainment business, their own bad movies, and the social privilege these confer.”Watch Trailer21 Jump Street (2012)  85% /&nbsp;22 Jump Street (2014)  84%A movie about a TV show that wasn’t exactly a classic in the first place has no business being awesome, and a buddy-cop picture doesn’t seem like the most natural environment for testing out Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill’s screen chemistry. All of which is pretty much exactly why the Jump Street&nbsp;franchise has had such a blockbuster time of it on the big screen: the duo’s easy banter, coupled with the freewheeling attitude of a pair of films that went meta on their medium in increasingly bonkers ways, added up to two critical and commercial hits. Whether we’ll ever get that rumored Jump Street/Men in Black&nbsp;crossover remains an open question, but for now, we’ve got the movies that moved the Atlantic’s Christopher Orr to write, “Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick, having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream&nbsp;and Austin Powers, but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor.”Watch TrailerHail, Caesar! (2016)  85%The Coen brothers have a terrific eye for talent and enough clout to hire just about any actor they see fit, so the opportunity to star in one of their films isn’t something many stars would take lightly — even if the role in question isn’t necessarily the biggest in the movie. For example, here’s Hail, Caesar!, a Coens spectacular that uses a bustling ensemble of famous faces (including George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Scarlett Johansson, and — you guessed it — Jonah Hill) to tell the madcap tale of a doofus actor in ’50s Hollywood who gets himself kidnapped, spurring his studio to enlist the efforts of their in-house fixer (inspired by real-life movie biz legend Eddie Mannix) to secure his return. That description just scratches the surface of an old-school singing, dancing extravaganza that simultaneously celebrates and sends up old-school cinema; if the end result is a little unwieldy, most critics felt its deficiencies were far more than outweighed by its charms. “This,” opined Richard Roeper for the Chicago Sun-Times, “is one of my favorite movies ever made about making movies.”Watch TrailerSuperbad (2007)  88%A high school loss-of-virginity flick in the grand tradition of Fast Times at Ridgemont High&nbsp;and American Pie, Superbad&nbsp;teamed Hill and Michael Cera with newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse as desperately horny teens on a quest to secure booze for a house party. It may have been embarrassingly familiar, but screenwriter Seth Rogen and his writing partner, Evan Goldberg, nonetheless managed to squeeze fresh laughs (and plenty of ticket receipts) from it — not to mention kudos from critics like the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, who wrote, “for pure laughs, for the experience of just sitting in a chair and breaking up every minute or so, Superbad&nbsp;is 2007’s most successful comedy.”Watch TrailerKnocked Up (2007)  89%After making a brief appearance in Judd Apatow’s 40-Year-Old Virgin, Hill took on a more substantial role in the follow-up, Knocked Up, which paired rumpled slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) with gorgeous E! Network employee Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) for a look at what can happen when you head to a club, have a few too many drinks, and don’t give a lot of thought to who comes home with you. (This is Hollywood, of course, so what ends up happening is everlasting love, but not before a lot of funnier, more unpleasant consequences.) An enormous box office success, Knocked Up&nbsp;offered Hill an opportunity to reel off a few funny lines, cemented Apatow’s standing as a purveyor of fine adult comedies, and earned the adoration of critics such as Stephanie Zacharek of Salon, who called it “Hilarious from moment to moment, but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting. This is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we’ve done so.”Watch TrailerMoneyball (2011)  94%As a (freakishly entertaining) by-the-numbers account of how the Oakland A’s used newly adapted metrics to turn conventional baseball wisdom on its head, Michael Lewis’ Moneyball&nbsp;seemed like one of the least cinematic bestsellers to have its film rights optioned by a major studio — and after directors David Frankel and Steven Soderbergh departed the project, it looked like it might be destined for the scrap heap. But with Bennett Miller behind the cameras and Hill demonstrating his Oscar-nominated dramatic chops opposite Brad Pitt — not to mention an Aaron Sorkin screenplay — it ended up being not only a six-time Academy Awards nominee, but a $110 million box office hit. “Baseball fans know this story,” admitted USA Today’s Claudia Puig, “but Miller puts it all in fascinating context. This is a thinking person’s baseball movie, a more complex version of the inspirational sports story.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"It, popular, Prime, Mirror, politics, Nat, and, batman, Pixar, Us, Lifetime, Poppins, Stephen","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/17135352/Jonah-Hill-Recall.jpg","slug":"jonah-hills-best-movies"},{"id":"47508960903500","title":"Anna Kendrick’s Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Anna Kendrick's Best-Reviewed MoviesWe run down the Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates star's most acclaimed films.by Jeff Giles | July 6, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend’s Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates uses real-life events as the loose inspiration for some R-rated fun with a pair of clueless bros and the hard-partying women who hoodwink them into a date to their little sister’s nuptials. And since one of the young ladies in question is played by the ever-charming Anna Kendrick, we decided this would be a great time to take a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights from her career thus far. Hold on to your cups — it’s time for Total Recall!Into the Woods (2014)  71%Stephen Sondheim fans were concerned when word got out that Disney was bringing his Tony-winning musical Into the Woods&nbsp;to the big screen — chiefly because it seemed likely that the studio would lop off the less family-friendly elements of its twisted fairy tale story. Like any adaptation, the film version wasn’t exactly the same as its source material, but happily for Sondheim enthusiasts — and those who like a little dark fantasy mixed in with their musicals — Woods&nbsp;survived its journey to theaters largely intact. As Cinderella, Kendrick upped the superstar quotient of the robust ensemble assembled by director Rob Marshall, which also included Meryl Streep as a witch, Emily Blunt as a woman desperate to undo her curse, and Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf. “Some of the musical’s superfans will feel shortchanged by the movie no matter what, but you have to give credit where it’s due,” warned the Washington Post’s Stephanie Merry. “The adaptation is pretty faithful to the original — for better and worse.”Watch TrailerThe Voices (2015)  74%For most films, making your main protagonist an employee at a bathtub factory would more than fulfill the weirdness quotient. But for 2015’s The Voices, that’s just the beginning of a surreal odyssey into bloody violence and black comedy — oh, and talking pets. Directed by acclaimed graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi by a script from Paranormal Activity 2&nbsp;co-writer Michael R. Perry, The Voices&nbsp;stars Ryan Reynolds as an unhinged loner with some very dark secrets to hide — and Kendrick as a potential love interest who stands to make some disturbing discoveries. While its main character’s warped descent into a bleak, chaotic psychological abyss definitely isn’t for all viewers, those with a taste for the strange have found the end results intoxicating; as Sara Stewart wrote for the New York Post, it adds up to a “tonally wild indie, which is nearly too horrifying to be funny — but not quite.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Happy Christmas (2014)  76%Kendrick reunited with Drinking Buddies&nbsp;writer-director Joe Swanberg for 2014’s Happy Christmas, in which a young woman at an emotional crossroads decides to crash with her older brother — and her arrival triggers an uncomfortable upheaval in his life of domestic bliss. Like a lot of Swanberg pictures, Christmas&nbsp;coalesces around a series of low-key, largely improvised moments, but with enough of a dramatic throughline to elevate the proceedings beyond their familiar narrative underpinnings. “All in all,” wrote the Los Angeles Times’ Betsy Sharkey, “Happy Christmas is a good deal like cartoon Charlie Brown’s classic tree — scraggly, plenty of heart and much to enjoy, especially if you prefer your presents homemade.”Watch TrailerPitch Perfect (2012)  81%Anna Kendrick can make a hundred movies, but for many filmgoers, she’ll probably always be most strongly identified with the Pitch Perfect&nbsp;series, and it’s easy to understand why. The fizzy charm of the 2012 original, starring Kendrick as a reluctant college freshman who stumbles into harmony with a campus a cappella group, exploded into a surprise $115 million hit — not only at the box office, but on the pop charts, where she scored a Top 10 single with “Cups,” her cover of the Carter Family classic “When I’m Gone.” The 2015 sequel (which added Hailee Steinfeld to an ace ensemble that already included Rebel Wilson) more than doubled its predecessor’s theatrical gross, and a third installment is already scheduled for 2017. Most critics have shared the audience’s evident enthusiasm for the franchise; as Connie Ogle wrote in her review of the original for the Miami Herald, “If you’re not grinning by the end of this light, funny crowd-pleaser, consider yourself tone deaf.”Watch TrailerScott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010)  82%After catching Hollywood’s eye in Up in the Air&nbsp;— and while she was still popping up in the Twilight&nbsp;franchise — Kendrick played the sister of the title character in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Edgar Wright’s adaptation of the Bryan Lee O’Malley graphic novels about a bass player (Michael Cera) who has to battle, video game style, past his new lady love’s exes in order to win her affection. Stuffed with fun pop culture nods and stacked with a cast that also included Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Brie Larson, and Aubrey Plaza, Pilgrim&nbsp;opened to surprising critical indifference, but it earned the affection of critics like Slate’s Dana Stevens, who called it “A package of cinematic Pop Rocks, a neon-hued, defiantly non-nutritive confection that nonetheless makes you laugh at its sheer bold novelty.”Watch TrailerDrinking Buddies (2013)  84%The first of several films Kendrick’s made with the incredibly prolific Joe Swanberg, Drinking Buddies&nbsp;centers on the professional and romantic travails of a young Chicago foursome (rounded out by Olivia Wilde, Jake Johnson, and Ron Livingston), two of whom are co-workers at a local brewery. It might sound like a slim nail on which to hang a rom-com, but most critics thought it added up to some pretty engaging stuff — particularly since, as per Swanberg custom, the actors improvised their dialogue around the outline of the story. Filmed in a real working brewery (by actors drinking real beer), Drinking Buddies&nbsp;won over critics who’d already seen enough rom-coms for several lifetimes; as Moira MacDonald wrote for the Seattle Times, it “Sneaks up on you…you think it’s going in one direction, and suddenly it goes somewhere much more interesting.”Watch TrailerRocket Science (2007)  84%You’ve probably watched more coming-of-age stories than you can count, but in the right hands, it’s a formula that can pay powerful dividends. Case in point: 2007’s Rocket Science, a teen dramedy about a high school student (Reece Thompson) whose stuttering makes it difficult to feel like he fits in — until he meets the star of the school’s debate team (Kendrick), who convinces him to sign up. Kendrick earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for her work, which offered an intriguing prelude to the bigger-budget work looming in her future; calling the results “Self-consciously quirky on the outside,” Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek wrote, “this gentle teenage fable has an affecting, openhearted core.”Watch TrailerEnd of Watch (2012)  85%Cops versus gangbangers on the mean city streets! It’s a story Hollywood’s told countless times, but with End of Watch, director David Ayer still found a way to make it feel somewhat new. His success is due in no small part to this 2012 crime drama’s terrific cast, led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña as LAPD partners working the South Central beat. Kendrick, as Gyllenhaal’s significant other, has more of a stock part, but — like her castmates — she infused what could have been a two-dimensional character with new life. “End of Watch&nbsp;is one thriller where the adrenaline rush, considerable as it is, is almost always put in the service of character,” observed NPR’s Bob Mondello. “Happily, the character on display turns out to be considerable, too.”Watch TrailerUp in the Air (2009)  90%Kendrick earned an Academy Award nomination for her work in this Jason Reitman dramedy, which put its finger on the pulse of the Great Recession with a story about a corporate downsizer (George Clooney) whose unencumbered, jet-setting lifestyle is thrown off its axis by the arrival of a new HR consultant (Kendrick) whose plans for the company threaten to make him obsolete. Its themes cut uncomfortably close for a number of viewers in uncertain economic times, but Up in the Air&nbsp;leavened the gloom with intelligent observations on modern culture — and even a bit of hope. “Timeliness can be tricky to pull off convincingly in movies,” wrote Claudia Puig for USA Today. “It’s tough to capture an era while it’s still happening, yet Up in the Air&nbsp;does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity.”Watch Trailer50/50 (2011)  93%Although Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were unquestionably the leads in 50/50, this 2011 “cancer comedy” — starring Gordon-Levitt as a guy who gets through his cancer diagnosis with a lot of help from his best buddy Rogen — was really rounded out by a pretty stellar ensemble. Kendrick joined the cast as Katherine, a medical therapist who develops a deeply personal relationship with Gordon-Levitt’s character, winsomely lowering the bro quotient in a deceptively thoughtful look at disease that earned nearly universal critical acclaim. “What ensues is Beaches&nbsp;meets Pineapple Express,” wrote Mary Elizabeth Williams for Salon. “Which, I’ve got to tell you, is pretty much what living with cancer is like.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"doctor, Family","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/06142719/Anna-Kendrick-Recall.jpg","slug":"anna-kendricks-best-reviewed-movies"},{"id":"47508962596175","title":"Mark Ruffalo’s Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Mark Ruffalo's Best-Reviewed MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at the most critically acclaimed work of the Now You See Me 2 star.by Jeff Giles | June 8, 2016 |  CommentsFew of us will ever have the opportunity to hang out with Mark Ruffalo in real life, but he’s one of those actors whose screen presence feels so honest and effortlessly down-to-earth that you can’t help feeling like you sort of know him. All that charm may not help his latest release, Now You See Me 2, achieve Certified Fresh status, but no matter — we’re using its arrival as our long-overdue excuse for taking a fond look back at some of his brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall!Begin Again (2014)  83%With 2007’s Once, writer-director John Carney proved himself a deft hand with musically driven romantic drama — and then he went and did it again seven years later with Begin Again. Sunnier and poppier than its predecessor, it finds Carney telling the tale of a record exec (Ruffalo) who’s at loose ends in his personal and professional lives when he happens across a rough-edged singer/songwriter (Keira Knightley) whose gifts inspire him to… well, you get the idea. It’s sweet, crowd-pleasing stuff, and if it hits some of the same beats Carney played with Once, they land with irresistible sincerity. “There are times when the thing you want most is not a big, important movie but a simple, beautiful story told with sensitivity, warmth, humor and a big heart,” observed TheWrap’s Steve Pond. “Times when you don’t need a movie to save your life, you just need a movie to make you feel good.”Watch TrailerCollateral (2004)  86%Michael Mann’s Collateral was largely sold as a two-hander pitting Tom Cruise (as a hitman hired to murder witnesses and a prosecutor in a court case) against Jamie Foxx (as the cab driver he hires to drive him to the killings). Really, though, this sleek thriller took more than a couple of big-name stars — for one thing, as in other Mann productions, Los Angeles essentially served as a supporting character, and for another, Cruise and Foxx were ably abetted by a talented ensemble that included Jada Pinkett Smith, Javier Bardem, and (as the cop who ends up on their tail) Mark Ruffalo. It all added up to what the Washington Post’s Stephen Hunter called “The best kind of genre filmmaking: It plays by the rules, obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once.”Watch TrailerFoxcatcher (2014)  87%Moneyball&nbsp;director Bennett Miller brought his knack for adapting real-life stories to bear on a decidedly darker tale with 2014’s Foxcatcher, which dramatizes multimillionaire heir John E. du Pont’s stranger-than-fiction descent into mental illness — and the terrible impact it had on the lives of Olympic wrestling champion Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and his brother Dave (Ruffalo). Joined by Steve Carell as du Pont, Ruffalo and Tatum anchored a film whose painful conclusion can be felt from the first few moments, but still exerts an inexorable grip. As Peter Rainer wrote for the Christian Science Monitor, “It’s rare to see an American movie that explores, let alone acknowledges, the class system in this country, or one that gets so far inside the abyss of the ethic that drives so many men to succeed — and to implode when they don’t.”Watch TrailerZodiac (2007)  89%In the hands of an ordinary filmmaker, any attempt to tell the story of the Zodiac Killer might have been equal parts conjecture and garden-variety gore — after all, the serial murderer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area for years in the 1960s and 1970s, taunting the police with a series of cryptic letters, eventually disappeared, never to be identified. For director David Fincher, though, the truly interesting story didn’t lie so much with the Zodiac as it did with the men and women who devoted themselves to apprehending him — particularly Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), the San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist who broke the Zodiac’s code and eventually became an asset to the investigation led by police detective Dave Toschi (Ruffalo). Gyllenhaal and Ruffalo led the viewer on a darkening spiral of dead ends, wild goose chases, and grim obsession — and anchored a showy cast that included Robert Downey, Jr., Chloe Sevigny, and Anthony Edwards. Unfortunately, the words “David Fincher” and “serial killer drama” sparked hopes that Fincher was returning to his Se7en&nbsp;roots, and the studio’s marketing campaign did nothing to set filmgoers straight; ultimately, despite a strongly positive reaction from critics, Zodiac was a non-starter at the box office, and by the time awards season arrived, this March release was all but forgotten. It deserved better, according to writers like the Toronto Star’s Geoff Pevere, who argued, “It makes you want to study it even more closely, in search of things you might have missed, trailing after leads that flash by in the relentless momentum of going nowhere fast. If you’re not careful, it might make you obsessed.”Watch TrailerMarvel's The Avengers (2012)  91%The Hulk is a creature of mindless rage and limitless strength who lurks within a mild-mannered scientist horrified by his own alter ego — all of which sounds like it should be more than compelling enough for its own film franchise. Yet after a pair of somewhat underwhelming attempts at a Hulk&nbsp;movie, it became obvious that it was going to take more than simply hiring a leading man and a fleet of CGI programmers to turn the comics legend into big-screen big green. The answer, as presented by Marvel’s The Avengers,&nbsp;was to turn the Hulk into a supporting player — and one whose human face was played by Mark Ruffalo. Over a pair of Avengers movies, Ruffalo breathed new life into his character’s cinematic fortunes, turning the split-personality brute into something much more than a wrecking ball — and although he’s just one cog in the smoothly running Marvel machine, more than a few fans have clamored for a standalone Hulk feature in the MCU. “Never,” warned CNN’s Tom Charity, “underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash.”Watch TrailerThe Kids Are All Right (2010)  92%Ruffalo received a BAFTA nomination for his work in this Lisa Cholodenko dramedy, which traces the messy fallout after a boy (Josh Hutcherson) enlists his sister (Mia Wasikowska) to find the sperm donor responsible for siring the two of them — thus setting off a chain of events that brings the man in question (Ruffalo) into the domestic orbit of the women who raised the kids (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore). It’s just as messy as it sounds, yet thanks to Cholodenko’s empathetic work — and the fine efforts of her incredible cast — The Kids Are All Right&nbsp;never teeters into indie caricature. As Ann Hornaday wrote for the Washington Post, “Just about everyone who has been a parent, child or partner will find resonance in its bittersweet depiction of the joys and trials of lifelong intimacy.”Watch TrailerEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%Ruffalo’s critically acclaimed turn in 2000’s You Can Count on Me didn’t immediately lead to a major increase in his Hollywood profile — he’d been working steadily for years leading up to the film, and he continued to log supporting turns for a few years after, many of them in ill-remembered efforts like Committed&nbsp;and The Last Castle. He picked a winner, though, in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which found him logging screen time with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (not to mention Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood) in Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry’s endearingly bizarre drama about love lost and the nature of memory. The result, wrote Owen Gleiberman for Entertainment Weekly, “may be the first movie I’ve seen that bends your brain and breaks your heart at the same time.”Watch TrailerThe Normal Heart (2014)  94%Ruffalo earned a slew of nominations (and a SAG Award) for his portrayal of an activist in director Ryan Murphy’s HBO adaptation of the Larry Kramer play, which takes a hard street-level look at the dawn of the public’s awareness of the AIDS crisis in the early 1980s. Surrounded by a sterling cast that included Julia Roberts and Alfred Molina, Ruffalo helped dramatize agonizing events that impacted real people — some of whom directly inspired the characters in the film. “You should watch,” wrote David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle, “because Larry Kramer’s play is so much more than an agitprop relic from the early years of AIDS — it is a great play that has become an even greater television film.”Watch TrailerYou Can Count On Me (2000)  95%Ruffalo found relatively steady work during his early years in Hollywood, but mainly via roles in films like The Dentist&nbsp;and a couple of Mirror, Mirror&nbsp;sequels. It wasn’t until he developed a working relationship with writer-director Kenneth Lonergan that things started to pick up — most notably with 2000’s You Can Count on Me, a small-scale, character-driven drama, written and directed by Lonergan, that eventually served as a critically lauded calling card for himself, Ruffalo, and Laura Linney (who earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work). Ruffalo doesn’t get to smash in this story about a ne’er-do-well brother whose sudden reappearance proves a mixed blessing for his sister and nephew, but his performance is infused with the same quiet soulfulness that Joss Whedon has relied on to help ground some of the Avengers&nbsp;movies’ more meaningful moments. Observed Michael Dequina for the Movie Report, “Linney and Ruffalo’s rapport is warm but raw and unsentimental, capturing the unconditional tough love dynamic that can only exist between siblings.”Watch TrailerSpotlight (2015)  97%Investigative reporting isn’t typically exciting work, but you’d never know it from watching Spotlight. Director/co-writer Tom McCarthy commanded an imposing ensemble cast for this Best Picture Academy Award winner — including Michael Keaton, Liv Schreiber, Rachel McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and (of course) Mark Ruffalo — to tell the sadly fact-based tale of the Boston Globe reporters who fought their way past systemic corruption and indifference to unearth decades of child abuse at the hands of the city’s Catholic priests, all allowed to continue while the church turned a blind eye or actively covered it up. Despite the inherently uncinematic nature of the work, and the fact that most filmgoers knew the end of the story going in, Spotlight proved positively gripping stuff — and a critical and commercial hit that racked up nearly $90 million at the box office on its way to earning six Oscar nominations (including Best Supporting Actor for Ruffalo).Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"facebook, ABC, Plus, 4/20, DC, Kaling, science, movies, streaming, sports, A&E, movies, Family, Company","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/08140441/Mark-Ruffalo-Recall.jpg","slug":"mark-ruffalos-best-reviewed-movies"},{"id":"47508962649434","title":"Definitive Sally Field Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Sally Field MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the roles that helped define the Hello, My Name is Doris star's career.by Jeff Giles | March 9, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend’s Hello, My Name Is Doris brings Sally Field back to the big screen after far too many years between leading roles, and in honor of this happy occasion, we decided to turn our attention to some of the most definitive performances in this two-time Oscar winner’s illustrious filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!Stay Hungry (1976)  67%Field started her strong 1970s run with an appearance in Bob Rafelson’s Stay Hungry, a Jeff Bridges dramedy about a layabout whose duties for a shady real estate developer lead him into a below-board deal that’s supposed to lead to the shutdown of a gym — until he falls for the gym’s receptionist and strikes up a friendship with one of the biggest bodybuilders (Arnold Schwarzenegger). It would be misleading to suggest that anything truly unexpected happens here, but Stay Hungry goes a long way on the youthful charms of its talented cast, and you can’t really go wrong with a movie that asks you to believe Schwarzenegger as a bluegrass fiddler. “It has its slack spells,” admitted Time Out’s Nigel Floyd, “but Rafelson’s sure feel for the inexpressible subtleties of emotional relationships is evident throughout.”Watch TrailerSmokey and the Bandit (1977)  80%A man, a plan, a whole bunch of beer — Smokey and the Bandit! At the time, this cheerfully knuckleheaded road-trip comedy about a scofflaw (Burt Reynolds) who bets he can speed a shipment of beer across state lines (and against the law) under the nose of a sputtering sheriff (Jackie Gleason) may have seemed like an awfully thin excuse to make a movie, but its artful blend of cornpone humor and high-octane action can be found imprinted upon the DNA of countless films to follow. Bandit inspired a pair of sequels and legions of imitators, yet while some of them may have had cooler stunts and sleeker cars, very few could come close to finding a starring duo with the breezy chemistry enjoyed by Reynolds’ Bandit and Sally Field as Carrie, the runaway bride whose spurned dimwit of a fiance just happens to be Gleason’s son. The end result, chuckled Marjorie Baumgarten for the Austin Chronicle, is “the king of the ‘good ol’ boy’ movies.”Watch TrailerNorma Rae (1979)  89%Field won her first Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of the labor heroine that Norma Rae is named for — a feisty union organizer based on Crystal Lee Sutton, the cotton mill worker whose real-life struggle to improve conditions at her factory inspired a bestselling book, not to mention countless moviegoers. When it was released in 1978, Norma Rae was a tip of the hat to the sacrifices borne by union members in the early 20th century (including Sutton, who ended up losing her job); today, it serves as a reminder that the battle for workers’ rights is far from over. Either way, it’s the movie that Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain XPress called “A beautifully made, splendidly acted film that more than achieves its aims.”Watch TrailerAbsence Of Malice (1981)  81%Media-bashing has become so trendy that you’d almost never know that being part of the Fourth Estate was once regarded as an honorable profession — a public service, even. Of course, that isn’t to say reporters haven’t always been dogged by questions of ethics — and few directors were better at framing a thorny ethical debate than Sydney Pollack. In Absence of Malice, Paul Newman plays the son of a Mafia boss who is outed as the subject of a murder investigation by an ambitious (and somewhat scruple-deficient) reporter played by Sally Field. Though a large number of critics felt Pollack and screenwriter Kurt Luedtke failed to present a truly compelling picture — and some, like Dennis Schwartz of Ozus’ World Movie Reviews, dismissed it as a “well-meaning liberal message story” — others praised its strong performances and overall intelligence. As James Rocchi wrote, “the ultimate conclusion of the film will leave you thoughtful and even perhaps a touch sad — rare for any film, and even more rare for a thriller.”Watch TrailerPlaces in the Heart (1984)  89%Field won a Best Actress Oscar and John Malkovich earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for their work in this 1984 drama, which tells the story of a widowed woman who struggles to keep her Texas farm afloat during the Great Depression while her sister (Lindsay Crouse) deals with her crumbling marriage to a carouser (Ed Harris). The kind of film whose plot doesn’t seem to cover a lot of ground, but which deals with some unmistakably weighty themes (in this case racism, adultery, and family commitment), Places in the Heart wasn’t necessarily one of the most exciting pictures of the year, but it was an Academy favorite — Field’s Best Actress win prompted her oft-lampooned “you like me” speech — and a source of admiration for critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote, “Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ‘mortgage’ melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.”Watch TrailerMurphy's Romance (1985)  73%Even back in 1985, they weren’t making ’em like Murphy’s Romance anymore — which would be reason enough to celebrate this quiet, small-town tale of a divorced single mom who finds love with an older man even if it didn’t serve as a showcase for the talents of Sally Field and James Garner. Predictably, Field (who also served as a producer) had to fight to get it made her way, up to insisting on casting Garner (who earned an Oscar nomination for his work), but she was vindicated by the overall favorable reviews that greeted Murphy’s Romance during its reasonably successful box-office run. “The whole point of this movie,” observed Roger Ebert, “is how it looks at those characters, and listens to them, and allows them to live in a specific time and place.”Watch TrailerSoapdish (1991)  71%The over-the-top melodrama of soaps is part of their enduring appeal, but what if things were just as crazy behind the scenes? That’s the novel twist imagined by Soapdish, in which a daytime drama’s longtime star (played by Field) finds herself under professional attack by a rival (Cathy Moriarty) and her disenchanted producer (Robert Downey, Jr.). Their efforts unearth real-life secrets after the return of an old star (Kevin Kline) and the ascent of a new cast member (Elisabeth Shue) — all of which have the unintended effect of making the show, and Field’s character, more popular than ever. “Soapdish is pure joy,” wrote Rita Kempley for the Washington Post, calling it “a lemon-fresh spoof of daytime drama that does the dishing and may even soften your hands.”Watch TrailerMrs. Doubtfire (1993)  71%It was Robin Williams who undoubtedly got most of Mrs. Doubtfire’s laughs — and carried the movie, as well as several pounds of latex, while wearing a dress — but aside from offering proof that Williams would have made a fairly convincing elderly woman (and delivering cinema’s first recorded run-by fruiting), this dramedy takes a bittersweet look at the wreckage left behind after Williams’ man-child antics push his wife (played by Field) beyond her breaking point. With Pierce Brosnan adding additional support as Field’s dashing boyfriend, Doubtfire offers a deceptively even-handed picture of post-divorce parenting between the guffaws. “In terms of plot, the film is rather feeble,” admitted ReelViews’ James Berardinelli. “But sometimes there’s more to a movie than story, and this is one of those rare occasions when all the other elements pull together and lift the production.”Watch TrailerForrest Gump (1994)  71%All things considered, Sally Field probably shouldn’t have been playing Forrest Gump’s mom — she is, after all, only a decade older than Tom Hanks — but setting that bit of Hollywood chicanery aside, there isn’t a thing wrong with her performance in this Oscar-winning hit. After all, who better to personify the precise blend of sweetness and determined pragmatism that leads Mrs. Gump to get it on with a reluctant principal in order to get young Forrest into public school? A massive hit that was later the victim of a backlash, Gump earned mostly positive reviews from critics who, while far from blind to the film’s flaws, were powerless to resist its good-natured charm. “It might hit you right in the feels, even as your eyes are rolling,” wrote Slant’s Rob Humanick. “To quote one of Forrest’s truest pieces of wisdom: Maybe both is happening at the same time.”Watch TrailerLincoln (2012)  89%He presided over the most tumultuous time in our nation’s history, accomplished great things while in office, and ended his administration — and his life — in violent tragedy. Needless to say, Abraham Lincoln’s life is the stuff that Oscar-winning films are made of — and with Steven Spielberg at the helm, directing a stellar cast that included Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, Sally Field, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and an almost unrecognizable Daniel Day-Lewis as the man himself, Lincoln was a virtual shoo-in for a Best Picture nomination even before it arrived in theaters. Of course, it helped that the finished product was one of 2012’s best-reviewed films thanks to critics like Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune, who wrote, “It blends cinematic Americana with something grubbier and more interesting than Americana, and it does not look, act or behave like the usual perception of a Spielberg epic.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"movie, Netflix, cars, streaming","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/08212354/sally-field-1.jpg","slug":"definitive-sally-field-roles"},{"id":"47508964098398","title":"Definitive Ryan Reynolds Roles","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Ryan Reynolds RolesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look at the roles that have helped define the Deadpool star's career.by Jeff Giles | February 10, 2016 |  CommentsAfter years of fan outcry, Ryan Reynolds finally gets the chance to topline a solo Deadpool&nbsp;movie this weekend — and if early critical returns are any indication, it was well worth the wait. In honor of the occasion, we decided to take a fond look back at some of the best and brightest moments from Mr. Reynolds’ film and TV career, and the results add up to a list that includes big box-office hits and left-field choices from across the spectrum. It’s time for Total Recall!Two Guys and a Girl (1998-2001)After getting his first big break in the Canadian soap Hillside, Reynolds picked up a handful of TV appearances (including a gig on Sabrina the Teenage Witch) before landing a co-starring role on the ABC sitcom Two Guys and a Girl, which lingered on the network’s lineup for an 81-episode run between 1998-2001. Initially part of a Wednesday comedy block that included The Drew Carey Show, the series was initially something of a midsized hit, but it was eventually doomed by a move to the&nbsp;Saturday TV graveyard — not to mention a glut of Friends-inspired shows about the travails of twentysomething urbanites. Still, for fans wanting an early glimpse of Reynolds (not to mention a pre-Firefly&nbsp;Nathan Fillion), it’s worth a look.National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002)  18%There’s no denying that Ryan Reynolds is genetically well-qualified to play feckless, handsome charmers — or that, by 2002, the world was ready for a fresh take on the slobs-vs.-snobs story that National Lampoon perfected into an art form with Animal House&nbsp;— so National Lampoon’s Van Wilder, starring Reynolds as a legendarily shiftless college student scrambling to preserve his cushy lifestyle after being cut off by his dad, could have been a lot of fun. The problem, as most critics saw it, was that instead of being a schlubby, disadvantaged outsider with an axe to grind against the Man, Reynolds’ character was simply lazy, and thus inherently hard to root for. Still, it gave him an early chance to carry a film, and it’s become something of a cult comedy classic — which is just&nbsp;fine with John Patterson of the L.A. Weekly, who called it “An effervescent campus gross-out comedy that’s true to the amoral, anarchic spirit of Lampoon founder-editor and screenwriter Doug Kenney.”Watch TrailerThe Nines (2007)  65%Whatever problems The Nines&nbsp;might have, lack of ambition isn’t one of them. This heady sci-fi fantasy, which marked the feature directorial debut of screenwriter John August, stars Reynolds in a triple role as three men struggling to understand the truth behind unusual occurrences in their lives — lives that occasionally intersect — while in the midst of fraught encounters with mysterious women (all played by Hope Davis, in another triple role). It’s the type of trippy metaphysical drama that demands a viewer’s complete concentration, and even then, the answers to the questions it poses are open to interpretation. Still, if you’re in the mood for a less-than-straightforward film, you could do far worse. “Confusing? Yes, and intentionally so,” wrote Christy Lemire for the Associated Press. “But it’s never boring.”Watch TrailerDefinitely, Maybe (2008)  70%A romantic comedy with a twist, Definitely, Maybe&nbsp;finds its protagonist looking back on the love affair that led to marriage and a child — by telling the story to his young daughter, with some names changed and facts adjusted, while in the midst of a divorce. Thanks in part to those narrative curveballs, most critics applauded Maybe&nbsp;— and even if it still ultimately traced a rather familiar arc, it was difficult to find too much fault with a resolutely charming production that made smart use of a likable ensemble cast that included Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Elizabeth Banks, Isla Fisher, and Rachel Weisz. “As the movie is about a character’s growing into his own truth rather than discovering some preordained truth, Definitely, Maybe&nbsp;is hard to outguess,” wrote Mick LaSalle for the San Francisco Chronicle. “For once in a romantic comedy, you won’t be able to tell after five minutes who will end up together.”Watch TrailerThe Proposal (2009)  44%It’s a special occasion when critics really go nuts for a romantic comedy — or when rom-com fans care enough about critics’ opinions to stay away from the cineplex even when a new entry in the genre is supposed to be subpar. For proof, look no further than 2009’s The Proposal, which endured a heap of critical brickbats on its way to theaters, yet still managed to roll up an impressive $300 million-plus gross — thanks in no small part to the chemistry between stars Sandra Bullock (as a publishing company’s abrasive editor-in-chief) and Reynolds (as the hapless assistant who’s browbeaten into marrying her to keep her from being deported). It definitely isn’t revolutionary stuff, and you know exactly where the movie’s taking the relationship, but that formula is a big part of the romantic comedy’s appeal. “The Proposal is just a good old-fashioned romance, one in which people actually bring out the best in one another rather than the worst,” wrote Betsy Sharkey for the Los Angeles Times. “How novel is that?”Watch TrailerBuried (2010)  87%It takes a special kind of creativity and filmmaking discipline — to say nothing of actorly chutzpah — to pull off a film centered around a single person in a single space, and when Reynolds read the script for 2010’s Buried, he had to know he was facing an immense challenge. Both he and director Rodrigo Cortés deserve a ton of credit, then, for making the most out of screenwriter Chris Sparling’s tightly focused story about a military contractor who wakes up imprisoned in a coffin, and turning its seemingly limited premise into a 95-minute white-knuckle race against time. As Rex Reed argued for the New York Observer, “Nothing this underrated actor has done previously measures up to the emotional diversity, focus and self-control required of him in a one-man exercise in underground suspense that Alfred Hitchcock would envy.”Watch TrailerSafe House (2012)  53%Reynolds got the chance to go toe-to-toe with Denzel Washington in 2012’s Safe House, an action thriller from director Daniel Espinosa about a rogue CIA operative (Washington) whose interrogation is interrupted by a team of mercenaries that attacks and sends him back into the wind with a low-level field agent (Reynolds). It’s a premise rich with possibilities for cool set pieces and odd-couple bickering, but Safe House never really takes full advantage of those possibilities, settling instead for frenetic editing that can’t quite move fast enough to mask the clichéd plot developments along the way. Still, when the movie gets going, it does have its pleasures; as Colin Covert wrote for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “I won’t deny that the movie hooked me with sheer brute energy and dragged me along with it most of the way.”Watch TrailerThe Voices (2015)  74%For most films, making your main protagonist an employee at a bathtub factory would more than fulfill the weirdness quotient. But for 2015’s The Voices, that’s just the beginning of a surreal odyssey into bloody violence and black comedy — oh, and talking pets. Directed by acclaimed graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi by a script from Paranormal Activity 2&nbsp;co-writer Michael R. Perry, The Voices&nbsp;gives Reynolds free rein to indulge in all manner of strange behavior, but for the most part, critics agreed that the movie stays on the right side of the line between refreshingly different and quirky for quirky’s sake, and while its main character’s warped descent into a bleak, chaotic psychological abyss definitely isn’t for all viewers, those with a taste for the strange might find the end results intoxicating. As Sara Stewart wrote for the New York Post, “Ryan Reynolds is chillingly perfect as a nice-guy factory worker struggling with schizophrenia and murderous impulses in this tonally wild indie, which is nearly too horrifying to be funny — but not quite.”Watch TrailerWoman in Gold (2015)  57%Woman in Gold&nbsp;has an awful lot going for it, including a fascinating real-life story and a talented cast topped off by the mighty Helen Mirren. Unfortunately, while there’s plenty of drama to be wrought from the tale of a Jewish refugee battling the Austrian government for ownership of a Gustav Klimt painting of her aunt, much of it went missing on its journey to the big screen. Although critics were quick to praise Mirren’s work, and had kind words for Reynolds’ portrayal of a rookie lawyer enlisted to help win back the painting, many critics felt Woman in Gold&nbsp;lacked the depth and dramatic pull its story deserved — which is not to say the movie didn’t have its fans. “Sometimes you know a movie is going to work in about the first three scenes,” wrote Wesley Morris for Grantland. “This one really works.”Watch TrailerMississippi Grind (2015)  91%A number of his more successful films have found him playing characters that might be described as blandly pretty, so the idea of Ryan Reynolds playing an emotionally stunted drifter with a gambling problem might seem like a bit of a stretch. With his work in Mississippi Grind, however, Reynolds offered an excellent reminder that when given the right script, he’s more than capable of delivering a finely layered performance — and going toe-to-toe with Ben Mendelsohn in a melancholy road movie about a pair of aging losers who can’t quite seem to grow up no matter how many chances they’re given. “Mendelsohn plays Gerry as a stringy, sweaty hunk of pure desperation,” wrote Mike D’Angelo for the A.V. Club, “while Reynolds, as the ostensibly more stable partner, demonstrates yet again that he’s much more than a ridiculously pretty face.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"TV, versus, critic, Sabrina","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/10152801/RyanReynoldsRecall.jpg","slug":"definitive-ryan-reynolds-roles"},{"id":"47508962625874","title":"Kevin Bacon’s Best-Reviewed Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kevin Bacon's Best-Reviewed MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the most acclaimed films of the star of The Darkness.by Jeff Giles | May 11, 2016 |  CommentsFrom starring roles in flicks like Footloose to memorable cameos in films such as JFK, Kevin Bacon has been pretty much all over Hollywood during his 35-year professional acting career, working so prolifically that he eventually inspired his own game. With that in mind, when we noticed Bacon’s name in the cast list for this weekend’s The Darkness, we knew exactly what we had to do. Everything is better with Bacon, so let’s start the countdown!A Few Good Men (1992)  83%Inspired by a real-life incident related to screenwriter Aaron Sorkin by his sister, a onetime member of the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps, A Few Good Men united an attention-getting cast, a tightly written script, and some of Rob Reiner’s sharpest direction to produce one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of 1992 (TIME’s Richard Schickel called it “An extraordinarily well-made movie, which wastes no words or images in telling a conventional but compelling story”). Although Men is mostly remembered today for its climactic courtroom scene, featuring Jack Nicholson as an enraged colonel who snaps under questioning and accuses the young lawyer questioning him (Tom Cruise) of not being able to handle the truth, it’s actually a pretty solid dramatic thriller all the way around — and it added links to a few more stars in Bacon’s growing resume, thanks to his supporting role as opposing counsel Captain Jack Ross.Watch TrailerTremors (1990)  86%A cheerfully amiable B-movie creature feature with modern-day trappings, 1990’s Tremors dropped Bacon in the middle of a wonderfully eclectic cast (including Reba McEntire and Big Trouble in Little China legend Victor “Egg Shen” Wong) to tell the story of a small town whose sleepy existence is disrupted by a rumbling passel of giant subterranean monsters. Although it wasn’t a major hit during its theatrical release, it went on to enjoy cult status, spawning a (lamentably Bacon-free) succession of sequels and a TV series. The secret of its enduring appeal, according to Rob Vaux of the Flipside Movie Emporium, lies in “The blueprint for how to do projects like this right: care about your material, but don’t lose your sense of humor.”Watch TrailerMystic River (2003)  88%With Clint Eastwood behind the camera, Brian Helgeland writing the script from a Dennis Lehane book, and a cast packed with reliable names like Sean Penn, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Laurence Fishburne, you’re pretty much guaranteed a terrific movie — and that’s exactly what filmgoers got with 2003’s Mystic River, which not only earned over $150 million at the box office, but won a pair of Academy Awards and a stack of honors from other organizations. Fishburne played Whitey Powers, Massachusetts state police sergeant and partner of Sean Devine (played by Bacon); over the course of the film, the duo investigates the murder of a girl whose father, Jimmy Markum (Penn), is not only a local gangster, but one of Devine’s closest childhood friends. Complicating matters even further is the nagging suspicion that the crime may have been committed by Dave Boyle (Robbins), Jimmy’s brother-in-law — and another of Sean’s old friends. It sounds like the stuff of bullet-riddled melodrama, but few mainstream authors spin literary gold out of pulp as reliably as Lehane, and with Eastwood’s flinty direction providing a solid foundation for his stellar cast, River deserved the praise of critics such as Cole Smithey, who pronounced, “American drama doesn’t get any more meaty and muscular than this.”Watch TrailerX-Men: First Class (2011)  86%While Bacon is certainly no stranger to effects-driven films — heck, he spent a substantial portion of 2000’s Hollow Man as an invisible man — he managed to avoid doing time in a comic book movie until 2011’s X-Men: First Class, which rebooted the moribund franchise by taking the characters back to their beginnings as a freshly assembled team of mutant superheroes. The reason for their coming together? The threat posed by Sebastian Shaw (Bacon), an energy-absorbing sociopath (and former Nazi to boot) who plans on taking over the world. A major box-office hit as well as a perfect opportunity for Bacon to chew some scenery, it also resonated with critics like the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, who wrote, “Preaching mutant pride with endearing fervor, X-Men: First Class proves to be a mutant in its own right — a zestfully radical departure from the latter spawn of a sputtering franchise.”Watch TrailerThe Woodsman (2004)  88%Actors often sign up to play unappealing characters in order to highlight their diversity — and they don’t come much more unappealing than “ex-con child molester,” all of which is to say that it took a certain amount of guts for Bacon to step into the role of a tormented pedophile struggling to put his life back together in 2004’s The Woodsman. Picking up after his release from prison and focusing on his awkward efforts to build new relationships and move on from the dark secrets of his past, it can be undeniably difficult to watch; as far as most critics were concerned, however, that discomfort paid rich dividends. “To watch this picture is to feel,” pointed out the Globe and Mail’s Rick Groen, “and what you’re feeling is an intense swirl of conflicting emotions — disturbed, creeped-out, sorry, and, yes, even moved.”Watch TrailerThe Big Picture (1989)  87%Before he developed into a full-fledged cult favorite with movies like Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, Christopher Guest made his directorial debut with The Big Picture, a cameo-laden showbiz satire about a young, talented director (Bacon) who learns the hard way that studio politics often wreak havoc on everything from a film’s storyline to a filmmaker’s career. Fittingly, Picture saw its own release derailed when the studio president who greenlit it was fired, but even during its limited theatrical run, it found an enthusiastic audience with critics like Chris Hicks of the Deseret News, who wrote, “All in all this is a terrific comedy that punctures Hollywood’s pretentiousness but is never mean-spirited about it.”Watch TrailerDiner (1982)  93%It may seem a little hard to believe in today’s superhero-driven cinematic landscape, but once upon a time, major studios actually did release movies that were about nothing more than ordinary people doing relatively ordinary things. Case in point: Diner, the low-key 1982 character study that acted as the first installment of writer/director Barry Levinson’s series of Baltimore films. Focused on the lives and loves of a group of friends, the narrative begins in 1959, using a series of vignettes to illustrate the way their relationships change; it’s pretty straightforward stuff, but it’s expertly grounded by Levinson’s marvelous script and sensitive direction, not to mention stellar work from a terrific cast of up-and-comers that included Bacon, Ellen Barkin, Steve Guttenberg, Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern, Tim Daly, and Paul Reiser. Observed a prescient Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “Movies like Diner — fresh, well-acted and energetic American movies by new directors with the courage of their convictions — are an endangered species.”Watch TrailerNational Lampoon's Animal House (1978)  90%Nine times out of 10, scoring a role in a T&amp;A-fueled college sex comedy isn’t a terribly auspicious beginning for a young actor, but in Kevin Bacon’s case, his appearance as the smug Chip Diller in 1978’s Animal House made for a memorable debut — as well as a hugely successful opportunity for a young actor to cut his cinematic teeth with a cast and crew that included such stellar talents as John Belushi, Donald Sutherland, Harold Ramis, and John Landis. Although it didn’t immediately lead to bigger film parts for Bacon, who’d end up in Friday the 13th and daytime serials over the next few years, it marked a solid opening chapter in what would turn into a distinguished career — and provided plenty of laughs for Roger Ebert, who wrote, “The movie is vulgar, raunchy, ribald, and occasionally scatological. It is also the funniest comedy since Mel Brooks made The Producers.”Watch TrailerFrost/Nixon (2008)  93%Ron Howard’s best-reviewed film in ages, 2009’s Frost/Nixon adapts the Peter Morgan play that dramatized British broadcaster David Frost’s (played by Michael Sheen) efforts to secure and sell a series of TV interviews with the politically exiled former president (portrayed by Frank Langella) — in spite of a series of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, not the least of which were the loud doubts expressed by Nixon’s chief of staff Jack Brennan (Bacon). Although plenty of pundits took umbrage at the way Morgan’s screenplay took liberties with the actual events that inspired the film, for the vast majority of critics, Frost/Nixon‘s flaws seemed pretty minor when weighed against the script, direction, editing, completed picture, and Langella’s performance — all of which received Oscar nominations. For the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, it all added up to “A must-see for political junkies, history buffs, and folks still fascinated by the paranoia-fueled follies of the twitchy, sweaty, decidedly uncharismatic 37th president.”Watch TrailerApollo 13 (1995)  96%This dramatization of NASA’s aborted 1970 lunar mission combined one of star Tom Hanks’ biggest personal passions — space travel — with Hollywood’s favorite thing: a blockbuster prestige picture. With a cast that featured a number of similarly prolific actors (among them Bacon, Ed Harris, Bill Paxton, and Gary Sinise), Apollo 13 probably would have made decent money even if it had played fast and loose with the real-life details of the launch, but director Ron Howard and his crew strove for verisimilitude, going so far as to shoot portions of the film in actual zero gravity. The result was a summertime smash that restored some of space travel’s luster for a jaded generation — and made for an exceedingly good filmgoing experience according to most critics, including Roger Ebert, who called it “a powerful story, one of the year’s best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"docudrama, movies, die, TV+","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/11143038/Kevin-Bacon-Recall.jpg","slug":"kevin-bacons-best-reviewed-movies"},{"id":"47508962655580","title":"Definitive Kate Winslet Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Kate Winslet MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the films that helped define the Triple 9 star's career.by Jeff Giles | February 24, 2016 |  CommentsOne of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed actors of her generation, Kate Winslet has been in movies that have collectively grossed more than a billion dollars and she’s three-fourths of the way to an EGOT — and although this weekend’s Triple 9 won’t get her any closer to that hallowed achievement, it offers us the perfect occasion to take a fond look back at some of the brightest critical highlights in a filmography full of them. It’s time for Total Recall!Heavenly Creatures (1994)  92%Director Peter Jackson’s impressively violent early work might have made him a natural fit for a movie about the grisly true-life tale of two teenage girls (played by Winslet and Melanie Lynskey) whose obsessive relationship leads to a shocking act of brutality — but few of his fans could have been prepared for Heavenly Creatures, an absorbing, assured film that blended elements of drama, science fiction, and romance while drawing beautifully compelling performances from its leads. Ultimately nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar at the Academy Awards, Creatures vaulted Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh to international acclaim, jump-started Winslet’s film career, and wowed critics like David Rooney of Variety, who wrote that it “Combines original vision, a drop-dead command of the medium and a successful marriage between a dazzling, kinetic techno-show and a complex, credible portrait of the out-of-control relationship between the crime’s two schoolgirl perpetrators.”Watch TrailerSense and Sensibility (1995)  97%Jane Austen’s books have inspired countless films, but with 1995’s Sense and Sensibility, director Ang Lee proved there was still cinematic gold yet to be spun from her stories. Working from an Oscar-winning screenplay by Emma Thompson (who also starred as the noble Elinor Dashwood), this adaptation offered a faithful representation of Austen’s 1811 novel about the financial and romantic aftershocks that reverberate through a landed British family after their patriarch passes away. Bolstered by an excellent ensemble cast that also included Winslet, Hugh Grant, and Alan Rickman, Sensibility resonated with Jeanne Aufmuth of the Palo Alto Weekly, who echoed the sentiments of the vast majority of her peers when she asked, “Enduring love, heartbreak, undying passion and bitter betrayal. What more could you ask from Jane Austen, and for that matter, from a film?”Watch TrailerJude (1996)  81%Thomas Hardy’s novel Jude the Obscure&nbsp;got the big-screen treatment with this 1996 adaptation courtesy of director Michael Winterbottom, who cast Winslet and Christopher Eccleston as the tormented couple at the heart of the story. The tale of 19th-century cousins who attempt to build a life for themselves in spite of many cruel obstacles imposed by class, culture, and religion, Jude&nbsp;is decidedly dark stuff, with a final act that packs a gut-punch even by the standards of Victorian-era arthouse pictures. If watching it isn’t exactly easy, it was well worth the effort according to most critics — including James Berardinelli of ReelViews, who wrote, “This is a film of tremendous scope and emotional depth that uncovers the soul of a novel and brings it to life on the screen.”Watch TrailerHamlet (1996)  95%Try adapting Hamlet&nbsp;for the screen after all these years, and you’d better bring something special to the table — and to his credit, that’s exactly what writer/director/star Kenneth Branagh did with his 1996 take on the classic Shakespeare play, leaving no dramatic stone unturned in a sprawling four-hour epic boasting the acting talents of an equally hefty cast that included Winslet, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, Charlton Heston…you get the idea. Although they’d seen it adapted countless times before, critics couldn’t help but be impressed by Branagh’s Hamlet; as James Berardinelli wrote for ReelViews, “I have seen dozens of versions of this play (either on screen or on stage), and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe.”Watch TrailerTitanic (1997)  89%Take one of the most infamous seafaring disasters in history and overlay it with a tragic love story between two beautiful people, and what do you have? Titanic, otherwise known as the blockbuster that sent millions of moviegoers fumbling for their Kleenex while Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio fought for their lives aboard the titular capsizing ocean liner. It wasn’t the first Titanic film — or even the first one named Titanic&nbsp;— but James Cameron’s iceberg-bound romance certainly struck a chord with audiences, setting sail to the tune of more than $1.8 billion in worldwide grosses. And it’s a good thing, too: at $200 million, it set a new record for the most expensive film ever made, causing many an ulcer on the Fox executive board (and ultimately earning Cameron a hefty chunk of money through his percentage of the profits). And oh by the way, while audiences were filing into the 194-minute Titanic&nbsp;in droves, critics were lining up to give it praise — including Newsweek’s David Ansen, who called it “big, bold, touchingly uncynical filmmaking.”Watch TrailerIris (2001)  79%Acting opportunities don’t come much meatier than Iris, a dramatization of literary critic and writer Jim Bayley’s memoirs about his life with novelist Iris Murdoch — and director Richard Eyre lined up a cast more than willing to make the most of it. Both Winslet, who stars as Murdoch as a younger woman, and Judi Dench, who portrays the author in her later years, earned Academy Award nominations for their work — as did Jim Broadbent, who played the elder Bayley. “It’s not only that Murdoch and Bayley had just that kind of kinship over the span of a 40-plus year marriage,” marveled Kenneth Turan for the Los Angeles Times. “It’s that the actors manage an identically close and intimate relationship both to each other and to the characters they play.”Watch TrailerEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%It would take a special kind of heartbreak to make a person want to completely purge their memories of a former love — and it’s very much to Winslet’s credit that she managed to convincingly embody just that sort of tempestuous, bewitchingly unobtainable affection in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Starring opposite Jim Carrey, Winslet played one-half of a star-crossed couple whose agonizing ups and downs lead them to seek out a groundbreaking therapy that will rid them of their pain…and that’s when things get really&nbsp;weird. A mindbending, critically beloved love story as well as one of the most eye-catching films of the early aughts, Sunshine&nbsp;finds director Michel Gondry (working from a script by Charlie Kaufman) riddling the drama with stunning visual effects that, depending on what you want out of the movie, either deepen its metaphorical layers of meaning or are simply really cool to look at. It’s admittedly too strange and/or chilly to appeal to everyone, but at its heart, the movie lives up to Mariko McDonald of Film Threat’s assessment of it as “fresh, heartfelt and ultimately heartbreaking in its honest portrayal of a modern relationship.”Watch TrailerFinding Neverland (2004)  83%Sticklers for accuracy bristled at the liberties it took with J.M. Barrie’s life story, but Finding Neverland&nbsp;was still good enough for audiences — who made it a $100 million-plus hit — and the Academy, which bestowed Johnny Depp with a Best Actor nomination for his work as the playwright and Peter Pan&nbsp;author. Neverland&nbsp;finds Barrie nursing his wounds after the failure of his most recent play, befriending a widow (Kate Winslet) and her young boys, and taking inspiration from their unorthodox friendship — even as helps cost him his own marriage and puts him at odds with the boys’ grandmother (Julie Christie). “Plenty of narrative liberties have been taken,” admitted Jason Blake of the Sydney Morning Herald, but argued that “It doesn’t matter a jot. At heart, this isn’t a biography anyway, it’s an ode to the power of the imagination.”Watch TrailerLittle Children (2006)  80%Winslet earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in Little Children, a harrowing ensemble drama that explores how outside events can nudge even the most well-worn domestic orbits wobbling off their axis. With writer/director Todd Field at the helm, this adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel looks at a suburban community whose beautiful facade masks untold conflicts — and whose carefully calibrated order is disrupted by the arrival of a registered sex offender (Jackie Earle Haley). It’s the kind of yarn that’s been spun countless times over the last few decades, but many critics still took fresh pleasure from this particular telling — including J.R. Jones, whose Chicago Reader review argued, “the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky.”Watch TrailerSteve Jobs (2015)  85%By the time Steve Jobs premiered in 2015, audiences had already seen a number of films about the Apple co-founder, both documentary (Alex Gibney’s Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine, released earlier in the year) and narrative (2013’s Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher). This Steve Jobs needed something special, in other words, to overcome the familiarity of its subject; fortunately, it boasted several unique ingredients, including direction from Danny Boyle, a script from Aaron Sorkin, and a cast that included Michael Fassbender as Jobs and Winslet as Apple marketing exec Joanna Hoffman. All that talent still didn’t do much to move the needle with a moviegoing public that might have been pretty Jobsed out at that point, but it had the desired effect with critics who applauded Steve Jobs as the definitive Steve Jobs biopic. As Bob Mondello argued for NPR, “The film feels so electric while you’re watching, it’s hard to believe that after two hours, it doesn’t even get to the iPod, let alone the iPhone.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"service","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/24135848/kate-w-22-e1456351146926.jpg","slug":"definitive-kate-winslet-movies"},{"id":"47508964104544","title":"10 Offbeat Romantic Comedies for Valentine’s Day","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Offbeat Romantic Comedies for Valentine's Dayby Yasmin Vought | February 2, 2016 |  CommentsWe’ve gathered together what we think are 10 of the most original films to challenge the conventions of the genre. Some have happy endings, some end in tears or confusion — yet all work an unfamiliar, offbeat magic on the romantic comedy template. There’s no Hallmark rubbish to be found here…Secretary (2002)  77%Based on Mary Gaitskill’s critically-acclaimed short story of the same, Secretary is a dark and deviant romantic comedy about the subjectivity of love, focusing on the idea that love doesn’t necessarily have to be predictable and pain free. It’s a coming-of-age love story about the journey of sexuality, shame and innocence. Like American Beauty and other dark comedies of its sub-genre, Secretary explores taboo concepts in an accessible way that still manages to tease out its controversial messages light-heartedly. It’s understandable, then, that critics might be have been a little divided by a movie that glorifies S&amp;M, self-harm and — perhaps worst of all — inter-office dating.Watch TrailerPunch-Drunk Love (2002)  79%Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love tackles the love story between the socially-impaired, emotionally-disturbed Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) and the sweet Lena Leonard (Emily Watson). Barry is not your average male protagonist, spending his days selling toilet plungers and collecting trolley loads full of pudding in order to accrue the attached frequent flyer coupons. He also gets himself into some unusual circumstances, such as calling a phone sex line run by con artists who then pursue and attempt to bully Barry into giving them all of his money. The romance in this film is unique as it speaks its own language; quite unlike that of any rom-com. At one tender moment Barry whispers to Lena: “I’m lookin’ at your face and I just wanna smash it with a sledgehammer… and squeeze it. You’re so pretty.” Isn’t love sweet?Watch TrailerHarold and Maude (1971)  84%When people develop relationships with unusual characters in a movie, it’s usually received by the majority of audiences in one of two ways: support or disgust. In rom-com Lars and the Real Girl, we found ourselves encouraging Ryan Gosling to fall in love with his life-sized doll. However, in the case of Harold and Maude, we’re challenged with a love much more confronting than that of a man for his plastic girl. Eccentric and shy young Harold (Bud Cort) passes his time by faking his own suicide attempts and attending funerals at his leisure in his very own hearse. It’s there he meets 79-year-old spontaneous and carefree Maude (Ruth Gordon), who teaches Harold new experiences. No doubt Harold and Maude is a one of a kind, a romantic comedy that tackles the social constructs of ageism behind a clever mask of dark humour and a fascinating (to say the least) love story.Watch Trailer2 Days in Paris (2007)  88%Marion (Julie Delpy) and Jack (Adam Goldberg) have been together happily for two years, but it’s not until a trip to her home in Paris that the relationship is truly tested. Jack becomes jealous and paranoid about Marion’s friendship with her ex-lovers while struggling to relate culturally. His neurosis is compounded by his inability to speak French and his misfortune in some disastrously uncomfortable situations. Channeling both Woody Allen’s ranting comedies and the freeform New Wave cinema of her national pedigree, 2 Days in Paris sees Delpy deconstruct the drama of a modern romance within the guise of an acerbic, off-the-cuff comedy.Watch TrailerBreakfast at Tiffany's (1961)  89%You want offbeat? Plenty of the magic behind the enduring love for this movie can be put down to the eccentricities of its lead characters. Consider that style icon Audrey Hepburn, playing the free-spirited Holly Golightly, is a young runaway living in Manhattan where she gets drunk, goes to strip clubs, stays out all night and lives an independent life completely devoid of responsibility. “We belong to nobody, and nobody belongs to us,” she says. Oh, and she’s also a call girl; lest we forget. Holly sparks up a friendship with her mysterious neighbour (George Peppard) — who also turns out to be a prostitute — and together they tumble into a rocky relationship, in which two commitment-phobes are slowly forced to admit they might have feelings for each other.Watch TrailerAmélie (2001)  89%Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen, The City of Lost Children) has a flair for imagining France in a twisted and peculiar light, and it’s on full display in Amélie — the story of a young recluse played with a mesmerising childlike quality by then little-known Audrey Tautou. Amélie is a shy girl who delights in skimming stones, cracking crème brulee and imagining how many people in the world are orgasming at any given moment, while she loves carrying out kind-hearted pranks on the people around her. She’s quite content living in her own fantasy world until chance hitches her fate to Nino Quincampoix (Matthieu Kassovitz), whom she begins to pursue around Paris like the world’s cutest stalker. Amazingly, Amélie was rejected by the Cannes Film Festival because one of the selectors found it “uninteresting”. Go figure.Watch TrailerChasing Amy (1997)  87%Basically, the story goes like this: boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy discovers girl is actually a lesbian. Typically, boy thinks he can “convert” girl. Trouble ensues. Kevin Smith’s highly quotable and unusual take on modern day expectations of love flirts with the idea of sexuality and relationships in a humorous and honest manner. It’s the ultimate tale of unrequited love, dealing cleverly and carefully with some pretty complex and controversial topics. Who could forget gay, black-power advocate Hooper’s wisdom on why he doesn’t feel obligated to stick up for lesbians? “Screw that ‘all for one’ s***, alright? I gotta deal with being a minority in a minority of the minority, and nobody’s supportin’ my ass!”Watch TrailerJuno (2007)  94%Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody’s Academy Award-winning teen pregnancy comedy is one of the quirkiest — in the best sense of that word — high school flicks in quite some time. Rather than the usual teenage movie caricatures, the movie’s characters reflect the sarcastic but emotionally vulnerable life of real high schoolers (or at least Cody’s imagination, anyway). That is until 16-year-old Juno becomes unexpectedly “Fo’ shizz up the spout” by Michael Cera’s goofy Paulie Bleeker. Romantic comedy of the most offbeat kind results, as the characters try to negotiate both their burgeoning puppy love and Juno’s baby-adopters… all framed within Reitman and Cody’s original little universe.Watch TrailerEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a story conjured up by two of the most remarkably imaginative and individual filmmakers working in movies — screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry. Together they take us on an almost voyeuristic journey inside the fraying relationship between the reserved, nervous Joel (Jim Carrey) and the unpredictable, outgoing Clementine (Kate Winslett). Frustrated, Clementine impulsively has her mind erased of all of her memories of Joel; and the forlorn Joel follows suit. Gondry and Kaufman’s dive into Joel’s subconscious as he tries to cling to his evaporating memories of Clementine is alternately comedic and heart-wrenching — who hasn’t felt the desire to rid ourselves of a painful memory, the hurtful things that we have said, or the vulnerable moments we have shared? Eternal Sunshine challenges our beliefs on love, and asks us if ignorance is indeed bliss…Watch TrailerAnnie Hall (1977)  96%Arguably the quintessential Woody Allen comedy and certainly one of the great romances in movies, Annie Hall is also our favourite offbeat rom-com — and one that’s inspired so many others, for both better and worse. Allen’s film retrospectively questions where a failed relationship has gone wrong. As Alvy, a comedian who is re-examining his break up with the frivolous Annie (played by Diane Keaton), Allen overanalyses the ups and downs, the screw ups and the bonds, in a way that attempts to find an upside to the failure of his one true love. Ultimately, Allen’s humour lies in his comedic ability to mock himself. As Alvy says, the reason why he lets his relationship fail is like that “Old Groucho Marx joke” — he doesn’t want to belong to any club that would have him as a member.Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Us, Returns, Fox, Rom-Com, Winter, aliens, Pictures, golden, the, Apple, jurassic, and","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/16010900/Rom-Com-Rep.jpg","slug":"total-recall-offbeat-romantic-comedies"},{"id":"47508962647385","title":"Definitive Michael Shannon Performances","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Michael Shannon PerformancesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the roles that helped define the Midnight Special's star's career.by Jeff Giles | March 16, 2016 |  CommentsWith this weekend’s Midnight Special, Michael Shannon and writer-director Jeff Nichols reunite for their fourth feature — and if early reviews are any indication, it’ll join its predecessors in earning Certified Fresh status. In anticipation of Special’s arrival, we’ve decided to dedicate this week’s feature to a look at some of the many highlights from Shannon’s still-growing filmography — a group that includes collaborations with Nichols as well as an array of other fortunate filmmakers. It’s time for Total Recall!Shotgun Stories (2007)  90%Shannon started his series of critically acclaimed collaborations with writer-director Jeff Nichols with 2007’s Shotgun Stories, which traces the fault lines in a pair of families who are left behind to sift through the emotional wreckage after the death of the father who abandoned one home to start another. Laced with the violence and unforgiving anger reflected by its title, Shotgun uses an awful situation to explore a series of uncomfortable truths about family dynamics and the human condition; as Roger Ebert observed, “Few films are so observant about how we relate with one another. Few are as sympathetic.”Watch TrailerRevolutionary Road (2008)  67%Shannon earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work as an allegedly crazy neighbor in Revolutionary Road, a 2008 period drama about the unraveling of a middle-class marriage between two suburbanites in 1950s America. Directed by Sam Mendes, Road didn’t win any points for cheeriness — in fact, a good number of critics were turned off by the grueling series of disappointments faced by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in the central roles — but on the whole, Justin Haythe’s screenplay, Mendes’ direction, and the performances of a talented cast helped make the medicine go down. Calling it “bitter, nerve-wracking, ugly and relentless,” Detroit News critic Tom Long wrote, “Revolutionary Road is Big Drama done right, a mesmerizing look at desperate lives, wrong moves and spoiled dreams that hits hard right from the beginning and never lets up.”Watch TrailerBoardwalk Empire  92%Shannon hasn’t done a lot of television, but he knows a solid small-screen opportunity when he sees one, as evidenced by the 35 episodes he filmed for HBO’s Boardwalk Empire. Part of the cable network’s award-winning slate of 21st century original programming, the Prohibition-set period drama starred Steve Buscemi as “Nucky” Thompson, a corrupt Atlantic City treasurer whose position puts him in contact with some of the era’s most notorious gangsters — and makes him susceptible to large-scale corruption. As Nelson van Alden, a former Prohibition officer leading a double life as a bootlegger, Shannon shared screen time with a talented ensemble that also included Michael Pitt and Kelly Macdonald, and enjoyed his share of five seasons’ worth of critical acclaim.Watch TrailerThe Runaways (2010)  69%Before they were solo stars, Joan Jett and Lita Ford were members of the all-female rock group the Runaways — and their fascinating, turbulent, and often rather lurid story can’t be told without making room for their larger-than-life manager, Kim Fowley. While Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning received the lion’s share of The Runaways’ pre-release attention after they were cast as Jett and Runaways vocalist Cherie Currie, many critics felt Shannon stole the film with his performance as Fowley, which captured his provocative essence without delving into the dark side that later came to define his public persona. As Ann Hornaday argued for the Washington Post, “While Jett and Currie emerge as blurry, half-formed characters, Shannon’s Fowley brings the contradictions the Runaways embodied into sharp, biting focus.”Watch TrailerTake Shelter (2011)  92%The restless worry rumbling under the remnants of America’s middle class in the early 21st century were mirrored in Take Shelter, writer-director Jeff Nichols’ 2011 drama featuring Michael Shannon as a father and husband whose happy home life is disturbed by a series of increasingly frightening apocalyptic visions. Convinced he’s bearing witness to a prophecy and determined to protect his wife and children, he sets about building a storm shelter — while starting to display signs that he may suffer from the paranoid schizophrenia that runs in his family. “Shannon is astounding, playing a good man pushed to the brink of sanity, maybe beyond,” wrote Bill Goodykoontz for the Arizona Republic. “He portrays a sense of quiet desperation — a feeling recognizable to many.”Watch TrailerReturn (2012)  83%A number of films have given viewers a look at the difficulties of readjusting to civilian life for combat veterans, but they mostly focus on male veterans. A notable exception is writer-director Liza Johnson’s Return, starring Linda Cardellini as a reservist who comes home after a tour of duty in the Middle East only to discover that things have changed — she struggles to cope with the boredom of her job and the demands of her children, all while coming to terms with the growing distance between herself and her husband (Shannon). Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times was one of my critics singling out Shannon’s performance for praise, writing, “Michael Shannon steals the film — when does he not? — as the loving, frustrated husband whose fuse is burning short.”Watch TrailerPremium Rush (2012)  74%928290 – Premium RushThe world wasn’t exactly crying out for a new bike-messenger drama after Kevin Bacon’s Quicksilver went skidding into the box office guardrails in 1986, but with 2012’s Premium Rush, director/co-writer David Koepp proved the subgenre still had stories left to tell. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a law school grad who dodges the bar with his low-responsibility, high-risk gig as a bike messenger, Rush adds an extra jolt of adrenaline courtesy of a subplot involving a particularly valuable package being chased by a corrupt cop (Shannon) who’ll retrieve it at any cost. Praising the end result as “stuffed with zingers and zippy stunts,” the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis wrote, “It comes with pretty young things of all hues and hair types – few prettier than its lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt – and start-to-finish clever special effects, none more clever or special than Michael Shannon.”Watch TrailerMud (2013)  97%A year after reuniting with&nbsp;Shotgun Stories&nbsp;director Jeff Nichols for&nbsp;Take Shelter, Shannon joined Nichols for their third collaboration, taking a supporting role in 2013’s critically acclaimed&nbsp;Mud. Here, Shannon plays Galen, uncle to one of the boys who stumble upon the title character (played by Matthew McConaughey) after discovering the home he’s made for himself in a boat that was stranded in a tree by a flood. Arriving during a particularly busy time in Shannon’s career — it made its festival debut the same year he released&nbsp;Premium Rush&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Iceman&nbsp;— it doesn’t offer as much screen time as other films he’s made with Nichols, but his presence is part of the rich, Twain-inspired canvas that helped make it one of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year. As Joe Morgenstern argued for the Wall Street Journal, “It’s a movie that holds out hope for the movies’ future.”Watch TrailerThe Iceman (2013)  66%Shannon’s intense screen presence makes him an ideal pick for a movie about an infamous hitman, and&nbsp;The Iceman&nbsp;— inspired by the real-life story of prodigiously homicidal killer Richard Kuklinski — would definitely seem to fit the bill. Unfortunately, a good many critics agreed that director/co-writer Ariel Vromen’s take on the Kuklinski story didn’t really live up to its potential, sacrificing some of its stranger-than-fiction energy for the sake of delivering yet another largely generic picture about the evil that men do.&nbsp;The Iceman’s&nbsp;saving grace, unsurprisingly, was Shannon’s performance, which vested the character with suitably chilling life even when the film didn’t seem to know what to do with him. As Dana Stevens wrote for Slate, “Shannon inhabits this character so completely that by the end of this hard-to-watch, hard-to-look-away-from movie you feel you can, if not understand Richie, at least wish he had found some redemption in life.”Watch Trailer99 Homes (2015)  92%The messy bursting of the housing bubble in 2008 serves as the backdrop for this harrowing drama from writer-director Ramin Bahrani, which uses the eviction of struggling single father Dennis Nash (Andrew Garfield) to set up a knotty conflict that doubles as a troubling microcosm for modern American economics. After being displaced from his home by real estate broker Rick Carver (Shannon), Nash is given the chance to get back on his feet — and regain possession of his home — by working on Carver’s crew, which sets in motion a chain of events that improves his family’s financial health while threatening to upend Nash’s moral compass. “Bahrani shows what happens when it becomes more profitable to yoink away the American Dream than it is to encourage people to buy into it,” wrote Alan Scherstuhl for the Village Voice. “Shannon shows us the toll that that yoinking etches in the face, the mind, the soul.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Television, serial, 78th","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16190823/600MichaelShannon.jpg","slug":"definitive-michael-shannon-movies"},{"id":"47508964102495","title":"Definitive Coen Brothers Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Coen Brothers MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we take a look at the films that helped define the careers of the writing/directing duo behind Hail, Caesar!by Jeff Giles | February 3, 2016 |  CommentsFor more than two and a half decades now, Joel and Ethan Coen have been thrilling critics — and, here and there, audiences — with their distinctive blend of dark humor, colorful violence, and singular visual flair. Not all of the Coens’ films have been critical darlings (alas, poor Ladykillers), but with lifetime Tomatometers above 80 percent, the brothers are easily two (or is that one?) of the most respected directors in the business. Their latest effort, Hail, Caesar!, hit theaters this week, and to celebrate, we’ve collected their most definitive directorial efforts, Total Recall style!Blood Simple (1984)  94%Combining the shocks of a slasher film with the moral ambiguity and twisty plotting of film noir, the Coens’ debut, Blood Simple, shook American independent cinema to its core. Creepy and deliriously malevolent, it’s the story of a bar owner who hires a sketchy private eye to kill his cheating wife (Frances McDormand); double and triple crosses and bloody mayhem ensues. With their first film, the Coens showed an aptitude for the stylistic quirks that would become their trademark — namely, a love of the ghoulish balanced with a loopy sense of humor. The Palo Alto Weekly’s Jeanne Aufmuth identified what would become recurring themes in their work when she wrote, “The Coens’ complicated sense of the surreal is consistently entertaining, down to the fleeting, oddball cameos and distinctly weird scripting.”Watch TrailerRaising Arizona (1987)  91%The first Coen brothers film to display their knack for quirky comedy,&nbsp;Raising Arizona helped seal the filmmakers’ reputation and cement their loyal following. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are brilliantly cast as a cop and ex-con husband/wife duo who resolve their infertility with kidnapping. Though not their biggest hit, it’s infinitely quotable (“Edwina’s insides were a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase”), and the original score by Carter Burwell is not to be ignored. As the New Times’ Luke Y. Thompson ruefully sighed, “Nic Cage may never be better.”Watch TrailerMiller's Crossing (1990)  92%As an homage to classic gangster movies, Miller’s Crossing is hypercharged; the language is harsher, the violence more brutal, the plotting more labyrinthine. Albert Finney and Gabriel Byrne star as Irish mobsters, threatened externally by the Italian mob and internally by their shared love of a woman (Marcia Gay Harden). This intriguing tale of loyalty features impeccable 1920s decor and a streak of dark humor; it’s arguably the Coens’ most straightforward work. Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson concluded, “it’s one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings.”Watch TrailerBarton Fink (1991)  90%Legend has it the Coens had such a bad case of writers’ block while writing Miller’s Crossing that they took three weeks off to script Barton Fink, a 1930s-set black comedy about — what else? — a Hollywood scribe with writer’s block. A fledgling New York playwright who sells out (at the cost of… his soul!) and moves to the City of Angels, Barton Fink (played marvelously by Coen regular John Turturro) holes up in the seamy Hotel Earle, where exquisitely dismal wallpaper peels off the walls as a heat wave sweats the city. The mercury rises further when Barton’s gregarious neighbor (John Goodman) is around; almost hellishly so, you might say. But as every smart filmmaker is wont to do, the Coens offer no overt explanations of what’s really going on — just a well-told tale with visual imagery aplenty, and an ode to the sometimes infernal nature of the creative process. Describing it as “gnomic, claustrophobic, hallucinatory, just plain weird,” Time’s Richard Schickel lauded Barton Fink as “the kind of movie critics can soak up thousands of words analyzing and cinephiles can soak up at least three espressos arguing their way through.”Watch TrailerFargo (1996)  94%Prior to No Country For Old Men, the macabre, pitch-black comedy&nbsp;Fargo was the Coens’ most decorated film, with seven Oscar nominations and two wins: Best Actress (Frances McDormand) and Best Original Screenplay. Fargo details a ransom kidnap scheme gone wrong, with very pregnant cop McDormand investigating the crime as the bumbling perpetrators attempt to cover their tracks. The Coens’ bleak humor and taste for blood and violence never mixed as well as it did in Minnesota, so the people over at FX decided to create an offshoot television series — with the Coens on board as executvie producers — and it’s gone on to win some awards of its own. According to Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “This is truly a brilliant film, the kind you don’t see often. Intelligent, raw, funny, daring and unique, pure cinematic delight from start to end.”Watch TrailerThe Big Lebowski (1998)  83%Though many of the Coens’ films can be labeled cult classics, perhaps none embody the term more than The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges stars as pot-smoking slacker hero Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski, who seeks restitution for his rug, urinated on by a pair of gangsters who mistook him for a different Lebowski — namely, the “big” one (played by David Huddleston). Along with his bowling buddies, The Dude embarks on a wild chase that’s as funny, depraved, and plain unpredictable as Los Angeles always feels like it should be. Not all critics were willing to join The Dude’s steadily growing cult — Todd McCarthy of Variety sniffed that the movie “Adds up to considerably less than the sum of its often scintillating parts” — but in the end, as Chuck O’Leary of FulvueDrive-in.com wrote, “It’s pretty much impossible not to love The Dude.”Watch TrailerO Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)  78%With O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers took their thriller tropes (ill-fated criminal plans, ironic stereotypes, and a detached tone) and magically applied it towards an Odyssey-inspired farce. Starring George Clooney as the beleaguered but resourceful Odysseus, O Brother is a sepia-toned fantasia of throwaway jokes, slapstick, and killer bluegrass. In fact, the music proved popular enough to spawn a virtual cottage industry with multiple soundtracks, a documentary, and even a national tour. “The surprise is how much fruitful digression such plotlessness makes possible,” quipped Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star. “With no particular place to go, this hobo of a movie is free to roam the damnedest places.”Watch TrailerNo Country for Old Men (2007)  93%Though the Coens have long been revered for their intermittently manic and macabre storylines, they’ve never made Oscar bait. It’s perhaps logical, then, that the massive Academy sweep they enjoyed with No Country for Old Men seemed like overdue praise. In No Country, based on the stoic anti-western novel by Cormack McCarthy, Josh Brolin’s protagonist sees a way out of his trailer in a bag of bloodied bills. Chance and destiny are invoked in the most resonant, least pretentious way in the sinister form of Anton Chigurh (Best Supporting Actor Javier Bardem), the hit man who coldly and relentlessly hunts Brolin’s Llewelyn. No Country is impeccable: the cinematography is breathtaking, the dialogue efficient, and the direction assured. Yet instead of the terse comic punch we’ve come to expect from the Coens, No Country takes a more dangerous tack with its morbid themes. With all the cards (and coins) falling tidily into place, this film presented the brothers as a truly mature filmmaking team, possibly at the peak of their careers — a sentiment echoed by Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix, who proclaimed, “No Country for Old Men is the brothers at their most polished, austere, and humorless.”Watch TrailerTrue Grit (2010)  95%It takes some major stones to step into John Wayne’s boots for a remake of one of the Duke’s classic pictures, so even if the Coen brothers’ True Grit&nbsp;had well and truly stunk, we’d have to give their version credit for having something extra in its saddlebag — namely Jeff Bridges, who took the role of the cantankerous Rooster Cogburn and made it his own. Of course, it didn’t hurt that Bridges (in vintage late-period marble-mouthed form) was surrounded by an ace supporting cast that included Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld, or that the Coens went back to Charles Portis’ original novel for inspiration; in the end, the result was a career-launching hit for Steinfeld, a mainstream hit for the Coens, and another critically acclaimed outing for Bridges — all of whom earned Oscar nominations for their work. As Claudia Puig observed for USA Today, “Joel and Ethan Coen have pulled off an impressive feat: repurposing a classic film with their idiosyncratic blend of dark, deadpan humor and palpable suspense, while remaining ultra-faithful to the novel.”Watch TrailerInside Llewyn Davis (2013)  92%A brilliantly cast ensemble period drama shot through with pitch-black, borderline misanthropic humor and topped off with a killer soundtrack, Inside Llewyn Davis&nbsp;checks off any number of the boxes filmgoers have learned to associate with the Coen brothers, so it’s very much to the film’s credit that it somehow manages to feel fresh anyway. This is due in no small part to the work of Oscar Isaac, who plays the titular struggling folk musician with an utter lack of vanity while infusing the character with enough essential humanity to temper his overall lack of likability — and to the Coens’ screenplay, which serves as a savagely honest, yet ultimately affectionate, look at the self-delusional struggle for artistic purity as a means to its own end. “It may be the Coen Brothers playing well inside their comfort zone,” wrote Scott Mendelson for Forbes, “but what a fine and thoughtful comfort zone it is.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Plus, leads, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/03144549/CoenBros.jpg","slug":"definitive-coen-brothers-movies"},{"id":"47508962653531","title":"Definitive Angela Bassett Roles","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Angela Bassett RolesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at the roles that helped define the London Has Fallen star's career.by Jeff Giles | March 2, 2016 |  CommentsLondon Has Fallen arrives in theaters this weekend, returning Gerard Butler to action as intrepid Secret Service agent Mike Banning — and bringing back Angela Bassett as his boss, Director Lynne Jacobs. It’s always a treat seeing Ms. Bassett on the big screen, so in honor of her return, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a fond look back at some of the brighter critical highlights in her formidable filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!Boyz n the Hood (1991)  94%One of the most sadly prescient films to come out of Hollywood in the last 25 years, writer-director John Singleton’s Boyz N the Hood&nbsp;illustrated the conditions in South Central Los Angeles during a time when most filmgoers didn’t know anything about the area. Singleton, who was 24 when Boyz was released and would ultimately go on to become the youngest person (and first African-American) to earn a Best Director Academy Award nomination, outlined the area’s struggles through the stories of a group of young men: Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Ricky (Morris Chestnut), and Doughboy (Ice Cube). As Tre’s mother, Bassett made the most of an opportunity to play an overmatched single mom — and delivered her share of memorable moments in an early 1990s classic about the growing list of problems facing urban American communities. A hit at Cannes, the box office, and multiple awards associations, Boyz&nbsp;presaged the “hood film” genre — as well as endless cycles of the violence it depicted. “Singleton had his fingers on the pulse of South Central at a time when it desperately needed help,” wrote Filmcritic’s Matt McKillop. “It’s too bad we didn’t listen to him soon enough.”Watch TrailerMalcolm X (1992)  88%Producer Marvin Worth struggled for years to mount a film adaptation of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, with a long list of on- and offscreen talent filtering through the project over a period of several decades before director Spike Lee finally came aboard in 1991. Fortunately, he found himself with the bones of a solid script — and ended up commanding a strong cast that included Denzel Washington as the slain activist and Bassett, who earned an Image Award for her appearance as his wife Betty Shabazz. For all the difficulties leading up to its release, Malcolm X&nbsp;ultimately ended up reaping almost universal critical acclaim; as David Ansen wrote for Newsweek, “Lee and company have performed a powerful service: they have brought Malcolm X very much to life again, both as man and myth.”Watch TrailerWhat's Love Got To Do With It? (1993)  97%Bassett earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Tina Turner in this hit 1993 drama, which paired her with Laurence Fishburne (as Turner’s ex-husband and former musical partner, Ike) and offered an unsparing look at one of the most dramatic — and enduring — success stories in the history of modern American music. Even before the curtain went up audiences knew they were in for a killer soundtrack, but What’s Love Got to Do with It?&nbsp;offered a layered narrative and full-bodied performances to match the Turner tale’s impressive musical heft; as David Sterritt argued for the Christian Science Monitor, “Angela Bassett gives a superbly versatile performance as the heroine, and Laurence Fishburne’s portrayal of Ike Turner consolidates his status as one of the most expressive and intelligent actors in movies today.”Watch TrailerWaiting to Exhale (1995)  60%After proving she could carry a picture with What’s Love Got to Do with It, Bassett continued her successful mid-1990s run with Waiting to Exhale, an adaptation of the Terry McMillan novel about the unsettled love lives of a group of female friends. Part of a talented ensemble that included Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon (not to mention Gregory Hines and Dennis Haysbert on the other side of this battle between the sexes), Bassett helped propel Exhale to over $81 million at the box office, marking first-time director Forest Whitaker as a talent to be reckoned with behind the cameras and setting the stage for her subsequent starring role in the McMillan-inspired How Stella Got Her Groove Back&nbsp;three years later. Although it wasn’t as popular with critics as it was with audiences, it did earn a number of positive reviews, including one from Roger Ebert, who called it “An escapist fantasy that women in the audience can enjoy by musing, ‘I wish I had her problems’ — and her car, house, wardrobe, figure and men, even wrong men.”Watch TrailerHow Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998)  50%Any discussion of Angela Bassett’s filmography would be incomplete without a look at How Stella Got Her Groove Back, the 1998 romantic dramedy — inspired by author Terry McMillan’s best-selling autobiographical novel — about a woman who falls for a much younger man (played by Taye Diggs) while on a Jamaican vacation. While critics were largely reluctant to groove along with the picture, it proved a somewhat modest success at the box office, turning in just under $40 million against a reported $20 million budget, and it did earn a share of acclaim, including Bassett’s NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Motion Picture. If reviews were ultimately largely negative, Bassett’s work received plenty of critical acclaim; as Margaret A. McGurk wrote for the Cincinnati Enquirer, the movie “Gives Angela Bassett the full star treatment, and she gives it right back.”Watch TrailerMusic of the Heart (1999)  63%After rejuvenating his career with the first two chapters in the Scream&nbsp;trilogy, director Wes Craven took a surprising turn into uplifting, reality-based drama with 1999’s Music of the Heart, the story of a Harlem violin teacher (played by Meryl Streep) whose dogged determination (and incredible luck) helped save a school arts program — and put her fundraising concert on stage at Carnegie Hall. It’s just the kind of true story that Hollywood loves to coat with corny melodrama, and while most critics agreed that Craven wasn’t immune to that impulse, they ultimately felt that Streep’s Oscar-nominated performance — along with solid work from a talented ensemble that included Bassett as her character’s principal — helped distinguish Music from similar films. “Some movies you want to see. Some movies you need to see,” wrote Liz Braun for Jam! Movies. “Music of the Heart is one of the latter.”Watch TrailerSunshine State (2002)  80%Writer-director John Sayles offered Bassett a pair of early film roles in City of Hope&nbsp;(1991) and Passion Fish&nbsp;(1992), and while her appearances in both movies were brief, they helped give her a springboard into projects like Boyz N the Hood&nbsp;— so even if Sayles’ script for 2002’s Sunshine State&nbsp;had been subpar, it’s easy to imagine that Bassett would have jumped at the opportunity to work with him again. Happily, quality wasn’t an issue with this ensemble dramedy, which surveys events at pivotal moments in an array of intertwining lives in a small Florida town. Bassett won an Image Award for her work in the film, which the Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday described as “A densely layered, always absorbing whole.”Watch TrailerAkeelah and the Bee (2006)  85%From the instant you look at the poster, you know Akeelah and the Bee&nbsp;is going to be another one of those feel-good pictures about someone (in this case, a cute little girl) overcoming the odds to achieve an unlikely triumph in the final act. But as Roger Ebert is fond of pointing out, it isn’t a formula unless it works, and this is a perfect example of familiar ingredients being used in all the right ways. The story of Akeelah Anderson (Keke Palmer), an 11-year-old girl whose gift for spelling earns her a shot at national acclaim — but places stress on her relationship with her widowed mom (Angela Bassett) — Bee&nbsp;gave Bassett a chance to reunite with frequent co-star Fishburne, who played Akeelah’s coach.&nbsp;We probably don’t need to tell you how it all turns out, but what it lacks in surprises, it more than makes up in a smart script, some sensitive direction from Doug Atchison, and typically strong work from its cast. As the Denver Post’s Michael Booth put it, “Akeelah and the Bee carefully diagrams every cliche we’ve absorbed from sports movies, urban dramas, mentor flicks and precocious-children portraits. Yet it works.”Watch TrailerAmerican Horror Story  77%Bassett‘s made a number of TV appearances throughout her career, both as an episodic series guest and as a cast member in network movies, but she’s become more of a fixture in recent years. After booking a 16-episode arc on ER, she joined the cast of American Horror Story: Coven&nbsp;in 2013 — and evidently had quite a bit of fun, as she returned for AHS: Freak Show&nbsp;the following year and again for AHS: Hotel&nbsp;in 2015-’16. Of course, she’s far from alone on that front — Horror Story‘s long list of talented performers includes Jessica Lange, James Cromwell, Kathy Bates, and Connie Britton — and critics have largely enjoyed the ride; as an appreciative Brian Lowry wrote for Variety, “Where too many TV series become stale after a season or two, Horror Story&nbsp;has a proven ability to transform itself — not just season to season, but also episode to episode and sometimes even scene to scene — built into its creative DNA.”Watch TrailerChi-Raq (2015)  82%More than 20 years after they united to award-winning effect with Malcolm X, Bassett and director Spike Lee teamed up again for Chi-Raq, a politically motivated satirical musical drama that uses Aristophanes’ Lysistrata&nbsp;as the basis for a story that imagines the gangbanger molls of Chicago banding together to deny their significant others sex until they agree to halt the city’s endless cycle of violence. It’s a story that seeks to balance an unwieldy assortment of tones, and its occasionally light treatment of real-life tragedies left some pundits disgruntled even before the movie made its premiere, but the end result enjoyed widespread critical acclaim. “It’s messy in places, as Lee’s movies tend to be. But there isn’t a moment that Chi-Raq&nbsp;isn’t alive,” wrote Stephanie Zacharek for TIME. “This is a deeply serious, biting picture that also has joy in its heart.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"golden, Peek, YouTube, song, werewolf, Rey, park, Reality","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/02141116/AngelaBassettRecall.jpg","slug":"definitive-angela-bassett-roles"},{"id":"47508964115815","title":"Which Tarantino Film Do Critics Like the Most?","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Which Tarantino Film Do Critics Like the Most?In this week's Total Recall, we take a look back at the filmography of The Hateful Eight director.by Jeff Giles | December 23, 2015 |  CommentsSince making his debut with Reservoir Dogs more than 20 years ago, Quentin Tarantino has enjoyed one of the most consistently critically lauded careers of any director in modern Hollywood, and he’s back this weekend with the grim ‘n’ gritty Western ensemble piece The Hateful Eight. Once again, early reviews are solid — which means now is the perfect time to dedicate a feature to taking a fond look back at his earlier efforts. Cover the kids’ ears and keep an eye on Marvin in the back seat, because this week, we’re serving up Total Recall, Tarantino style!Four Rooms (1996)  14%The appeal of anthology films — that audiences can see the work of multiple directors under one narrative umbrella — can also be one of their major drawbacks: The results, as in 1995’s Four Rooms, often strike some viewers as wildly, painfully uneven. As this particular outing proved, success isn’t guaranteed even if you bring together a handful of the industry’s most critically beloved and/or commercially ascendant filmmakers; although Four Rooms united Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, Allison Anders, and Alexandre Rockwell to tell the promise-rich tale of a beleaguered bellhop (Tim Roth) making his way through a series of progressively weirder hotel rooms on New Year’s Eve, only Rodriguez’s segment escaped heaps of withering critical scorn, and the film barely eked out $4 million at the box office. But a 14 percent Tomatometer rating means that a few critics liked it — such as Boxoffice Magazine’s Shlomo Schwartzberg, who shrugged and said, “As a whole, Four Rooms is only diverting, and pretty mindless, but at its best it’s a lot of fun.”Watch TrailerDeath Proof (2007)  65%Forged by the bond of friendship between Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez — as well as their shared love of sloppy, bloody, low-budget exploitation flicks — 2007’s Grindhouse found the two directors splitting a three-hour double bill that took audiences from cheeky zombie terror (Rodriguez’s Planet Terror) to seethingly violent high-octane action (Tarantino’s Death Proof). At 67 percent, Tarantino’s half of Grindhouse got the short end of the Tomatometer stick, but plenty of critics still enjoyed his gleefully depraved look at a homicidal stuntman (Kurt Russell) with a fondness for murdering young ladies. “I’ve rarely seen a filmmaker, in current Hollywood at least, expose his sexual and sadistic kinks on screen with such shameless glee,” observed an admiring Kevin N. Laforest for the Montreal Film Journal.Watch TrailerThe Hateful Eight (2015)  74%What if Quentin Tarantino tried his hand at an Agatha Christie mystery? Filmgoers got their answer to that question — sort of — with 2015’s The Hateful Eight, in which a rogue’s gallery of typically Tarantino-esque characters find themselves bound up in lethally close quarters while a murder mystery inexorably tightens its way toward a gleefully violent conclusion. It’s a setup rich with possibilities for the director’s signature style of filmmaking, and in a fair number of respects, critics said Hateful didn’t disappoint: Tarantino assembled a stellar ensemble cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, and fed them heaping servings of the sort of pungently knotty dialogue fans have come to expect. Yet while Tarantino’s films have often benefited from an approach to violence that could be charitably described as “enthusiastic,” some scribes admitted to a certain amount of discomfort with the particular brand of bloodshed he unleashed here, identifying a darker, meaner strain that explored racism and misogyny without necessarily offering illumination. “The Hateful Eight is a movie about the worst aspects of human nature, which is why the film can’t be quite described as ‘fun,’ at least in the traditional sense,” wrote the Miami Herald’s Rene Rodriguez. “But Tarantino isn’t glorifying the ugliness; he’s condemning it.”Watch TrailerKill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)  84%Six months after kicking off his Kill Bill revenge saga with Volume 1, Tarantino returned to theaters with its conclusion. Part kung fu brawl, part origin story, Kill Bill: Volume 2 fills in the blanks of its katana-wielding protagonist’s (Uma Thurman) past while she slices and dices her way to whatever passes for redemption. Clocking in at over four hours between the two installments, it’s a pretty hefty cinematic experience for something that boils down to a fairly simple tale, but most critics didn’t mind at all — in fact, Volume 2 performed nearly as well as its predecessor on the Tomatometer. As Jeremy Heilman of MovieMartyr argued, “The massive combination of the first and second Kill Bill movies stands as a testament to both Tarantino’s exceptional skill as a filmmaker and the possibilities of pop cinema.”Watch TrailerKill Bill: Volume 1 (2003)  85%After a seemingly interminable six-year wait following Jackie Brown, Tarantino re-emerged with a blood-spattered martial arts epic so sprawling it needed to be chopped in half. Enter 2003’s Kill Bill: Volume 1, starring Uma Thurman as an assassin whose plans to leave the fold for a life of wedded bliss hit a snag when her mentor (David Carradine) decides he’d rather have her dead than retired, and sends her fellow killers-for-hire (played by Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen) to put a permanent stop to the nuptials. After watching Thurman’s take-no-prisoners performance, the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris couldn’t help but say, “I would argue that, in a bizarre way, Mr. Tarantino empowers women as no action-genre director before him ever has.”Watch TrailerJackie Brown (1997)  87%Three years after achieving “young Hollywood genius” status with Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino re-emerged with Jackie Brown, a 154-minute adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch that served as Tarantino’s homage to 1970s blaxploitation while resurrecting the career of one of the genre’s biggest stars: Pam Grier. Hitherto known for playing the title role in 1974’s Foxy Brown, Grier returned to the big screen in pretty good company, including Bridget Fonda, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Chris Tucker, Robert De Niro, and Pulp Fiction star Samuel L. Jackson. While it was ultimately a bit of a critical and commercial letdown after the raging success of Pulp Fiction, Jackie still proved a favorite for scribes like Chuck Rudolph of Matinee Magazine, who wrote that it “Achieves the soulful edge lacking from Tarantino’s previous efforts. Forster and Grier’s performances deserve to join the short-list of all-time greats.”Watch TrailerDjango Unchained (2012)  87%Having entered the realm of social justice revenge fantasy with Inglourious Basterds, Tarantino basically remained there for Django Unchained, a pre-Civil War Western about a slave (Jamie Foxx) in an unorthodox partnership with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) who needs his assistance to apprehend of a trio of outlaws — and is willing to not only grant his freedom in exchange, but help Django find and free his wife (Kerry Washington) from the clutches of a sadistic plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). It’s the perfect setup for two hours and change of profane, gleefully violent action, and Tarantino more than delivers with a star-studded excoriation of systematic injustice that manages to treat its subject with something approaching the proper respect without sacrificing an ounce of momentum. The end result, wrote the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, is “Wildly extravagant, ferociously violent, ludicrously lurid and outrageously entertaining, yet also, remarkably, very much about the pernicious lunacy of racism and, yes, slavery’s singular horrors.”Watch TrailerInglourious Basterds (2009)  89%Any film fan worth his or her salt has seen plenty of World War II movies, but Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds added a little something special to the mix — an eminently well-cast revenge fantasy, starring a motley crew of solid actors (including Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and Michael Fassbender) as soldiers in a parallel reality where the evil of the Third Reich is met full force with an Allied squadron whose members are hungry for Nazi blood (and/or scalps). Boasting a uniquely cathartic flavor of Tarantino-brewed violence to go with its taut drama and dark wit, Basterds proved powerfully compelling for critics like Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek, who had to concede, “Quentin Tarantino seems to be hanging on to a lost world of moviemaking. He may be nuts. But he’s a nut who cares.”Watch TrailerReservoir Dogs (1992)  92%Debuts don’t come much more auspicious than Reservoir Dogs. Yes, it’s a profane, blood-splattered heist flick — and goodness knows we have more than enough of those — but this one’s noteworthy for a number of things, including its hyper-literate script, its killer soundtrack, and a cast stuffed with tremendously talented character actors (including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen). While it didn’t exactly set the world on fire during its small theatrical run, it did offer cineastes an early look at one of modern filmmaking’s most exciting, fully formed talents — and it definitely drew the notice of critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “It’s unclear whether this macho thriller does anything to improve the state of the world or our understanding of it, but it certainly sets off enough rockets to hold and shake us for every one of its 99 minutes.”Watch TrailerPulp Fiction (1994)  92%Some careers take a while to get going — and then there’s Quentin Tarantino, who drew almost universal critical praise for Reservoir Dogs before skyrocketing into the Hollywood stratosphere with his second film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. A $214 million box office smash and seven-time Academy Award nominee (as well as Best Original Screenplay winner), Fiction offered a blend of pop culture smarts, laugh-out-loud humor, and shocking violence so potent (and massively influential) that it even managed to revitalize John Travolta’s long-moribund acting career — and left Dusty Springfield’s “Son of a Preacher Man” blasting out of countless college dorm rooms along the way. It was also, as Janet Maslin of the New York Times noted, “A triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino’s ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Ellie, Christmas, furious, romance, Dates, E!, on, Apple, football, Esquire, GoT, A24, Paramount, Series","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/23235017/Hateful8-Rep.jpg","slug":"tarantino-movies-ranked-by-tomatometer"},{"id":"47508964119913","title":"Definitive Michael Caine Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Michael Caine MoviesWe look back at the roles that have helped mold the Youth star's career.by Jeff Giles | December 2, 2015 |  CommentsA film and television fixture for decades, Michael Caine is one of Hollywood’s best and brightest (he’s earned an Oscar nomination at least once a decade since the 1960s), with an incredible list of credits as a leading man and a supporting player — and even a few minor roles, like his brief appearance in 2006’s Children of Men. As if that wasn’t impressive enough, Caine’s also a published author, a chillout DJ, and a knight of the Order of the British Empire — and now, thanks to the debut of his latest film, Youth, he can add “subject of a Rotten Tomatoes Total Recall” to his list of accomplishments. Let’s take a look at Michael Caine’s definitive roles!Zulu (1964)  96%Caine scored his first starring role in this Cy Endfield production, which told the story of the Battle of Rorke’s Drift during the late 19th century Anglo-Zulu War. The culmination of a long and bitter border dispute, the war ultimately added another bloody chapter to British colonialism in the region, but not without months of the kind of struggle dramatized in Zulu — and the efforts of soldiers like lieutenants John Chard (played by Stanley Baker, who also produced) and Gonville Bromhead (played by Caine), who threw together a makeshift fort to make a desperate stand against the opposition. Though barely a footnote in American history books, Rorke’s Drift produced a number of decorated veterans for the British Army — and an early critical triumph for its freshly minted star. “Caine was just splendid,” applauded Dennis Schwartz of Ozus’ World Movie Reviews. “It is still one of his finest hours in film.”Watch TrailerThe Ipcress File (1965)  100%Caine made his first — and, critically speaking, his best — appearance as Len Deighton’s rumpled spy Harry Palmer in this 1965 thriller, which gave fans of cinematic espionage a slightly more realistic alternative to James Bond. Emphasis on the slightly: Although Harry had to contend with more bureaucratic red tape (and got to play with fewer gadgets) than 007, his adventures still included a few of the fanciful elements that make a good spy yarn, like The Ipcress File‘s high-tech tape recordings and brainwashing baddies. Caine went on to play Palmer in two sequels and a pair of made-for-TV movies, but Ipcress was the one that helped him break out as a leading man: As Angie Errigo of Empire noted, “Caine, Zulu under his belt and Alfie ahead, is the cheeky working class but aspirational bright spark hero par excellence, captured at the exact moment he became a star.”Watch TrailerAlfie (1966)  96%The quintessential swinging ’60s film, Alfie is undeniably a product of its time, and it can admittedly be hard to watch it in 2015 without thinking of Austin Powers or wincing at the dated lingo and/or fashions. But this adaptation of the Bill Naughton novel remains a classic for many reasons, chief among them Michael Caine’s impressively nuanced, Oscar-nominated performance in the title role. Alfie Elkins is a cad, plain and simple, but Caine made audiences root for him anyway by giving them glimpses of his humanity — and not only in the few scenes where he was called upon to show some real emotion, but throughout the entire film, as he slowly, subtly took the character on a journey from callow bachelor to… well, less callow bachelor. As Dan Lybarger put it in his review for Nitrate Online, “Caine’s terrific performance makes a viewer almost forget that the film is actually a condemnation of its character’s swinging lifestyle.”Watch TrailerGet Carter (1971)  84%A stark, unflinching portrait of the lingering stain that violence can leave on a person’s life — even after they’re dead — Get Carter repulsed many critics when it was released, but behind all that ugly violence lurks a film whose sharp script, strong performances, and surprisingly thoughtful themes are impossible to ignore. The critics eventually came around, too; over time, Carter has come to be regarded as one of the best gangster movies ever made — and even one of Britain’s best films overall. In another actor’s hands, the role of the vengeful Jack Carter would have been a thuggish cartoon, but Caine infused his character’s homicidal rampage with palpable pain and sorrow. (For an example of how it could have gone wrong, watch Sylvester Stallone’s 2000 remake, which featured Caine in a supporting role. Or better yet, don’t.) He’d earned praise for earlier roles, but Caine really started coming into his own here; as Roger Ebert noted in his review, “Caine has been mucking about in a series of potboilers, undermining his acting reputation along the way, but Get Carter shows him as sure, fine and vicious — a good hero for an action movie.”Watch TrailerSleuth (1972)  96%Caine went toe to toe with Laurence Olivier in this adaptation of the Anthony Shaffer play, directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve). A seriously impressive pedigree, and it paid off on the screen: Caine and Olivier were the only credited actors in the movie, and Sleuth earned them both Best Actor nominations — something that had, to that point, happened only once before (the first? Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf). As with a lot of stage adaptations, Sleuth is extremely dialogue-heavy, but with actors this talented, that helps; over the course of its two hours-plus running time, the complicated rivalry between nobleman Andrew Wyke (Olivier) and struggling businessman Milo Tindle (Caine) deepens with every line. It’s such a rich story, Caine actually took Olivier’s role for Kenneth Branagh’s 2007 remake, starring opposite Jude Law. “It’s one of those works built around a gimmick that in fact requires a little cheating on the part of the filmmakers in order to succeed,” wrote Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress. “But it’s a good gimmick.”Watch TrailerThe Man Who Would Be King (1975)  97%John Huston waited more than 20 years to finish this adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s short story about a pair of adventurers and their exploits in a remote Afghan village, trying to cast a succession of rugged duos (from Bogey and Clark Gable to Robert Redford and Paul Newman) before finally finding his leading men in Caine and Sean Connery. Blending anti-imperialist themes with swashbuckling escapism, The Man Who Would Be King charts the rise and fall of Peachy Carnehan (Caine) and Danny Dravot (Connery) as they dupe an Afghan village into thinking they’re gods, only to find that the natives aren’t quite as credulous as they seem. It was, in short, a slice of good old-fashioned adventure during a time when it had fallen out of favor — making King, in the words of Cole Smithey, “A must for every 10-year-old boy.”Watch TrailerHannah and Her Sisters (1986)  91%Woody Allen lined up one of his strongest ensemble casts for the seven-time Academy Award nominee Hannah and Her Sisters, starring Caine as Elliot, the restless husband of Hannah (Mia Farrow) whose dissatisfaction with his marriage leads him into an entanglement with — you guessed it — Hannah’s sister (Barbara Hershey). It’s the kind of story Allen tells best, and Hannah is one of his strongest — and most successful — films, ultimately winning a Best Writing Oscar to go with its healthy $40 million gross. “No matter how passive a viewer you are, how much you attempt to dismiss it or judge its characters,” wrote Steven Snyder for Zertinet Movies, “Woody Allen reaches past those sleepy, cynical, or questioning eyes and makes you think as much as any film I’ve seen.”Watch TrailerMona Lisa (1986)  97%Writer/director Neil Jordan scored one of his earliest critical hits with 1986’s Mona Lisa, starring Bob Hoskins as George, an ex-con who is manipulated by his former boss, a gangster named Mortwell (Caine), into a relationship with a prostitute (Cicely Tyson) so Mortwell can take advantage of her “professional” connection to a rival. Caine is in singularly sleazy form here, but it was Hoskins, in a rare starring role, who walked away with a pile of trophies, including a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award, and an Oscar nomination. Part love story, part grisly mobster drama, Mona Lisa didn’t make a ton of money at the box office, but it did earn the admiration of critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who wrote, “In an era when movies about love almost always invariably devolve into formulaic affairs, Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa stands out as an often-surprising, multi-layered achievement.”Watch TrailerThe Quiet American (2003)  87%The first time Hollywood took a crack at adapting Graham Greene’s bestselling novel, the result was a bowdlerized version that, much to his chagrin, stripped out the author’s distaste with American involvement in Vietnam. More than 40 years later, director Phillip Noyce filmed a much more faithful adaptation, starring Brendan Fraser as an idealistic CIA operative in 1950s Vietnam, Michael Caine as the jaded British journalist who crosses his path, and Do Thi Hai Yen as the woman who comes between them. What Noyce’s version lost in timeliness, it more than made up in script and cast — most notably Caine, who earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his work and was singled out in reviews from critics such as Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Caine, who also starred in one other Greene adaptation, 1983’s The Honorary Consul, is the essence of almost all the author’s misfits, ” wrote Gillespie, summing him up as “a practiced cynic masking an aching romantic.”Watch TrailerThe Dark Knight TrilogyBruce Wayne might be an unimaginably wealthy businessman who lives a double life as the crime-purging vigilante Batman, but he wouldn’t be able to get much done without the dependable service of his long-suffering butler, Alfred Pennyworth — and when Christopher Nolan took over the franchise with 2005’s Batman Begins, he turned to Caine to embody the character with his unique ability to project an aura of good breeding, street smarts, and a quick, understated wit. Though not one of Caine’s larger roles, Alfred is an integral part of the Batman mythos, and his part in the franchise placed him alongside talented actors such as Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, and Heath Ledger — whose bravura performance as the Joker in The Dark Knight&nbsp;was a crucial element in the positive reviews the movie earned from critics like Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, who wrote, “Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, The Dark Knight&nbsp;goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"comedies, Netflix, concert, Rocketman, Association, Adventures, TCM, stand-up, cinematic, Pirates, Family, shows","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/01155404/MichaelCaine.jpg","slug":"definitive-michael-caine-movies"},{"id":"47508965237103","title":"10 Beloved TV Shows That Were Made Into Awful Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Beloved TV Shows That Were Made Into Awful MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at some of the worst adaptations of popular TV series ever to hit the big screen.by Jeff Giles | October 21, 2015 |  CommentsWhen Jem and the Holograms makes its truly outrageous way into theaters this weekend, it’ll add another entry to the long list of successful television shows that have been adapted for the big screen. Of course, just because a concept works as a series doesn’t mean it’ll pay off as a film — and although all of us here certainly wish nothing but the best for Jem and her pals on their cinematic adventures, we’re willing to concede the possibility that this will end up being another instance where a few things will be lost in translation. In that spirit, we’ve decided to dedicate this feature to some of the bumpier journeys hit shows have experienced on the way to the cineplex, so don’t touch that dial — it’s time for Total Recall!Land of the Lost (2009)  26%Will Ferrell, Danny McBride, and dinosaurs — plus a loose creative affiliation with one of the most beloved live-action Saturday morning serials of the 1970s. It’s a can’t-miss proposition, right? Universal certainly seemed to think so, given that the studio ponied up $100 million and a plum June release date for 2009’s Land of the Lost. Sadly, the result — which starred Ferrell as a nincompoop paleontologist who triggers a time warp and finds himself trapped in the distant past with a college student (Anna Friel) and a gift shop owner (McBride) — didn’t even try to recapture the low-budget magic of the original series, opting instead for a satirical approach that failed to resound with filmgoers and critics alike. “With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb, Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation, but he’s not doing anything fresh in Land of the Lost,” opined a disappointed Peter Rainer for the Christian Science Monitor.Watch TrailerBewitched (2005)  24%Bewitched&nbsp;was an undeniably silly show, but its high-concept premise — about a witch who falls for an ordinary guy and tries to fit in with his suburban existence — was used to address a wide variety of themes and topics during its eight-season run. Updating the show for the 21st century really could have been a good idea, particularly with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in the lead and Nora Ephron writing, directing, and producing, but this is one case of the road to cinematic hell being paved with good intentions — not to mention a convoluted script that added an unnecessary meta layer to the whole thing. In this version of Bewitched, Ferrell plays a washed-up actor approached to star in a film adaptation of Bewitched… whose vain attempt to secure a nobody for a co-star leads him to unwittingly cast an actual witch. It’s the kind of self-consciously aware stuff that really needs to be clever in order to work; alas, cleverness proved to be in exceedingly short supply. “If it lost every bad idea, miscast actor, wasted performance, and botched scene,” predicted the A.V. Club’s Nathan Rabin, “nothing would be left but the end credits.”Watch TrailerThe Beverly Hillbillies (1993)  22%A number of long-gone television shows were adapted for the big screen in the early 1990s, with wildly varying results; for every critical and commercial hit like The Brady Bunch Movie, there were a number of duds like… well, a few of the other films on this list, actually. Somewhere in the middle sat 1993’s The Beverly Hillbillies, director Penelope Spheeris’ rather inexplicable follow-up to her triumph with Wayne’s World&nbsp;the previous year — although the movie made money, it was a critical disaster, with review after review rejecting the film’s aggressive attempt to update the barn-broad cornpone humor of the hit series. While Spheeris enlisted a talented cast to portray the oil-rich Clampett clan, building a roster of stars that included Cloris Leachman, Lily Tomlin, Dabney Coleman, and Jim Varney, and the movie even worked in a clever cameo from original Beverly Hillbillies&nbsp;star Buddy Ebsen as his other&nbsp;iconic TV character, Barnaby Jones, it simply wasn’t enough to overcome the movie’s many creative flaws. “Four writers worked on the script,” noted the Chicago Reader’s Jonathan Rosenbaum. “They all should hang their heads in shame.”Watch TrailerWild Wild West (1999)  17%Starting with 1995’s Bad Boys, Will Smith pretty much owned the box office for the back half of the decade, toplining an impressive string of hits that included Independence Day, Men in Black, and Enemy of the State. By 1999, he had nowhere to go but down — although no one expected him to take a tumble as fast and steep as the infamous Wild Wild West, a woeful would-be Western steampunk action-comedy that entered theaters positioned as the hit of the summer and instantly revealed itself to be just as ludicrously ungainly as the mechanized spider thing piloted by Kenneth Branagh in the final act. Based on the hit CBS series that was described as “James Bond on horseback” during its 1965-’69 run, the big-screen West aped some of the form of its predecessor (including its flights of technological fancy), but neglected to include a sensible storyline, memorable characters, or interesting dialogue; the result was one of the least-loved major releases of the year. He’d certainly go on to enjoy further cinematic successes, but after this, Hollywood understood it needed more than Will Smith and some killer special effects to cook up a hit. “Wild Wild West&nbsp;is a comedy dead zone,” decreed Roger Ebert. “You stare in disbelief as scenes flop and die. The movie is all concept and no content; the elaborate special effects are like watching money burn on the screen.”Watch TrailerI Spy (2002)  16%It broke new racial ground, but in terms of its concept, I Spy&nbsp;was pretty standard stuff — the secret agent adventures of an undercover tennis player (Robert Culp) and his trainer (Bill Cosby) as they traipsed around the world stopping bad guys. The secret of its Emmy-winning success was the abundant chemistry between Culp and Cosby — not to mention the sharp writing. All of the above was lost in translation when the show made its way to theaters in 2002, despite a small army of screenwriters and the star power of Owen Wilson and Eddie Murphy. The problem, according to Ed Park of the Village Voice: “Though ample time is spent mingling Murphy’s jabberjaw locutions and Wilson’s curveball spaciness, the film leaves only the bitter reek of a botched chemistry experiment.”Watch TrailerThe Dukes of Hazzard (2005)  14%A thinly disguised spinoff of the 1975 film Moonrunners, the hit CBS series The Dukes of Hazzard&nbsp;was never regarded as, shall we say, particularly intelligent&nbsp;entertainment. It was harmlessly cheesy fun, the rootin’ tootin’ adventures of some good ol’ boys who never meant no harm and were just makin’ their way the only way they knew how — which was, unfortunately just a little bit more than the law would allow. In other words, it should have been relatively easy to make an entertaining Dukes movie in 2005, especially with an eclectic cast that included Seann William Scott, Johnny Knoxville, Burt Reynolds, and an exuberantly short-shorted Jessica Simpson. Alas, although it broke $100 million at the box office, the Dukes&nbsp;movie was lambasted by critics like Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post, who lamented it as “So loud, so long, so dumb.”Watch TrailerThe Avengers (1998)  5%Super-producer Jerry Weintraub has blockbuster powers beyond most mere mortals, but not even his magic box-office touch was enough to take a big-budget adaptation of the ‘60s British series The Avengers&nbsp;and turn it into a hit movie nearly 30 years after the show’s final airdate. It definitely wasn’t for lack of effort: Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman signed on to play secret agents John Steed and Emma Peel, while Sean Connery co-starred as the villainous weather-controlling madman Sir August de Wynter. But not even the finest cast could have altered the public’s indifference toward a movie based on a property many filmgoers were barely familiar with, and the project was also a fairly odd fit for director Jeremiah Chechik, whose previous credits included National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation. The result was a bruising flop whose failure helped speed Connery’s looming retirement and prompted David Bianculli of the New York Daily News to moan, “This Avengers&nbsp;film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar&nbsp;and Howard the Duck&nbsp;a good name.”Watch TrailerThe Mod Squad (1999)  3%During its 1968-73 run on ABC, The Mod Squad&nbsp;was not only a moderate hit, it could be argued that the show was actually important: with its hippies-solving-crimes formula and a focus on multicultural storylines, it helped make the counterculture safe for mainstream American audiences. But it was also very much a product of its time (example: the cringeworthy promo tagline “One White, One Black, One Blonde”), and when MGM decided to give the Squad a new look with 1999’s Scott Silver-directed movie, the results were disastrous. Despite an attractive cast led by Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar Epps, the updated Mod Squad petered out at 4 percent on the Tomatometer, thanks to what the Palo Alto Weekly’s Jim Shelby called “a pristine example of incoherent storyline mixed with poor editing and limp writing.”Watch TrailerMcHale's Navy (1997)  3%The McHale’s Navy&nbsp;TV series was so successful that midway through its run, it spawned a 1964 theatrical effort that managed to sell tickets despite the obvious fact that it was little more than a 90-minute episode of the show. Thirty years later, none of the above should have indicated to any rational person that the world was waiting for a goofy McHale’s update starring Tom Arnold, Tim Curry, and David Alan Grier, but that’s still what we got in 1997. Fresh off the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie and in the midst of a banner year that also included the Tim Allen/Kirstie Alley vehicle&nbsp;For Richer or Poorer, director Bryan Spicer assembled an alleged comedy following the exploits of the original McHale’s son (played by Arnold) who’s drawn out of retirement in order to combat the world’s second-best terrorist (Curry). The finished product, as Liam Lacy decreed for the Globe and Mail, was “A useless movie. Not funny, suspenseful, moving or even offensive enough to want to torpedo. Just devoid of any conceivable value.”Watch TrailerCar 54, Where Are You? (1994)  0%It’s hardly remembered as a TV classic today, but Car 54, Where Are You?&nbsp;was an Emmy-winning hit during its two-season run on NBC from 1961-’63, and its premise — centering on the goofy misadventures of a pair of Bronx cops (played by Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne) — should have been fairly easy to bring to the big screen. Unfortunately, something unfunny happened along the way, and Tapeheads&nbsp;director Bill Fishman’s adaptation was doomed well before it even arrived in theaters. In fact, the movie version of Car 54&nbsp;— with David “Buster Poindexter” Johansen and future Scrubs&nbsp;star John C. McGinley subbing in for Ross and Gwynne — moldered in the studio’s vault for years before finally puttering into cineplexes in 1994. Ultimately, it needn’t have bothered; despite appearances from original stars Al Lews and Nipsey Russell, the results proved a thoroughly misbegotten effort to update the show’s campy laughs. “Some movies are so bad they warrant special attention,” warned the Chicago Tribune’s Jim Petrakis. “Car 54, Where Are You&nbsp;is one of them.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Podcast, FX, miniseries, Red, visit, BBC, Studios, Columbia, Acorn, Book, PlayStation, stoner, Netflix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/WorstTvShowMovies.jpg","slug":"worst-movies-based-on-tvshows"},{"id":"47508964122987","title":"Definitive Jennifer Lawrence Roles","content":"(Photo by Weinstein Company LLC/Courtesy Everett Collection)All&nbsp;Jennifer Lawrence Movies RankedIf there ever was a life-or-death need to pick a Hollywood it-girl to define the 2010s, Jennifer Lawrence would surely be the one chosen to save our hides.

A beloved small-screen star on The Andy Griffith Show&nbsp;and Happy Days, he’s spent the last 35 years focusing on directing — and his latest effort, the aquatic drama In the Heart of the Sea, arrives in theaters this weekend, so we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a rundown of some of the brighter critical highlights from a career full of crowd-pleasers. Goodbye gray sky, hello blue — it’s time for Total Recall!Night Shift (1982)  92%Howard could have been accused of tempting fate when he elected to direct his Happy Days&nbsp;buddy Henry Winkler in 1982’s Night Shift&nbsp;— a particularly risky move considering that in the movie, Winkler shed his Fonzie cool to play the nebbishy Chuck Lumley, a newly hired morgue attendant who finds himself going against his better judgment to participate in the cockamamie schemes hatched by his fast-talking co-worker Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) and ends up becoming the de facto co-manager of a thoroughly unusual brothel hosted by a free-spirited hooker (Shelley Long). Ralph Malph was nowhere in sight, in other words, but there was plenty of sitting on it going on — and loads of critical praise, including a positive review from Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “This isn’t as snappily directed or as caustically conceived as the subsequent Risky Business, which has a similar theme, but it’s arguably just as sexy and almost as funny.”Watch TrailerSplash (1984)  91%Starring in a frothy romantic comedy as a man who falls in love with a mermaid may not seem like the surest path to starting a film career, but then, 1984’s Splash&nbsp;was no ordinary movie — in fact, it started a lot of things, among them an entire studio (Touchstone Pictures, created to allow Disney the ability to release more “adult” fare without sullying its name brand), a surge in the number of girls named Madison, and, supposedly, a name change for the Disneyland ride that eventually became Splash Mountain. Not bad for a movie featuring a pair of largely untested stars (Hanks was fresh from Bosom Buddies, and Hannah was known mainly for her role in Blade Runner) and a director most people still thought of as Opie Taylor (or Richie Cunningham). Nearly $70 million in domestic receipts (and one Academy Award nomination) later, and all three were on their way to bigger and brighter things, thanks in part to positive critical buzz that has proven surprisingly durable; recently, Empire’s Ian Freer held it up as “the movie that really showed Tom Hanks’ promise as a deliverer of great comedy and heart-warming pathos.”Watch TrailerCocoon (1985)  79%Round up a group of wily old acting pros like Don Ameche, Maureen Stapleton, Wilford Brimley, Jessica Tandy, and Hume Cronyn, and you can have them do pretty much any old thing and make it well worth watching — even if the script in question is a gauzily sentimental sci-fi dramedy about senior citizens accidentally stumbling across a batch of age-reversing alien pods while Steve Guttenberg does his uniquely 1980s Guttenberg thing. The threat of heartstring-tugging sap was high with Cocoon, but screenwriter Tom Benedek (working from David Saperstein’s novel) treated his characters with dignity, and Howard’s direction left plenty of room for the cast to carry the movie with remarkably deft performances that managed to be funny, thought-provoking, and heartbreakingly poignant — sometimes within the same scene. “Mr. Howard brings a real sweetness to his subject, as does the film’s fine cast of veteran stars; he has also given Cocoon&nbsp;the bright, expansive look of a hot-weather hit,” wrote Janet Maslin for the New York Times. “And even when the film begins to falter, as it does in its latter sections, Mr. Howard’s touch remains reasonably steady.”Watch TrailerParenthood (1989)  91%Ten years after redefining doofus comedy with 1979’s The Jerk, Steve Martin had (mostly) traded in props and pratfalls — and he cemented his more reflective, mature on-screen persona with his appearance as sensitive dad Gil Buckman in Ron Howard’s Parenthood. Blending comedy and drama with crowded casts was trendy for a time in the late ’80s (thirtysomething, anyone?), and there are few better examples of the “dramedy” subgenre than this tender, witty look at the tangled bonds between parents and their kids; Parenthood was greeted with a wave of glowing reviews upon its release, many of them reserving their highest praise for the uncommon dexterity with which the story (written by Howard, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel) jumps between its numerous threads. As Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers pointed out, “It’s a shock, and a welcome one, to see Steve Martin cast against type as a doting dad. Martin’s nippy wit continually lifts this movie above the swamp of sentiment.”Watch TrailerThe Paper (1994)  88%Howard reunited with his Night Shift&nbsp;star, Michael Keaton, for a very different kind of project in 1994: The Paper, an ensemble dramedy about the frantic goings-on behind the scenes during 24 hours in the life of a New York City newspaper. While things have changed drastically for the publishing industry in the years since The Paper’s release, rendering the movie’s backdrop rather quaint, the sharp writing (from brothers David and Stephen Koepp) and rock-solid acting — rounded out by a showy cast that also included Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Jason Robards, and Marisa Tomei — are timeless. “Howard, after stumbling with Far and Away, is back in form, and perhaps at the top of his game,” enthused Chris Hicks for the Deseret News. “There are times when the sheer size of the film seems enough to throw it off the track, but Howard manages, for the most part, to keep things rolling along in his usual slick, if sometimes obvious fashion.”Watch TrailerApollo 13 (1995)  96%Splash&nbsp;buddies Tom Hanks and Ron Howard reunited for 1995’s Apollo 13, a dramatization of NASA’s aborted 1970 lunar mission that combined one of Hanks’ biggest personal passions — space travel — with Hollywood’s favorite thing: a blockbuster prestige picture. With a cast that featured a number of similarly prolific actors (among them Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Ed Harris, and Hanks’ Forrest Gump&nbsp;costar Gary Sinise), Apollo&nbsp;probably would have made decent money even if it had played fast and loose with the real-life details of the launch, but Howard and his crew strove for verisimilitude, going so far as to shoot portions of the film in actual zero gravity. The result was a summertime smash that restored some of space travel’s luster for a jaded generation — and made for an exceedingly good filmgoing experience according to most critics, including Roger Ebert, who called it “a powerful story, one of the year’s best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.”Watch TrailerA Beautiful Mind (2001)  74%Only a year after scoring his Best Actor Academy Award for Gladiator, Russell Crowe resurfaced on Oscar ballots for his work in Howard’s A Beautiful Mind, which dramatized the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a Nobel-winning economist whose struggles with schizophrenia have darkened a remarkable life. Though its historical accuracy was questioned, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman was accused of cherry-picking details from Nash’s life to make him a more sympathetic character, the result was still a film that grossed more than $300 million and earned four Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Director, as well as another Best Actor nomination for Crowe). As Bob Bloom of Lafayette Journal and Courier wrote, “A brilliant performance by Russell Crowe, who takes his audience on a terrifying journey inside a man tormented by self-created mental demons, propels A Beautiful Mind.”Watch TrailerCinderella Man (2005)  80%One good biopic deserves another, A Beautiful Mind&nbsp;teammates Ron Howard and Russell Crowe reunited four years later for another life story — the tale of Depression-era heavyweight champion James J. Braddock, who was dubbed “The Cinderella Man” even before he overcame 10-to-1 odds and defeated Max Baer to claim his title. Surrounded by a top-shelf cast that included Renee Zellweger, Paddy Considine, and Paul Giamatti (who received one of the film’s three Oscar nominations), Crowe embodied both the raw physicality and the inner struggle of a fighter who risked his health, and his marriage, to stay in the ring. Though Cinderella Man&nbsp;wasn’t a Beautiful Mind-sized hit, it did break the $100 million mark — and it earned the admiration of most critics, including Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly, who wrote, “How exceptional a film actor is Russell Crowe? So exceptional that in Cinderella Man, he makes a good boxing movie feel at times like a great, big picture.”Watch TrailerFrost/Nixon (2008)  93%Howard earned some of the better reviews of his career for 2009’s Frost/Nixon, which adapts the Peter Morgan play that dramatized British broadcaster David Frost’s (played by Michael Sheen) efforts to secure and sell a series of TV interviews with the politically exiled former president (portrayed by Frank Langella). Although plenty of pundits took umbrage at the way Morgan’s screenplay took liberties with the actual events that inspired the film, for the vast majority of critics, Frost/Nixon‘s flaws seemed pretty minor when weighed against the script, direction, editing, completed picture, and Langella’s performance — all of which received Oscar nominations. For the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, it all added up to “A must-see for political junkies, history buffs, and folks still fascinated by the paranoia-fueled follies of the twitchy, sweaty, decidedly uncharismatic 37th president.”Watch TrailerRush (2013)  89%As he’s shown repeatedly throughout his career, Howard is adept when it comes to finding the cinematic drama in a nonfiction story — and there was plenty of it to distill for the fact-based fuel that powers Rush, his 2013 biopic about the real-life rivalry between Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl). Where many filmmakers might use a racing biopic as an excuse to focus on glossy, Days of Thunder-style revving and zooming, Howard honed in on the human element at play between his dual protagonists, crafting an engrossing tale of two temperamental opposites conjoined by a career that could kill either one of them every time they step on the track. “Howard keeps his cameras small and all over the cars, to show us dazzling machinery in motion, the ground whizzing by in a blur underneath,” observed Stephen Whitty for the Newark Star-Ledger. “Playing to his own strengths, though, he keeps this a movie about character.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"VOD, PlayStation, docudrama, Prime, Reviews, TV, street, directors","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/09165834/RonHoward1.jpg","slug":"definitive-ron-howard-movies"},{"id":"47508966886780","title":"Tomatopalooza: Cinema’s Greatest Fake Bands","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Tomatopalooza: Cinema's Greatest Fake BandsA list of moviedom's greatest hits.by RT Staff | August 6, 2015 |  CommentsThis week, Meryl Streep will attempt to prove she’s hip enough to rock out with the best of them in the musical drama Ricki and the Flash. With that in mind, we thought we’d take a fond look back at some of the greatest fake rockers and rappers to grace the big screen. Sit back and crank that stereo, because it’s time for Total Recall!The Blues BrothersAs seen in&nbsp;The Blues Brothers (1980)  73%Other bands on this list may have more interesting backstories, but none of them were on a mission from God — and none of them boast a pedigree as stellar as the Blues Brothers. As Donald Fagen noted in Steely Dan’s 1980 hit, “Hey Nineteen,” “It’s hard times befallen the soul survivors” — and none of them had more soul than Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Willie Hall, Steve Jordan, and Matt Murphy, the Stax veterans who made up the core of Jake and Elwood Blues’ orphanage-saving combo and enjoyed career boosts after the movie was released. It was all too good to last, and soul purists may have taken offense at the band’s very existence, but if they were good enough for Brother Ray, hey, they’re certainly good enough for you.Watch TrailerBuckaroo Banzai and the Hong Kong CavaliersAs seen in&nbsp;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984)  68%Only in the 1980s would you find Peter Weller playing a world-renowned neurosurgeon and particle physicist who moonlights as the frontman for one of eastern New Jersey’s most popular bar bands — a band consisting of many other part-time hyphenates, including a botanist, a linguist, and an entomologist — but The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension owes its cult classic status, at least in part, to the nightclub performances of the Hong Kong Cavaliers. Family Ties fans and sharp-eyed children of the ’80s will recognize Mr. Billy Vera (of Billy Vera and the Beaters, natch) holding down the bass as Pinky Carruthers.Watch TrailerThe Carrie NationsAs seen in&nbsp;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970)  75%The Carrie Nations might have been a fake band, but they rock and roll like the best of them in Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. With songs like “Find It,” “Come With the Gentle People,” and “Sweet Talkin’ Candy Man,” the trio conjures shades of Jefferson Airplane and the Mamas and the Papas, psychedelic rock and flower power ballads alike. Watch and delight as redhead singer Kelly (Dolly Read, who married comedian Dick Martin the following year), brunette bassist Casey (Cynthia Meyers), and soulful drummer Petronella (Marcia McBroom) willfully sacrifice innocence, friendship, and true love for the trappings of fame and glory in Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert’s deliciously groovy exploitation satire. It’s a whirlwind rise to rock stardom for the girls, and you have a front row seat to every show, hook-up, betrayal, drug binge, and orgy along the way — as well as the film’s Manson-esque conclusion, in which flamboyant Svengali Ronnie “Z-Man” Barzell has a happening, and it freaks him (and us) out.Watch TrailerCB4As seen in&nbsp;CB4 (1993)  57%Taking a page from This Is Spinal Tap to lampoon the world of gangsta rap (albeit a few years too late), CB4 follows the meteoric rise of the titular rap group, whose members include Albert “MC Gusto” Brown (Chris Rock), Euripides “Dead Mike” Smalls (Allen Payne), and Otis, a.k.a. Stab Master Arson (Deezer D). Though critics generally compared it unfavorably to Tap, CB4 has enjoyed a cult following in the post-theatrical market — partly because of typically terrific appearances from supporting actors such as Phil Hartman, Chris Elliot, Khandi Alexander, and Charlie Murphy, and partly because of tracks like “Straight Outta Locash.”Watch TrailerThe CommitmentsAs seen in&nbsp;The Commitments (1991)  89%If true soul music was scarce in 1980, it was an endangered species in 1991 —&nbsp;which is one reason why audiences flocked to Alan Parker’s adaptation of Roddy&nbsp;Doyle’s The Commitments, which depicts the formation and rise of a group&nbsp;of soul-loving Irish musicians. The movie’s soundtrack did as well, if not&nbsp;better, than the film, and for good reason — the performers were chosen for&nbsp;their musical ability, not acting skills, and a number of them (including&nbsp;vocalist Andrew Strong, future Once star Glen Hansard, and eventual&nbsp;Fleadh Festival hottie Andrea Corr) went on to real-life careers in music after&nbsp;the movie. In fact, a touring version of the band is still booking dates to this&nbsp;day — how’s that for Commitments?Hedwig and the Angry InchAs seen in&nbsp;Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001)  92%Aping the high-gloss androgyny of the New York Dolls, David Bowie, and the&nbsp;half-forgotten and openly gay glam rock pioneer Jobraith, John Cameron&nbsp;Mitchell’s Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a band (and a film) lousy with&nbsp;camp ethos and ultra-literate pop culture references. The music of “The Angry&nbsp;Inch” mixes Lou Reed with Iggy Pop, but the aesthetic is pure Diamond Dog —&nbsp;well, Diamond Dog if you replace Bowie with a Streisand impersonator, which,&nbsp;funny enough, this film includes (she goes by the stage name “Krystal Nacht” and&nbsp;her extended medley is mind-blowing!). What began as an off-Broadway,&nbsp;monologue-motivated production, Hedwig and the Angry Inch had big success&nbsp;in ancillaries (like the soundtrack) and now rotates like an anatomically&nbsp;graphic Rocky Horror Picture Show, with costume attendees in tow.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Josie and the PussycatsAs seen in&nbsp;Josie and the Pussycats (2001)  53%Boy bands and mall punk pop music. The combination sounds worse than a Raffi benefit concert, but we indeed did live through such dark times. In fact, some probably even liked it! Resurrecting the 1970s cartoon curio,&nbsp;Josie and the Pussycats presents itself as a satire of the pop music industry during its height of audience cynicism; the movie’s plot revolves around three girls (Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, and Rosario Dawson) navigating the biz and uncovering their record label’s conspiracy of brainwashing people into enjoying their music. You have to be lobotomized to like the crap on the radio, the movie almost says.Watch TrailerN.W.H.As seen in&nbsp;Fear of a Black Hat (1994)  86%With the previous year’s CB4 still fresh on the minds of unsuspecting&nbsp;moviegoers, 1994 introduced audiences to another hip-hop satire in Fear of&nbsp;a Black Hat. Unlike its predecessor, Black Hat was filmed&nbsp;documentary-style, and it chronicled the life and times of underground act&nbsp;N.W.H. — we can’t exactly spell out for you what the initials stand for, but&nbsp;if you’re familiar with the legendary Los Angeles crew known as N.W.A., just&nbsp;replace the “Attitude” with “Hats.” Lampooning everything from rapper names&nbsp;(Ice Cold, Tone Def) to song content (the deliriously tasteless “Booty Juice”)&nbsp;to the inevitable group split and solo career paths (one member’s new persona&nbsp;bears a striking resemblance to P.M. Dawn), the film was critically&nbsp;well-received but performed poorly at the box office. It’s become somewhat of&nbsp;a cult classic, however, with its over-the-top script, surprising poignancy,&nbsp;and willingness to take a few powerful and calculated jabs at a&nbsp;still-burgeoning rap industry.Watch TrailerPoP!As seen in&nbsp;Music and Lyrics (2007)  63%With everyone these days willing to get history lessons through the Internet, the only way to test the authenticity of Music and Lyrics‘ fake music video for a 1984 song called “PoP! Goes My Heart” is through YouTube. Can it convincingly be put in a video playlist with Rick Astley, Flock of Seagulls, and Talking Heads? Our prognosis: the band’s wardrobe is a bit too 1980s exorbitant, and Scott Porter’s performance as the lead singer plays it a bit too hard for laughs, but the song’s insanely catchy and Hugh Grant hits the right note of idiotic earnestness. Best of all, Music and Lyricswas only a modest hit, so you can stick this song for your 1980s-themed party.&nbsp;Do it quick, though — everyone’s starting to get nostalgic for&nbsp;acid wash and&nbsp;sweaters wrapped around waists.Watch TrailerThe RutlesAs seen in&nbsp;All You Need Is Cash (1978)  91%The grandpa of mock rock docs, The Rutles: All You Need is Cash should be&nbsp;manna to any Beatlemaniac. This satirical take on the Beatles’ rise and fall&nbsp;from members of Monty Python and the Saturday Night Live cast was so spot&nbsp;on, Ringo Starr allegedly found the later scenes too painful to enjoy. However,&nbsp;this is a comedy, and though it has its share of barbs (the fake John Lennon and&nbsp;Yoko Ono scenes are pretty rough), it’s still a lovingly detailed look at the&nbsp;Fab Four’s history. Real-life stars like Mick Jagger, Paul Simon, and Ron Wood&nbsp;turn up to sing the praises of the Rutles, and even George Harrison makes a&nbsp;cameo. Featuring songs like “Get Up and Go” (“Get Back”), “Ouch!” (“Help!”), and&nbsp;“Love Life” (“All You Need Is Love”), The Rutles was a profound influence&nbsp;on This Is Spinal Tap. Best visual gag: Eric Idle, playing Paul McCartney&nbsp;doppelganger Dirk McQuickly, is profiled in the “where-are-they-now” segment at&nbsp;the end of the movie as the leader of a punk band called the Punk Floyd — with&nbsp;a safety pin through his head.Watch TrailerThe Soggy Bottom BoysAs seen in&nbsp;O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)  78%The music in O Brother, Where Art Thou? was so extraordinary that it almost eclipsed the film itself. The Coen Brothers’ twisted take on Homer’s The Odyssey was something of a musical journey itself into the roots of American country, gospel, and blues. The the SBBs (played by George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson) are based (albeit very loosely) upon the musical stylings of such old timey groups as the Foggy Mountain Boys, and the O Brother soundtrack featured such roots stars as Ralph Stanley, Allison Krauss, and Emmylou Harris. But the group’s secret weapon is an itinerant bluesman named Tommy (Chris Thomas King, singing for himself), who, like the real-life Tommy Johnson (famous for “Canned Heat Blues,” about the pleasures of getting drunk on Sterno), has sold his soul to the devil in order to acquire his mind-blowing guitar skills.Watch TrailerSonic Death Monkey/ Kathleen Turner Overdrive/&nbsp;Barry Jive and the Uptown FiveAs seen in&nbsp;High Fidelity (2000)  91%Jack Black spends much of High Fidelity stealing scenes; his turn&nbsp;as an obnoxiously opinionated (but strangely endearing) record snob was a&nbsp;breakout performance. Still, he saves his coup de grace for the film’s&nbsp;penultimate scene, in which he and his band of metalheads (with more band names&nbsp;than songs) lay down a convincing version of Marvin Gaye’s come-hither anthem&nbsp;“Let’s Get It On.” Black had been doing the comedy/rock thing for years with&nbsp;Kyle Gass as Tenacious D, and he would later lend his irreverent rockist persona&nbsp;to Richard Linklater’s School of Rock.Watch TrailerSpinal TapAs seen in&nbsp;This Is Spinal Tap (1984)  95%They’ve done everything from flower power folk to the lewdest of heavy&nbsp;metal, played for sold-out arenas and opened for puppet shows, and blurred the&nbsp;lines between fact and fiction for nearly a quarter of a century. Spinal Tap —&nbsp;made up of guitarists Nigel Tufnel (a.k.a. Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins&nbsp;(Michael McKean), and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), plus whichever&nbsp;drummer happens to be foolhardy enough to be sitting behind the kit — has&nbsp;parlayed its appearance in the original mockumentary, 1984’s “This Is Spinal&nbsp;Tap,” into a series of concerts (including the Hear ‘n Aid benefit), albums&nbsp;(such as 1992’s Break Like the Wind), and, of course, a guest spot on The&nbsp;Simpsons. We love all the bands on this list, but only the Tap goes to 11.Watch TrailerStillwaterAs seen in&nbsp;Almost Famous (2000)  89%A composite of the Allman Brothers, Led Zeppelin, the Eagles, Lynyrd&nbsp;Skynyrd, and many, many more, Stillwater is a distillation of the rock&nbsp;monsters that roamed the earth in the 1970s — and that were profiled by a&nbsp;teenaged Cameron Crowe in Creem and Rolling Stone. Crowe wrote, &nbsp;directed, and co-composed some of the songs (with his wife, Heart singer Nancy&nbsp;Wilson, and Peter Frampton), and Almost Famous oozes period detail,&nbsp;serving as a reminder that rock in the 1970s was still a seat-of-the-pants&nbsp;enterprise. Stillwater lays down some convincing stoner rock that recalls the&nbsp;heyday of AM radio — with help from Pearl Jam’s Mike McCready on guitar, Mark&nbsp;Kozelek of Sun Kil Moon on bass, and impressive vocals from star Jason Lee.Watch TrailerThe WondersAs seen in&nbsp;That Thing You Do! (1996)  93%Writer-director Tom Hanks makes his influences clear. See The Oneders&nbsp;have a Monkees-style clown-around on a map of the U.S.! Hear as The Oneders ape&nbsp;the lesser-known British pop invaders the Dave Clark Five (a fave of Hanks’)!&nbsp;The band’s name, “The Oneders,” is a cute reach to U.S. Beatlemania, but that&nbsp;little stab at cleverness goes south when the MC of the band’s first show hollers “The Oh-Nee-Ders!” Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne), Howard Shore (composer for Lord of the Rings) and Tom Hanks are&nbsp;three of the songwriting contributors to the film’s sassy 1960s pop soundtrack.&nbsp;Though their contributions were all stellar, Schlesinger earned an Oscar nom for&nbsp;the film’s title track.Watch TrailerWyld StallynsAs seen in&nbsp;Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989)  81%Few movies with bands actually let their bands end up sucking; even the&nbsp;jokiest of them of all, Spinal Tap, in reality possesses the power to bring&nbsp;sold-out stadiums to their knees. Bill Preston and Ted Logan (Alex Winter,&nbsp;Keanu Reeves) of the Wyld Stallyns have no such power. They rarely ever get to&nbsp;play more than a few sloppy seconds before something divine intervenes, like&nbsp;an amp blowing out or the credits rolling. It’s all part of the joke in their&nbsp;legendarily excellent adventure involving time travel, referring to Napoleon&nbsp;as a dick, and the late, great George Carlin. But all is not lost! In their&nbsp;further travels as chronicled in Bogus Journey, Bill and Ted do indeed&nbsp;rock the world, fulfilling their destiny as depicted in Excellent&nbsp;Adventure.Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Mary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/19174621/moviebands.jpg","slug":"total-recall-tomatopalooza-cinemas-greatest-fake-bands"},{"id":"47508966915456","title":"Ben Kingsley’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ben Kingsley's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Self/less star.by Jeff Giles | July 8, 2015 |  CommentsBen Kingsley‘s been knighted, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and he’s won a cavalcade of honors that includes an Oscar, a Grammy, a pair of BAFTAs, two Golden Globes, and a Screen Actors Guild award — and as if all that weren’t enough, this weekend Kingsley gets to steal Ryan Reynold’s body in Tarsem Singh’s new sci-fi thriller Self/less. In honor of all these achievements, we decided this week would be the perfect time to take a fond look back at some of the best efforts from Sir Kingsley’s filmography, and discovered an array of critical highlights whose diversity may surprise you. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Fifty Dead Men Walking (2008)  83%Loosely based on British agent Martin McGartland?s autobiographical account of his time as an undercover mole in the IRA, Fifty Dead Men Walking pries at a painful — and frequently dramatized — chapter in the UK’s past. But what the film might lack in fresh perspective, it more than makes up with the sheer talent assembled by writer-director Kari Skogland, including Jim Sturgess as McGartland and Ben Kingsley as McGartland’s devoted handler, Fergus. “What makes Fifty Dead Men work,” argued the A.V. Club’s Tasha Robinson, “is the story’s sheer moral complexity, which dares viewers to sympathize with anyone onscreen for more than a few minutes at a time.”Watch Trailer9. Sexy Beast (2000)  87%Kingsley picked up a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this taut British gangster movie, and it isn’t hard to see why: Aside from affording him a too-rare opportunity to play a truly unpleasant villain, Sexy Beast is a thoroughly compelling debut effort from director Jonathan Glazer, who made the leap from music videos and commercials with this eminently well-cast drama about a retired safecracker (Ray Winstone) whose efforts to live a quiet life and go straight are complicated by the sudden appearance of a former associate (Kingsley) who wants to lure him back underground for one more job — and won’t take no for an answer. As Peter Rainer wrote Peter Rainer for New York Magazine, “As the mobster Don Logan in Sexy Beast, Ben Kingsley is so intensely frightening that it’s as if the actor were on a personal mission to deep-six Gandhi and his loincloth once and for all.”Watch Trailer8. Gandhi (1982)  85%Ben Kingsley has clearly been in plenty of solidly reviewed movies, but for a lot of people, Gandhi will always be the one that leaps to mind when his name is mentioned. There are a number of very good reasons for this, including the Best Actor Oscar he won for his captivating work in the title role (one of an incredible eight Academy Awards the film took home against 11 nominations), in addition to the rousing arc of its fact-based narrative and the suitably epic sweep of Richard Attenborough’s direction. More than 30 years after its release, Gandhi remains a prime example of why the inspirational biopic is still such a popular target for studios — as well as a perfect demonstration of how crucial it can be to find the right star. “In playing Gandhi, an actor must be less concerned with physical verisimilitude than with spiritual presence,” wrote TIME’s Richard Schickel. “Here, Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.”Watch Trailer7. A Birder’s Guide to Everything (2014)  86%Coming-of-age movies are never really in short supply, and there’s been something of a bumper crop in recent years, so one might be tempted to ignore A Birder’s Guide to Everything on the grounds that it most likely doesn’t add anything new to an overstuffed genre. But while that might be strictly true, that doesn’t mean this well-cast little gem doesn’t have plenty of its own rewards to offer, including some wonderfully sensitive work from co-writer/director Rob Meyer and a host of believable performances from a young contingent led by Kodi Smit-McPhee and Katie Chang. The grown-up stars aren’t too shabby either — including Kingsley as a renowned birding expert who spurs the plot toward a late twist. While conceding that the story’s “tidy resolution is telegraphed from the outset,” Slant’s Drew Hunt placed Birder’s Guide a cut above its many similarly structured brethren, arguing, “The energetic, never-mocking tone of all involved allows the film to stake its place alongside some of the genre’s stronger and more enduring touchstones.”Watch Trailer6. Turtle Diary (1985)  82%Kingsley has reaped plenty of acclaim for a number of his higher-profile projects, and is certainly no stranger to blockbusters, but his filmography also boasts a number of hidden gems — including 1985’s Turtle Diary, a Harold Pinter-scripted adaptation of the Russell Hoban novel about a pair of London lonely hearts (played by Kingsley and Glenda Jackson) who bond over their shared love of sea turtles while forming an audacious plan to send a few of their favorite amphibians back to their ocean home. It may not sound like the most obvious inspiration for a memorable movie, but Diary offers the sort of thoughtful, quietly gripping cinematic experience prized by explosion-averse cineastes — and it’s bolstered by a pair of talented leads who, along with co-star Michael Gambon, turn in impeccable work. For Roger Ebert, it was a film worth seeing if only for its leading man; as he put it in his review, “Ben Kingsley’s smile, so warm and mysterious, is the sun that shines all through Turtle Diary.”Watch Trailer5. Transsiberian (2008)  91%Four strangers on a train barreling across the Trans-Siberian Express. What could go wrong? That’s the slowly unraveling mystery at the wintry heart of writer/director Brad Anderson’s Transsiberian, starring Woody Harrelson and Emily Mortimer as a pair of missionaries whose return trip from China takes a series of unexpected turns after they find themselves sharing a train cabin with another couple (played by Eduardo Noriega and Kate Mara) — a meeting that ultimately puts them under the watchful eye of a Russian narcotics detective (Kingsley). It’s the kind of movie that’s better the less you know going in, so we won’t spoil any further plot details here; suffice it to say that, in the words of Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “Anderson gives us an artful, shifty-eyed take on human strengths and weakness; his film delivers the pleasure of a conventional tale well told, with clever twists and complex characters.”Watch Trailer4. Dave (1993)  95%Dave is nothing if not laughably unrealistic — a temp agency owner (Kline) stands in for the President, hires an accountant to fix the federal budget, and dreams up a jobs bill that will provide work for anyone who wants it, all while unwittingly helping perpetrate a fraudulent scandal against the Vice President (Kingsley) and making the First Lady (Sigourney Weaver) fall for him along the way — but even in the go-go ’90s, it appealed to our best and brightest hopes for our elected leaders, and in today’s vituperative political climate, it’s more of a funny, warm ‘n’ cuddly fable than ever. Janet Maslin of the New York Times was certainly charmed during its original release, admitting that “In spite of this sogginess, and despite a self-congratulatory, do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave, this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.”Watch Trailer3. Hugo (2011)  93%Brian Selznick’s bestselling novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret earned raves and won awards partly because of its unique structure, which blended graphic elements with narrative prose — and made it a natural target for the right filmmaker to turn into a family-friendly big-screen blockbuster. Martin Scorsese gave it his best shot with Hugo, a 3D adaptation of the story starring Asa Butterfield as the young titular protagonist and Kingsley as the reclusive retired director whose creations hold the key to past secrets as well as a fantastical future. A modern visual opus that stands as a testament to the magic of the cinema, Hugo won praise from critics like the Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday, who wrote, “If ever the movie gods were to smile on an adaptation, it would be Scorsese’s take on Selznick’s bestselling book, a valentine to the cinematic artists whose work the filmmaker has toiled so tirelessly to champion and preserve.”Watch Trailer2. Schindler’s List (1993)  98%Steven Spielberg circled Schindler’s List for years, concerned he didn’t have the skills or maturity necessary to dramatize the story of Oskar Schindler, the Nazi Party member who used his position as a German industrialist to save nearly 1,200 Jews during World War II. After trying to give the project away more than once (Spielberg’s candidates for his own replacement included Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese), he finally started filming in early 1993 — and the result is one of the most widely acclaimed movies of the ’90s, and the crowning achievement of Spielberg’s career. Kingsley, who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor BAFTA, appears as accountant Itzhak Stern, aiding the spiritual transformation of the title character (portrayed by Liam Neeson) from war profiteer to a man wracked with guilt over the lives he’d failed to spare, despite risking his life — and losing his fortune — to prevent the deaths of so many. It may have taken Spielberg time to feel he was up to the challenge of Schindler’s List, but in the end, he had nothing to worry about; as Janet Maslin of the New York Times wrote, “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.”Watch Trailer1. Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993)  100%Chess may not seem like the most inherently cinematic subject, and a story about a young prodigy caught in a tug-of-war between the opposing ideologies of his mentors sounds like the stuff of treacly clichés. Credit to writer-director Steven Zaillian, then, for turning Searching for Bobby Fischer into a genuinely touching drama whose climactic chess matches are actually rather thrilling — and doing cinematic justice to real-life former Junior Chess champion Joshua Watzkin with a fact-based film (based on his father’s memoir) stocked with stellar acting talent. Here, Kingsley works in a supporting role, playing real-life chess coach Bruce Pandolfini, whose strict approach puts him at odds with a speed player (Laurence Fishburne) that young Joshua (Max Pomeranc) meets in the park — a conflict that stokes the drama in a film that Variety’s Brian Lowry referred to as “a kind of cerebral The Karate Kid.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"rotten, Red, Marathons","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ben-Kingsley.jpg","slug":"ben-kingsleys-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508965253496","title":"Definitive Ron Perlman Roles","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Ron Perlman RolesIn this week's Total Recall, we look back at ten roles that helped define the Hand of God star's career.by Jeff Giles | September 2, 2015 |  CommentsIf you’re casting a television series about a judge who suffers a breakdown and thinks he’s receiving messages from God that put him on a path of vigilante justice, you need a guy with both gravitas and imposing menace — and fortunately Amazon’s new Hand of God series, debuting this week, found a leading man with both of those qualities in Ron Perlman, occasional Hellboy and character actor supreme. Whether he’s appeared au naturel or under makeup, worked live action or voiced animated characters, Perlman’s distinctive talent has been entertaining audiences for 30 years, and he’s assembled an eclectic filmography along the way. It’s about time we honored Mr. Perlman with the Total Recall treatment, wouldn’t you say?Amoukar, Quest for Fire (1981)A latex-covered Perlman got his big break in this award-winning adaptation of the 1911 novel, about a Neanderthal war for fire — and the dangerous quest undertaken by a small band of tribesmen who are forced to find another source after their clan’s fire is stolen by a rival tribe. An hour and 40 minutes of grunted dialogue and dirty caveman sex obviously isn’t what most filmgoers have in mind when they head out for a night at the cineplex, but Quest for Fire managed to perform relatively well at the box office, and became something of an early ‘80s cult favorite — as well as a hit with critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who said it was “more than just a hugely enterprising science lesson, although it certainly is that. It’s also a touching, funny and suspenseful drama about prehumans.”Watch TrailerVincent, Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;(1987-1990)Going under heavy makeup for Quest for Fire helped Perlman launch his career, so perhaps it’s fitting that things didn’t truly take off for him until he put on prosthetics again — this time for Beauty and the Beast, an unlikely-seeming hit drama that aired for three seasons on CBS between 1987-’90. A modern retelling of the oft-adapted fable, this Beauty posited our hero as a member of a secret community below New York City whose disfigurement masks a noble warrior’s heart — as evidenced when he rescues a lawyer (Linda Hamilton) from a brutal attack, saving her life and starting one of the era’s most swoonworthy TV love affairs. The show burned bright but fast — ratings started fading in the second season, and Hamilton’s departure the following year cemented its fate in the third and final batch of episodes — but it earned Perlman a Golden Globe and a whole new lease on his professional life.Watch VideosAngel de la Guardia, Cronos (1993)Perlman started his continuing association with Guillermo del Toro in this 1993 horror movie, about the gruesome series of events that unfolds after an old man (Federico Luppi) discovers an ancient scarab that injects him with a mysterious substance — one which restores his youthful vitality, but leaves him with a thirst for blood. Perlman stars in a supporting role as the ironically named Angel de la Guardia, a hoodlum sent on a quest by his elderly uncle, who craves the scarab’s restorative powers; the path of violence he carves in pursuit of his goal sets in motion some of Cronos’ most memorably horrific sequences. It barely registered a blip on the U.S. box office, but Cronos was an instant hit with critics; as an appreciative Ken Hanke wrote for the Asheville Mountain Xpress, it is “one of the most intelligent — and strangely moving — horror films ever made.”Watch TrailerOne, The City of Lost Children (1995)Perlman’s work with Guillermo del Toro has placed him within some pretty remarkable cinematic worlds, but his sojourn into Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro’s City of Lost Children might be the most visually striking of them all: a dense, whirring dystopia where an evil scientist (Daniel Emilfork) steals the dreams of kidnapped children. Their only hope is One (Perlman), a circus strongman whose younger brother is among the lost — and for whom he’ll set out on an arduous journey to rescue. Rife with sights that will haunt the viewer long after the credits roll, City won praise from critics like Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, who recommended it as “a dark phantasmagoria so visually amazing and provocative — yet dense and confusing — that viewers may need to see it more than once to take it all in.”Watch TrailerNorman Arbuthnot, The Last Supper (1996)Witty equal-opportunity political humor has become something of a lost art on the big screen over the last decade or so, but thing’s weren’t always this way. For proof, simply look to 1995’s The Last Supper, an ensemble indie comedy about a group of young liberals (including Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, and Annabeth Gish) who begin poisoning conservative dinner guests as part of a misguided campaign to save the world. While the murder victims aren’t terribly sympathetic, their murderers aren’t especially likable either — so by the time they cross paths with a Limbaugh-esque conservative pundit (played by Perlman), loyalties to either ideological extreme have been tested. “In today’s divisive political climate, where compromise is a dirty word,” observed Leslie Rigoulot of Film Scouts, “The Last Supper raises not only timely questions but moral dilemmas as well.”Watch TrailerMarshal Nalhober, Happy, Texas (1999)A goofy Steve Zahn comedy with a minuscule budget and a box office tally that wasn’t much bigger, Happy, Texas gave Perlman the opportunity to steal scenes in another supporting role: Marshal Nalhober, a straight-shooting cop in hot pursuit of three escaped prisoners (Zahn, Jeremy Northam, and M.C. Gainey) posing as the organizers of a local beauty pageant. Eminently quotable and buoyed by a smart, rootsy soundtrack, Happy provoked appreciative guffaws from critics like Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, who called it “a hoot, a hilarious comedy that’s smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive Full Monty-style box-office appeal.”Watch TrailerHellboy, The Hellboy FranchisePerlman went back under the makeup — and reunited with his Cronos and Blade II director, Guillermo del Toro — for 2004’s Hellboy, an adaptation of the popular Dark Horse Comics title. Grossing under $60 million in the U.S., it was something of a disappointment at the box office, but Perlman and Del Toro were a natural fit for the franchise; four years after the first Hellboy, Perlman teamed up again with Guillermo del Toro for another round of supernatural fun — and while the original Hellboy earned mostly positive reviews, the sequel was an even bigger critical winner. A gleeful blend of popcorn thrills and uniquely del Toro visual splendor, Hellboy II: The Golden Army reunited the original cast for an epic battle between the forces of good and an irate elven king (Luke Goss) who wants to reignite the long-dormant war between elves and humans. While it was overshadowed at the box office by The Dark Knight and Iron Man, it still earned over $160 million — and earned the admiration of critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who called it “the biggest, richest, most imaginative superhero movie of the summer.”Watch TrailerEd Pollack, The Last Winter (2006)A sort of cross between An Inconvenient Truth and The Thing, this wintry thriller found writer/director Larry Fessenden returning to the themes of isolation he explored in Wendigo, while adding an ecologically conscious twist: at a remote ANWR drilling base, a team of workers (led by Perlman) starts dying off, casualties of “sour gas” released as a side effect of global warming — or are they under attack from vengeful spirits of the Earth? Though it screened in extremely limited release, The Last Winter received more than a few positive reviews from critics, including Aaron Hillis of Premiere Magazine, who called it “A richly drawn, ambitious character piece both socially relevant and genuinely suspenseful” before concluding, “This is filmmaking both gorgeous and deeply unsettling.”Watch TrailerFather Duffy, I Sell the Dead (2008)Perlman and his Last Winter director, Larry Fessenden, re-teamed for this 2008 black comedy — only this time, they were both on the same side of the camera. Helmed by Glenn McQuaid (who also worked behind the scenes on The Last Winter), I Sell the Dead recounts the story of a pair of Irish grave robbers (played by Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan), as told to a jailhouse priest (Perlman). A bizarre mashup of 19th-century period thriller and zombie/alien comic gore, Dead had a blink-and-you-missed it theatrical run, playing on only two screens, but even some of the critics who couldn’t recommend it found the film impossible to dislike — such as Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, who mused, “If it’s not actually a good movie, on some level you have to admire the chutzpah of a film set in 1850s Ireland but shot on Staten Island.”Watch TrailerClay Morrow, Sons of Anarchy (2008-2014)Perlman stayed busy on television in the years after Beauty and the Beast, consistently booking voice work and episodic guest spots on shows even as his film roles continued to pile up — and putting him in a uniquely enviable position as the small screen’s new golden age made the prospect of snagging a regular series gig increasingly appealing to a widening circle of Hollywood vets. It paid fresh dividends with Sons of Anarchy, the 2008-’14 FX hit that spun circles of tightly woven (and increasingly dark) drama out of the inner lives of a California motorcycle gang whose second-generation vice-president (Charlie Hunnam) finds himself increasingly at odds with the gang’s morally ambiguous leader (Perlman). Consistently critically acclaimed, Sons set ratings records for the network — and offered Perlman an opportunity to prove he could help anchor a series without a lion-shaped prosthetic covering his face.Watch VideosFinally, here’s one of Mr. Perlman’s first television appearances — the role of Dr. Bernie Marx on a 1979 episode of the daytime serial Ryan’s Hope:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"PlayStation, italian, One, Central","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ron-Perlman-Sons-of-Anarchy.jpg","slug":"definitive-ron-perlman-roles"},{"id":"47508965244275","title":"Definitive Matt Damon Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Definitive Matt Damon MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at ten films that helped define The Martian star's career.by Jeff Giles | September 30, 2015 |  CommentsSince earning his career breakout with Good Will Hunting in 1997, Matt Damon has won an Academy Award, worked for some of the finest directors (and alongside some of the most talented actors) in Hollywood, and proved his mettle as a dramatic actor, gifted screen comic, and steely action hero. In honor of his latest starring role, in Ridley Scott’s The Martian this weekend, we decided to rifle through the Damon filmography and take a closer look at the ten most&nbsp;definitive entries. Which of your favorites made the cut? Which ones have the critics blasphemously overlooked? There’s only one way to find out!Courage Under Fire (1996)  85%Think you’re committed to your job? Try being Matt Damon in preparation for Courage Under Fire. For his role as Specialist Ilario, Damon dropped 40 pounds, adopting a grueling training regimen that had him running miles a day and subsisting on a diet consisting of little more than cigarettes and coffee. It was not, as you might imagine, a decision popular with Damon’s doctors — or, more importantly, his body, which required no small amount of medical repair after shooting ended. But all’s well that ends well, and Edward Zwick’s Rashomon-style Gulf War drama helped Damon break the dry spell he’d been suffering since nabbing a role in 1993’s Geronimo: An American Legend. Oh, and the critics liked it too — critics like Steve Rhodes, who called it “An extremely moving picture that left me with my heart racing and my arms clutching myself and staring at the screen.”Watch TrailerGood Will Hunting (1997)  98%Before you even opened this list, you probably knew we’d end up here. And for good reason: Good Will Hunting&nbsp;is not only the massive left-field success that launched Damon and his pal/co-writer Ben Affleck into the Hollywood stratosphere, it’s a smart, tenderly written tale of the ways love and friendship can help build a bridge between the memories that haunt us and the futures we dream of. With empathetic direction from Gus Van Sant, beautiful music from Danny Elfman and Elliott Smith, and an Oscar-winning supporting performance from Robin Williams, Good Will Hunting&nbsp;was the kind of film that played equally well to the arthouse and cineplex crowds — and the kind of story that makes you feel good about loving movies. As Margaret McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer put it, “Good Will Hunting&nbsp;is another auspicious sign that the best of Young Hollywood is not only bringing back respect for the craft of acting, but for the cogent telling of tales as well.”Watch TrailerRounders (1998)  65%Between Good Will Hunting&nbsp;and The Rainmaker, Damon had a pretty good 1997, and seemed poised to continue his winning streak with 1998’s Rounders, a gambling drama about a law student whose efforts to give up high-stakes backroom poker in order to appease his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) are complicated by the arrival of a ne’er-do-well buddy (Edward Norton) who needs his help to making enough scores to pay off a massive debt owned by a local mobster (John Malkovich). In spite of a nifty premise and a cast loaded with young Hollywood up-and-comers, Rounders&nbsp;went bust at the box office, although it’s since gone on to acquire something of a cult status on the home market (and rumors of a sequel even made the rounds a few years ago). “You’re going to hear a lot about the good job Edward Norton and Gretchen Mol do in Rounders,” predicted Edvins Beitkis of the San Francisco Examiner. “But the movie lives and dies with Matt Damon.”Watch TrailerThe Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)  83%As conceived by author Patricia Highsmith, Tom Ripley is a deeply unsavory character — a psychopath who uses his natural charm and malfunctioning moral compass as the gateway into a lavish lifestyle built on lies, theft, and murder. Not the kind of role you’d expect to go to a wholesome-looking fellow like Matt Damon, in other words — but that’s part of what made Damon’s performance in Anthony Minghella’s The Talented Mr. Ripley&nbsp;so profoundly disquieting. Capable of communicating bottomless need, desperate rage, and cold calculation in a single scene, Damon proved his range was far greater than many may had suspected. “We all knew Damon was a fine actor after Good Will Hunting,” wrote Jeffrey Westhoff of the Northwest Herald, “but The Talented Mr. Ripley&nbsp;takes him much further much faster than anyone could have expected.”Watch TrailerThe Ocean’s FranchiseThe occasional odd cameo aside, it’s generally safe to say Matt Damon is usually the biggest star in any movie he makes — but the Ocean’s&nbsp;trilogy is a cheerful exception to that rule, boasting an overstuffed cast full of film stars that includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Al Pacino, Carl Reiner, and Bernie Mac… just to name more than a few. As Linus Caldwell, the master pickpocket in the team of thieves assembled by the impossibly suave Danny Ocean (Clooney), Damon got the chance to lend comic relief, perform some nifty cinematic thievery, and just generally make it all look easy while sharing the load with the cast of a lifetime. In the end, after three films of watching Ocean and his gang make off with millions in ill-gotten loot, it was the audience who made out best of all; as Rene Rodriguez wrote of 2007’s Ocean’s Thirteen&nbsp;for the Miami Herald, “When a movie keeps you this entertained without insulting your intelligence, it’s hard to complain.”Watch TrailerThe Bourne FranchiseIt seems laughable now, but before The Bourne Identity reached theaters, there were a lot of people who didn’t think Matt Damon had what it took to be a convincing action hero. Those doubts were quickly erased with director Doug Liman’s sleek, powerful adaptation of the Robert Ludlum novel — a huge box office hit that was powered with equal parts explosive set pieces and a solid central performance by its star. As it turned out, Damon had not only the dramatic chops to realistically portray the fear and confusion of an amnesiac who slowly begins to realize he’s a lethal assassin, but the physical presence to make audiences believe he could kill a man with a pen — and launch a franchise that has had filmgoers lining up to follow a global trail of high-speed car chases, conspiracy cover-ups, and hand-held cameras shakily capturing some truly impressive hand-to-hand combat. “Who needs an identity,” quipped Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix, “when you’re having this much fun?”Watch TrailerStuck on You (2003)  61%Damon’s had a number of opportunities to show off his comedic chops over the years, but he’s rarely gone for all-out comedy — which is why, despite its 60 percent Tomatometer, we decided to include 2003’s Stuck on You&nbsp;here. Co-starring Damon and Greg Kinnear as conjoined twins who reach a crossroads when the more outgoing twin (Kinnear) decides to pursue his Hollywood dream, this Farrelly brothers production lacks the gleeful ribaldry that defined their earlier efforts, but in its absence, viewers are able to focus on the genuine sweetness beating at the heart of their films’ best moments — and that, coupled with Damon and Kinnear’s easy chemistry, is just enough to make it one of the more appealing efforts in a filmography that’s largely fallen prey to the law of diminishing returns. As Claudia Puig wrote for USA Today, “Not only is Stuck on You&nbsp;a hoot, but it also walks a line — as the best Farrelly brothers movies do — between silly farce and sweet sentimentality that artfully avoids the cloying or maudlin.”Watch TrailerThe Departed (2006)  90%Violent, bleak, and unbearably tense, The Departed&nbsp;earned director Martin Scorsese his long-overdue Best Director Oscar — but before that, it delighted critics and filmgoers by using Andrew Lau and Alan Mak’s Infernal Affairs as the launchpad for an unflinching look at the personal toll exacted by the mortal struggle between law enforcement and organized crime. As dirty cop Colin Sullivan, Damon gives one of his subtlest and most heartbreaking performances, portraying a man who knows he’s living one step away from prison — or worse — and who you can’t help but feel for, even as he works to ferret out the identity of Mafia mole and honest cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio). Though some critics compared The Departed&nbsp;unfavorably to Infernal Affairs, most agreed with the Academy voters who named it the year’s Best Picture; in the words of Beyond Hollywood’s Brian Holcomb, “Scorsese has made an incredible cover version of the original, imbued with every ounce of his artistic personality transforming it into something both familiar and new.”Watch TrailerThe Informant! (2009)  79%Life as an action hero seems like fun, but every actor wants the chance to demonstrate diversity, so after a few years of beating people up as Jason Bourne, Damon grew a mustache and a paunch for Steven Soderbergh’s The Informant!. The strange-but-true story of Mark Whitacre, who blew the whistle on price fixing at Archer Daniels Midland and worked as a secret FBI informant while embezzling millions from the company (and experiencing an acute mental breakdown along the way), Informant!&nbsp;allowed Damon to indulge his inner delusional schlub without losing sight of Whitacre’s essential humanity; instead of the cruel display it could have been, the movie’s a sensitive — yet still absurdly funny — satire of modern capitalism. “As Soderbergh lovingly peels away veil after veil of deception, the film develops into an unexpected human comedy,” observed Roger Ebert. “Not that any of the characters are laughing.”Watch TrailerBehind the Candelabra (2013)  94%A longtime passion project for director Steven Soderbergh, Behind the Candelabra&nbsp;languished in development limbo for years while the Oscar-winning filmmaker struggled to find funding for a drama depicting the last years of the flamboyant pianist Liberace, as told through his estranged ex-lover Scott Thorston. Even with Michael Douglas attached as Liberace and Damon on board to play Thorston, Candelabra remained stuck until HBO stepped in to cover the budget — and ended up reaping record ratings for a TV movie on the way to achieving major awards recognition, including an Outstanding Lead Actor Emmy nomination for Damon. (Douglas, meanwhile, won Outstanding Lead Actor, while Candelabra&nbsp;itself walked away with Outstanding Miniseries or Movie.) “Douglas is more than acceptable, but Damon has made an unforgettable character,” wrote David Thomson for the New Republic. “Scott Thorson is unknown and he comes out of the dark as the story that needs to be told.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"robots, movies, Action, News, Red, Geo, reboot, Schedule, competition, crime, guild, ESPN, Islander, strong","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MattDamon.jpg","slug":"definitive-matt-damon-movies"},{"id":"47508965260665","title":"Owen Wilson’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Owen Wilson's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the No Escape star.by Jeff Giles | August 26, 2015 |  CommentsIndie classics, animated hits, well-reviewed dramas, and blockbuster comedies: Owen Wilson has done it all. This week, he makes a rare foray into action thriller territory opposite Pierce Brosnan in No Escape, so we knew this would be the perfect occasion to take a fond look back at some of the many critical highlights from a very prolific — and impressively varied —filmography. It’s time to pay tribute to the man who brought Marmaduke to life, Total Recall style!&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;The Darjeeling Limited (2007)  69%Reuniting after the six-year layoff that followed The Royal Tenenbaums, frequent collaborators Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson paired up for 2007’s The Darjeeling Limited, a typically quirky dramedy about three eccentric brothers (played by Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) who struggle — not always entirely successfully — to reconnect by taking a train ride across India in order to reunite with their mother (Anjelica Huston). While a troubling&nbsp;number of critics felt Darjeeling found Anderson settling into a rut, the majority felt that even if he was treading somewhat familiar ground, he managed to do it with style. Calling it “Arguably Wes Anderson’s most compassionate, mature film,” Nick Rogers of Suite101 credited the film with “[dancing] around disconcerting what-ifs: If they weren’t your brothers and sisters, would you voluntarily befriend them, or do you tolerate quirks and annoyances because blood links you?”Watch Trailer&nbsp;9.&nbsp;Inherent Vice (2015)  73%It wouldn’t be entirely accurate to say Wilson’s had an easy time of it with critics lately — his recent duds include Are You Here and She’s Funny That Way — but he’s also made his mark in a few well-reviewed releases, including a brief appearance in The Grand Budapest Hotel and a more substantial supporting role in Paul Thomas Anderson’s star-studded adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s Inherent Vice. Here, Wilson appears as Coy Harlingen, a man whose disappearance prompts his wife (Jena Malone) to hire the film’s P.I. protagonist (Joaquin Phoenix) to mount a search. The plot’s a whole lot messier than that — and critics seemed admittedly divided over just how successfully Anderson managed to wrestle it onto the screen — but even if they weren’t quite sure what to make of it, most enjoyed what they saw. “It is no exaggeration to say that this could become the new Big Lebowski,” wrote Helen O’Hara for GQ. “Something that will not just stand up to repeat viewings but positively reward every single rewatch of its twisted, lunatic glory.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Cars (2006)  74%At a comparatively paltry 74 percent on the Tomatometer, 2006’s Cars represented something of a critical setback for PIxar — but while the reviews that greeted this John Lasseter-directed tale of a young racecar (Owen Wilson) and his quest to wrest the Piston Cup from a pair of challengers (Michael Keaton and Richard Petty) weren’t up to the usual Pixar standard, audiences didn’t mind; it grossed over $460 million on its way to spawning a sequel (and a spinoff), and even if it didn’t measure up to Pixar’s previous, it was still good enough to earn praise from scribes like Chris Vognar of the Dallas Morning News, who wrote, “no other outfit can match Pixar’s knack for plucking heartstrings without tearing them off the frets.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Wedding Crashers (2005)  76%Part of the R-rated comedy renaissance of the aughts, Wedding Crashers may not have given Wilson the opportunity to do anything new — here, he appears as John Beckwith, a soft-spoken lech with a heart of gold — but it played squarely to Wilson’s comedic gifts, had a solid Steve Faber/Bob Fisher script, and surrounded Wilson and his co-star, Vince Vaughn, with some terrific supporting talent, including Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, and Isla Fisher. Though some critics had problems with Crashers‘ uneven tone — and the scads of gratuitous flesh on display in the movie’s opening montage — most found it too much fun to resist. “The likes of the sneakily subversive Wilson and Vaughn deserve better,” wrote MaryAnn Johnson of Flick Filosopher, “but this is darn close to a perfect showcase for what they can do, and how much better they do it together.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Shanghai Noon (2000)  79%Westerns and kung fu movies have enjoyed a close relationship for years, and that rich shared tradition is given a tongue-in-cheek salute with Shanghai Noon, an action-comedy that transcends its goofier elements (Lucy Liu plays the female lead, a character named Princess Pei-Pei) and delivers a well-rounded blend of humor, adventure, and — of course — jaw-dropping stunts. Jackie Chan stars as Chon Wang (say it out loud with a drawl), a Chinese imperial guard who is sent to Nevada to rescue the princess, kidnapped by agents of the villainous Lo Fong (Roger Yuan). Of course, no sooner has he arrived in Nevada than he gets tangled up with Roy O’Bannon (Owen Wilson), a rather inept outlaw who starts out hijacking Wang’s train and ends up becoming an invaluable ally in his quest. For some fans, Shanghai seemed at first like just another Americanized buddy project for Chan, who had already done this sort of thing with Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. Chan and Wilson proved a duo worth watching, though; on their way to a $99 million gross (and an eventual sequel), they earned praise from critics like the New York Times’ A.O. Scott, who wrote, “Shanghai Noon is, in classic western tradition, a celebration of male bonding, unabashedly juvenile, boyishly risqué and disarmingly sweet.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;5.&nbsp;The Royal Tenenbaums (2002)  81%A year after breaking the box-office bank in Meet the Parents, Wilson and his frequent castmate reunited for a far less mainstream excursion into the oddball end of the comedy spectrum: Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums. Co-writing the screenplay (about a mind-bendingly eccentric family whose overbearing, insensitive patriarch turns the lives of his children upside down) and appearing amidst an eyebrow-raising ensemble cast that also included Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, and his brothers Andrew and Luke, Wilson was at his quirkiest and most neurotic — in other words, at his best. While it wasn’t a huge hit at the box office, Tenenbaums fared well with most critics, including Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star, who called it “An eloquent, eccentric and surprisingly touching tribute to the comic dignity of failure.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Meet the Parents (2000)  84%Ben Stiller is one of the kings of uncomfortable comedy, and few films have taken advantage of his gift for squirm-inducing laughs as brilliantly as Meet the Parents, the 2000 smash hit Jay Roach comedy about male nurse Gaylord “Greg” Focker (Stiller) and his painfully awkward (and/or just plain painful) attempts to make a good first impression on his girlfriend’s parents while dealing with the unexpected presence of her annoyingly perfect ex-boyfriend (Wilson). Featuring plenty of guffaw-worthy physical comedy and splendidly antagonistic chemistry between Stiller and Robert De Niro, Parents grossed over $500 million, spawning a franchise and earning the applause of critics like Time’s Richard Schickel, who chuckled, “Alas, poor Focker. He can’t help himself. And we can’t help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Bottle Rocket (1996)  85%Wilson cut his cinematic teeth in style with 1996’s Bottle Rocket, an indie darling that not only kicked off his big-screen acting career, but found him co-writing the first of three highly regarded screenplays (followed by Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) with director Wes Anderson. Although it was a blip on the commercial radar, this cheerful crime comedy about a trio of Texans (Wilson, his brother Luke, and Robert Musgrave) whose rather inept first foray into armed robbery leads them into the path of an older, wiser thief (James Caan) was a favorite of critics like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who called it “A hilarious, inventive and goofy breath of fresh air.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)  93%These days, it’s a rare animated film that doesn’t boast a star-studded cast, but most of them don’t attract the sort of award-hoarding talent that Wes Anderson lined up for Fantastic Mr. Fox, is stop-motion adaptation of the Roald Dahl book about a rascally fox (George Clooney) whose devotion to his wife (Streep) is tested by his need to have the last laugh against a trio of bloodthirsty farmers. Rounded out by an eclectic list of co-stars that included Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, and Owen Wilson, Fox thrilled critics like Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News, who called it “A visual treasure that successfully blends deadpan quirkiness with a wry realism rarely seen in any film, let alone one for children.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Midnight in Paris (2011)  93%Following a fairly dire year that saw him surfacing in Little Fockers and providing the voice of Marmaduke, Wilson enjoyed a huge critical rebound with his starring performance in Midnight in Paris — a late-period smash hit for writer/director Woody Allen, who enjoyed some of the warmest reviews (and the highest grosses) of his career with the fantasy-infused comedic tale of an ennui-addled screenwriter who heads out for a melancholic walk on the streets of Paris and ends up taking much more of a journey than he bargained for. “Woody Allen seemed to have lost his fizz as a filmmaker of late,” observed Jason Best for Movie Talk, “and then he uncorked the sparkling Midnight in Paris, a comic fantasy with all the effervescence of vintage champagne.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s Tom Hiddleston imagining what it might have sounded like if Owen Wilson had played Loki:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Pirates, thriller, Company, Drama, adaptation, marvel, ABC, deadpool, Oscars, game-of-thrones, what, Starz, zero","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Owen-Wilson-Still-No-Escape.jpg","slug":"total-recall-owen-wilsons-best-movies"},{"id":"47508965249398","title":"12 Movies You Didn’t Know Feature the Doctor from Doctor Who","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})12 Movies You Didn't Know Feature the Doctor from Doctor WhoIn this week's Total Recall, we look at some of the best films the Doctors have made over the years.by Jeff Giles | September 16, 2015 |  CommentsThe rejuvenated Doctor Who returns for its ninth series of episodes on BBC One this weekend, extending a beloved British television tradition that stretches back to the show’s November 1963 debut and has grown to encompass hundreds of installments, a variety of spinoffs, and a dozen (official) Doctors, all of whom did distinguished work outside the series. In that spirit, we’re honoring the actors who’ve inhabited the role by dedicating this list to some of the more interesting moments in their big-screen résumés — all, alas, with the unfortunate exception of the Sixth Doctor, Colin Baker, who’s focused his efforts outside the film industry. That still leaves us with an eclectic selection of movies, &nbsp;some of which you may have forgotten — or simply never knew — featured one of the Doctors, so without further ado…it’s time for Total Recall!William Hartnell – Brighton Rock (1947)  95%Years before he became the original Doctor, William Hartnell scored a key role in Brighton Rock, director John Boulting’s widely acclaimed adaptation of the 1938 &nbsp;Graham Greene novel about a gang of British hoodlums whose enforcer (Richard Attenborough) murders a reporter in retribution for a story that got his leader killed — then grows increasingly violent and paranoid as he’s hemmed in on all sides by people who could prove his undoing. Hartnell appears as Dallow, the character who serves as Attenborough’s second in command and confidante, but whose loyalty may be trumped by the same nihilistic cynicism that pervades the film — an artfully bleak British noir lauded by the BBC’s Jamie Russell as “one of the darkest films ever to be made on these shores.”Watch TrailerPatrick Troughton –&nbsp;The Gorgon (1965)  64%A vintage monster thriller from the Hammer vaults, 1965’s The Gorgon repeats the studio’s classic formula with a bit of a twist — instead of a creature of more recent vintage, a la Dracula or the Mummy, this outing is inspired by the titular beast from Greek mythology, whose mere gaze was said to be enough to turn men to stone. The story unfolds in a small German village in the early 20th century, after a rash of mysterious murders — each one leaving behind a victim whose body has been dispatched Gorgon-style — leads an investigator (Troughton) to the medic-slash-coroner of the local sanitarium (Peter Cushing). Toss in appearances from Hammer vets Christopher Lee and Barbara Shelley, and you’ve got all the ingredients for above-average pulp from a studio whose name is synonymous with the stuff. Calling The Gorgon “Enjoyable nonsense,” F5’s Jake Euker wrote, “the passing decades have rendered it more nonsensical, and thus more enjoyable.”Watch TrailerJon Pertwee –&nbsp;The House That Dripped Blood (1971)  92%The House That Dripped Blood promised viewers “TERROR waits for you in every room” — and if that promise proved somewhat unfulfilled in this typically uneven anthology effort, it was still true often enough to recommend the end result. Pertwee, whose Doctor Who tenure started the year before his appearance in House, appeared in one of the movie’s better-loved entries, an amusingly morbid piece about a buffoonish actor who buys a vampire’s cloak without realizing it has dark powers — or that he should keep it far, far away from his shapely co-star (Ingrid Pitt). “The first thing that should be noted about The House That Dripped Blood is that no blood is dripped,” mused Ken Hanke for the Asheville Mountain Xpress. “Knowing this will perhaps save disappointment along the way.”Watch TrailerTom Baker –&nbsp;Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)  67%Prior to becoming the longest-tenured and arguably most widely recognized Doctor — playing the role for seven consecutive seasons between 1974 to 1981 — Baker landed his first major film role in 1971’s Nicholas and Alexandra, in which director Franklin J. Schaffner dramatized the fall of the final house of Russian Romanovs. While Baker played neither Nicholas nor Alexandra (those honors went to Michael Jayston and Janet Suzman), he scored an even more satisfying part, playing the infamous mystic Grigori Rasputin. Although the end result certainly wasn’t to everyone’s liking — Roger Ebert argued that it “considers the Russian Revolution from, in some ways, the least interesting perspective” — many critics felt it struck a pleasing balance between character-based drama and epic historical sweep. “[Producer] Sam Spiegel,” &nbsp;wrote Variety, “comes up with a rarity: the intimate epic, in telling the fascinating story of the downfall of the Romanovs.”Watch TrailerPeter Davison –&nbsp;Black Beauty (1994)  80%Recognizing they had some big shoes to fill when Tom Baker left Doctor Who, the show’s producers opted to go in a different direction, but still wanted an actor who’d be familiar to British viewers. They found him in Peter Davison, who’d earned acclaim — and worked with Doctor Who producer John Nathan-Turner — on a BBC production of All Creatures Great and Small, and who put his own distinctive stamp on the venerable show during his 1981-’84 tenure. Davison has focused largely on television and stage work throughout his career, but he’s picked up a few film roles along the way, including an appearance as Squire Gordon in director Caroline Thompson’s 1994 adaptation of the oft-filmed Black Beauty&nbsp;— a family-friendly drama whose familiarity didn’t breed contempt for critics like Chris Hicks of the Deseret News. “Four (or more) movie versions precede this latest cinematic incarnation of Black Beauty,” admitted Hicks, “but none have managed to capture the spirit of the book as well.”Watch TrailerSylvester McCoy –&nbsp;The Hobbit TrilogyMcCoy bears the distinction of being the final Doctor during the show’s original 26-season run at the BBC, assuming the role from Colin Baker in 1987 and staying with the series until late 1989, when the network broadcast “Survival,” the last episode to air until Doctor Who&nbsp;was revived in 2005. Since making his mark on series history, McCoy has mainly concentrated on stage and television roles, but he’s ventured onto the big screen from time to time — perhaps most notably as the wizard Radagast the Brown in Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit&nbsp;trilogy, which culminated with The Battle of the Five Armies in 2014. “The pleasure is intense, and mixed with awe,” wrote Joe Morgenstern for the Wall Street Journal. “There is majesty here, and not just because we’re in the presence of magnificently regal madness.”Watch TrailerPaul McGann –&nbsp;Withnail and I (1987)  94%After the original series ended in 1989, Doctor Who fell into a long limbo — but even during its hibernation between official incarnations, there were still a few occasions for fans to enjoy the Doctor’s adventures. Paul McGann became the eighth Doctor when he assumed the role for a 1996 TV movie that was supposed to serve as an official relaunch, but instead mainly led to him starring in a lengthy series of audio dramas — and, much later, a 50th anniversary mini-episode titled “The Night of the Doctor.” But before all that, McGann was a member of the group of young UK actors dubbed “the Brit Pack,” and the proud owner of a series of film credits that included one of the main roles in the British black comedy classic Withnail and I. “The best British comedy ever made? Possibly,” mused Film4’s Ali Catterall. “A masterpiece? Unquestionably.”Watch TrailerChristopher Eccleston –&nbsp;Shallow Grave (1995)  69%Every Doctor is special, but Christopher Eccleston will always hold a hallowed place in Doctor Who&nbsp;history, because — as the Ninth Doctor — he’s the actor who bears the distinction of bringing the character back to active duty when the series was brought back to life by the BBC in 2005. Already a wizened veteran of stage and screen before he stepped into his first TARDIS, Eccleston boasts a laundry list of distinguished credits — but since we have to choose just one, we’re going with 1995’s Shallow Grave, an early Danny Boyle film that mined the depths of British dark comedy with a cast that included a young Ewan McGregor. Calling it “one of the most solid debuts anyone could ask for,” Examiner’s Chris Sawin wrote, “Shallow Grave&nbsp;is a story that goes from bad to worse to nasty during its duration. The performances are solid as you can never get a clear read on anyone’s motives right until it’s about to be revealed.”Watch TrailerDavid Tennant –&nbsp;Fright Night (2011)  72%After a string of short-term Doctors, David Tennant restored stability to the series when he assumed the role from Christopher Eccleston in 2005, taking over as the Tenth Doctor and keeping the reins for five years — including an animated spinoff — while maintaining his busy film and television schedule. He picked up right where he’d left off after leaving the show in 2010 — including a part in Craig Gillespie’s 2011 remake of the cult horror-comedy classic Fright Night, in which he played a supposed vampire expert who initially rebuffs the panicked efforts of a suburban teen (Anton Yelchin) to expose his allegedly bloodsucking neighbor (Colin Farrell). “Fright Night,” argued Colin Covert for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “is the best thing to happen to horror movies since red food coloring and Karo syrup.”Watch TrailerMatt Smith –&nbsp;Terminator Genisys (2015)  27%&nbsp;As the youngest Doctor, it’s understandable that Matt Smith has a relatively brief filmography; aside from his 2010-’14 stint starring in Doctor Who, a fair number of his credits have come in stage productions. But this is not to say that Doctor fans wishing to see Smith on the big screen are without options; in fact, earlier this year, he landed himself at the center of another decades-old sci-fi franchise when he scored the role of Skynet in Terminator: Genisys&nbsp;(next year, we can expect to see him in Patient Zero&nbsp;and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies). While most critics felt the Terminator&nbsp;films were already long past their prime, this sequel did have its defenders; as Tim Martain argued for the Mercury, “There is a fine line between clever homage and lazy lip service. This film trips over that line, spills its drink, and pukes in the cab on the way home. But I had fun.”Watch TrailerPeter Capaldi –&nbsp;In the Loop (2009)  94%Prior to taking over as the 12th official incarnation of the character in 2013, our current Doctor compiled a rather impressive list of screen credits, including roles in Local Hero, The Lair of the White Worm, and Dangerous Liaisons. But Capaldi is probably best known for playing spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in writer-director Armando Iannucci’s hit BBC series In the Thick of It, a character that helped him earn a BAFTA — and one that he reprised on the big screen for the show’s critically acclaimed spinoff film, In the Loop. Inspired by the run-up to the Iraq War, Loop&nbsp;ruthlessly skewers self-serving bureaucrats of all persuasions, adding up to one of the most relentless — and hilarious — political satires in recent memory. “[It’s] that rare film utterly without heroes,” observed the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr. “Instead, it amasses a group of boobs, users, and charlatans on both sides of the Atlantic and asks us to recognize our duly elected and appointed officials. You’ll laugh until you bleed, or vice versa.”Watch TrailerJohn Hurt –&nbsp;The Hit (1984)  87%John Hurt may not be an “official” Doctor, but this Oscar-nominated thespian’s appearance as the “War Doctor” in the 50th anniversary feature The Day of the Doctor&nbsp;counts in our book — and gives us an excuse to heap additional praise on a marvelous filmography. Mr. Hurt has made so many great movies that it’s hard to pick just one — between 1978-’80, he fired off Midnight Express, Alien, and The Elephant Man&nbsp;in quick succession, with voicework in Ralph Bakshi’s Lord of the Rings&nbsp;movie in between — but for the purposes of this list, we’re settling on the hidden gem The Hit, in which he stars as a hitman tasked with retrieving a former associate (Terence Stamp) who rolled over on the gang. Praising both leading men in addition to director Stephen Frears, the Los Angeles Times’ Sheila Benson wrote, “The Hit&nbsp;is something special: thoughtful, perfectly performed and carrying the clear stamp of an extremely interesting director.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Day, teaser, Seed, green, Writers, and, MSNBC, Emmy, Character, in","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DoctorWhoRecall.jpg","slug":"hidden-gems-of-the-doctor-who-doctors"},{"id":"47508965246324","title":"50 Years of Vampire TV Series","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})50 Years of Vampire TV SeriesWith The Vampire Diaries premiering this week, we look at some other memorable TV bloodsuckers.by Jeff Giles | September 30, 2015 |  CommentsTV vampire fans suffered a painful loss in August, when HBO’s True Blood aired its series finale after seven sudsy seasons of sharp-fanged melodrama. All is not lost, however; the CW’s The Vampire Diaries begins its seventh&nbsp;season on October 8, and in honor of its return, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a look back at some of the small screen’s most noteworthy nosferatus. It’s time for Total Recall!Dark Shadows (1966-71, 1991, 2004)Initially something of a Hail Mary pass for a network whose daytime lineup struggled against its broadcast rivals, ABC’s Dark Shadows added a novel supernatural twist to the nascent TV soap medium, weaving a gothic tale of monsters, werewolves, zombies, witches, and everyone’s favorite vampire, Barnabas Collins (Jonathan Frid). Always a solid hit, Shadows nevertheless fell under the axe in 1971, largely because its audience skewed heavily younger than other soaps (and therefore had significantly less buying power). But like any good vampire, it proved hard to kill, briefly resurfacing with a new cast on NBC in 1991 and again at the WB in 2004, when an unaired pilot filmed for the network. There’s also the Johnny Depp-led 2012 film adaptation, which most fans of the original would probably like to forget — and they can, since the bulk of the show’s initial run is still available, and audio dramas starring the original cast continue to be produced.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Night Stalker (1972)Years before he became part of an annual holiday tradition as the cantankerous father in A Christmas Story, Darren McGavin helped enthrall millions of viewers as the lead in ABC’s The Night Stalker, a hugely successful adaptation of the Jeff Rice novel The Kolchak Papers, about a Las Vegas reporter who slowly becomes convinced that a vampire is responsible for a series of grisly murders in the area. Originally aired in January of 1972, Stalker earned a 33.2 rating and 54 share, practically guaranteeing a sequel (which soon arrived in the form of The Night Strangler) and spawning a full-on series (1974-’75’s Kolchak: The Night Stalker), as well as a belated remake (2005’s short-lived Night Stalker). Deeply influential, Rice’s creation (initially adapted by I Am Legend author Richard Matheson) inspired a long list of writers that includes X-Files creator Chris Carter, who years later cast McGavin as Arthur Dales, the agent who essentially founded the X-Files program.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Forever Knight (1989)After checking out of General Hospital, starring in 1984’s Hard to Hold, and exhausting an impressive string of ’80s Top 40 hits, reformed pop idol Rick Springfield turned his focus to his acting career. One of his first orders of business? 1989’s Nick Knight, about an LAPD detective who also happens to secretly be a centuries-old vampire. Sadly, CBS didn’t wish that they had Rick’s pilot, and ended up airing it as a TV movie instead of picking up the series — at least until 1992, when they moved it to Canada, replaced most of the cast (including Springfield), and aired the result as Forever Knight.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Kindred: The Embraced (1996)There have been lots of vampire TV shows, but only one was based on a video game, starred C. Thomas Howell, and had its plug pulled after a measly eight episodes: Kindred: The Embraced, which aired on the Fox network during the spring of 1996. Howell played SFPD detective Frank Kohanek, who’s understandably concerned when he discovers that in addition to plain old mortal criminals, his beat is also home to scores of vampires led by one particularly nasty bloodsucker who masquerades as a mobster named Julian Luna (Mark Frankel). It isn’t the worst premise — and at the time, reviews calling the show a “cross between The Godfather and Melrose Place” meant it as much more of a compliment than one might assume today — but by the end of the season, Howell was on to other projects.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003)The film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, starring Kristy Swanson as the titular stake-wielder and Luke Perry as her scruffy teen paramour, seemed more likely to be buried in a ’90s time capsule than to serve as the inspiration for a long-running small-screen institution, but as ESPN’s Chris Berman might say, that’s why they make the TV shows. Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy, the broadcast Slayer — adapted by the movie’s screenwriter, future Avengers wrangler Joss Whedon — served as a surprisingly flexible forum for its creator’s imagination, expanding from its supernatural teen premise to hold a broadening mythology (the Buffyverse!) that encompassed everything from spinoffs to tie-ins and even a musical episode. Few vampire shows started from less auspicious-seeming beginnings — and few have demonstrated the genre’s flexibility with its compelling verve.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Port Charles (1997-2003)Unlike the other shows on our list, Port Charles didn’t always have a vampire theme; in fact, when it debuted as part of the ABC daytime lineup in 1997, it was a straight spinoff of General Hospital that focused on interns at the medical school across the street. Over time, however, in an effort to cut costs and lure younger viewers, the show adopted quicker, finite telenovela-style arcs while incorporating an extreme supernatural element that eventually saw the town of Port Charles overrun by a passel of vampires that included Caleb Morley (Michael Easton), whose sinister obsession with Livvie Locke (Kelly Monaco) proved so popular with viewers that not even multiple deaths could put an end to the character. Port Charles was canceled in 2003, seemingly ending Caleb’s story for good, but he returned a decade later when Easton, then playing his One Life to Live character John McBain on General Hospital, took on a dual role to solve the mystery of Caleb Morley once and for all. Maybe. This vampire stuff can get complicated.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Angel (1999-2004)Few spinoff series are ever truly taken seriously in their own right, and when Buffy the Vampire Slayer debuted in 1997, few could have guessed that it would ever be able to weave the sort of robust, sprawling mythology that could support a brand new show, let alone one that would last for five seasons and attract a passionate fanbase of its own. But then came Angel, starring David Boreanaz as the titular vampire first introduced in Buffy‘s debut episode. With a rich backstory that stretched back hundreds of years and included a gypsy curse that restored his human soul (as well as a bottomless, brooding guilt for all the heinous things he’d done during his evil days), plus a setup that found Angel moving to L.A. and fighting evil as a (what else?) P.I., the character proved more than capable of telling plenty of stories in his own corner of the broadening Buffyverse, and despite the show’s surprisingly premature cancellation in 2004, those tales continue to be told in the comics, where Angel, Buffy, and assorted other characters from the shows live on.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Blade: The Series (2006)Initially planned as a Showtime series that would have brought big-screen Blade Wesley Snipes back to the role he played in the Blade film trilogy, Blade: The Series was temporarily derailed when Snipes sued New Line, the studio behind the movies — but not even legal action was enough to stop the idea of weekly vampire-huntin’ action, and the show was eventually greenlighted by Spike TV with Kirk Jones, a.k.a. former Onyx member Sticky Fingaz, in the lead. Blade: The Series pulled healthy numbers for the network, scoring the most-watched original series premiere in Spike TV’s history, but the channel simply wasn’t equipped to sustain the kind of budget that an open-ended show about the struggle to purge the world of vampires requires. After one 13-episode season, the plug was pulled, sending Blade back to the comics… for now.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Moonlight (2007-2008)Your wedding day is stressful enough without having to worry about having your neck tapped after the guests go home, but that’s the cross that Mick St. John (Alex O’Loughlin) has to bear; before he and his new bride (Shannyn Sossamon) could even get the honeymoon started, she revealed her vampirism to him — and passed it along. Moonlight picks up decades later, when Mick’s working as a P.I. who collars bad guys while battling his bloodlust, staving off attraction for a human woman (Sophia Myles), and renewing his turbulent acquaintance with his former bride, who was assumed dead but is actually lurking around claiming to have a cure for vampirism. In spite of that rather loaded premise, Moonlight was a critical punching bag during its brief run, and in spite of fairly healthy ratings, a hiatus prompted by the writers’ strike of 2007-08 put the final stake in the show’s heart.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Being Human (2008-2013)There were two Being Humans, with one broadcast by the BBC and its North American remake on Syfy, but thanks to the wonders of the ever-expanding cable dial, they both aired here, so we’re flipping a coin and focusing on the original here. Certainly one of the more critically lauded series on our list, Human starred Russell Tovey and Aidan Turner as a werewolf and vampire who have somehow managed to become best buds; as part of their ongoing effort to fit into human society, they work at a local hospital and room together — although as the series opens and they’re moving onto their new place, they discover that it just so happens to be inhabited by a ghost (Lenora Crichlow). Taken another direction, Being Human might have been laugh track-worthy, but it used its outlandish setup as the springboard for a thoughtful treatment of weighty social themes — and didn’t skimp on the action, either. The Syfy version, while not quite the award-winning sensation the original was, still earned healthy ratings for the network; perhaps best of all, both shows had the good sense to tell their stories within a relatively compact framework, with the original bowing out after 37 episodes and its successor bidding farewell after 52.Watch Trailer&nbsp;True Blood (2008-2014)Unlike a lot of vampire-themed productions, Alan Ball’s HBO hit True Blood didn’t fall back on “hey, vampires” for its supernatural drama; instead, inspired by author Charlaine Harris’ Southern Vampire Mysteries books, it imagined a hypothetical near future in which the development of synthetic blood leads to vampires “coming out of the coffin” and revealing themselves to humanity — and then splitting themselves into factions over whether it’s better to assimilate or maintain separate societies. If that makes the show sound like a lot of high-minded speechifying, don’t worry — as any True Blood viewer will eagerly tell you, it’s a lot darker and sexier than that. Revolving around the small-town Louisiana adventures of a telepathic human-faerie hybrid named Sookie (Anna Paquin), it explores weighty themes like equal rights and substance abuse while leaving plenty of room for sexytime and sanguine fluid.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries (2009-present)Execs at the CW may have offed Angel before fans (and/or series creator Joss Whedon) were ready to let it go, but that didn’t mean the suits in the building were entirely blind to the appeal of a vampire series; in fact, five years later, it was bloodsucker season once more, when the network debuted The Vampire Diaries, a suitably soapy adaptation of the bestselling L. J. Smith book series about young Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev) and her teen embroilment in a vampiric love triangle that just happens to be the tip of a very large, incredibly dramatic superantural iceberg in her small Virginia town. Six seasons and running, Diaries is enough of a signature hit for the network to deserve the place of honor on this week’s list — and it now boasts its own spinoff series: The Originals.Watch Trailer&nbsp;From Dusk Till Dawn (2014-present)Writer-director-producer-El Rey network exec Robert Rodriguez is an entertainment industry unto himself, and when you hold all those cards, you get to write your own rules — hence From Dusk till Dawn: The Series, the small-screen continuation of the 1996 film that starred George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a pair of hoods whose journey toward a Mexican safehouse is complicated when they stumble into a strip club that just happens to be full of vampires. After spawning a video game and a pair of sequels, Dusk dawned on Rodriguez’s network in 2014, with D.J. Cotrona and Zane Holtz stepping in for Clooney and Tarantino.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Strain (2014-present)Guillermo del Toro is overflowing with ideas, and he’s got plenty of tenacity, too: After initially conceiving The Strain as a TV show but failing to find a buyer, he teamed up with author Chuck Hogan to turn it into a novel trilogy — and then, after the books spilled over into a comic series, took the story back to television, where The Strain made its FX debut in July of 2014. A grimly compelling look at the grisly rise of a horrific vampire army, it continually tests network TV’s ability to give del Toro’s freakshow imagination free rein, and so far, audiences can’t turn away.Watch Trailer&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Spectrum, Golden, BBC, Esquire, Cinematographers, LGBT, Sci-Fi, slashers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer.jpg","slug":"50-years-of-vampire-tv-series"},{"id":"47508966997384","title":"Emily Watson’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Emily Watson's 10 Best MoviesWe look at the ten best-reviewed films of the Little Boy star.by RT Staff | April 22, 2015 |  CommentsStarting with her breakout performance in 1996’s Breaking the Waves, Emily Watson has assembled a truly impressive filmography over the years — and with her latest effort, Little Boy, arriving in theaters this weekend, we decided there was no time like the present to take an appreciative look back at some of its brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall!10. The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep (2007)  74%Emily Watson has more than her share of harrowing dramas in her filmography, but with 2007’s The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep, she proved she also has a pretty good knack for picking a heartwarming family-friendly script. Adapted from Dick King-Smith’s children’s novel of the same name, Water Horse uses a modern-day conversation in a Scottish bar as the framing device for a gently mystical trip back in time to the ’40s, when a boy (Alex Etel) stumbles upon a mysterious egg on the shores of Loch Ness and… Well, you can probably see where this is heading, but director Jay Russell’s sensitive depiction of the book (from Robert Nelson Jacobs’ screenplay) and the work of a fine cast (including Watson as Etel’s mother) still add up to rousing, heartwarming fun for viewers of all ages. According to Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, “The film is what family entertainment ought to be, but so rarely is: a ripping good adventure, a parable about childhood and maturity, and a romp.”Watch Trailer9. War Horse (2011)  74%Name a movie War Horse, and you’re essentially signifying that your entire human cast is playing second fiddle to its equine lead — but in Steven Spielberg’s 2011 adaptation of Michael Morpurgo’s 1982 children’s novel, those human stars are still pretty spectacular. Exactly the sort of beautifully filmed period drama you’d expect given its behind-the-scenes pedigree and Christmas Day release date, War Horse follows the astonishing WWI adventures of a Bay Thoroughbred named Joey, as well as the equally stirring tale of his young trainer (Jeremy Irvine) and his family (Watson and Peter Mullan). While some critics dismissed the results as glossy awards bait, it proved sufficiently moving for the majority; as Steven Rea wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “War Horse is sugary, to be sure — but it is sugar cut with cannon fire and barbed wire and the horrors of war.”Watch Trailer8. Punch-Drunk Love (2002)  79%Playing the yin to Adam Sandler’s yang can often be a rather thankless task, as has been ably demonstrated by a list of thespians that includes Salma Hayek, Marisa Tomei, and Jennifer Aniston, but in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love, Watson brought the best out of him, anchoring Anderson’s warped, tender drama with a quiet soulfulness that underscored an arguably career-best performance from Sandler. As a pair of wounded hearts timidly connecting between halting overtures punctuated by bursts of Anderson-style chaos, the duo brought two of the writer-director’s most deeply relatable characters vividly to life. “It’s wacky. It’s unpredictable,” wrote Susan Stark for the Detroit News. “It’s sure to give pause to Sandler fans and, smaller in number but every bit as dedicated, to Watson admirers too.”Watch Trailer7. The Theory of Everything (2014)  80%James Marsh’s biopic of renowned scientist Stephen Hawking earned mountains of acclaim, most of it for Eddie Redmayne’s Oscar-winning work in the starring role, but Redmayne had plenty of company in terms of outstanding acting talent, including Felicity Jones (also Oscar-nominated) as Hawking’s wife Jane, David Thewlis as one of Hawking’s professors, and Watson as Jane’s mother. The result was a production that matched its largely positive reviews with the kind of box office befitting a tastefully mounted tale of real-life courage in the face of enormous adversity; as Claudia Puig wrote for USA Today, “Marsh takes a complicated persona and reveals a range of dimensions. The result is an engaging biopic that is often quite moving.”Watch Trailer6. The Boxer (1997)  80%Most boxing movies use the battle inside the ring as a sort of mirror or metaphor for conflicts the protagonists are forced to deal with during everyday life, and Jim Sheridan’s The Boxer is an example of this cinematic formula writ large: Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis) returns to his old neighborhood after serving a lengthy prison sentence for charges stemming from his IRA membership, only to find his old stomping grounds gutted by financial and emotional malaise. His efforts to find redemption by reopening the community gym — and his continual torch-carrying for a married ex-girlfriend (Watson) — are cause for hope even as they ratchet up the tension for a grueling final act. “Day-Lewis has the ability to make the will to nonviolence look positively volcanic,” wrote an admiring Carrie Rickey for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “and Watson, with her 200-watt incandescence, makes longing look radiant.”Watch Trailer5. Belle (2014)  84%The remarkable real-life story behind a well-known 1779 painting inspired screenwriter Misan Sagay to pen the script for Belle, a handsomely mounted historical drama that ended up becoming one of the more widely acclaimed films of 2014 — and served as a coming-out party for its magnetic star, Gugu Mbatha-Raw. She plays the titular character, a woman born into slavery but raised as a British noblewoman, whose story plays out against the backdrop of a pivotal time for British law and societal mores, and while the movie definitively rests on Mbatha-Raw’s performance, she’s ably aided and abetted by a stellar supporting cast that included Watson, Tom Wilkinson, and Miranda Richardson. “It’s smartly acted, handsome, and well-crafted in a way that’ll make it irresistible to the Merchant-Ivory/Masterpiece Theater set,” wrote NPR’s Bob Mondello. “Think pride, with a whole lot of prejudice.”Watch Trailer4. Gosford Park (2001)  86%Before we had Downton Abbey, director Robert Altman gave us Gosford Park — a period British mystery brought to life by a veritable who’s who of U.K. acting talent that included Watson (nominated for a Satellite Award for Best Actress) along with Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas, Helen Mirren, and Stephen Fry, among many others. While Altman’s foray into Agatha Christie territory may have caught some viewers off guard, few critics were complaining after the credits rolled; as Peter Rainer wrote for New York Magazine, “Altman is a supreme artist-joker, and the jest this time is that the most American of film directors has given us a finely wrought British whodunit with the emotional layering of a first-rate novel.”Watch Trailer3. Breaking the Waves (1996)  85%Watson received her first Academy Award nomination for Breaking the Waves, which also happened to be her first film role — not a bad outcome for a part that would have gone to Helena Bonham Carter if Carter hadn’t dropped out at the last minute. While Watson was virtually unknown before Waves was released, director Lars von Trier obviously saw something in her, and after this harrowing drama about a woman whose marriage to an oilman (Stellan Skarsgård) takes some increasingly dark turns arrived in theaters, von Trier’s reasons for plucking his leading lady from obscurity were readily apparent. “Not many movies like this get made, because not many filmmakers are so bold, angry and defiant. Like many truly spiritual films, it will offend the Pharisees,” wrote Roger Ebert. “Here we have a story that forces us to take sides, to ask what really is right and wrong in a universe that seems harsh and indifferent.”Watch Trailer2. Hilary and Jackie (1998)  88%Hollywood loves a good “troubled genius” biopic, and 1998’s Hilary and Jackie definitely fits the bill. Starring Watson and Rachel Griffiths as the real-life du Pre sisters, whose ultimately rather tragic story provided wrenching (albeit reportedly semi-fictional) grist for Frank Cottrell Boyce’s screenplay, it offered its leading ladies excellent opportunities to prove their dramatic mettle, and they delivered in spades: both Watson and Griffiths earned Academy Award nominations for their work in director Anand Tucker’s wrenching drama. Of course, this isn’t exactly light watching, and if you aren’t in the mood for a movie whose arc includes dreams deferred, mental illness, and death, then Hilary and Jackie probably isn’t for you — but for those receptive to its thorny charms, it delivers an experience that the Cincinnati Enquirer’s Margaret McGurk called “as exhilarating, passionate and profound as the music it celebrates.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;1. The Proposition (2005)  85%We turn to John Hillcoat movies for nail-bitingly grim depictions of the dust-caked evil that lurks within the dark heart of human nature, and 2005’s The Proposition does not disappoint: Starring Guy Pearce as the nominal “nice guy” in a savage family of thugs whose reign of terror in the Australian outback has triggered a crusade for justice from an officer of the law (Ray Winstone), it starts with Pearce’s character being told he must murder one of his brothers in order to save another, and only gets darker from there. The Proposition‘s stellar pedigree includes a hard-hitting screenplay from Nick Cave and an outstanding supporting cast rounded out by Danny Huston, John Hurt, and — as Winstone’s increasingly imperiled wife — Watson, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress of the Year by the London Film Critics’ Association; critics elsewhere were just as vociferous in their acclaim, with Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution speaking for many of her peers when she wrote, “The movie gets at something primal in the pit of your stomach, something that speaks of loyalty and betrayal, of men’s souls — or the lack thereof.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"NYCC, of, Summer, we, Mudbound, E!, Freeform, Legendary, Amazon, indiana","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/emily-watson.jpg","slug":"emily-watsons-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508968769933","title":"Ed Harris’ 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Ed Harris' 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Run All Night star.by Jeff Giles | March 11, 2015 |  CommentsA prolific character actor with leading-man chops and four Oscar nominations under his belt, Ed Harris has been entertaining audiences for decades — so when we saw his name in the credits for Run All Night, we knew exactly what we needed to do with this week’s list. From supporting parts to leading roles, from action to comedy to drama, Harris has done just about everything — and done it well. The Tomatometer agrees, giving us a top 10 that bottoms out at an impressive 88 percent. Which of your favorites made the cut? It’s time to find out, Total Recall style!10. The Abyss (1989)  89%1989’s underwater epic The Abyss required the construction of the world’s biggest tank of filtered fresh water, as well as newly designed watertight cameras and bleeding-edge special effects work from Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It also required a lot of patience on the part of its cast (including Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, both of whom suffered emotional breakdowns during the grueling six-month shoot) and crew (including director James Cameron, who spent hours at a time under 50 feet of water) — and the studio had its own cross to bear, enduring millions of dollars in cost overruns and weeks of delays. In the end, The Abyss wasn’t as profitable as Cameron’s other epics, only bringing in around $90 million against a $70 million budget, but critics were generally kind, particularly to the longer version that eventually surfaced on home video (Widgett Walls of Needcoffee.com called the theatrical release “an abomination” and wrote, “For God’s sake, make sure you have the director’s cut”).Watch Trailer9. Swing Shift (1984)  87%It endured an infamously bumpy production period — during which stars Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell went over Jonathan Demme’s head to arrange edits and reshoots with a different director — but even if Swing Shift didn’t end up fulfilling Demme’s original vision, critics still felt it effectively told the story of a war bride (Hawn) who enters the workforce (and starts an affair) during WWII while her husband (Harris) is overseas. Although more than a few viewers have taken issue with its soft-focused treatment of adultery, the picture’s rich detail and well-written script impressed writers like Filmcritic’s Pete Croatto, who observed, “Sofia Coppola and Wes Anderson could learn a few things watching this. Or maybe they already have.”Watch Trailer8. Sweet Dreams (1985)  90%Although it was roundly criticized for taking liberties with the facts of its subject’s brief, fascinating life, the Patsy Cline biopic Sweet Dreams makes for a solidly compelling — if at times frustratingly inaccurate — film about the country star’s (played by Jessica Lange) early years, short career, and tragic death, as well as her tumultuous marriage to the unfortunately named Charlie Dick (Harris). Earning Lange a Best Actress nomination for her work, Dreams won praise from critics like Time Out’s Geoff Andrews, who wrote, “The two main performances are excellent: Lange plays the singer without a hint of condescension to her dreams of ‘a big house with yellow roses’, while Harris is persuasively menacing, with an inventively foul mouth.”Watch Trailer7. Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)  95%You think the dynamic at your company is brutal? Try swimming with the sharks of Glengarry Glen Ross, a pitch-black, deeply profane case study in how quickly an office will disintegrate when a sales team is told that it’s about to enter a competition — and everyone who winds up lower than second place is going to lose his job. The result, as you might expect, is a bile-drenched free-for-all, brilliantly scripted by David Mamet (adapting his own Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play) and brought to painful life by an ace cast that included Harris, Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Al Pacino (who earned an Academy Award nomination for his work). It isn’t for the faint of heart, and it might provoke a few winces of recognition, but it is, in the words of Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “An utter masterpiece.”Watch Trailer6. The Truman Show (1998)  95%Is it science fiction? A comedy? A drama? A psychiatric syndrome? Actually, 1998’s The Truman Show is all of the above. Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of a wildly popular reality series engineered by a producer named Christof (played by Harris), in which Truman’s life — complete with fake wife, fake friends, and a whole fake town — is lapped up by eager audiences. It didn’t net Carrey the Academy Award that many were anticipating, but The Truman Show has endured over the last 10 years, and predicted the overwhelming popularity of reality television in the years to come. In the words of Hollywood Report Card’s Ross Anthony, “this is clearly one of the decade’s cleverest, most original pictures.”Watch Trailer5. Gone Baby Gone (2007)  94%Ben Affleck made his directorial debut with this pitch-black thriller, adapted from the Dennis Lehane novel about a private investigator (Casey Affleck) who finds himself mixed up in the exceedingly shady case of a kidnapped girl. As he works with the cops (including Harris and Morgan Freeman) and his girlfriend/partner (Michelle Monaghan), it becomes clear that things are not what they seem. It’s a basic framework that pretty much any filmgoer will be familiar with, but in Affleck’s hands, Gone Baby Gone came alive; as Bruce Westbrook wrote for the Houston Chronicle, “A love-tolerate valentine to the city, it feels more real than the gangster-gorged mean streets of Martin Scorsese’s The Departed, and just as tortured as Clint Eastwood’s Mystic River.”Watch Trailer4. Apollo 13 (1995)  96%This dramatization of NASA’s aborted 1970 lunar mission combined one of star Tom Hanks’ biggest personal passions — space travel — with Hollywood’s favorite thing: a blockbuster prestige picture. With a cast that featured a number of similarly prolific actors (among them Harris, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, and Gary Sinise), Apollo probably would have made decent money even if it had played fast and loose with the real-life details of the launch, but director Ron Howard and his crew strove for verisimilitude, going so far as to shoot portions of the film in actual zero gravity. The result was a summertime smash that restored some of space travel’s luster for a jaded generation — and made for an exceedingly good filmgoing experience according to most critics, including Roger Ebert, who called it “a powerful story, one of the year’s best films, told with great clarity and remarkable technical detail, and acted without pumped-up histrionics.”Watch Trailer3. Snowpiercer (2014)  94%A little more than 15 years after he played a powerful man who manipulates lives in service of his own warped version of the greater good for The Truman Show, Harris offered a variation on that theme for Snowpiercer. One of the best-reviewed movies of 2014, it found director and co-writer Bong Joon-ho exploring the outer reaches of bizarro mainstream sci-fi with a dystopian class warfare thriller about the conflict between the unwashed masses (led by Chris Evans) against their pampered overlords (featuring Tilda Swinton acting as Harris’ cartoonishly awful enforcer) on a train hurtling non-stop around the post-apocalyptic ruins of planet Earth. Bracingly original during a summer season crowded with blockbuster fare, Snowpiercer earned raves from the vast majority of critics, including Slate’s Dana Stevens, who wrote that it “seems to have been sent back to us from some distant alternate future where grandiose summer action movies can also be lovingly crafted, thematically ambitious works of art.”Watch Trailer2. Places in the Heart (1984)  89%Sally Field won a Best Actress Oscar and John Malkovich earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for their work in this 1984 drama, which tells the story of a widowed woman (Field) who struggles to keep her Texas farm afloat during the Great Depression while her sister (Lindsay Crouse) deals with her crumbling marriage to a carousing husband (Harris). The kind of film whose plot doesn’t seem to cover a lot of ground, but which deals with some unmistakeably weighty themes (in this case racism, adultery, and family commitment), Places in the Heart wasn’t necessarily one of the most exciting pictures of the year, but it was an Academy favorite — Field’s Best Actress win prompted her oft-lampooned “you like me” speech — and a source of admiration for critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote, “Out of the memories of his boyhood in Waxahachie, Tex., during the Great Depression, and within the unlikely tradition of the old-fashioned ‘mortgage’ melodrama, Robert Benton has made one of the best films in years about growing up American.”Watch Trailer1. The Right Stuff (1983)  96%It’s based on one of America’s most inspiring true stories, it features an ace ensemble cast, and it earned rave reviews from critics — so why did audiences turn their backs on The Right Stuff during its 1983 theatrical run? The fact that it’s more than three hours long probably had something to do with it, but in writer/director Philip Kaufman’s defense, it’s hard to think of a better way to tell the story of NASA’s famed “Mercury Seven.” As astronaut John Glenn, Harris held his own against talented co-stars such as Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, and Dennis Quaid; together, they helped create the four-time Oscar winner that Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson recommended by writing, “Along with Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America it’s the last great American epic — the kind of film that couldn’t be made today.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s the trailer for Harris’s directorial debut, Pollock, which also earned him a Best Actor Oscar nomination:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"latino, 71st, cartoon, Avengers, USA, singing, on, know, Exclusive, Review, Academy, unscripted, Network, book","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ed-harris.jpg","slug":"ed-harris-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508968812942","title":"Judi Dench’s 10 Best Films","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Judi Dench's 10 Best FilmsWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel star.by Jeff Giles | March 5, 2015 |  CommentsThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel made more than $135 million worldwide while offering a handful of finely seasoned veteran actors a chance to prove that Hollywood doesn’t always have to be youth-obsessed — and this weekend, the old gang is back together (with a couple of new additions) for the sequel, the sensibly titled The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. This gives us the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to returning Exotic star Judi Dench, whose long list of well-received roles includes everything from Merchant Ivory period pieces to a long stint as M in the James Bond franchise. You won’t find any of her 007 movies on this list, because they missed the cut after we added up and averaged out their scores, but that’s just another testament to the strength of Dame Dench’s filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Wetherby (1985)  67%Dench earned her second BAFTA nomination for her supporting work in David Hare’s Wetherby, a 1985 drama about the increasingly unsettling goings-on that unspool following the shocking death of a young man in the cottage of a woman (Vanessa Redgrave) whose party he’s recently attended. Beautifully cast and endowed with patiently explored narrative depths, it also started a busy string of acclaimed theatrical releases for Dench: Although she’d focused much of her energy on stage and television work since making her film debut with Four in the Morning in 1965, she found herself in increased demand after the mid-’80s, rounding out the decade with A Room with a View, 84 Charing Cross Road, A Handful of Dust, and a supporting role in Kenneth Branagh’s star-studded Henry V. Of Wetherby, Roger Ebert wrote, “A haunting film, because it dares to suggest that the death of the stranger is important to everyone it touches — because it forces them to decide how alive they really are.”Watch Trailer9. My Week with Marilyn (2011)  83%Attempting to portray a screen legend like Marilyn Monroe seems like the kind of thankless task for which a director would need to find an inexperienced actress who didn’t know any better — but fortunately for Simon Curtis, whose My Week with Marilyn adapts a pair of Colin Clark memoirs inspired by his time on the set of Monroe’s The Prince and the Showgirl, Michelle Williams was ready and willing to take the job. And while the events that unfold in the movie amount to little more than a footnote in Monroe’s story, her empathetic work in the role helped lift My Week above rote biopic material — as did the reliably solid performances turned in by an ace supporting cast that included Dench, Kenneth Branagh, Julia Ormond, and Eddie Redmayne. As Stephen Whitty put it for the Newark Star-Ledger, “No other actress has quite understood the frustrated, maternal side of Monroe that informed so many of her performances. Or quite recaptured that absolutely luminous quality she had on film.”Watch Trailer8. Jane Eyre (2011)  84%Never one to shy away from a well-mounted period piece, Dench availed herself of Cary Fukunaga when the director decided to film the umpteenth adaptation of Jane Eyre in 2011 — and as she had when she signed up for Joe Wright’s Pride and Prejudice in 2005, she ended up being part of an unlikely latter-day classic in the bargain. Led by a marvelous Mia Wasikowska in the title role, this new-look Eyre hews closely to the Charlotte Bronte novel while adding loads of gloomy British atmosphere and assembling a parade of talented actors — including Michael Fassbender, Sally Hawkins, and Dench as Mrs. Fairfax — to bring the story to life. “Some of us are Jane Eyre addicts,” wrote Moira MacDonald for the Seattle Times, “and the new movie version directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga gives us just the right fix.”Watch Trailer7. Pride and Prejudice (2005)  86%If you’re going to try and put together a new version of something that’s been adapted as many times as Pride and Prejudice, you’d better bring something new to the table and put together one heck of a cast — and director Joe Wright accomplished both with his 2005 version of the Jane Austen classic, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen as the star-crossed Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. A back-to-basics affair that tried to put a little dirt back under the fingernails of source material often used as the basis for excessively prim adaptations, Wright’s Pride also honored the novel by rounding out the cast with supremely talented actors, including Dench (as the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh), Carey Mulligan, Rosamund Pike, and Donald Sutherland — an approach that paid dividends at the box office, where the movie raked in more than $120 million worldwide, as well as with critics like Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who wrote, “Dare I say that even Jane Austen herself would have delighted in the final triumph of Ms. Knightley’s quick-witted Elizabeth in this film? Yes, I do, and all the highbrow and middlebrow cinephobes of the world be damned.”Watch Trailer6. 84 Charing Cross Road (1987)  87%On paper, the story of a long-distance friendship that evolves through letters exchanged between a New York City book lover and a London bookstore owner might not seem like the most inherently filmable idea, but as 1987’s 84 Charing Cross Road proves, you don’t need a lot of flashy visuals to create absorbing cinema — particularly when you’re aided and abetted by a passel of talent, both behind the scenes (including director David Jones) and in front of the cameras, where audiences were treated to the sight of veteran actors Anne Bancroft, Judi Dench, and Anthony Hopkins sinking their considerable dramatic chops into an expanded dramatization of the real-life letters between American writer Helene Hanff and bookseller Frank Doel. Dench was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress BAFTA, while Bancroft won Best Actress, and critics were generally delighted with Charing Cross; as Geoff Andrew wrote for Time Out, “The film has nothing to do with easy nostalgia; it’s about real, credible people, and as such finally becomes very moving.”Watch Trailer5. Notes on a Scandal (2006)  87%A modern spin on the sort of mean-spirited melodrama that Joan Crawford and Bette Davis might once have chewed through, Notes on a Scandal stars Dench opposite Cate Blanchett in the tale of two London schoolteachers whose friendship teeters on the precipice of one woman’s terrible secrets and the other’s seething misanthropy. Fashioned from luridly pulpy ingredients but elevated by its powerful cast (including Bill Nighy as Blanchett’s husband), Scandal wowed critics like Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, who wrote, “Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett star in a misanthropic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including saps like us who think we’re watching a film about other people.”Watch Trailer4. Shakespeare in Love (1998)  92%Would people have been as enthralled by Romeo and Juliet if William Shakespeare had written it as Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate’s Daughter? According to the lightly history-inspired Shakespeare in Love, we missed the chance to find out only because the writer’s block-stricken playwright (Joseph Fiennes) had the good fortune to meet a bewitching young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) whose secret presence in his stage company led to a love affair that ended up inspiring the classic play. While it may not have been accurate, Love offered a whole lot of talented actors a chance to strut their stuff, including Paltrow, who won a Best Actress Oscar, and Dench, whose appearance as Queen Elizabeth I earned her her own Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. “It restores to centrality of consciousness one of the great geniuses of our civilization,” wrote Stephen Hunter for the Washington Post. “It makes us care for his greatness, for his passion, for his worth. In no uncertain terms, it tells us Willie Boy is still here.”Watch Trailer3. Philomena (2013)  91%She’s walked off with countless scenes in supporting roles, some of them amounting to little more than a few lines. With Philomena, Dench was offered the rare opportunity to carry a movie — and she proved she was more than up to the task, investing the fact-based story of a woman who, with the help of a journalist (Steve Coogan), attempts to reconnect with the son she gave&nbsp;up for adoption decades before with warmth, humor, and plenty of honest dramatic heft. Dench didn’t win her Best Actress Academy Award nomination for Philomena — one of four the film was up for, including Best Picture — but perhaps this story’s appeal is best summed up by the Best Actress honors she took home from the AARP Annual Movies for Grownups Awards; at a time when thoughtful movies for adults are often said to be in short supply, here’s a thoughtful rejoinder. “At its core,” observed the Washington Post’s Ann Hornaday, “this clever, wrenching, profound story underscores the tenacity of faith in the face of unfathomable cruelty.”Watch Trailer2. Mrs. Brown (1997)  92%Dench walked away with her first Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her work in John Madden’s Mr. Brown, a tasteful — if not entirely factual — dramatization of the real-life story of a Scottish servant (Billy Connolly) whose relationship with the widowed Queen Victoria (Dench) throws the royal court into a tizzy. Originally intended to air as an episode of Masterpiece Theatre, it went on to accrue acclaim — and a healthy $13 million at the box office during its arthouse run — while proving that its star’s surprising midlife career renaissance was absolutely no fluke. Observed Janet Maslin of the New York Times, “Mrs. Brown transcends its period setting not only with a keenly observed struggle between love and duty but also with the kind of controversy that envelops the Queen and her servant.”Watch Trailer1. A Room With a View (1985)  100%Dench earned her first BAFTA for her work in A Room with a View, taking home a Best Supporting Actress award — one of several the film won, including Best Actress (for Maggie Smith) and Best Film. Looking back, it isn’t difficult to see why: Although modern viewers may watch this sweeping period drama — about an Edwardian lass (Helena Bonham Carter) whose irrepressible fondness for a caddish rake (Julian Sands) is thwarted by an older cousin (Smith) who believes he’s a bad influence — and see pure Merchant Ivory formula, it’s important to remember that at the time, there was no such thing. Room set the template for dozens of pictures to follow, setting a bar that all but the very best have tried in vain to match — aided in no small part by a robust supporting cast that, aside from Dench, included Daniel Day-Lewis and Simon Callow (who earned a BAFTA nomination of his own). “This is a complete movie, full of life, love and hope,” wrote Dan Jardine for the Apollo Guide. “While we may occasionally forget that truth is beauty and beauty truth, thankfully films like A Room With a View will always be there as a reminder.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s Dame Judi doing her part to bring awareness to ALS in last year’s ice bucket challenge:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"video, BBC, Winners, comedy, IFC, movies, Swim","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/judi-dench.jpg","slug":"judi-denchs-10-best-films"},{"id":"47508968703372","title":"Sean Penn’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Sean Penn's 10 Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best reviewed work of the Gunman star.by Jeff Giles | March 18, 2015 |  CommentsFrom his breakout appearance as beloved stoner Jeff Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High to his Academy Award-winning efforts as a dramatic actor, Sean Penn has had a remarkable journey. This weekend, he’s adding “action hero” to his résumé with The Gunman, so in honor of Mr. Penn’s cinematic exploits, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to some of the brightest highlights from his distinguished (and quite eclectic) filmography. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Colors (1988)  80%Before New Jack City and the decade of hard-hitting urban cop dramas that followed, there was 1988’s Colors, starring Penn and Robert Duvall as a pair of LAPD officers out to purge the streets of gang activity — when they aren’t clashing with one another over their conflicting methods of serving and protecting the public, that is. There’s truly no shortage of movies that start from the same rough setup, but director Dennis Hopper — working from a script by Crimson Tide writer Michael Schiffer — had a tremendous cast to work with, including a roster of solid supporting players (among them Maria Conchita Alonso and Don Cheadle) to ground what might otherwise have proven an overly familiar tale. “There’s great pleasure in watching these two actors work,” wrote Hal Hinson for the Washington Post. “And Hopper, a great actor himself, knows what they need to thrive.”Watch Trailer9. State of Grace (1990)  84%Director Phil Joanou opened his career with a better-than-average teen comedy (Three O’Clock High) and a well-intentioned, albeit indulgent rockumentary (U2: Rattle and Hum) — which is to say that few could have expected that he had it in him to helm a drama as tense and gripping as 1990’s State of Grace. Starring Penn as an undercover cop whose latest case tests his loyalty to his best friend (played by Gary Oldman) — not to mention his affection for his friend’s sister (Robin Wright) — Grace exploited an instantly recognizable formula while transcending it thanks to outstanding acting from its leads. Calling it “a superior gangland drama that deals imaginatively with the familiar themes of family, friendship and loyalty,” Don Groves of SBS wrote, “Wild-eyed and sporting lank, greasy hair, Oldman dominates the screen as a truly terrifying character, while Penn effectively portrays a man battling with diametrically-opposed emotions.”Watch Trailer8. Casualties of War (1989)  83%By the time Casualties of War arrived in 1989, filmgoers had already seen a growing list of films about the wretched aftermath of the Vietnam War, including dramatic hits such as The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now, and Platoon as well as action-driven blockbusters like the Rambo trilogy — which might go a little way towards explaining why they failed to show up for Brian De Palma’s Casualties of War, in which Penn and Michael J. Fox take opposing sides in the nightmarish conflict within an American patrol squad that erupts as the war rages on around the soldiers. A solid hit with critics who offered Penn another round of hosannas and expressed surprised admiration for Fox’s strong dramatic turn, Casualties lost money at the box office while earning praise from scribes such as Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, “There’s a moral charge to the action, but it’s also swooningly exciting, coldly scary. Every friend may be an enemy, every innocent a traitor.”Watch Trailer7. The Falcon and the Snowman (1985)  82%The ’80s produced no shortage of Cold War dramas, but 1985’s The Falcon and the Snowman is utterly unlike any of them. Rather than a pulse-pounding thriller coasting on patriotism-driven intrigue, this fact-based, John Schlesinger-directed effort stars Penn as an opportunist drug dealer who finds himself lured into selling government secrets after he’s approached by a defense contractor (Timothy Hutton) who becomes disillusioned after realizing the U.S. government’s overseas activities aren’t always as noble as he’d once believed — and whose rather impulsive decision to commit treason soon finds both men struggling to control forces well beyond their control. “It’s a watchable, likely accurate recitation of facts, with two outstanding performances,” wrote Nick Rogers for Suite101. “But in the case of The Falcon and the Snowman, the truth we don’t see onscreen may be stranger, and stronger, than the historical fiction that has been created.”Watch Trailer6. The Tree of Life (2011)  84%Nothing gets a cineaste’s anticipation humming like news of a new Terrence Malick film — and since Malick is nothing if not deliberate, we had plenty of time to hum over Tree of Life. Originally announced in the wake of Malick’s 2005 effort The New World, it tumbled down the release schedule throughout 2009 and 2010 before finally bowing in May 2011 — all 139 inscrutable minutes of it. The product of Malick’s progressively harder-to-contain ambition, Life took viewers from the dawn of life to the 21st century, leaving plenty of room for solid acting from Penn, Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain — as well as hosannas from critics like the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, who deemed it “Daring in concept, occasionally daffy in execution and ultimately unforgettable” as well as “a heartfelt answer to the question of where we humans belong — with each other, on this planet, bound by love.”Watch Trailer5. At Close Range (1986)  87%1986 was the best of times and the worst of times for Sean Penn in the critics’ circle: August brought the roundly derided Shanghai Surprise, co-starring our subject and his newlywed bride Madonna in one of the decade’s most infamous flops, but April found him in a different — and altogether more successful — kind of family affair. At Close Range placed Penn alongside his brother Chris in director James Foley’s bleak crime drama about a mob boss (a mustachioed Christopher Walken) whose return from exile upends the lives of his grown sons. In spite of its compelling story and excellent cast — which included Mary Stuart Masterson, Kiefer Sutherland, and Crispin Glover — the movie didn’t make much of an impact at the box office, but it resonated with critics like James Sanford of the Kalamazoo Gazette, who called it “a dark jewel of a drama, with first-rate performances.”Watch Trailer4. Mystic River (2003)  88%Hollywood stories about childhood loyalties divided by adult lives that unfold on opposite sides of the law aren’t exactly in short supply, and really never have been — but when you have Clint Eastwood behind the camera, Brian Helgeland writing the script from a Dennis Lehane book, and a cast packed with reliable names like Penn, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Laurence Fishburne, you’re pretty much guaranteed a terrific movie. That’s exactly what filmgoers got with 2003’s Mystic River, which transcended its rather familiar framework to earn over $150 million at the box office and a pair of Oscars, including one awarded to Penn for his portrayal of Jimmy Markum, a gangster whose life is upended when his daughter is murdered — and the investigation rekindles his connection with an old friend (Bacon) who’s grown up to be a police detective and has to face the possibility that the crime was committed by another of their youthful buddies (Tim Robbins). It sounds like the stuff of bullet-riddled melodrama, but few mainstream authors spin literary gold out of pulp as reliably as Lehane, and with Eastwood’s flinty direction providing a solid foundation for his stellar cast, River deserved the praise of critics such as Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of the Atlanta Journal-Constiution, who wrote, “Eastwood has handed Penn the role of a lifetime, and the actor scorches the screen with his anguish and angry vengefulness.”Watch Trailer3. Bad Boys (1983)  89%The word “iconic” is sorely overused, but Penn’s portrayal of the blissfully zonked stoner Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High richly deserves it — and it was followed by a complete 180 in 1983’s Bad Boys, a grim teen drama from director Rick Rosenthal about a petty hood (Penn) whose thirst for bigger scores puts him on a collision course with a rival (Esai Morales) that ultimately lands them both in the same hellish juvenile correctional facility. While plenty of critics took issue with Bad Boys‘ unrelentingly dark tone (and expressed astonishment that it was directed by the same person responsible for Halloween II), most agreed that whatever the movie’s problems, it was substantially elevated by powerful performances from its stable of young actors, most particularly Penn. “Bad Boys misses its chance at greatness, but it’s saying something that this movie had a chance,” mused Roger Ebert. “I have a notion it will stand as one of those benchmark movies that we’ll look back at for the talent it introduced.”Watch Trailer2. Dead Man Walking (1995)  95%Nine times out of 10, when you see a movie poster that focuses on a man and a woman, their characters are romantically involved. Not so 1995’s true events-inspired Dead Man Walking, starring Penn as a death row inmate and Susan Sarandon as Sister Helen Prejean, the real-life nun whose experiences advocating on behalf of a pair of convicted killers inspired her to write the non-fiction book of the same name — and pursue a life of speaking out against the death penalty. It’s harrowing stuff all the way around, ably adapted by writer-director Tim Robbins and achingly brought to life by his cast; both Penn and Sarandon as well as Robbins were nominated for Oscars in their respective categories, and while Sarandon was the only one who won, each of the trio were lauded by critics for their part in what the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson deemed “An intelligent, balanced, devastating movie.”Watch Trailer1. Milk (2008)  93%Actors have earned acclaim for starring roles in biopics often enough that it’s easy to be cynical about the genre as a whole — but it’s just as easy to understand why Penn picked up his second Best Actor Oscar for his work in Milk. Directed by Gus Van Sant from a Dustin Lance Black screenplay, it stars Penn as Harvey Milk, the activist whose promising political career was cut short when he was assassinated by a fellow member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978, and surrounds his wholly committed performance with stellar contributions from a talented stable that also included James Franco, Emile Hirsch, and Josh Brolin as Milk’s killer Dan White. While it wasn’t a massive box office hit, Milk more than made up in plaudits what it lacked in dollar grosses, with more than a few critics singling out Penn for praise in a production with no shortage of brilliance. As Andrew O’Hehir wrote for Salon, “I don’t know that this is Penn’s best performance, overall — let’s have that debate some other time — but as far as the mannered, immersive impersonations of his later career go, Harvey Milk takes the cake.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s a compilation of some of Penn’s best moments as the legendary Spicoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Comedy, Video","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/at-close-range-sean-penn.jpg","slug":"sean-penns-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508966964612","title":"10 Disastrous Disaster Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})10 Disastrous Disaster MoviesWith San Andreas hitting theaters, we look back at some of cinema's most ill-advised catastrophe flicks.by Jeff Giles | May 27, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend’s San Andreas imagines a devastating earthquake that tears a gash of horrific ruin through California — and plops Dwayne Johnson in the middle of the action as a heroic helicopter pilot who must brave statewide chaos in order to find his estranged daughter. It’s a good old-fashioned disaster movie, in other words, and while we’d never doubt the Rock’s ability to kick maximum butt in any cinematic setting, we can’t help but be reminded of the many times other talented folks have tried (and often failed) to thrill audiences with tales of epic mayhem and destruction, which is exactly why we’ve dedicated this week’s list to some of the worst entries in the genre. Head for cover, folks — it’s time for an all-disaster edition of Total Recall!Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979)  0%It arrived seven years after The Poseidon Adventure, but this utterly unnecessary sequel picked up pretty much right where the original left off — and roughly retraced the Poseidon plot in the bargain, too. Starring Michael Caine as a tugboat captain who wants to salvage the shipwreck’s cargo, Sally Field as Caine’s passenger, and Telly Savalas as the leader of a group of Greek sailors who have their own reasons for wanting to board the Poseidon, Beyond the Poseidon Adventure mustered barely a fraction of its predecessor’s box office grosses and none of its critical acclaim, adding up to one of the more bruising late-’70s blows to the sinking career of Irwin Allen, the legendary producer-director known as the “Master of Disaster.” For Roger Ebert, the whole thing was ridiculous, but not ridiculous enough to be any fun. “What did we really, sincerely, expect anyway,” he wondered, “from a movie in which Karl Malden plays a character named ‘Wilbur,’ and Slim Pickens plays a character named ‘Tex?'”Watch TrailerThe Concorde… Airport ’79 (1979)  14%The original Airport helped begin the all-star disaster movie craze in 1970, so it’s perhaps only fitting that the fourth installment in the Airport series, 1979’s The Concorde…Airport ’79, helped heap stale popcorn upon its grave. Featuring franchise mainstay George Kennedy as Captain Joe Petroni — surrounded by a marvelously ’70s ensemble that included Eddie Albert, John Davidson, and Charo — this masterpiece of unintentional hilarity hinges on a plot involving the dastardly efforts of a corrupt arms dealer (Robert Wagner) to ruin the supersonic jet’s goodwill mission. It all ends with an emergency landing on a ski slope in the Alps, but first, any number of ludicrous lines and plot points provoke guffaws, including the infamous moment in which Kennedy’s character fires a flare gun out of the Concorde’s cockpit window. “Until the snowbound finale,” sighed Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “most of the film’s interest lies in watching the actors and wondering what they’re doing here.”Watch TrailerDaylight (1996)  27%Take a car full of diamond thieves speeding away from the cops, put them in a tunnel where a truck just happens to be transporting illegally dumped toxic waste barrels, and you’ve got yourself a disaster that threatens to turn the evening commute into a life-threatening ordeal for dozens of innocent New Yorkers. Fortunately, Sylvester Stallone is on the scene — a former EMT who just happens to be behind the wheel of a cab that just happens to be at the mouth of the tunnel when it collapses. Assorted derring-do ensues, but as far as many critics were concerned, Daylight lacked the relatable characters and taut thrills that might have made it a superior disaster flick — or the campy fun that could have given viewers a few good laughs. “Alas, the movie can’t trim its metaphoric bulk,” lamented Rob Nelson of the Boston Phoenix. “Before long, daylight represents the viewer’s reward for surviving this ordeal.”Watch TrailerEarthquake (1974)  44%San Andreas rattles California in 3D — and 41 years ago, director Mark Robson unleashed Earthquake, which sent the residents of Los Angeles (including Charlton Heston, Ava Gardner, and Richard Roundtree) screaming through the streets in thrilling, booty-rattling Sensurround sound. Although the critical returns weren’t exactly (ahem) earth-shaking, Earthquake racked up roughly $80 million, and it isn’t hard to see why: Provided you can pull it off relatively realistically, there are few things more legitimately horrifying than the earth beneath one’s feet suddenly deciding to stop sitting still. Alas, while the results may have added up to B-movie magic for viewers who just want a little popcorn mayhem, most critics agreed with the Greenwich Village Gazette’s Eric Lurio, who called it “a masterpiece of bad moviemaking.”Watch TrailerThe Happening (2008)  17%It may have fewer scenes of epic destruction (and more Mark Wahlberg) than other entries in the genre, but M. Night Shyamalan’s The Happening is still a disaster movie at heart — only instead of a volcano, tidal wave, meteor, or horrific insect attack threatening to doom humanity, it’s an entire planet full of pissed-off trees. The movie’s Tomatometer can attest to the fact that it wasn’t executed brilliantly, but there’s the germ of a decent idea in The Happening; sadly, like other recent Shyamalan efforts, it fell woefully short of the sum of its parts. “Shyamalan seems to have lost his sense of the fine line between the disturbingly grotesque and the outright ridiculous,” observed Philip Marchand for the Toronto Star. “The film even seems to be a parody of the scientific method.”Watch TrailerHard Rain (1997)  30%Half disaster movie, half heist thriller, and complete waterlogged mess, 1997’s Hard Rain stars Christian Slater (coming off the $150 million Broken Arrow) as an armored car driver stuck in a torrential downpour — and a fight to the death against the violent criminal (Morgan Freeman) who’s willing to do whatever it takes to get his hands on Slater’s multimillion-dollar cargo. In theory, injecting the staid disaster-movie formula with some cops ‘n’ robbers thrills might have made Hard Rain something special, but on the screen, as Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman wearily observed, “The flood rises, the night grows murky, and it becomes clear that the more water there is on screen, the less room there is for anything of interest to happen.”Watch TrailerMeteor (1979)  5%Near the peak of Cold War paranoia, only one thing could have been big enough to unite the U.S. and the Soviet Union: A meteor hurtling toward Earth, condemning capitalists and communists alike to certain doom. That’s the idea behind 1979’s aptly titled Meteor, starring Sean Connery as a U.S. scientist forced to team up with a Soviet counterpart (Brian Keith) in a last-ditch effort to stave off extinction by nuking the bejeezus out of the giant space rock on a collision course with mankind. In spite of its talented cast (which also included Martin Landau and Natalie Wood, as well as Peter Fonda as the President) and a reported $18 million budget, the results are almost uniformly cheesy and inept (although it did earn an Oscar nomination for Best Sound). “See it,” warned Time Out’s Tom Milne, “on peril of death by boredom.”Watch TrailerPoseidon (2006)  33%The original Poseidon Adventure may not be high art, but it does what it sets out to do, and does it exceptionally well. In theory, remaking it for modern audiences should have been as simple as putting an odd assortment of stars on a ship, capsizing the darn thing, and adding a fresh coat of CG special effects — alas, 2006’s Poseidon had little to offer beyond the sight of Kurt Russell and Richard Dreyfuss dog-paddle their way through 99 minutes of PG-13 peril. Calling the result “Titanic without the metaphors, the class-consciousness, the love story, or anything resembling a theme,” the A.V. Club’s Scott Tobias grumbled, “Poseidon invests so little in its screenplay that it might as well be an episode of The Love Boat gone horribly awry.”Watch TrailerThe Swarm (1978)  10%Often pegged by pundits as the beginning of the end for the ’70s disaster epic boom, The Swarm found Irwin Allen bringing to bear his (hitherto quite successful) knack for large-scale cinematic chaos upon Arthur Herzog’s novel about the panicked efforts of a military general (Richard Widmark) and a scientist (Michael Caine) to save the world from a plague of killer bees. It’s kind of a cool idea — who hasn’t worried about getting stung by a ticked-off insect at some point? — but Allen sadly failed to surmount the challenge of making his fuzzy little antagonists seem all that scary. “When Mr. Allen films large numbers of bees from afar, they look like clouds of nutmeg or, sometimes, like peculiarly chunky smog; up close, they suggest a naturalist’s documentary about habits of the hive,” mused Janet Maslin for the New York Times. “[He] might just as well have devoted his talents to man-eating goldfish, poodles on the rampage or carnivorous canaries.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;When Time Ran Out (1980)  0%With 1980’s When Time Ran Out, the Irwin Allen finally unleashed a disaster film big enough to destroy his own career. This ensemble-driven effort, featuring an eclectic assortment of stars that includes Paul Newman and William Holden (reunited after starring together in Allen’s Towering Inferno) as well as Jacqueline Bisset, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Burgess Meredith, and Pat Morita, centers on the molten fury that’s about to be unleashed on a Pacific island resort by a volcano — and while watching that unfold onscreen may sound like great fun, Time doesn’t deliver. Arguably the only portion of the film’s $20 million budget that wasn’t woefully misappropriated was Newman’s salary, which the reluctant star reportedly used to found Newman’s Own. “The eruption, when it finally comes, is a wonderfully cheesy amalgam of wobbly back projection, bathtub tidal wave and scared expressions from the cast,” observed Adrian Turner for Radio Times. “It’s not as hilariously awful as Swarm or Meteor, though, which is a pity.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Office, festivals, service, 93rd, series, awards, Pictures, biography, Adult, 71st, child's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/earthquake.jpg","slug":"10-disastrous-disaster-movies"},{"id":"47508968813967","title":"Will Smith’s 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Will Smith's 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Focus star.by Jeff Giles | February 25, 2015 |  CommentsHe’s been a chart-topping rapper, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and the undisputed king of the July 4 movie blockbuster — and this weekend, Will Smith returns to the big screen alongside Margot Robbie in Focus, so we knew now would be the perfect time to pay tribute to some of the brightest highlights from his blockbuster filmography. You’ll obviously find some of the biggest hit films of the last 15 years in here, but Big Willie Style isn’t always about the big-budget smash hit; his efforts include a few eclectic diversions that may surprise you. Let’s find out how many of your favorites made the cut — it’s time for Total Recall!10. I, Robot (2004)  56%Isaac Asimov’s classic short story collection had a long journey to the screen — and when it finally arrived in 2004, the end result bore little more than a passing resemblance to its literary namesake. It may have disappointed purists, but I, Robot was another in a line of hit summer films for Smith — and although its transformation into a big-budget action thriller may have sacrificed thought-provoking subtext along the way, it was still enough for Nev Pierce of the BBC, who argued, “Whether there’s anything substantial under the sheen and CGI of Alex Proyas’ glistening future vision is debatable, but this enjoyable, engrossing picture is at least intelligently artificial.”Watch Trailer9. Independence Day (1996)  67%After establishing himself as an action star with Bad Boys, Smith kicked off a string of July 4 blockbusters with Independence Day, Roland Emmerich’s 1996 ensemble sci-fi thriller about the worldwide chaos unleashed when an armada of terribly unfriendly aliens stops by Earth for a visit. With a worldwide gross of over $815 million, Independence Day was the biggest hit of the year, and although Smith had a lot of help along the way, his wisecracking heroics were a big part of what inspired critics like Empire’s Angie Errigo to hail it as “a throwback to traditional entertainment with an old-fashioned, gung-ho good time thrilled up by ’90s-style state-of-the-art technology.”Watch Trailer8. Ali (2001)  68%Smith trained for a year to prepare himself for the title role in Michael Mann’s Muhammad Ali biopic, both inside the ring and out, with a workload that included everything from live sparring to Islamic studies and time with a dialect coach. While Ali ultimately packed a somewhat disappointing punch at the box office, where its $87 million gross failed to earn back its budget, all that preparation paid off handsomely for Smith, who walked away with a Best Actor Oscar nomination — as well as glowing reviews from critics like Jay Carr of the Boston Globe, who wrote, “Smith makes contact with enough of Ali’s swagger, sweetness, wit, and pride to convince us that justice is being done to the boxing champion.”Watch Trailer7. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)  67%Otherwise known as the film that proved Will Smith’s cinematic dynasty would eventually extend to his kids, The Pursuit of Happyness used the real-life story of Chris Gardner’s journey from homeless single parent to stockbroker as the basis for an inspirational drama starring Smith alongside his son Jaden, who was all of eight when the movie came out (and stole the picture anyway). It takes a special kind of performance to make audiences believe a multimillionaire box-office king as a desperate dad on the brink of losing everything, and Smith delivered it here; as Tom Meek wrote for the Boston Phoenix, “Smith turns in a career-capping performance, and director Gabriele Muccino ingeniously turns the material inward, cautioning us all to be grateful for what we have, for we’re closer to the edge than we think.”Watch Trailer6. Hitch (2005)  69%Romantic comedies get a pretty bad rap, but when they’re put together with enough sensitivity and skill, the results can be pretty hard to resist. Case in point: 2005’s Hitch, starring Smith as a legendary “date doctor” who’s playing matchmaker for a schlub (Kevin James) and his celebrity crush (Amber Valletta) while wooing a gossip columnist (Eva Mendes) whose latest assignment puts her on an unwitting collision course with Hitch. It’s all familiar stuff, but that was just fine with critics like Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, who wrote, “Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you’d think she has had as many good parts as Smith.”Watch Trailer5. I Am Legend (2007)  68%After languishing in development hell for more than a decade and passing through the hands of a list of stars that included Tom Cruise, Mel Gibson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Matheson’s classic novel finally made its way to the screen for the third time in 2007, with Will Smith starring as Robert Neville, the virologist who just happens to be one of the last healthy people left after a government-engineered vaccine goes awry and turns the human race into vampire-like beings. Although its deviations from the book — particularly in the final act — made the movie something of a blown opportunity as far as some fans were concerned, most critics enjoyed Legend on its own merits, with an appreciative Rex Reed calling it “a grenade that goes off when least expected. It has more horror than heart, but it is never boring.”Watch Trailer4. Enemy of the State (1998)  72%Depending on your ideological leanings, Enemy of the State‘s pre-9/11 warnings of an encroaching government surveillance state are either quaint or chillingly prescient — but either way, this techno-thriller, which united Bruckheimer with director Tony Scott for their fifth film, is a solidly built piece of big-budget entertainment. Starring Will Smith as a lawyer targeted by the NSA, Gene Hackman as the retired spook who helps him evade capture, and Jon Voight as the creepy bureaucrat who will stop at nothing to ensure the passage of a key piece of legislation, State blended good old-fashioned man-on-the-run action with state-of-the-art technology, and scared up a healthy $250 million along the way — as well as praise from critics such as Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, who called it “a thriller straight through to its sleek, millennial-fever heart, an onrushing, giddily paranoiac roller-coaster ride with bad brakes, clever dialogue, and a reach that only occasionally exceeds its grasp.”Watch Trailer3. Where the Day Takes You (1992)  80%As a rapper and an actor, Smith spent the first several years of his career largely in comedy mode — so when he decided to make the jump into film, he chose the decidedly unfunny role of a handicapped, homeless Los Angeles youth in the ensemble drama Where the Day Takes You. Surrounded by a crowd of veteran actors that included Dermot Mulroney, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Kyle MacLachlan, Smith was able to test the dramatic waters without having to carry a movie on his own — and it paid off for critics like Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Maybe the director, Marc Rocco, is good with actors. Or maybe these actors haven’t had this kind of strong material to work with before.”Watch Trailer2. Six Degrees of Separation (1993)  88%The fascinating story of real-life con artist David Hampton formed the basis for Six Degrees of Separation, adapted from the John Guare play about a smooth-talking young man named Paul (Smith) who shows up on the doorstep of a wealthy New York couple (Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing) and convinces them he’s not only friends with their college-age kids, but that he’s the son of Sidney Poitier. Before the night is out, he’s sleeping in their guest room — and before the closing credits roll, the extraordinary truth of Paul’s story is revealed. While far from a blockbuster on par with Smith’s future efforts, Separation earned Channing an Oscar nomination and won praise from critics like About.com’s Fred Topel, who called it “a compelling drama” and “Will Smith’s greatest performance.”Watch Trailer1. Men In Black (1997)  92%The success of The Fugitive catapulted Tommy Lee Jones from “distinguished character actor” to “leading man” status, and after Bad Boys, the mid-to-late 1990s pretty much belonged to Will Smith — so Men in Black wasn’t just your average action/comedy/sci-fi summer blockbuster, it was an Event Movie with almost $590 million in ticket sales (and a pair of sequels) waiting to happen. It didn’t win any awards for storytelling depth (although it did win a Best Makeup Oscar), but its unapologetic popcorn thrills, fueled by Smith and Jones’ easy interplay, entertained a whole lot of people — including Slate’s David Edelstein, who called it “The smartest, funniest, and best-looking sci-fi comedy since the movies learned to morph.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s one of the Fresh Prince’s oddest recordings — a surrealist nightmare called “Then She Bit Me”:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"winner, period, mockumentary, best, Tubi, nature, universal","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/will-smith-i-robot.jpg","slug":"will-smiths-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508968817041","title":"Jeff Bridges’ 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jeff Bridges' 10 Best MoviesWe run down the best-reviewed films of the Seventh Son star.by Jeff Giles | February 4, 2015 |  CommentsNot even a family tree full of dramatic DNA automatically adds up to the kind of talent Jeff Bridges has displayed over the course of his nearly 40-year career. Bridges has gone on to score six Best Actor Oscar nominations (winning one, for 2009’s Crazy Heart), all while assembling one of the more interesting, and critically successful, filmographies in the business. So successful, in fact, that Bridges’ top eight films all boast Tomatometers at or above 90 percent — and although we sort of doubt his work in this weekend’s Seventh Son will match that level of critical love or add another Oscar nomination to the pile, we still thought it offered the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to a life in pictures. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Fearless (1993)  85%Cheating death sounds like an incredible gift — but what do you do after you’ve accepted you’re about to die and walked away from the experience? As Peter Weir’s Fearless powerfully argues, that second lease on life can sometimes be harder to come to grips with than we might imagine — especially if you’re like protagonist Max Klein (Bridges), who survives a plane crash that ends up killing almost everyone on board. The type of thought-provoking adult drama that seems all but extinct in the modern studio system, Fearless didn’t make much of a dent at the box office after its 1993 release, but many critics rightly applauded it as a vehicle for one of its star’s finest efforts. “Bridges turns in another in what has become an astoundingly long list of brilliant performances,” wrote Hal Hinson for the Washington Post. “Using the simplest means imaginable, he steps into a role as nonchalantly as he might slip into his trousers.”Watch Trailer9. The Iceman Cometh (1973)  91%Every Total Recall list has its share of films you know are going to make the cut, but it’s often just as much fun to find the more esoteric entries in an actor’s filmography — the movies that, for whatever reason, slipped through the cracks and aren’t closely identified with the star in question. Case in point: 1973’s The Iceman Cometh, the four-hour film adaptation of Eugene O’Neill’s play that was released as part of the American Film Theater series. Directed by John Frankenheimer and featuring a cast that included Lee Marvin, Fredric March, and Robert Ryan in one of his final performances, Iceman helped Bridges extend his early-career streak of solidly reviewed films with excellent pedigrees. As Roger Ebert wrote, “For four hours we live in these two rooms and discover the secrets of these people, and at the end we have gone deeper, seen more, and will remember more, than with most of the other movies of our life.”Watch Trailer8. Cutter’s Way (1981)  91%Michael Cimino’s Heaven’s Gate spent years being maligned as one of the biggest directorial follies in cinematic history, but some good things did come out of it, at least for Jeff Bridges. He took one of the sets and turned it into his home, for one thing — and United Artists execs impressed with his work in the movie ended up offering him a co-starring gig in Cutter’s Way, too. And while Cutter’s was far from a hit, taking in less than its reported $3 million budget, director Ivan Passer’s adaptation of the Newton Thornburg novel Cutter and Bone — about two pals (Bridges and John Heard) investigating the potential conspiracy behind a young woman’s murder — reaped plenty of critical praise; as Peter Bradshaw from the Guardian wrote, “The film moves with an easy uncoerced swing: moment by moment, scene by scene, we are unsure what to think or where we are going. It is a fascinating, organically grown drama.”Watch Trailer7. Crazy Heart (2009)  90%Bridges won the Best Actor Oscar for his work in Scott Cooper’s Crazy Heart, and rightfully so; in a long line of deeply naturalistic performances, it’d be hard to argue that Bridges’ turn as the bloated, alcoholic misanthrope Bad Blake didn’t deserve a spot at or near the top. You might not think you’d ever be the kind of person who’d root for a middle-aged guy who passes out in his underwear on the bathroom floor, but Bridges made it work here, breathing extra dramatic life into another variation on the oft-told tale of the middle-aged guy who’s piddled away his prospects while delivering believable renditions of some hummable country-rock songs and anchoring a picture whose small, eclectic cast also included Maggie Gyllenhaal and Robert Duvall. “On first viewing, Crazy Heart seemed like a pretty good movie with one great performance,” mused Slate’s Dana Stevens. “After a second time through, it’s sneaking up on the title of my favorite film of the year.”Watch Trailer6. Bad Company (1972)  92%Director Robert Benton has made a career out of crafting films that make brilliant use of quiet moments and seemingly ordinary people — and, sometimes, some pretty unusual situations. He showed his flair for character studies with his debut, 1972’s Bad Company, which focuses on the efforts of a group of young men (including Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges) to avoid being drafted into the Civil War. One of a handful of counter-culture Westerns during the period, Company carefully deconstructed the romantic myths of the genre while underlining its gently comedic tone with a surprisingly moral message of social responsibility. Roger Greenspun of the New York Times was one of the many scribes who applauded the film, writing, “A naturalistic, irreverent and sometimes broadly comic view of a largely ignored aspect of the Civil War gives Bad Company a refreshingly good name.”Watch Trailer5. Iron Man (2008)  94%He hasn’t been asked to do it many times, but Jeff Bridges plays a mean bad guy (check out his wonderfully creepy turn in 1993’s otherwise rather mundane The Vanishing for a good, albeit mostly wasted, example). He got to show his villainous colors again in 2008’s Iron Man, shaving his head and growing a wicked beard to play Obadiah Stane, the treacherous business partner-turned-armored nemesis of Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Though Stane fell below “awesome fight scenes,” “shots of the armor in action,” and “funny one-liners from Downey” on the list of things people went to Iron Man to see, you can’t have a truly entertaining superhero movie without a worthwhile heavy, and Bridges sunk his teeth into the scenery with appropriately menacing results. In the words of the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, “The gadgetry is absolutely dazzling, the action is mostly exhilarating, the comedy is scintillating and the whole enormous enterprise throbs with dramatic energy.”Watch Trailer4. The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989)  96%We like to complain about the lack of original ideas in Hollywood, but The Fabulous Baker Boys is proof positive that you don’t need to do something new to make a great movie — you just need to do something really, really well. And Baker Boys does a few things well, actually — including exploring the tension between a pair of piano-playing brothers (played by real-life siblings Jeff and Beau Bridges), the fading hopes of musicians resigned to pursuing commerce instead of art, and — perhaps most importantly — highlighting the luminous beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer. It wasn’t a huge commercial hit at the time of its release, but it was profitable, and the overwhelmingly positive critical reaction has since been shared by the many millions who have seen it at home. “The Fabulous Baker Boys is like a beloved movie from the glory days of Hollywood,” wrote Rita Kempley of the Washington Post. “It transports you. It’s an American rhapsody.”Watch Trailer3. True Grit (2010)  95%It takes some major stones to step into John Wayne’s boots for a remake of one of the Duke’s classic pictures, so even if the Coen brothers’ True Grit had well and truly stunk, we’d have to give Bridges credit for having something extra in his saddlebag — not just any actor would have been able to take the role of the cantankerous Rooster Cogburn and make it his own. Of course, it didn’t hurt that Bridges (in vintage late-period marble-mouthed form) was surrounded by an ace supporting cast that included Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld, or that the Coens went back to Charles Portis’ original novel for inspiration; in the end, the result was a career-launching hit for Steinfeld, a mainstream hit for the Coens, and a suitably successful follow-up to Crazy Heart for Bridges, who earned the admiration of the Patriot Ledger’s Al Alexander in a review that argued, “Duke has been usurped by the Dude, and I couldn’t be more thrilled by the experience of watching one of our finest actors take a role as iconic as Rooster Cogburn and indisputably make it his own.”Watch Trailer2. Fat City (1972)  100%Long before he’d earned the right to play grizzled, down-on-their-luck ne’er-do-wells, Bridges paid his dues playing the young men who look up to them — as he did in John Huston’s Fat City, a beautifully unadorned look at a washed-up boxer (Stacy Keach) who takes a young contender (Bridges) under his wing. A babyfaced 23 years old and only one film removed from The Last Picture Show, Bridges displayed an uncommon grace and calm grasp of his craft in his scenes with Keach, and Huston — who ended the movie on the sort of unsettling note we see far too rarely today — made the most of Bridges’ emerging gifts. “The movie is crafty work and very much a show,” wrote J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, adding, “in one way or another, right down to the percussively abrupt open ending, it’s all about being hammered.”Watch Trailer1. The Last Picture Show (1971)  100%If you love movies, you’ve probably seen The Last Picture Show — and even if you haven’t, you’re almost certainly aware of its impact. Selected to the National Film Registry, named to the AFI’s list of the 100 greatest American films of all time, and the recipient of eight Academy Award nominations (Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both took home Oscars for their supporting roles), Picture Show launched the careers of Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, and director Peter Bogdanovich, whose previous credit was Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women. Here, Bridges’ youth and easygoing charm are put to good use in the role of Duane Jackson, a high school football star whose restlessness sends him in and out of Shepherd’s bed — and, like many young men of the ’50s, off to Korea. “Ultimately,” observed James Kendrick of the Q Network Film Desk, “The Last Picture Show is remembered and probably always will be because it is truthful. It doesn’t shy away from the inherent awkwardness of life, but instead embraces it as its subject matter.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s Bridges in a recent ad you may have seen, helping good folks get their well-deserved rest:&nbsp;Click here for Jeff Bridges’ complete filmographyRead more Total Recall.&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"2016, independent, Emmys, lee, Universal, Chernobyl, transformers, asian-american, Prime, Diego, Peek, Crackle, curtis, Marvel, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jeff-Bridges.jpg","slug":"jeff-bridges-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508966942082","title":"12 Comedy Sequels Nobody Asked For","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})12 Comedy Sequels Nobody Asked ForIn this week's Total Recall, we look at some of the most unfunny sequels ever made.by Jeff Giles | June 24, 2015 |  CommentsLet’s get this out of the way right up front: We wish only the best for Ted 2, and hope it turns out to be one of the year’s funniest comedies while making plenty of money for everyone who worked on it. But we also know that the track record for comedy sequels isn’t terribly encouraging, and while waiting for Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg to return for another round of R-rated hijinks between a man-child and his talking stuffed bear, our thoughts turned inexorably to the many times when the sequels kept coming long after the laughs stopped. If comedy equals tragedy plus time, then perhaps the movies featured in this week’s list are still waiting for their moment — or maybe they’re just bad. Either way, it’s time for Total Recall!Mannequin Two: On the Move (1991)  13%How, pray tell, does one go about putting together a sequel to the 1987 hit Mannequin without the raw sexual magnetism between Kim Cattrall and Andrew McCarthy, or the wan unctuousness of James Spader? The sensible answer is “one does not,” but the folks behind Mannequin Two: On the Move had other ideas — mainly consisting of re-enlisting flamboyant Mannequin second banana Meshach Taylor to reprise his role as mincing window dresser Hollywood Montrose for a follow-up with different stars (William Ragsdale and Kristy Swanson, trying in vain to duplicate Cattrall and McCarthy’s unforgettable chemistry) but the same basic plot. Chiefly of interest for fans of prolific character actor Terry Kiser, who used his downtime between Weekend at Bernie’s movies to work in his appearance as Mannequin Two villain Count Gunther Spretzle, this is a sequel so bereft of ideas that it even recycles the original’s theme song, the Starship hit “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.” As Variety wearily observed, “It took four writers to struggle with another idea of why a mannequin would come to life in a department store and what would happen if she did.”Watch TrailerWeekend at Bernie’s II (1993)  10%Is the original Weekend at Bernie’s a comedy classic? Assuredly not, but there are still plenty of chortles to be wrung from the sight of a couple of corporate drones panicking their way through a scheme that involves using the body of their recently deceased boss as a comically ineffective prop, and we would be lying if we said we’d turn it off if we happened upon that first Weekend while scrolling through channels. It most certainly did not, however, need a sequel — and yet theatrical grosses dictated that stars Jonathan Silverman, Andrew McCarthy, and Terry Kiser (as Bernie) reunite for a humiliatingly absurd caper involving a voodoo ritual gone awry and millions in stolen cash. “Frankly,” opined Scott Weinberg for eFilmCritic, “I’m stunned that every American who paid to see it didn’t file a class action suit against Tri-Star Pictures for their blatant misrepresentation of the word ‘comedy.'”Watch TrailerDeuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (2005)  9%It would take a profoundly silly person to argue that Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo was at all deserving of a sequel on qualitative grounds, but Rob Schneider’s comedy pulled in nearly $100 million at the box office, so a sequel was bound to happen — and it did in 2005, when fans of putative comedies about male sex escorts were treated to Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, which sent Schneider to… oh, we don’t need to talk about the storyline, do we? The only thing that really matters about this movie is what it triggered offscreen: the infamous dustup between Schneider and Roger Ebert, who lambasted it in his review (“Aggressively bad, as if it wants to cause suffering to the audience”) and later distilled his thoughts regarding European Gigolo to a simple message he relayed directly to Schneider: “Your movie sucks.” The two later had a moving reconciliation during Ebert’s last days, setting an example that almost (but not quite) justifies spending an hour and 28 minutes of one’s life to watch the film.Watch TrailerRevenge of the Nerds 2: Nerds in Paradise (1987)  7%It’s difficult to watch the original Revenge of the Nerds today without cringing at some of the embarrassing stereotypes and rampant misogyny that passed for comedy at the time, but there were a few kernels of legitimately forward-thinking ideas embedded in all the lewd gags, and in some respects, it can be argued that the first Nerds was a movie slightly ahead of its time. No such arguments have ever been made on behalf of Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise, in which our gentle-hearted (and yet oh so horny) heroes descend upon Fort Lauderdale for some old-fashioned spring break debauchery — and once again find themselves forced to contend with persecution from their beefy jock nemeses. With twice the jiggle and half the reason for actually existing, Nerds in Paradise needed to worry less about musclebound frat boys than it did about critics: Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer summed up the nigh-universal scorn of her colleagues when she sneered, “By all evidence, to make Nerds II, it took over 1,000 people with an aggregate IQ of under 1.”Watch TrailerTeen Wolf Too (1987)  7%Jason Bateman is an immensely likable performer with sharp comedic timing and a gift for playing the straight man, but he’s also had some pretty rough luck when it comes to picking film scripts, and that snakebitten streak extends all the way back to his big-screen debut. The original Teen Wolf barely got by on Michael J. Fox’s fresh-faced charm and an eager enthusiasm for low-budget B-movie tropes (not to mention Mark Safan’s “Win in the End,” an unsung ’80s teen movie sports montage soundtrack classic), but not even Fox’s refusal to return for more kept the studio from commissioning a sequel in which his character’s cousin (played by Bateman) heads off to college and discovers that he too is burdened with the family curse. While producers may have thought they were recapturing lightning in a bottle by tapping another young TV sitcom star — and Bateman may have made for a more imposing teen werewolf than the diminutive Fox — none of it mattered in the face of a screenplay that barely bothered pretending to go through the motions. “The pacing is near-cataleptic and the movie’s intended comic highlight is a frog-fight in the biology lab,” fumed Michael Wilmington for the Los Angeles Times. “Isn’t that just what you’re dying to see and hear? Bad dialogue, lugubriously paced; awful jokes about werewolves, and guffawing actors churlishly hurling around a lot of little frogs?”Watch TrailerPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 (2015)  5%If you’re somehow able to finance and film one movie about a Segway-riding mall cop with a main gag that revolves around the fact that his last name rhymes with “fart,” you might as well make another one, right? Hence Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, in which Kevin James returns to ride his motorized scooter of justice — and in the time-honored sequel tradition, finds himself in a new location (Las Vegas) and in the middle of even more high-stakes action (a hotel heist involving the theft of some priceless art). It all added up to another $100 million-plus outing for the increasingly pratfall-dependent James, whose brightest moments in Mall Cop 2 included fighting an ostrich and punching an elderly woman in the stomach — none of which were enough to distract critics from delivering a swift and vicious pummeling for the film that Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News referred to as “the cinematic equivalent of biting into an old brown banana.”Watch TrailerMajor League II (1994)  5%In theory, a sequel to 1989’s Major League wasn’t necessarily such a bad idea. The first movie made a pile of money, it had a solid cast (most of whom were willing to return for a follow-up), and the seasonal nature of baseball meant it would be relatively easy — and narratively feasible — to bring the gang back together for another round of yuks. Add in the fact that director/co-writer David S. Ward (who doggedly pitched the original for years before it was released) was returning, and Major League II should have been (ahem) a home run. But even with all that going for it, this belated sequel — which opened five years later but picked up the season after Major League — just didn’t have the same zip as the original, and based on the box office, audiences no longer really cared whether Rick “Wild Thing” Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) and his motley crew of teammates had what it took to send the Cleveland Indians to the World Series. Sighed Caryn James for the New York Times, “There has rarely been such a steep and strange decline between a movie and its sequel as the one between the fast, silly original and the dismal, boring Major League II.”Watch TrailerCaddyshack II (1988)  4%Caddyshack is a comedy classic that virtually hums with the madcap energy thrown off by director Harold Ramis and his incredible cast, a marvelously motley bunch that included Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Bill Murray, and Chevy Chase. Naturally, the sequel brought back virtually no one who’d been involved the first time around, limiting the classic Caddyshack vibes to a supporting appearance from Chase and a new song from Kenny Loggins on the soundtrack. This might not have been such a bad thing if these crucial absences had been filled by the right people or a suitably funny storyline, but director Allan Arkush was presented with a cobbled-together script that virtually reprised the original and asked Harvey Mason to serve as a Dangerfield facsimile with Robert Stack as Knight’s proxy. Audiences saw through the flimsy carbon copy and so did critics; the result was, as Steven Rea wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, “a sight not to behold.”Watch TrailerThe Whole Ten Yards (2003)  4%Just because a movie makes a bunch of money doesn’t mean it needs a sequel. Case in point: The Whole Ten Yards, the 2004 travesty that reunited the cast of the 2000 hit The Whole Nine Yards simply because the studio seemed to take the first film’s box office receipts as some sort of mandate. Once again, Matthew Perry (as nebbishy dentist Nicholas “Oz” Ozeransky) and Bruce Willis (as retired hitman Jimmy “The Tulip” Tudeski) find themselves in hot water with vengeful mob boss Laszlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), and the sequel’s retreaded plot — as well as a marked decrease in the original’s laughs-per-minute quotient — left critics openly questioning why anyone would bother. “So mirthless is this misbegotten enterprise,” grumbled Peter Howell for the Toronto Star, “the sound of fake chucklers busting a gut would at least have given us valuable clues as to when we’re supposed to laugh.”Watch TrailerPolice Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987)  0%If film franchises were professional sports teams, the Police Academy movies would hover somewhere near the 2011-’12 Charlotte Bobcats in the standings, with Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol representing the most painfully lopsided defeat in a long stretch of stunning futility. All of which is to say that critics loathed each of the Academy films in their own special way, and no fewer than four of the seven installments in the series boast a 0 percent Tomatometer rating, but with 20 uniformly negative reviews, it’s 1987’s Citizens on Patrol that represents the jewel in the franchise’s crown of failure. We could go into plot, but it’s a Police Academy movie, and the plot’s all laid out in the title; really, all you need to know is that there’s definitely something better to watch. As Dave Kehr pointed out in his review for the Chicago Reader, “Jim Drake is credited with the direction and Gene Quintano with the script, though they’d probably appreciate it if you kept it to yourself.”Watch TrailerLook Who’s Talking Now (1993)  0%Look Who’s Talking was a pleasantly undemanding comedy that reminded audiences they still liked John Travolta and featured some funny voicework from Bruce Willis as the inner monologue of a baby. Three years later, Look Who’s Talking Too tried to double down on the toddler-driven laughs by adding Roseanne Barr as the voice of Willis’ sister, but that gambit proved woefully unsuccessful — so three years after that, we got Look Who’s Talking Now, in which the kids are old enough to speak with their own voices… and old enough to have pets who, you guessed it, the audience can hear speak. As concepts go, it’s pretty thin, but Now still might have benefited from the talents of its new voice cast if someone had written a worthy script; alas, Danny DeVito (as a streetwise mutt named Rocks) and Diane Keaton (as Daphne the purebred poodle) were left to try and wring a few laughs out of a premise long past its prime while the human stars of the series, John Travolta and Kirstie Alley, bore the onscreen brunt of a series of humiliations that included Alley dressing up as an elf. “The first film had maybe a shred of realism to flavor its romantic comedy,” lamented Roger Ebert. “This one looks like it was chucked up by an automatic screenwriting machine.”Watch TrailerSuperbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 (2004)  0%Jon Voight is a very famous, highly respected actor, but he also has bills to pay, which may explain how he ended up alongside Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel playing second fiddle to a diaper-clad quartet in Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2. Then again, if you take Voight at his word, he chose the project because “When you look around the world, everybody’s really in a fearful state in some way, and kids are getting that, they’re getting that fear, and they need to be given a kind of empowerment in some sense” — but no, you know what? We prefer the “bills to pay” explanation. Either way, this alleged action comedy about an evil media mogul who’s out to kidnap four freakishly smart toddlers has gone down as one of the more shockingly awful stinkers to seep out of Hollywood in recent memory — as well as, sadly, the final effort from Porky’s director Bob Clark. “The first Baby Geniuses, released in 1999, was one of the most inane, humorless, ill-conceived, poorly acted comedies of the year,” wrote Jean Oppenheimer for the New Times. “As difficult as it is to imagine, the sequel is even worse.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Con, It, Dates","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/superbabies.jpg","slug":"12-comedy-sequels-nobody-asked-for"},{"id":"47508969969057","title":"The 15 Most Eccentric TV Detectives","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 15 Most Eccentric TV DetectivesIn this week's Total Recall, we look at some of the most quirky and unique small-screen sleuths.by RT Staff | September 18, 2014 |  CommentsIt’s hard to stand out on a crowded programming dial, and that’s probably always been especially true for the stars of crime procedurals; often, making one’s mark isn’t as easy as simply lowering one’s shades while Roger Daltrey screams on the soundtrack. In order to rise above the fray, detective shows sometimes resort to adding the odd wrinkle or two in order to get our attention — and although this tactic isn’t always successful, sometimes it really, really works. In honor of all those offbeat gumshoes, this week, we’re devoting Total Recall to an appreciative look back at some of the quirkiest crime-solvers in TV history. Join us, won’t you?Andy Barker – Andy Barker P.I.Here’s TV’s biggest detective quirk: It’s a hard, dangerous occupation, dominated by grueling hours in which nothing seems to happen, but showrunners seem to think it’s the type of career that any old fool can bumble their way into without getting his or her head blown off. Not that we’re complaining, mind you — especially when the results are as gleefully absurd as Andy Barker, P.I., the lamentably short-lived comedy starring Andy Richter as a mild-mannered accountant who finds himself dragged into a life of crimefighting after renting some new office space in the spot where a since-retired private dick once plied his trade. Only six episodes were made, but with a supporting cast that included Arrested Development‘s Tony Hale, a roster of guest stars that made room for Ed Asner, and Richter playing a sweet-tempered naïf as only he can, Barker could have — and should have — run for far longer.Barnaby and Betty Jones – Barnaby JonesAlthough Betty (Lee Meriweather) was the quirkier of the two Joneses, having backed into the family P.I. business after her brother was murdered, her dad Barnaby (Buddy Ebsen) was no stranger to quirk himself — he was in his 60s when he came out of retirement to find his son’s killer, for one thing, and for another, he was a milk-sipping judo enthusiast rather than a raging alcoholic like most of his peers. Over eight entertaining seasons, Barnaby and Betty developed into quite the crimefighting duo, eventually taking on J.R. (Mark Shera), the son of Barnaby’s cousin — who also, per the Jones family’s rotten luck, made his way into detecting via an urgent need to figure out who murdered his dad. Ebsen essentially retired along with Barnaby when the show was canceled in 1980, but he played the character one more time in 1993, bringing him to the big screen for the Beverly Hillbillies movie.Lieutenant Frank Columbo – ColumboRumpled in approach as well as appearance, Columbo (played by Peter Falk for the bulk of the character’s run) has to rank as one of the least assuming — and yet brilliantly effective — detectives in TV history. Over 10 seasons and 69 episodes, our seemingly absent-minded hero dispensed justice in distinctively amiable fashion, frequently deluding his suspects into believing his absent-minded demeanor was a sign of incompetence rather than an effective front for a laconic (yet dogged) method of case-cracking. No matter how many times Columbo’s goose appeared to be cooked, he always managed to spend the last few minutes of the show patiently explaining how he’d snared another bad guy — and oh yeah, he managed to make wrinkled raincoats cool, too.Francis “Frank” Dowling – Father Dowling MysteriesFew actors have a less detective-like appearance than Tom Bosley in a priest’s collar, which is what made Father Dowling Mysteries such a delightful burst of cracked TV genius during the show’s three-season run between 1989-’91 (with a 1987 movie-of-the-week essentially serving as the pilot). Aided by a tough-as-nails nun nicknamed Steve (played by Tracy Nelson), our Father spent just as much time putting Chicago crooks behind bars as he did tending to his parish — in spite of periodic appearances by his ne’er-do-well twin brother Blaine, who was often just as much of an inconvenience as the fact that the 10 o’clock Mass tended to take place just as Dowling was about to nail a perp.Jonathan and Jennifer Hart – Hart to HartIt seems a little hard to believe in these days of class warfare and one-percenters, but in the ’80s, there was actually a hit series about a couple of bored rich people (played to smooth, banter-driven perfection by Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers) who decided to pass their idle hours by (ahem) moonlighting as amateur detectives. Utterly ludicrous? Perhaps. But thanks to Wagner and Powers’ strong chemistry and impossible good looks, the show served as a reliably guilty pleasure for five seasons. Wagner and Powers even reunited in the ’90s for a series of TV movies with titles like Home Is Where the Hart Is, Crimes of the Hart, and Till Death Do Us Hart.Theodore Kojak – KojakSome policemen are bald. Some are snappy dressers. But throughout the long and colorful history of TV’s many detectives, there’s only been one bald, nattily attired, lollipop-gobbling lawman, and that’s Theodore “Theo” Kojak. Played to perfection by Telly Savalas during the top-rated five-season run on the CBS series that bore his name, Kojak got to the middle of countless cases and an even greater number of Tootsie Roll Pops, all while cheerfully dispensing his signature line: “Who loves ya, baby?” Low ratings put an end to the original series in 1978, but affection for Kojak remained — Savalas reprised the role for a series of TV movies between 1985 and 1990. His 1994 death seemed to put an end to the franchise for good, but in 2005, The USA Network tried bringing the character back with a reboot starring Ving Rhames; it just wasn’t the same, however, and after nine episodes, the new-look Kojak had been consigned to the TV graveyard.Thomas Sullivan Magnum IV – Magnum, P.I.Detective work isn’t traditionally known as a path to riches, and many of our favorite TV snoops live in fairly dire straits. One notable exception: Thomas Sullivan Magnum IV, the lushly mustached focus of the eight-season CBS smash Magnum, P.I. Rather than being forced to gumshoe for a living, Magnum (played by Tom Selleck) spends his days idly loafing about a former client’s palatial Hawaii estate, where he’s been invited to live in the guest house free of charge while engaging in barbed witticisms with Higgins (John Hillerman), the stuffy, Doberman-wielding British Army vet with whom he shares the grounds. Although he could have whiled his life away sipping German beer in Hawaiian shirts, Magnum kept detecting — and despite his amicable beach bum’s demeanor, he took the work seriously enough to build a pretty impressive case file over the show’s 162-episode run.Allison DuBois – MediumMedium creator Glenn Gordon Caron knows a thing or two about quirky detectives — he was the guy behind Moonlighting as well as a writer and producer on Remington Steele — but he didn’t have to invent a central character for this seven-season hit, which served the bulk of its tenure for NBC before finishing out its run on CBS. Instead, he turned to Allison DuBois for inspiration, using her claims of having served as a real-life psychic consultant for various law enforcement agencies as the inspiration for a weekly drama about a crime-solving medium named Allison DuBois (played by Patricia Arquette). Beset on both sides by police who doubt her gifts and a husband who occasionally suspects she might be a little bit crazy, poor Allison had enough drama to deal with at home without being forced to contend with evildoers and other assorted complications, but it made for some awfully compelling television — as well as one of the more bittersweet series finales on our list.Adrian Monk – MonkThis do-gooding bundle of neuroses is probably the first character who comes to mind when you say “quirky TV detective” to viewers of a more recent vintage, and for good reason: As portrayed by the inestimably talented Tony Shalhoub, the OCD-and-phobia-plagued Adrian Monk personifies the very best of off-kilter crime-solving. Shalhoub has played plenty of roles in his day, and Monk ended its eight-season USA Network run in 2009, but this will probably be the character he’ll always be most closely associated with, and for good reason: until The Walking Dead lurched onto the dial in 2012, Monk‘s series finale was the most-watched episode of any scripted drama in the history of cable television.Maddie Hayes and David Addison – MoonlightingPerhaps they weren’t quirky as much as they were essentially incompetent, but the squabbling duo whose will-they-or-won’t-they relationship drove Moonlighting — and entranced viewers during the ABC show’s first few hit seasons — were definitely a colorful pair, united more through wild twists of fate (she was a model who lost her fortune to a shady accountant; he was a fast-talking shyster clinging to an easy meal ticket) than any real passion for case-solving. That said, they certainly managed to solve their share of mysteries when they weren’t making up or breaking up — although that darn Anselmo case always remained frustratingly out of reach.Jessica Fletcher – Murder, She WroteThat prim pensioner clacking away on her typewriter might seem harmless enough, but don’t be fooled: she’s still sharp enough to unearth those dark deeds you’re hiding and have you sent to the slammer. As the mystery-writing (and solving) Jessica Fletcher, Angela Lansbury did it time and time again over the course of Murder, She Wrote‘s impressive 12-season run — although not even Fletcher’s legendary sleuthing was enough to solve the case of who at the network thought it was a bright idea to move the show from its traditional Sunday slot and feed it to the lions on Thursdays at 8 for its final season. Still, not even cancellation was enough to get rid of Murder: Lansbury returned to star in four TV movies, with the first airing in in 1997 and sequels following in 2000, 2001, and 2003. She’s stated in recent years that she’d be open to coming back for more — and judging from the scornful outcry that erupted when NBC tried rebooting the show with Octavia Spencer in the lead, her audience is still open to the possibility.Shawn Spencer – PsychYou could make the argument that Psych‘s Shawn Spencer is more of a sociopathic liar than a genuinely quirky guy — after all, this is someone who lies about being psychic in order to avoid jail time and ends up taking a gig as an allegedly paranormally attuned “consultant” for the local police force — but it takes chutzpah to pull that kind of hoodwinking over on the law, and if a surfeit of moxie can be seen as a quirk, then Spencer surely fits the bill. Psych certainly hit the spot for viewers: Like its USA Network companion Monk, it was a solid hit for eight seasons.Laura Holt – Remington SteeleShe may have been the best detective in town, but in the ’80s, Laura Holt (Stephanie Zimbalist) couldn’t get a gig — so to circumvent rampant sexism, she invented a “boss” named Remington Steele and, in the series pilot, hired an unnamed con man (played to suave perfection by Pierce Brosnan) to assume Steele’s fictitious identity. With two beautiful stars, smart storylines that delivered a groundbreaking blend of mystery, romance, comedy, and drama, and a classic Henry Mancini theme song, Remington Steele regularly offered one of the better hours of television during its five seasons on the NBC schedule; unfortunately, audiences didn’t always turn out in the numbers that the network would have liked, and it was canceled after Season Four — only to be unexpectedly brought back when NBC brass were swayed by a grassroots fan campaign (which unfortunately cost Brosnan an early shot at the role of James Bond, forcing him to wait until the ’90s to don 007’s tux).Sledge Hammer – Sledge Hammer!One year after he scored a supporting role in arguably the most over-the-top cop movie of the ’80s (Sylvester Stallone’s Cobra), David Rasche took the lead in ABC’s Sledge Hammer!, an enthusiastically absurd sitcom that took the decade’s burgeoning pile of steely-eyed action tropes and lampooned them to the hilt. Not surprisingly, audiences were largely unsure of what to do with a show that had a laugh track and a central character who had a passionate relationship with his revolver, and Sledge Hammer! was never a big ratings winner — to the point that the first season ended with a nuclear explosion that presumably killed all the characters, only to pick up “five years earlier” the following season, despite the multiple continuity errors that caused. As Sledge would have said: Trust him, he knows what he’s doing.Rustin Cohle – True DetectiveQuirks don’t develop in a vacuum, and the next time you find yourself wanting to make fun of someone showing signs of odd behavior, you might want to consider the tragic tale of Rustin Cohle, the True Detective character (played by Matthew McConaughey) whose meticulous approach to the tireless pursuit of criminal justice has led to an ascetic life largely devoid of possessions or pleasures — with the notable exceptions of the bulging ledger file that earns him his derisive nickname of “Tax Man” and the drinking problem that threatens to drag him under. Unlike most of the detectives on this list, Cohle’s quirk isn’t played for laughs, but it’s no less enthralling in its seriousness; whoever steps into the McConaughey-shaped void in True Detective‘s second season will have an awfully heavy badge to carry.target=”_blank”&gt;Check out the latest TV reviews, news, interviews, andphotos.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Red, singing, theme, based, marvel, scorecard","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kojak1.jpg","slug":"the-15-most-eccentric-tv-detectives"},{"id":"47508968831384","title":"The 10 Worst Christmas Day Releases of the Past 30 Years","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The 10 Worst Christmas Day Releases of the Past 30 YearsIn this week's Total Recall, we look at biggest critical failures that opened on December 25.by Jeff Giles | December 23, 2014 |  CommentsHeading to the cineplex has grown into a Christmas Day tradition over the years, encouraged by a rising tide of December 25 releases that includes some of the more critically acclaimed films of the last few decades — as well as some of the most infamous stinkers. In honor of the latter tradition, we’ve sorted through 30 years of Hollywood’s Christmas gifts to filmgoers, and arranged a list of the releases that were pelted with the biggest lumps of critical coal. Can’t make it to the theater this week? Here are 10 times when staying home for the holidays turned out to be a pretty good idea.10. Cheaper by the Dozen (2003)  24%Few would argue that Steve Martin is a dramatic and comedic actor without peer; unfortunately, by the mid-’90s, his gift for choosing scripts seemed to have abandoned him all but entirely, leading to a rather abysmal run of releases that stretched from 1992’s Housesitter into the 21st century, only periodically broken up by sporadic roles in rewarding reminders like The Spanish Prisoner and Bowfinger. Among the worst of Martin’s late-period offenders is 2003’s Cheaper by the Dozen, a slapstick-heavy comedy that takes its loose concept and title — and little else — from the bestselling nonfiction book (and hit 1950 film) inspired by the lives of a New Jersey family with a dozen offspring. Arriving on Christmas Day of 2003, the Martin-led Cheaper wrangled an unlikely-seeming cast (including Bonnie Hunt, Piper Perabo, Hilary Duff, and Ashton Kutcher) around a plot that seemed to exist for no other reason than to string together a series of thuddingly unfunny (and occasionally crude) pratfalls; not surprisingly, although enough ticket buyers showed up to generate a 2005 sequel (which, it should be noted, received even worse reviews), critics were almost uniformly unimpressed. “It’s not that Cheaper by the Dozen is awful,” bemoaned the Apollo Guide’s Brian Webster. “Worse than that, it’s just plain dull.”Watch Trailer9. Patch Adams (1998)  22%Given the right script, Robin Williams was capable of melding humor and genuine pathos as well as anyone — and on its face, a movie based on the real-life story of Hunter “Patch” Adams, a doctor whose youthful struggles with suicidal depression helped inform a groundbreaking medical career highlighting the therapeutic value of humor, seemed like the perfect vehicle for Williams’ singular gifts. There’s a thin line between inspirational and mawkish, however, and it’s one that screenwriter Steve Oedekerk and director Tom Shadyac stomped all over while making the 1998 Christmas Day drama Patch Adams. Wholeheartedly indulging the heartstrings-tugging nature of Adams’ story without taking sufficient care to create three-dimensional characters or build genuine narrative stakes, Patch quickly soured critics and dimmed some of the buzz Williams had built with his Oscar-winning work in Good Will Hunting. “Williams pulls out all the stops in a lead role that gives him carte blanche to careen between extremes of silliness and sentimentality,” observed Variety’s Joe Leydon. “He tries too hard, too obviously, much like the pic itself.”Watch Trailer8. Gulliver’s Travels (2010)  20%On paper, a Jack Black-led Gulliver’s Travels looks like a potentially great idea. The original story seems uniquely well-suited to a big-budget update fueled by slick modern special effects, and as we’ve seen in Tenacious D and School of Rock, Black’s very good at going from arrogant and oafish to eminently likable — sometimes within the same scene. Precious little of that promise, however, made it to the screen in the 2010 edition of Travels, directed by Rob Letterman and co-written by Nick Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Joe Stillman (Shrek); instead, viewers were bombarded with crude, unfunny slapstick, strung together with CG graphics and set to the strains of one of Black?s most grating performances. “I will tell you there’s a cast credit for a character described only as ‘Butt-crack man,'” grumbled the Washington Post’s Michael O’Sullivan. “Consider yourself warned.”Watch Trailer7. Black Christmas (2006)  16%It’s never going to be mentioned in the same breath as, say, Citizen Kane, but the original Black Christmas, released in 1974 and starring Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder, is arguably the first slasher flick — and a pretty good one at that. Minus that groundbreaking spirit and talented cast, there wasn’t really any reason to remake it; unfortunately, that didn’t stop director Glen Morgan from taking a (cough) stab at it with his updated take on the story, released in 2006. The results were predictably brutal and lacking in transgressive wit — and were soundly thrashed by critics like Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, who didn’t mince words in a review reading in part, “Creativity is a stranger to this sick excuse for entertainment, which pounds a ridiculous back story into a butchered rehash that includes incest, cannibalism, eyeball gouging and impossibly dumb plot contrivances.”Watch Trailer6. 47 Ronin (2013)  16%Keanu Reeves with a samurai sword — in 3D! What could go wrong? Pretty much everything, according to critics who screened 47 Ronin prior to its wide release on December 25, 2013. Helmed by debuting commercial director Carl Rinsch, Ronin attempted to make a blockbuster out of the real-life story of 18th-century Japanese samurai who avenged their dead master’s honor — knowingly condemning themselves to death in the process — but succeeded only in serving up yet another in the seemingly endless line of big-budget critical punching bags in Reeves’ post-Matrix filmography. Calling the result “Solemn as a funeral march, humorless as your junior high principal, as Japanese as a grocery-store California roll,” the Village Voice’s Alan Scherstuhl dismissed the picture as “Keanu Reeves’s let’s-mope-about-and-kill-ourselves samurai drama.”Watch Trailer5. The Spirit (2008)  14%Will Eisner’s The Spirit is one of the more distinctive and beloved characters in comics history, a masked vigilante whose adventures served as a springboard for a series of stories — mostly published between 1940-’52 — that used an expansive noir-inspired backdrop incorporating a wide variety of elements, including horror and comedy. Sadly, little of what made the Spirit special translated to the big-screen adaptation helmed by Frank Miller in 2008; deliberately cartoonish and devoid of Eisner’s gift for narrative or ear for dialogue, it proved equally inept either as a tribute to the comic or as a bid for a modern-day continuation of the franchise. “Miller’s directing chops, er, chop, is non-existent, offering up a muck of amateurish posturing, weak storyline and tedious characters,” sighed Kimberly Gadette for Indie Movies Online. “As for the title? Ouch, that’s some irony.”Watch Trailer4. Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)  12%Pitting the slavering stars of the Alien and Predator franchises against one another for a sci-fi action thriller battle royale is a pretty cool idea — just ask the publishers behind the sprawling array of comics, novels, and video games that have run wild with the concept. Do not, however, ask anyone who’s seen either of the AVP movies; the first one, 2004’s Alien vs. Predator, whiffed with critics, but made enough money to justify a sequel, directed by FX specialists Greg and Colin Strause and written by Shane Salerno (Armageddon). Somewhat unbelievably, 2007’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem did even worse, taking an epic Christmas Day pounding from just about every critic who screened it. “The door is left open for another sequel,” warned Scott Tobias for the AV Club. “If someone would kindly shut it and board it up, that would be much appreciated.”Watch Trailer3. Revolution (1985)  10%Take the director of Chariots of Fire, the screenwriter of The French Connection II, and the star of The Godfather II, and you should have yourself a pretty good picture, right? Not based on the evidence presented in Revolution, a thoroughly misbegotten attempt to portray a commoner’s-eye view of the events leading up to the War of Independence waged by American colonists against the British crown. One of the earliest in a series of shockingly misguided films that would eventually dot leading man Al Pacino’s filmography, it united a tremendous amount of talent (including a cast boasting Nastassja Kinski and Joan Plowright) in what appeared to be a war against a good time for filmgoers who traipsed out to see it on December 25, 1985. Saying that Pacino “often looks as if he were an 18th-century Rambo and sounds as if he were speaking 20th-century David Mamet,” the New York Times’ Vincent Canby opined, “Mr. Pacino has never been more intense to such little effect. It’s like watching someone walk around in a chicken costume.”Watch Trailer2. Mr. Magoo (1997)  7%By the late ’90s, Leslie Nielsen had cornered the Hollywood market on bumbling, white-haired klutzes — and for very good reason, as anyone who’s seen his wonderful work as Lieutenant Frank Drebin in Police Squad!, Airplane!, and The Naked Gun will tell you. However, not all slapstick comedies are created equal, and over time, Nielsen was sadly called upon to test the limits of his gifts by straining to overcome the deficiencies of scripts that offered little more than the merest framework for one of the industry’s greatest physical comics to work his magic. Case in point: 1997’s Mr. Magoo, which started from a decent idea — Leslie Nielsen as a legendary cartoon dunderhead! — and never bothered to go any further. The Houston Chronicle’s Jeff Millar summed up the dispirited response expressed by many of his colleagues when he sighed, “Here’s where I’m supposed to suggest how the film might be better. But I can’t think of anything to say other than to make the film again, with different writers and a new director.”Watch Trailer1. Pinocchio (2002)  0%Like plenty of other Oscar-winning actors, Roberto Benigni used the clout he earned with his awards (Best Actor and Best Foreign Film for Life Is Beautiful) to help get his passion project made. And it had plenty of potential, too — Carlo Callodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic book, but the character has become more closely identified with its somewhat bowdlerized Disney counterpart, and Benigni could have channeled his love for the book into a more faithful film. Alas, he chose instead to create one of the strangest (and vaguely creepiest) family movies of the 21st century, starring Benigni himself (who also directed and co-wrote the script) as the impish wooden boy. In fairness, it should be pointed out that the international version of Pinocchio did fairly well, but in the States, the English overdubs only compounded the overall weirdness of what unfolded on the screen. As an incredulous Edward Guthmann asked for the San Francisco Chronicle: “What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log?”Watch Trailer&nbsp;Finally, here’s a nice hot fire for you to warm yourself after reading those chilly reviews:&nbsp;Read more Total Recall&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"live, Britbox, teaser, kids, Star, shows","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Pinocchio-2002.jpg","slug":"the-10-worst-christmas-day-releases-of-the-past-30-years"},{"id":"47508971562420","title":"Movies For Tax Day","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Movies For Tax DayWe put a positive spin on tax day by focusing on how your money is spent.by RT Staff | April 15, 2014 |  CommentsOK, Tomatoes, tax day is here. And though we’ll concede that few enjoy forking over their hard-earned riches to Uncle Sam, we at Rotten Tomatoes thought it would be a good time to look on the bright side, and reflect upon how your tax money is allocated — in order of our rough approximation of federal expenditures. We’ve compiled a list of movies that proudly displays your tax dollars at work — cinematic portrayals of the dedicated men and women of our federal government working tirelessly in the public interest, or at least those citizens that benefit from our national largesse. So send your tax forms off to the IRS, and join us on a tour of your government programs at work on the silver screen!Department of Defense: Top Gun 57%Every year, the US government pours hundreds of billions of dollars into various Defense initiatives. Thus, it’s comforting to know our tax dollars are being spent wisely, ensuring that our skies are protected by people with names like Maverick and Goose, Iceman and Slider, Cougar and Merlin. In Tony Scott’s Top Gun, then-rising star Tom Cruise is Lieutenant Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, a gifted renegade pilot with a wicked competitive streak and a knack for mischief who is sent to the elite Top Gun training school for naval aviators. Sure, Maverick may “gamble with a $30 million aircraft” from time to time, and his unorthodox techniques and penchant for bedding female instructors could be seen as weaknesses, but he does our Navy proud when the chips are down. Even his chief rival, ace pilot Iceman (Val Kilmer), eventually comes around, and though he never quite brings himself to call Maverick “the best,” he knows he’s found a wingman for life, and when you’ve got MiGs constantly zipping around, that’s really all that matters.Department of Education: Rock ‘n’ Roll High School 81%George W. Bush’s controversial No Child Left Behind Act arrived far too late to bring accountability to the likes of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Marky Ramone, those irrepressible (and long-in-the-tooth) juvenile delinquents who spent more time sniffing glue and beating on brats than hitting the books. As Joey himself proclaims during the film’s theme song: “I don’t care about history/Cuz that’s not where I want to be” — words that would surely chill the spines of school administrators whose charges are scoring low on standardized tests. In Roger Corman’s Rock ‘n’ Roll High School, principals are like Spinal Tap drummers, unable to control their students’ collective appetite for such punk rock classics as “I Wanna Be Sedated,” “Pinhead,” and “Teenage Lobotomy.” It’s likely the Department of Education would grit its teeth before allocating any of its budget to Lombardi High, a school where the average student’s language skills consist of shouting “gabba gabba hey!” and little more.Department of Energy: Pulse 64%The next time you find yourself battling a defective appliance, don’t be so quick to blame the Maytag man: you could be facing the effects of a malevolent alien that has infested your local power grid, like the one in 1988’s Pulse. Starring Shock Treatment vet Cliff DeYoung and featuring an early appearance by Joey and Matthew Lawrence, this would-be “ultimate shocker” may have failed to jolt the box office, but it does pose a crucial question: What good is having a Department of Energy if they can’t safeguard our power supply from intergalactic freeloaders?Department of Labor: Silkwood 74%Its title has become shorthand for uncomfortable showers, but at its core, Silkwood is really the story of a tenacious labor activist (Meryl Streep) whose willingness to annoy her bosses is doubly brave — not only does she run the risk of losing her job, but she also happens to work at a fabrication site for plutonium fuel rods, and when she makes a lot of noise about safety corners being cut at the plant, surprise! She ends up becoming contaminated with radiation. Of course, things eventually get a lot worse for Streep’s character — based on Karen Silkwood, a real-life chemical technician who died in a suspicious single-car accident in 1974 — but what might seem on the surface to be a cautionary tale for union organizers is instead a rallying cry against employer dishonesty and unsafe workplaces, as well as a poster child for the sort of acting, directing, and screenwriting labor (ahem) that’s likely to pick up multiple Oscar nominations during awards season.Department of Transportation: Speed 94%So just what would the Department of Transportation think of Speed? While it fantastically depicts Los Angeles public transportation as occupied by functional, normal citizens, it also reveals weaknesses in the Californian infrastructure. Shouldn’t more of your tax dollars be spent on security, lest we allow riddle-parsing real-life madmen like Dennis Hopper near our bus depots? Or how about we get some more crews out there to finally finish up the freeway; that bus clearing that 50-foot gap looked a little unsafe. But you know what we don’t need? Raising the ceilings in our subway tunnels. Otherwise, how else would Keanu Reeves have put a stop to Hopper?Department of the Treasury: In the Line of Fire 96%Since we’re sure most of you aren’t particularly enamored with the Internal Revenue Service right about now, we thought it would be a good time to point out a little-known fact: The infinitely more awesome Secret Service is also part of the Department of the Treasury. Yes, those black-clad, joke-free dudes who protect the president are under the same jurisdiction as the IRS, since they’re also tasked with investigating fraud and identity theft. During In the Line of Fire, Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) does it all; not only does he apprehend a counterfeiter (a pre-Jigsaw Tobin Bell) in the movie’s opening scenes, he also must save the president from assassination aficionado Mitch Leary (John Malkovich). Leary knows Frank’s secret: he was on the scene when Kennedy was assassinated, and his inability to save the president continues to haunt him. However, nothing will stop Frank from defending the unnamed president, even if it means taking a bullet for him.Department of Veterans Affairs: First Blood 85%Forget the pumped-up sequels that used jingoism and rocket launchers to approximate higher dramatic stakes. John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) eventually became synonymous with beefy, brain-dead action, but anyone who’s seen First Blood knows that before it was a franchise, this was the relatively simple (and actually rather poignant) tale of a Vietnam vet who’s haunted by violence and hunted by a sheriff (Brian Dennehy) whose petty vendetta against the long-haired drifter mushrooms into a deadly imbroglio. The story may be a mite outlandish, but underneath the firepower, First Blood‘s real ammo is a serious — and, at the time, sorely needed — plea for tolerance and aid for veterans. The animated series Rambo: The Force of Freedom, on the other hand, was a plea for someone to change the channel, but that’s another story.Environmental Protection Agency: Ghostbusters 97%“Why worry? Each one of us is carrying an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back,” muses Dr. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) in Ghostbusters. Despite an outbreak of spectral activity in New York City, the Ghostbusters are not immune to the long arm of the law — in this case, the EPA. Seems our heroes are storing the captured spirits in an unregulated on-site containment unit, one that a particularly overzealous official named Walter Peck (William Atherton) would like to examine. Unfortunately, when Venkman treats Peck with customary disdain, Peck returns with a court order to shut down the containment unit — thereby unleashing a Pandora’s Box of ghouls upon the city.Federal Bureau of Investigation: Point Break 70%“You’re trying to tell me the FBI’s gonna pay me to learn to surf?” wonders Special Agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves). In Point Break, alacrity with a surfboard is essential if Utah is to infiltrate the Ex-Presidents, a masked posse of surf enthusiasts/bank robbers led by philosophical thrill junkie Bodhi (Patrick Swayze). Utah took an unconventional path to the bureau (he was a star quarterback at Ohio State before an injury redirected him to law enforcement), so it’s not altogether surprising that his undercover work isn’t exactly by-the-book; in addition to his pursuit of justice, Utah is also on the trail of 100 percent pure adrenaline. He’s also got a romance going with a surfer chick (Lori Petty) and a bromance with Bodhi, both of which might compromise his mission. Not unreasonably, one of his superiors is concerned with the effect such wild times might wreak on the eff-bee-eye budget; in one tense moment, he stridently asks the unorthodox agent, “Do you think that taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew that they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?”Federal Communications Commission: Pump up the Volume 81%Long before they became the go-to government agency for wardrobe malfunction complaints, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission had to deal with scofflaws like Mark Hunter (Christian Slater), the Phoenix high school student whose nightlife as a pirate radio DJ named “Happy Harry Hard-On” earns him the clandestine devotion of Camper Van Beethoven fans all across suburbia — and the wrath of FCC agents who are called in to investigate by concerned local authorities after a rash of troublesome teen behavior. Harry gets hauled to the hoosegow for his misdeeds, but he sparks a golden age of independent radio in the process, and he also leaves behind one of the era’s coolest soundtracks. Consider us pumped.Health and Human Services: Contagion 85%Some star-studded epic thrillers — like 1970’s Airport, for example — try to draw the audience into their disaster-driven storylines through sheer force of spectacle. Steven Soderbergh’s Contagion uses a different tactic, choosing instead to simply scare the hell out of viewers by killing famous faces in a blandly gross fashion. Inspired by such modern health scares as the 2003 SARS epidemic, Contagion imagines a terrifyingly likely scenario in which one nasty virus quickly works its way around the globe while panicked researchers and health workers — including officials from our own Department of Health and Human Services — toil around the clock to halt its spread. It’s the movie on this list most likely to make you want to wash your hands… which really isn’t such a bad thing.Securities and Exchange Commission: Wall Street 79%Wall Street is one of those perennials that blooms every time a financial scandal (or worse, a recession) hits. Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) certainly embodies the spirit of the get-rich-quick 1980s, but this unapologetic capitalist’s name was invoked when Enron and WorldCom came crashing down decades later. Gekko is so unscrupulous that he’s more than willing to utilize inside information and use underling Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), a go-getting stockbroker, to manipulate the stock price of his father’s company. However, Bud has some scruples, and refuses to wholly swallow Gekko’s “greed is good” ethos. He eventually decides to play ball with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the independent body that oversees the stock market, bringing the slippery Gekko to justice. Still, greed was good for Douglas, who picked up a Best Actor Oscar for the role, and became an ironic anti-hero to ambitious Wall Street up-and-comers.United States Forest Service: Firestorm 12%Who says tree-huggers are a bunch of wusses? In Firestorm, a gang of prison escapees set large swaths of Wyoming forest ablaze as a cover to retrieve a hidden stash of more than $30 million — and take an attractive hostage to boot. (Given the large percentage of national forest acreage in Wyoming, this is not an insubstantial problem.) But they didn’t count on “smokejumper” Jesse Graves (Howie Long). Profoundly internalizing the words of Smokey the Bear, Graves realizes that only he can prevent these non-eco-friendly thugs from getting away with their nefarious plan — preferably while meting out a rough brand of backwoods justice. In the real world, a greater number of forest fires in recent years has forced the United States Forest Service to utilize a much higher portion of its budget for fire suppression — which has drawn federal dollars away from the service’s other programs.&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"universal, media, Family, york, jones, tv, leads, dc, Travel, Arrowverse, MTV, unscripted","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Christian-Slater-Pump-Up-the-Volume.jpg","slug":"movies-for-tax-day"},{"id":"47508969958813","title":"Jeff Daniels’ 10 Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jeff Daniels' 10 Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Dumb and Dumber To star.by Jeff Giles | November 12, 2014 |  CommentsAlways an actor first and celebrity second, Jeff Daniels has appeared in scores of films over the last three decades and change without ever commanding a superstar level of attention — but as even a cursory glance at his filmography makes clear, he has a marvelous knack for choosing projects, one that extends to his work on the stage (where he’s earned a Tony nomination) and the small screen (where he won an Emmy for his work on The Newsroom). This weekend, Daniels reunites with his old pal Jim Carrey for the Dumb and Dumber sequel Dumb and Dumber To, and to celebrate, we’ve decided to turn our attention to his most critically beloved efforts. It’s time for Total Recall!10. Fly Away Home  87%Little kids and animals often trigger Cuteness Overload warnings for filmgoers over the PG-13 age barrier, and that can be especially true for sun-dappled dramas starring grizzled Hollywood veterans playing emotionally broken parents fumbling to reconnect with their children while also racing against time to solve some critical little kid/animal dilemma. Pretty much all of those boxes are ticked in 1996’s Fly Away Home, but the end result is affecting enough to tug a few strings in all but the hardest of hearts — due in large part to a pair of top-shelf performances from Jeff Daniels and Anna Paquin, starring here as a father-daughter duo who move beyond their painful past in order to save a flock of geese. Saying that the movie’s “tender beauty… goes well beyond what might be expected from a movie about things that hatch,” Janet Maslin of the New York Times applauded director Carroll Ballard for turning “a potentially treacly children’s film into an exhilarating ’90s fable” and added, “See it and you will never look at a down comforter in quite the same way.”Watch Trailer9. The Lookout  87%Out of Sight and Get Shorty screenwriter Scott Frank made his directorial debut with The Lookout, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt — then just beginning to demonstrate the knack for picking scripts that had helped him earn raves for Brick two years before — as a callow high school athlete whose foolishness leads to a catastrophic accident that turns his entire life upside down…and puts him in the path of a group of bad people who want to use him for their own nefarious ends. Co-starring Daniels as Gordon-Levitt’s blind roommate and Isla Fisher as the seductive, memorably named Luvlee Lemons, The Lookout didn’t have much of an impact at the box office, but it earned plenty of praise from critics like the AV Club’s Scott Tobias, who wrote that its “thriller elements could stand to be more surprising, but they’re ultimately in service of a better understanding of the characters. Usually, it’s the other way around.”Watch Trailer8. Something Wild  91%It’s refreshing whenever an actor plays against type, but there’s also something to be said for a script that lets a star sit directly in his or her wheelhouse; for example, here’s Something Wild, in which Daniels plays a buttoned-down stockbroker who makes the fateful decision to accept a ride home from a vivacious stranger (Melanie Griffith), thus setting off a chain of events that finds him an unwilling participant in all manner of ill-advised hijinks — including fending off her enraged husband (Ray Liotta). Subversive, willfully quirky, and thoroughly well-acted, Wild earned applause for its stars as well as for director Jonathan Demme; as James Kendrick wrote for Q Network Film Desk, “The tones shift rampantly, which for some viewers can be disorienting and off-putting. But, if you’re in tune with Demme’s aesthetic, which usually runs counter to our cinematic intuition, it is a wild ride indeed.”Watch Trailer7. Terms of Endearment  78%Daniels made his cinematic debut in Milos Forman’s 1981 epic Ragtime, but he got his first big break two years later in Terms of Endearment. Writer-director James L. Brooks, working from Larry McMurtry’s novel about the complicated lives and relationships of a mother (Shirley MacLaine) and daughter (Debra Winger), fashioned a critical and commercial sensation that grossed more than $100 million and picked up 11 Oscar nominations (winning five). While none of those trophies went to Daniels, he did earn positive notice for his supporting role as Winger’s rather scummy (and ridiculously named) husband, Flap Horton, and he was hardly alone among an almost uniformly praised cast; as John Ferguson so succinctly put it for Radio Times, “This is American mainstream movie-making at its best.”Watch Trailer6. The Purple Rose of Cairo  92%After catching Hollywood’s eye in Terms of Endearment, Daniels wasted no time racking up further accolades, picking up a starring (and Golden Globe-nominated) role in Woody Allen’s The Purple Rose of Cairo. Starring Mia Farrow as a mousy waitress toiling her way through a fairly dismal marriage to a rough-tempered drunk (Danny Aiello), the movie offers its heroine an unexpected boost in the form of a movie character (Daniels) who steps out of the screen and into her life. (As she tells her sister, “I just met a wonderful man. He’s fictional, but you can’t have everything.”) Critics were similarly smitten. “To be blunt about it, The Purple Rose of Cairo is pure enchantment,” gushed Vincent Canby of the New York Times. “It’s a sweet, lyrically funny, multi- layered work that again demonstrates that Woody Allen is our premier film maker who, standing something over 5 feet tall in his sneakers, towers above all others.”Watch Trailer5. Arachnophobia  93%Frank Marshall (backed here by his longtime production partner Steven Spielberg) made his directorial debut with this affectionate, cheerfully creepy tribute to classic Hollywood creature features, in which a deadly breed of spider terrorizes a small town whose residents include a lunatic exterminator (John Goodman) and, of course, a doctor with the titular phobia (Jeff Daniels). “That sound you hear in the background is the ‘ugh!’ heard round the world,” chuckled Janet Maslin of the New York Times, adding, “luckily, Arachnophobia will also be generating its share of boisterous, nervous laughter.”Watch Trailer4. Speed  94%After Die Hard blew up at the box office, action movies where the setting served as a sort of co-star became a wildly popular trend — to the point where, when Keanu Reeves starred in 1994’s Speed as an LAPD officer trapped on a moving bus that a maniac (Dennis Hopper) has loaded with explosives, it seemed safe to assume that it was just one more of the “Die Hard on a _____” movies that had clogged the cineplex for the past several years. Happily, this one proved a sleekly thrilling exception to the rule, both at the box office — where it racked up more than $350 million worldwide — and among critics, who applauded director Jan de Bont’s lean production, the movie’s uncommonly intelligent screenplay (given an instrumental polish by Joss Whedon), and a terrific cast that also included Sandra Bullock, Alan Ruck, and as Keanu’s steadfast partner, Jeff Daniels. Calling it “clean, delirious, and, yes, speedy,” the New Yorker’s Anthony Lane deemed it “the best big-vehicle-in-peril movie since Clouzot’s The Wages of Fear.”Watch Trailer3. The Squid and the Whale  92%Round up all the characters in every Noah Baumbach movie, and you’d have yourself a room full of some fairly messed up individuals. Case in point: 2005’s The Squid and the Whale, starring Daniels and Laura Linney as a husband and wife whose messily splintering marriage throws shards that wound their two sons (played by Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline) — not that either of the parents seem willing or able to put a stop to their selfish behavior. Like many of Baumbach’s films, Squid puts the viewer in the company of narcissists and misanthropes, but it’s also a piercingly honest look at the ways in which we deal with disappointment when our lives — and our loved ones — let us down. As Roger Ebert put it, “The Squid and the Whale is essentially about how we grow up by absorbing what is useful in our parents and forgiving what is not.”Watch Trailer2. Good Night, and Good Luck  93%For his directorial follow-up to Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, George Clooney decided to dramatize Senator Joseph McCarthy’s Communist witch hunt — specifically from the viewpoint of CBS News, where legendary anchor Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) engaged in a public war of wills against McCarthy while trying to temper the mass hysteria wrought by his adversary’s rabid insistence that all levels of American life had been infiltrated by the Red Menace. Rounded out by a stellar supporting cast (including Daniels as CBS News director Sig Mickelson), Good Night, and Good Luck. earned an impressive six Academy Award nominations — as well as our own Golden Tomato for Best Reviewed Film of 2005 in Limited Release. “By its end,” enthused Movie Mezzanine’s Sam Fragoso, “Good Night, and Good Luck evolves into a prophetic vision of how television and film can be used to illuminate or insulate, educate or entertain.”Watch Trailer1. Looper  93%A large part of Jeff Daniels’ considerable screen appeal has always been his ability to project an unassuming everyman aura, but acting opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to bring out the oddball in him: After stealing every scene he was in as Gordon-Levitt’s roommate in The Lookout, Daniels proceeded to do the same in Looper, injecting writer-director Rian Johnson’s thought-provoking sci-fi thriller with a madcap blast of energy as the sociopathic (and perversely likable) mob boss who orders Levitt’s hit man character to kill…well, we don’t want to spoil the fun if you haven’t already seen the movie. Point is, Looper is a lot of fun, not least because of Daniels’ performance, as well as what Deadspin’s Will Leitch called “A wildly entertaining film that isn’t content with science and cinematic tricks. It desires, and achieves, much more.”Watch TrailerFinally, here’s Daniels putting in a plug for his home state:Read more Total RecallClick here for Jeff Daniels’ complete filmography","section":"Total Recall","tags":"color, street, Ovation, video, king, 007, game-of-thrones, of, song","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jeff-daniels.jpg","slug":"jeff-daniels-10-best-movies"},{"id":"47508969965984","title":"Denzel Washington’s Best Movies","content":"\n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                        \n\n                    \n                                                \n(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)\n\nAll&nbsp;Denzel Washington Movies Ranked\nOver the course of his decades in show business, Denzel Washington has done pretty much everything — he’s played cops (good and bad), lawyers, reporters, educators, doctors, mobsters, and more, earning multiple Academy Awards and more than a billion dollars in box office grosses along the way. Of course, it’s fairly difficult to do all that without piling up a pretty hefty stack of positive reviews, and Mr. Washington’s filmography has definitely drawn its share, from&nbsp;Oscar winners like&nbsp;Glory,&nbsp;Training Day, and&nbsp;Philadelphia&nbsp;to his collaborations with director Spike Lee, like&nbsp;Malcolm X,&nbsp;He Got Game, and&nbsp;Inside Man.&nbsp;With all of that in mind, we’re here to celebrate by taking a comprehensive look at his career, including the&nbsp;best Denzel Washington movies&nbsp;and the worst.&nbsp;Perfection!

But this is not to say that every so often, network execs aren’t capable of indulging the occasional flight of fancy. In fact, the dial is often littered with memorably idiosyncratic shows — some of which we later look back on with befuddled bemusement and wonder what the people behind the scenes could have been thinking. This week, we raise a glass to those not-so-noble failures, so start practicing your most quizzical facial expressions — it’s time for Total Recall!AfterMASH (1983-1985)The Premise: Really, the “premise” was that CBS wasn’t ready to give up on M*A*S*H‘s viewers after the show bade the airwaves farewell following 11 acclaimed seasons. But conceptually, the show was supposed to follow the post-Korean War adventures of three M*A*S*H characters (Colonel Potter, played by Harry Morgan, Klinger, played by Jamie Farr, and Father Mulcahy, played by William Christopher) at a veteran’s hospital in Missouri.The Problem: As younger readers no doubt recall from the sadly shuffling exploits of Joey, ratings lightning rarely strikes twice — and although AfterMASH was a Top 10 hit during its first season, all it took to burst the show’s bubble was a little program called The A-Team, which showed up on NBC the following year and chased poor AfterMASH off the schedule midway through Season Two. W*A*L*T*E*R, M*A*S*H‘s final spinoff, which was supposed to follow the popular Radar character into civilian life, was taken out of development before it made it to series, eventually airing as a one-off special in the summer of 1984.Cavemen (2007)The Premise: You love the talking caveman in those GEICO insurance commercials, so you’d definitely be interested in seeing him star in a half-hour sitcom.The Problem: Attempts at turning product mascots into stars in their own right are nothing new, and as these things go, Cavemen at least tried to build on its subjects’ unlikely origins, pitching itself as a “unique buddy comedy that offers a clever twist on stereotypes and turns race relations on its head” that just happened to take place in an alternate reality in which modern man coexists uneasily with his prehistoric forebears. Alas, critics simply didn’t find it very funny, and audiences stayed away in droves; when the Writers Guild went on strike in November of 2007, Cavemen was quietly taken out back and made to go extinct.The Charmings (1987-1988)The Premise: Snow White (played by Caitlin O’Heaney, then Carol Huston) and Prince Charming (Christopher Rich) move from the Enchanted Forest to modern-day Burbank.The Problem: Part of the anything-goes spirit at late-’80s ABC that led to such delightfully unorthodox fare as Max Headroom and Sledge Hammer!, The Charmings bore a kernel of a cool idea (not to mention a Magic Mirror voiced by Paul Winfield), but it was smothered by a laugh track and silly scripts revolving around stuff like Snow White getting a credit card. To add insult to injury, the network scheduled it across from Family Ties during its second season, thus ensuring the show’s speedy demise.Cop Rock (1990)The Premise: A serious police procedural from Hill Street Blues creator Steven Bochco… with singing and dancing!The Problem: The knock on modern Hollywood is that it’s far too risk-averse, but reflecting on this short-lived 1990 ABC series, that complaint is thrown into stark relief against the pure lunacy of Cop Rock. Looking back, it’s exceedingly difficult to imagine how anyone thought this would find an audience — even with Bochco at the reins and music from the genius mind of Randy Newman — but all the same, we’re awfully glad it happened, if only so we’d one day be able to say a police drama aired a trial sequence concluding with a gospel number called “He’s Guilty.” Perhaps strangest of all? Cop Rock lasted 11 episodes.Homeboys in Outer Space (1996-1997)The Premise: A pair of astronauts (played by Flex and Darryl Bell) travel the universe in a car-shaped ship dubbed the Space Hoopty (piloted by a talking computer named Loquatia).The Problem: There’s a certain delightfully weird charm to the idea that a person can be streetwise in outer space, but it seems more suited to a Saturday Night Live sketch than a full-on sitcom. An early example of the UPN network’s see-what-sticks approach, Homeboys in Outer Space was widely panned by critics and mostly ignored by viewers, but managed to hang around for 21 episodes during the ’96-’97 season.Me and the Chimp (1972)The Premise: A former NASA chimp finds itself a new human family, creating laff-a-minute hijinks for beleaguered dad Mike Reynolds (Ted Bessell).The Problem: Bessell would eventually go on to win an Emmy for his work behind the scenes of The Tracey Ullman Show, and Me and the Chimp co-creator Garry Marshall would close out the ’70s as the TV kingpin behind Happy Days and Laverne &amp; Shirley. As Matt LeBlanc and Jason Alexander would later discover, however, chimp-based humor is a fairly thankless medium.Mr. Smith (1983)The Premise: A circus orangutan is separated from his trainer, drinks a mixture bestowing him with a 256 IQ, and gets a job as an adviser to the president of the United States.The Problem: That Mr. Smith was probably the biggest programming boondoggle of 1983 should be so immediately obvious that we won’t even bother listing the reasons for its quick cancellation; instead, we’ll point out that the orangutan’s voice was provided by executive producer Ed Weinberger, who’d co-created Taxi and would go on to do the same for The Cosby Show and a number of other series. The moral of the story: No one is brilliant all the time.My Mother the Car (1965-1966)The Premise: You say “weird TV show,” and for a lot of people, this one-season wonder is the first thing that springs to mind. For good reason, too: For 30 episodes between September of 1965 and April of 1966, My Mother the Car sought to squeeze laughs from the idea that a lawyer (Jerry Van Dyke) buys a run-down used car after hearing the voice of his mother (Ann Sothern) speaking to him — and only to him — through the radio.The Problem: Hand this show to David Lynch or Tim Burton, and it’d end up in some potentially delightful places. In the context of the ’65-’66 TV season, however, it was merely grist for wacky comedy, a la shows such as The Flying Nun and My Favorite Martian. Instead of being committed to an insane asylum or wallowing in existential anguish, our hero simply tried to stay one step ahead of an unscrupulous collector (Avery Schreiber) who wanted the car and wouldn’t take no for an answer. Car quickly crashed, but as with some of the other entries on this list, it boasted a creative pedigree that included some future stars, including Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks and Mary Tyler Moore co-creator (with Brooks) Allan Burns.The Second Hundred Years (1967-1968)The Premise: A gold miner (Monte Markham) heads off to Alaska to make his fortune in 1900, only to be caught in an avalanche — and held in suspended animation until 1967, at which point he returns to civilization and moves in with his now-67-year-old son (Arthur O?Connell) and dead ringer grandson (also played by Markham).The Problem: Culture clash comedy is nothing new, but The Second Hundred Years might be the most high-concept show ever to make it on the air. Unfortunately, the laughs were rather low — and after viewers’ curiosity faded, so did the ratings.The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer (1998)The Premise: A black Englishman (Chi McBride) is chased out of his native country after racking up excessive gambling debts, and after arriving in Civil War America, finds work as President Abraham Lincoln’s butler.The Problem: Some of comedy’s loudest laughs have been mined from painful truths, and American slavery is one of the most painful of all. But it requires intelligence and wit, neither of which were in abundant supply on the short-lived The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. Beset by problems even before it aired, Desmond‘s pilot (which included at least one joke about slavery, a blackface sequence, and a cotton-picking gag) was pulled in favor of a later episode, but even with all that notoriety, the show failed to generate much interest; after airing it four times in October of 1998 to low ratings and poor reviews, UPN pulled the plug.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Network, History","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cavemen.jpg","slug":"10-tv-shows-we-cant-believe-actually-got-made"},{"id":"47508968830359","title":"Best Movies Off the Radar 2014","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Best Movies Off the Radar 2014RT staffers pick the little-seen gems from 2014 that deserve another look.by RT Staff | December 30, 2014 |  CommentsAs Birdman and Boyhood continue to rack up accolades en route to what is increasingly looking like an Oscar showdown in the making, it’s important to remember there were a ton of films this year that aren’t getting anywhere near the same kind of awards season buzz (and probably won’t), but still deserve a fair amount of love. With that in mind, we’ve put together a list of RT staff favorites that have either been largely forgotten or will pass through awards season with little to no fanfare. Read on for our off-the-radar recommendations of 2014!Alan Partridge  86%Alex Vo, EditorSelf-absorbed and misanthropic radio DJ Alan Partridge is Steve Coogan’s most popular creation in his home country and virtually unknown in the United States. This fact makes an Alan Partridge movie a tough sell here, especially since the character has been around for well over 20 years. For example, how much awareness of the character does one need coming into the movie? Fortunately, none! Alan Partridge more than stands on its own, with a barrage of hilarious jokes and scenarios rising out of the absurd “radio station gets held hostage” plot. Great tunes pepper the soundtrack, too, culminating with a memorable tribute to Sparks’ 1979 disco track, “#1 Song in Heaven.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Babadook  98%Jeff Giles, Associate EditorIf you’ve heard anything about The Babadook, you’ve probably heard that it’s one of the scarier horror films of the year, and for good reason. Debuting writer-director Jennifer Kent envelops the viewer in a steadily encroaching atmosphere of cold, isolating dread, ratcheting up the tension so effectively that — as with many of the best entries in the genre — the movie’s titular villain hardly needs any screen time to establish his malevolent presence. But The Babadook isn’t just scary; in fact, it works just as effectively as a wrenchingly honest (and, in the end, almost sweet) examination of the ways in which unprocessed grief can draw us into darkness. Watch it for the icy chills, but don’t be surprised if The Babadook lingers long after you’ve stopped looking over your shoulder at night — and definitely be on the lookout for more from Kent.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Blue Ruin  96%Grae Drake, Senior EditorThe idea of the revenge flick has been around for a loooong time. I imagine that the first one came out right after the Lumiere Brothers’ The Arrival of a Train, and featured a disgruntled passenger who had missed the train at the last stop. So now, in a cinematic landscape overflowing with recycled ideas, the revenge flick has to travel far from the beaten path to make a splash. Blue Ruin, directed and written by newcomer Jeremy Saulnier, is just such a film. Quiet and frantic, Blue Ruin slowly reveals the story of Dwight, who appears to be a lonely drifter with nothing but garbage dinners to keep him shuffling through life. Beneath the surface, however, lies a warrior who has suffered a great loss, and whose only desire in life is to restore balance through violence. One of the many problems Dwight has is that he is completely incompetent as an assassin, but where there’s a will, there’s a (messy) way. Dwight is the kind of samurai that I think I would be — full of enthusiasm and righteousness, but lacking in actual skill or know-how. Saulnier’s film never strays into slapstick territory, as the subject matter and Dwight’s life is too bleak to allow for lightheartedness. Somehow this movie manages to be poignant without being heavy-handed, and brutal without being judgmental.Watch Trailer&nbsp;A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night  96%Tim Ryan, Senior EditorPlenty of movies can be described as “more style than substance.” A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night, on the other hand, is something else altogether: a movie whose style is so striking that it becomes the substance. Describing the plot of A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night makes it sound utterly generic (lovelorn vampire seeks companionship) and its unofficial tagline (“It’s the best Iranian feminist vampire Western ever made!”) makes it seem like some kind of campy stunt. But A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night emits a weird vibe that’s hard to shake, from its haunting black-and-white cinematography to its pulsing soundtrack. Every once in a while, I’ll see something that feels so unique and fresh that I want to tell everyone I know to see it now! This year, A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night was that movie.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Rob the Mob  81%Kerr Lordygan, Review AggregatorThe true story of small-time crooks Tommy and Rosie Uva is a pretty incredible one, and it’s brought to vivid life in the little-seen Rob the Mob. Written by Jonathan Fernandez and directed by Raymond De Felitta (City Island, Booker’s Place: A Mississippi Story), the film is funny in its portrayal of a couple with enough chutzpah to steal from the mafia, but it’s touching, too; Tommy (Michael Pitt) and Rosie (Nina Arianda) love each other so much, they’ll do whatever is necessary to keep their passion alive. Struggling to pay the bills, they pull mini-heists to stay afloat, but after Tommy serves a stint in prison, he decides to try robbing private clubs owned by the Mafia, and Rosie is forced to go along for the ride. With a cast that includes solid pros like Ray Romano, Andy Garcia, and Griffin Dunne, the film is sure to entertain while pushing a few buttons. And tickling your funny bone. The actors are spot-on, commanding an unlikely empathy through their performances and making this modern day Bonnie and Clyde story worth more than just a glance.Watch Trailer&nbsp;The Skeleton Twins  86%Beki Lane, Editorial CoordinatorA surprisingly heartfelt drama starring well-known comedians Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, The Skeleton Twins is a soft-spoken success. I was amazed to find such simple and clear acting by two people who are usually known for over-the-top comedic performances. This story of estranged twins is easy to relate to and you get the distinct impression that you are peeking in on everyday lives in progress. It is also a study of depression, and the struggle of those who fight to live in the face of it. The Skeleton Twins is Certified Fresh at 87% on the Tomatometer, and is worthy of diving into.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Snowpiercer  94%Catherine Pricci, Review AggregatorConsidering it came in at number two on our Summer Movie Scorecard — Certified Fresh at 95 percent, no less — it’s hard to believe so few people have heard of Snowpiercer, let alone seen it. Imagine a frozen, post-apocalyptic Earth whose only survivors are living on a train that perpetually circles the globe, and all of the train’s inhabitants are divided by class. Curtis (Chris Evans) and a ragtag bunch of his fellowproletarians are fed up and plan a forward assault to the front of the train in an attempt to secure better living conditions. As they progress through each car, they discover increasingly shocking things. There are extremely dark tones in this film that will resonate with most and the morals they live by. Snowpiercer is a rock-solid action film, but it’s hard to miss its allegorical concerns, especially at a time when economic hardship is a reality for so many of us.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Teenage  77%Marya E. Gates, Social Media SpecialistWriter/Director Matt Wolf’s documentary adaptation of Jon Savage’s book, Teenage: The Prehistory of Youth Culture: 1875-1945, is more of a visual collage than a traditional documentary. Certified Fresh at 74 percent, Teenage uses archival footage and filmed recreations to tell the true story of four teenagers in the years building up to World War II. Narrators (including Ben Whishaw and Jena Malone) read excerpts from Savage’s book — much of which was taken from diaries and newspaper articles — to bring these four examples to life. A haunting musical score by Atlas Sound ties everything together, and the film ends with a montage of archival footage from post-1945 that celebrates the exuberance, despair, passion, and hope that comes during those tumultuous teenage years. While Teenage might not be for everyone, it’s definitely not like any other documentary you’re going to see this year.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Under the Skin  84%Sarah Ricard, TV EditorAt the same time that she was kicking supervillain ass as Black Widow in Marvel’s blockbuster Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Scarlett Johansson was also quietly burrowing her way into the gloomy outskirts of Glasgow, Scotland as a mysterious, beautiful, and dangerous stranger in Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin. Laura, whose name is easy to miss, drives a van through town seducing male strangers into coming home with her. While the men can’t believe their luck, they ought to remember that some things are too good to be true. Going home with a gorgeous woman, only to find that her apartment is actually an infinite quagmire of black goo, should be something of a real red flag. Under the Skin may frustrate many on account of its equally gooey pace and almost-too-subtle plot, but Johansson’s performance is at once beguiling and creepy, leaving you with two questions by this mesmerizing and shocking film’s end: What the heck did I just see? And when can I see it again?Watch Trailer&nbsp;We Are the Best!  96%Ryan Fujitani, EditorComing-of-age films are a dime a dozen these days, but the vast majority of them — even the comedies — seem intent on filtering adolescence through the adult lens of wistful, melancholy nostalgia. This is one of the reasons why Lukas Moodysson’s We Are the Best! feels so refreshing, even as its themes ring familiar. Set in the early 1980s but never cloyingly era-specific, the film follows a trio of outcast middle-school girls in Stockholm who come together to form a punk band, and it never devolves into the dire melodrama or awkward sexual awakenings of its genre kin. Instead, We Are the Best! embraces the joyful, devil-may-care rebellion of youth in all its ephemeral glory, best illustrated by the scene when the girls panhandle for change to pay for a new guitar, only to spend all their money on a candy and ice cream binge. There are some ups and downs in the movie, to be sure, but Moodysson’s affection for raucous Klara, sheepish Bobo, and demure Hedvig is so clearly on display that I’m inclined to declare you heartless if you don’t at least crack a smile when the girls finally break out into the titular chant.Watch Trailer&nbsp;Whiplash  94%Matt Atchity, Editor in ChiefIt’s easy to understand why Whiplash got a little bit lost when it was released in October; it was a small film overshadowed by wider releases, and its leads (Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons) aren’t exactly box office draws on their own. But this film absolutely deserves all of the accolades its received so far, including the Grand Jury Award at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. Miles Teller plays a talented drummer studying at a New York music conservatory who falls under the sway of a tyrannical bandleader, played by J.K. Simmons. The movie explores artistic achievement and obsession in a way that will have you on the edge of your seat, as Simmons and Teller repeatedly face off on the bandstand. The movie features an especially chilling performance from Simmons, balancing charm and abuse in equal measure. Sure, the movie takes a bit of license with jazz history, but the tense and thrilling climax will stick with you long after the film is over.Watch Trailer&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"video, service, Horror, review, jamie, classics, Pictures, mission:, Prime, children's, BET, GIFs, Crunchyroll, E!","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Best-Movies-Off-the-Radar-2014.jpg","slug":"best-movies-off-the-radar-2014"},{"id":"47508971550128","title":"X-Men Movies by Tomatometer","content":"(Photo by 20th Century Fox Film Corp.

Oh, and capture some lightning-in-a-bottle casting with Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. A bit tall to play Wolvy, but he had the chops (and literally, the muttonchops).The relentless X2: X-Men United brought true action to the series, before hitting the skids with The Last Stand and the writer’s strike-afflicted X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Since then, the X-Men franchise has spread out in myriad ways, with highlights including adapting the time-splitting classic Days of Future Past, the Western-inflected Logan (nominated for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar!), and introducing the meta Merc With A Mouth Deadpool into the mix.With New Mutants finally out, we’re taking a look at all the X-Men movies ranked by Tomatometer.#14Dark Phoenix (2019) 22%#14Adjusted Score: 38.385% Critics Consensus: Dark Phoenix ends an era of the X-Men franchise by taking a second stab at adapting a classic comics arc -- with deeply disappointing results.Synopsis: In DARK PHOENIX, the X-MEN face their most formidable and powerful foe: one of their own, Jean Grey.

To celebrate their stars’ and creators’ bravery in the face of all-but-insurmountable odds, we decided to dedicate this week’s feature to a selection of programs who were sacrificed to the television gods after only a single airing, and came up with an eclectic list of overnight sensations culled from across several decades of abrupt failure. Don’t change that dial — it’s time for Total Recall!Co-Ed Fever (1979)The first few months of 1979 saw a trio of hastily assembled, Animal House-inspired sitcoms hit the airwaves. By the summer, they’d all been cancelled, but only one of them suffered the ignominy of being yanked after a single airing: Co-Ed Fever, starring future character actor titan David Keith and future Fall Guy ingenue Heather Thomas in an alleged laffer about the hormone-addled ribaldry that erupts after an all-girls’ college starts admitting men. Although the show’s set survived as the first-year dorm for The Facts of Life, most of Co-Ed Fever‘s six-episode stockpile was never seen by American viewers, airing only on the Canadian dial.Melba (1986)Getting Melba Moore in front of the cameras was something of a coup for CBS in 1986: a successful recording artist since the mid-’70s, she was on a hot streak a decade later, scoring a string of R&amp;B hits that culminated with two Number One smashes that year, “A Little Bit More” and “Falling.” Unfortunately, Moore’s sitcom (helpfully titled Melba) had the misfortune of airing its debut episode the night of the Challenger space shuttle disaster on January 28, and its ratings were subsequently so low that the network immediately pulled the show from the lineup and dumped the balance of its six-episode run off during the summer (which, during those days, was generally the rough equivalent of throwing the tape in a dumpster).South of Sunset (1993)Eagles co-founder Glenn Frey is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but his platinum credentials in the music arena haven’t exactly spilled over into his acting career; the highlights of Frey’s filmography include a much-ballyhooed guest-starring appearance on Miami Vice and a role in Wiseguy, while the lowlights include the 1986 Alan Smithee film Let’s Get Harry and his short-lived CBS series South of Sunset, which managed to sully the network’s schedule for one night only on October 27, 1993. Sunset‘s immediate cancellation had to be embarrassing for Frey, but he didn’t have long to sulk — the Eagles were back together the following year, on the road for one of the most successful tours of all time. To celebrate, VH1 even aired five of the show’s seven filmed episodes.The Great Defender (1995)Long before he scored a gig on The Sopranos as Jackie Aprile, Sr., Michael Rispoli was the star of the 1995 freshman hopeful The Great Defender, about a Boston lawyer who works out of his apartment alongside his mother/receptionist (Who’s the Boss alum Rhoda Gemignani). The supporting cast included the Emmy-winning Richard Kiley, but none of it was enough to stem the ratings bloodshed when Defender premiered against perennial Sunday night juggernaut 60 Minutes, and after they crunched the numbers (it pulled in a dismal 6 percent of the viewing audience), Fox took it off the schedule. The network dithered over whether or where to give it a new timeslot, eventually letting the actors’ contracts expire — which worked out pretty well for Rispoli, who’d booked a handful of roles in high-profile movies (including While You Were Sleeping and The Juror).Public Morals (1996)The long-running ABC drama NYPD Blue was a Top 10 hit in 1996, so it’s understandable that creator Steven Bochco might contemplate a spinoff. Less understandable: Said spinoff turned out to be Public Morals, a CBS sitcom starring NYPD cast member Bill Brochtrup playing his character, administrative aide John Irvin, in the midst of a group of vice squad officers played by an ensemble cast that included Donal Logue. Optimistic CBS execs commissioned 13 episodes, but after a single airing of the new series was greeted with abysmal ratings and rotten reviews, Public Morals was no more. Fortunately for Brochtrup, his old job was still waiting for him back at NYPD Blue.Lawless (1997)Nearly a decade after his short-but-flamboyant NFL career ended, ex-linebacker Brian Bosworth brought his thespian muscle to bear on network TV as the star of Fox’s Lawless, a detective drama built around the Miami-set exploits of special ops vet-turned-motorbikin’ private dick John Lawless and his Jamaican helicopter pilot pal Reggie (Glenn Plummer). Immediately dismissed by critics as a crass Miami Vice clone, Lawless tumbled off the schedule after its premiere, freeing up Bosworth to continue adding to the film career he’d begun with 1991’s Stone Cold. (Recent roles include “The Friendly Pirate” in Patrick Warburton’s Rock Slyde.)Dot Comedy (2000)In need of a quick addition to the lineup after cancelling The Trouble with Normal just five episodes into its run, ABC trotted out Dot Comedy, a clip show (hosted by Annabelle Gurwitch and the Sklar Brothers) cobbled together from funny stuff the staff dug up on the internet. Not the worst premise in the world (just ask Daniel Tosh), but viewers simply weren’t interested — and after looking over the debut episode’s ratings, neither were network executives. The irony here? After all that work collecting laughs, the funniest thing about Dot Comedy is that plenty of shows would dearly love to pull in the 4.1 million viewers that got it cancelled.The Will (2005)Plenty of reality shows have tried to use a shockingly tasteless premise to drum up ratings, and more often than not, those efforts fail — but they’ve never failed quite as spectacularly as they did with CBS’s The Will, a would-be contest in which the relatives of a multimillionaire vied for inheritance of his vast Kansas ranch. Although the balance of the show’s six episodes were eventually aired on the Fox Reality Channel (R.I.P.) and in New Zealand (we’re still waiting for a declaration of war), the CBS schedule had a Will-shaped hole after poor ratings prompted a quick plug-pulling following the first installment on January 8, 2005. (FYI: the rich guy’s wife ended up “winning” the contest.)Emily’s Reasons Why Not (2006)It happens a lot more often than it used to, but anytime a movie star decides to take a series gig on television, it turns into a big story — and that’s exactly what happened with the heavily hyped Emily’s Reasons Why Not, which brought Heather Graham to the ABC lineup as the center of a sitcom about a self-help author who — quelle surprise! — is cursed with a comically inept approach to her own love life. If that premise sounds tired, well, the execution wasn’t much to write home about either; the series was roundly panned by critics and ignored by viewers, and after a single airing, the network had all the reasons why not it could have asked for. Five of the six episodes that were filmed only aired far, far away from American viewers (example: Slovenia).Quarterlife (2008)A would-be thirtysomething for 21st-century twentysomethings, Quarterlife started out as an online-only series that posted in brief increments on MySpace, YouTube, and its official site, which doubled as a social network — and it was a raging success, racking up such gaudy traffic stats that NBC execs became convinced it might serve as a sort of dramatic bellwether for a paradigm shift for TV in the internet era. Retrofitted into six hourlong episodes, the show made its debut January 31, 2008… and was cancelled almost immediately thereafter, joining the list of creative ventures whose alliance with technology before its time helped doom them to the scrapheap.Secret Talents of the Stars (2008)Our widespread belief that celebrities can only be good at one thing can be almost childlike in its insistence, and downright hurtful for people whose talents really do spill over into a variety of seemingly separate disciplines. Of course, for every EGOT winner, there are probably a couple dozen people who probably shouldn’t pursue their private dreams in public — and that’s the gist of Secret Talents of the Stars, a 2008 competition series, hosted by the professionally unctuous John O’Hurley, in which famous people (like, say, Partridge Family alum Danny Bonaduce) subjected themselves to being judged on television for skills you didn’t know they had (like, say, riding a unicycle). Alas, not even the sight of George Takei singing a country song was enough to lure viewers, and after its April 8, 2008 debut, Secret Talents of the Stars was no more.For more Total Recall lists, be sure to check out our archive.For more TV news, visit here.For a complete list of this Fall’s TV premiere dates, visit here.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Seed, A24, Western, Games, FXX, Mindy, Golden, Television, Trailer, The, Mudbound, universe","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lawless-1997.jpg","slug":"11-tv-shows-cancelled-after-the-first-episode"},{"id":"47508969982375","title":"Nine Movies That Bring the Funk","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Nine Movies That Bring the FunkWith Get On Up hitting theaters, we run down some of the grooviest flicks of all time.by Jeff Giles | July 31, 2014 |  CommentsThe Godfather of Soul gets his cinematic due this weekend with the James Brown biopic Get On Up, starring 42‘s Chadwick Boseman as the legendary singer. The prospect of watching director Tate Taylor’s dramatization of Brown’s remarkable life has left all of us in the RT offices with ants in our pants and the need to dance, so we decided to devote this week’s list to a celebration of all things filmic and funky. Jump back, we wanna kiss ourselves: It’s time for Total Recall!Black Dynamite 83%A blaxploitation spoof that actually functions as a fairly brilliant movie in its own right, Black Dynamite affectionately revives a discarded genre with humor that, while never shy about puncturing the shoddy production values and threadbare plots those earlier movies are known for, avoids settling for cheap scorn. Starring Michael Jai White as the titular martial arts-wielding ladies’ man, Dynamite tosses out all the expected story beats — a protagonist with a score to settle, a community writhing in the grip of drugs and crime, a litany of grave injustices perpetrated by the Man — and uses them to string together a series of absurd, hilarious, and absurdly hilarious gags. As Shaula Clark enthused for the Boston Phoenix, “As Dynamite kung-fu-fights his way through a vast conspiracy involving smack-addled orphans, malt liquor, and the best (read: worst) exploding-car scene of 2009, you’ll feel a rush of 1970s nostalgia you never knew you had.”Coffy 86%Pam Grier picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her work in Quentin Tarantino’s (arguably more widely seen) Jackie Brown, but if you want to know why he wanted to honor her with that role in the first place, you need to go back to the source — the string of blaxploitation features Grier made her cinematic bones with in the 1970s, including 1973’s grimly funky Coffy. Boasting typically strong work from Grier and a standout soundtrack from the monumentally talented Roy Ayers, Coffy follows the misadventures of an inner-city nurse who strikes back against the drug underworld that left her younger sister hooked on smack; given that her scheme includes posing as a Jamaican prostitute to get close to a devious pimp (Robert DoQui) and take down a vicious Mafia don (Allan Arbus), you can pretty much guess at the level of sex, drugs, and violence that go down during the movie’s 91-minute running time, but in this case, knowing what’s in store doesn’t make the journey any less enjoyable. “Jack Hill directs for maximal suspense, violence, and voyeuristic appeal,” wrote an appreciative Don Druker for the Chicago Reader, “which Grier certainly embodies.”The Harder They Come 91%Part crime drama, part message movie, and 100 percent reggae’s utterly funky coming-out party in the U.S., The Harder They Come utilizes its classic soundtrack as the backdrop for a hard-hitting (and fairly loosely adapted) portrayal of the life and underworld exploits of real-life Jamaican criminal Ivanhoe Martin, a.k.a. Rhyging. An enormous box office sensation in Jamaica and a midnight movie classic in the States, Harder remains noteworthy on cinematic as well as musical grounds; it is, as Melissa Anderson wrote for the Village Voice, “The definitive postcolonial cult-movie musical.”Love and Basketball 83%Like Steely Dan said in 1980’s “Hey Nineteen,” hard times have befallen the soul survivors; following the blaxploitation explosion, the cinema got a heck of a lot less funky, and these days, it’s quite a bit harder to find a film/soundtrack combination that delights the eyes while encouraging one to get one’s swerve on. A notable exception: 2000’s Love and Basketball, starring Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan as a young couple negotiating the pitfalls of life and love, on and off the basketball court — all accompanied by a blend of new and classic cuts from the likes of Rufus and Chaka Khan, Al Green, Angie Stone, and Guy. Wrote Stephanie Zacharek for Sight and Sound, “It’s a fine example of a conventionally made picture which follows all the rules yet still emerges as fresh and original.”Purple Rain 70%After scoring his first Top 10 pop hit with 1982’s “1999,” Prince went all in for Purple Rain, taking advantage of the complete creative control he’d negotiated from Warner Bros. to put together a musical biopic that presented a (very) loose retelling of his Minneapolis youth, set to the strains of the funkiest, most ambitious music of his career. While the results weren’t always thoroughly compelling on strictly cinematic terms, as a complete package, Purple Rain was one of the more purely enjoyable efforts of the year, and it kicked off a period of total radio domination for Prince that lasted for the rest of the decade. “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called Purple Rain,” opined Rob Nelson of the Minneapolis/St. Paul City Pages, calling it “the Citizen Kane of Minnesota movies and a worldwide showcase for the ascendance of its then-26-year-old star into rock ‘n’ roll eternity.”Shaft 88%Other cats cop out when there’s danger all about, but not John Shaft, the all-around bad mother — shut your mouth! — who runs around risking his neck for his brother man whenever he isn’t busy being a sex machine to all the chicks. Shaft is a complicated man, but director Gordon Parks’ brand of blaxploitation noir proved an easy sell for audiences, who generated a whopping $13 million return on MGM’s $500,000 investment, producing one of several bankruptcy-staving hits in the studio’s colorful history and helping, along with Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song, to kick off a wave of like-minded features. Shaft remains a standard-bearer of the genre, however, thanks to Richard Roundtree’s imposing performance in the title role — and Isaac Hayes’ classic ode to the character, which anchored a soundtrack that went on to set a sales record for the Stax label. “Shaft,” declared Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “is nothing short of a classic.”Soul Power 84%Part history lesson, part sports documentary, and part concert movie — all of which combine into a joyous, effortlessly entertaining whole — Soul Power looks back on the Zaire 1974 music festival planned around the Rumble in the Jungle heavyweight boxing championship match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in October of that year. Featuring performances from James Brown, the Spinners, Bill Withers (Hope She’ll Be Happier), Miriam Makeba, B.B. King, and many others, Power adroitly walks the line between lamenting lost cultural potential and celebrating a truly unique moment in time; as Ann Hornaday observed for the Washington Post, the end result “turns out to be an unusually resonant time capsule, one that weaves together theatrics, musicianship, cosmopolitanism and sharp political critique in a vibrant look-back that’s at once celebratory and wistful.”Superfly 92%Presenting audiences with a supposedly sympathetic drug dealer protagonist looking to score a million-dollar haul before getting out of the business is a lot to ask, but darn it if 1972’s Superfly doesn’t pull it off. Starring Ron O’Neal as Priest, a coke dealer who hatches the aforementioned scheme with his partner Eddie (Carl Lee), it’s a dark (and sometimes darkly comic) tale of the would-be kingpin as a put-upon middleman, squeezed from all sides by cops, thugs, girlfriends, and anybody else who wants a piece of the action — and an incredibly successful one, not least because of Curtis Mayfield’s classic soundtrack (which ultimately ended up making even more money than the film). Calling Superfly “one of the best to come out of the genre,” Counting Down’s Larry Carroll wrote, “O’Neal gives a fine (but always funky) performance in one of the last movies before the genre ate itself and became self-parody.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Naturally, there’s plenty of horror in here, but just like a group of kids heading off into the woods to debunk an urban legend, you might find a few surprises too. Power up that handheld camera, because it’s time for Total Recall!The Bay 76%A found footage horror movie from the guy who gave us Rain Man and The Natural? It sounds like a disaster, but in Barry Levinson’s The Bay, the only disaster is what we’re doing to our water supply — specifically in Chesapeake Bay, where the refusal of one town’s mayor to heed researchers’ warnings of lethal toxicity lead to a horrific outbreak of a mutant breed of tongue-eating louse. Freaky stuff, and well-handled by Levinson, who rebounded from a string of wretched stinkers like Envy and Man of the Year by using the inherent raw immediacy implied by found footage in pursuit of a timely (and obviously deeply felt) message. “Levinson’s film proves something pretty unequivocally,” argued Jason Gorber for Twitch. “Any conceit, any style, be it found footage or shakycam or haunted house or whatever, can be great in the hands of a good filmmaker.”The Blair Witch Project 86%No surprises here — The Blair Witch Project spawned the current found-footage craze, and there’s no way we were leaving it off this list, even if it has become a sort of whipping boy for the many inferior knockoffs inspired by its runaway success. And although, looking back, it really only has a few truly potent scares, it strings them out so patiently — and uses its then-novel narrative gimmick so well — that it’s easy to understand how Blair Witch scared the dickens out of so many filmgoers, particularly during the days of its early release, when it was still rumored to be culled from actual footage left behind by the Witch’s real-life victims. “The Blair Witch Project is the scariest movie I’ve ever seen,” decreed Lloyd Rose for the Washington Post. “Not the goriest, the grossest, the weirdest, the eeriest, the sickest, the creepiest or the slimiest… Just flat out the scariest.”Chronicle 85%Before 2012, the superhero and found-footage genres might not have seemed like the most natural of companions — but as Chronicle demonstrated, under the right circumstances, they can go together as deliciously as peanut butter and chocolate. Following the adventures of troubled teen Andrew (Dane DeHaan), his cousin Matt (Alex Russell), and their school acquaintance Steve (Michael B. Jordan) after they discover an unknown object that leaves them with telekinetic powers, the Josh Trank-directed drama imagines the giddy thrill that might come from developing adolescent superhuman abilities — as well as the struggle to come to terms with the responsibility all those cool new gifts entail. Of course, that’s a struggle familiar to anyone who’s ever read early Spider-Man, but Max Landis’ screenplay delves a bit deeper into the darkness — and the cast imbues his characters with easily relatable anguish. “It’s a testament to Trank’s capable direction that the movie feels so grounded in reality,” wrote USA Today’s Claudia Puig. “There is no sense of the magical in the goings-on, even though what the boys are doing defies logic and gravity.”Cloverfield 78%Hyped with a fairly brilliant “viral” ad campaign that made it seem like producer J.J. Abrams was brewing up some truly next-level cinema, Cloverfield couldn’t help but disappoint a little when it stomped into theaters in 2008 and filmgoers realized it was really just a monster movie with a(n occasionally nauseating) found-footage twist. Still, taken on its own terms, this is a better-than-average entry in this week’s subgenre, boasting some energetic work from director Matt Reeves and a solid script from Drew Goddard. Basically, if you’re going to watch one movie about a monster running amok in New York City while handicam-toting twentysomethings try to make sense of the destruction, this is the one to choose. “There’s nothing to Cloverfield, really, but stripped-down chaos shot in a faux-verite Blair Witch Project fashion,” shrugged the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips, who then admitted, “But I have to say, I was with it.”End of Watch 85%Most critics — and more than a few filmgoers — would agree that the found-footage gimmick has been more than played out since rising to prominence with The Blair Witch Project in the late 1990s. Still, it’s a powerful tool when used in the right way, as demonstrated by writer/director David Ayer’s End of Watch, which follows a cop/film student (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his partner (Michael Pena) on patrol in the mean streets of South Central Los Angeles. While Ayer’s use of the found footage technique proved divisive among critics, End of Watch earned a healthy $51 million at the box office, picked up a pair of Independent Spirit Award nominations, and enjoyed the respect of scribes such as Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote, “The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser, dashboard shots that face inward instead of out, catching Gyllenhaal and Peña in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison.”Europa Report 81%Having apparently never seen the end of 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a group of astronauts (played by Daniel Wu, Anamaria Marinca, Christian Camargo, Karolina Wydra, Sharlto Copley and Michael Nyqvist) board a deep space flight to Jupiter’s moon Europa, intent on probing the surface to try and find forms of life. The result is director Sebastián Cordero’s Europa Report, sort of a more intelligent cousin to the disastrous Apollo 18; rather than cheap scares and ill-conceived characters, Report tries to wring real human drama out of a dangerous situation that slowly goes from hopeful to horrifying — and, to many critics’ immense satisfaction, also grounds its story in intelligent dialogue that at least sounds like the kind of stuff scientists might say. “Finally,” crowed Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News. “A found-footage thriller that merits, and expands on, this irrationally popular format.”Lake Mungo 96%An eminently creepy low-budget ghost story barbed with scary videotapes, cell phone footage, and mockumentary interviews, Lake Mungo took the spirit of unsettling real-life documentaries like Capturing the Friedmans and used it as the chilling springboard for a grueling question: how do families carry on after the death of a loved one? In most cases, one hopes the answer includes fewer moments of blood-curdling horror than Mungo, but that undercurrent of real-world sadness helps anchor the fear with genuine poignancy. Calling it “a sophisticated, adult tale that blends complex, compelling emotions with reflexive commentary on film as a ‘medium’ of memory, manipulation and magic,” Little White Lies’ Anton Bitel deemed it “a classic supernatural enigma, once seen never forgotten.”Paranormal Activity 83%For a lot of found footage horror movies, the device is used largely as a narrative and/or editing gimmick in order to obfuscate details and amp up jump scares. But with 2009’s Paranormal Activity, director Oren Peli rocked it Blair Witch style, using the characters’ handheld cameras to slowly ratchet up an overall feeling of dread that finally yields to a payoff rendered all the more haunting by its refusal to rely on gore or over-the-top special effects. Your mileage may vary with the growing list of Paranormal spinoffs and sequels, but the original is as simple as it is effective. “It illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x,” wrote an appreciative Roger Ebert. “For extended periods here, nothing at all is happening, and believe me, you won’t be bored.”[Rec] 89%You’ve no doubt noticed that quite a few of the movies on our list have fallen under the horror umbrella, but precious few are as lethally effective as [Rec], the 2007 sensation helmed by Spanish writer-directors Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza. Plunging viewers into the nightmarish hellscape of an apartment complex that might be ground zero for a quickly spreading virus that turns its hosts into homicidal savages, it proved that no matter how played out found footage might have seemed even then, it could still be used as an effective delivery mechanism for sparse, economic horror. The inevitable sequels fell victim to the laws of diminishing returns, but the original remains a classic of the genre; as Jason Morgan put it for Filmcritic.com, “Not since John Carpenter’s one-shot intro to Halloween has POV horror been this good.”Trollhunter 82%Found footage is so pervasive these days that it’s spread all the way to Norway, where director André Øvredal used it for his international cult hit Trollhunter. One of those movies whose plot is rather brilliantly summed up in its title, it follows the occasionally scary, often hilarious adventures of a group of college students whose pursuit of a suspected bear poacher takes a surprising turn when they discover that he’s actually after a much, much bigger quarry. With uniformly strong performances and more of a cinematic aesthetic than your average found-footage film, Trollhunter elicited applause from the majority of critics, including the Hollywood Reporter’s David Rooney, who called it “An enjoyably off-kilter hybrid of The Blair Witch Project and Where the Wild Things Are.” There’s a presumably bigger-budget Hollywood remake in the works, but you don’t need to wait for that; the original is streaming via Netflix right now.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

In honor of the genre’s latest freshly chambered round, we decided to take a look back at some of the more successful quippin’ ‘n’ shootin’ duos from precincts past. Shoulder those holsters, because it’s time for Total Recall!&nbsp; 83%Beverly Hills CopThe Buddy Cops: It’s Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) who’s shown on the poster and described in the title, but his classic debut would have seemed pretty lonely without the involvement of his Beverly Hills buddies Detective Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Foley’s such a pain in the neck, he triggers high-volume outbursts from superiors in two places: As the movie opens in Detroit, he’s getting an earful from his inspector (Gil Hill), and when he follows an investigation to Beverly Hills, he runs similarly afoul of Beverly Hills PD Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox).Saving the Day: Foley spends a substantial portion of the movie keeping Rosewood and Taggart from figuring out what he’s up to, but the trio put their heads together just in time to take down ruthless smuggler Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) — and lay the groundwork for a series of sequels that seems likely to continue with Beverly Hills Cop IV in 2016. The follow-ups have made their share of cash, but there’s nothing like the original; as R.L. Shaffer wrote for IGN, “Simply put, Beverly Hills Cop is one of the best buddy cop movies ever made.” 94%The GuardThe Buddy Cops: Irish police Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleeson) and FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Actually, Boyle pretty much punches his own ticket in his little burg; he’s got enough respect and seniority to do more or less whatever he likes, including indulging in illegal activities while he’s on duty. The Guard‘s tension lies between Boyle’s blasé attitude and Everett’s by-the-book approach — a conflict as old as the genre, to be sure, but one enlivened here by the movie’s change of setting.Saving the Day: From the moment Everett and Boyle clash, you know they’re going to develop a begrudging respect, just as surely as you know a change is gonna come for the depressingly corrupt rural police district that Boyle calls home. But it doesn’t matter, because writer/director John Michael McDonagh has penned such a smart, tightly constructed script — and lucked into a pair of immensely compelling leads — that The Guard could probably get by on charm and chemistry even if it had nothing else to offer. “McDonagh’s script is agile, darting between the ridiculous, the sage and the surprisingly sentimental,” opined the Denver Post’s Lisa Kennedy. “His love of language and the absurd has hints of the wisecracking Quentin Tarantino. But the story is decidedly more rooted in Ireland’s loamy turf.” 66%The HeatThe Buddy Cops: Straight-laced FBI agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) and slovenly Boston cop Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: When you have a cop on your payroll that’s as loudly insubordinate (yet utterly effective) as Mullins, there’s no point in yelling, lest you end up being rewarded for your trouble with a few insults and a tape dispenser to the head. Which is a shame, because as Tom “Captain Woods” Wilson proved when he played Biff in Back to the Future, he makes for a pretty compelling authority figure.Saving the Day: Undermined by their co-workers and frequently at odds, our pistol-packing duo still manage to hunt down a local drug lord known only as Larkin — and even with cinema’s most godawful impromptu tracheostomy and a ghastly stab wound standing between them and the bad guy, they do (of course) manage to get their man. They also earned the admiration of critics like Movie Talk’s Jason Best, who wrote, “The Heat is crude and rude, and its plot is pretty ropey, but as Bullock’s by-the-book prissiness collides with McCarthy’s slobbish street savvy, its leading ladies strike scintillating comic sparks off each other.” 91%Hot FuzzThe Buddy Cops: U.K. constables Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) and Danny Butterman (Nick Frost).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: It’s actually Angel who does most of the yelling, mainly because he’s been “promoted” to the sleepy country town of Sanford as a way of keeping his spotless arrest record from ruining the curve for his fellow officers in London. Angel’s no-nonsense demeanor and sharp eye for crime seem utterly wasted in Sanford, and to add insult to injury, his new partner Butterman is an oaf whose evident incompetence is matched only by his childlike love of the cop shows and movies that make a mockery of Angel’s respect for the law.Saving the Day: An affectionate half-parody of the buddy cop movie, Hot Fuzz subverts some of the genre’s cliches while following its basic narrative outline — which is to say that Sanford isn’t quite the idyllic hamlet it initially seems to be, and that Angel and Butterman find their groove and prove their partnership’s mettle just in time to bring the bad guys to justice. “What you get from Hot Fuzz is what you rarely see from Hollywood,” argued David Germain for the Associated Press. “Something genuinely smart and silly at the same time, a film and filmmakers that respect their characters, their audience and the genre at which they lovingly poke fun.” 82%Lethal Weapon 2The Buddy Cops: LAPD detectives Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), back for another round after 1987’s smash hit Lethal Weapon. While the first installment certainly had its funny moments, it’s the first follow-up that might be the funniest in the series — partly because it introduces the annoyingly fast-talking Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), whose antagonistic presence unites the occasionally fractious duo against a common nuisance.Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Mainly because Riggs is at least mildly insane, which makes for some of the most entertaining moments in the four-volume (and counting) Weapon franchise, but causes angst at HQ when you’re dealing with, say, a smuggling ring perpetrated by a cadre of South African diplomats.Saving the Day: They’re ordered to leave the case alone, but you know you can’t keep Murtaugh and Riggs from pursuing the bad guys — especially ones as nasty as Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland) and his second-in-command, Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick O’Connor). Things get a little dicey, of course — the original script had Riggs kicking the bucket in the final act — but our men emerge victorious and ready to reload for another sequel. “If you liked Lethal Weapon, you’ll like Lethal Weapon 2,” nodded the New York Times’ Caryn James. “It’s almost as simple as that.” 78%The Other GuysThe Buddy Cops: Trigger-shy NYPD desk jockey Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and his exceedingly reluctant partner, the much more aggressive Detective Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Gamble’s pencil-pushing ways make him a liability under fire (not to mention the butt of department-wide jokes), but Hoitz has a few skeletons in his closet, too — including the time he accidentally shot Derek Jeter.Saving the Day: Initially sent to investigate a permit violation, Gamble and Hoitz turn up a wide-ranging conspiracy involving an unscrupulous billionaire (Steve Coogan), a ruthless CEO (Anne Heche), and the NYPD pension fund. The entire department is against them, and their boss (Michael Keaton) is distracted with his second job at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond — can they collar the perp while delivering the funny? “The plot doesn’t always hold water and it has a tendency to ramble, but they don’t seem to care,” chuckled Betsy Sharkey for the Los Angeles Times. “And honestly, neither should you.” 67%Red HeatThe Buddy Cops: Moscow police captain Ivan Danko (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Chicago detective Art Ridzik (Jim Belushi), thrown together when a Soviet drug kingpin flees to the States after murdering Danko’s partner.Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Ridzik is kind of a loudmouth, as well as a total schlub — which not only gives his superiors fits, but amps up the fish-out-of-water comedy that ensues once Danko muscles his way into the investigation.Saving the Day: Things initially appear less than promising for our heroes — the bad guy, naturally named Viktor (Ed O’Ross), adds Ridzik’s partner to his list of casualties — but they eventually manage to find some common ground just in time to demolish half of Chicago before bringing him to justice. Although the involvement of director Walter Hill beggared a number of unfavorable comparisons to the superior 48 HRS, most critics had enough fun to give Red Heat a pass. “Walter Hill’s direction’s real cool, and the photography is beautiful,” wrote Kevin N. Laforest for the Montreal Film Journal. “The film is also pretty funny. The leads are great.” 57%Running ScaredThe Buddy Cops: Chicago detectives Danny Costanzo (Billy Crystal) and Ray Hughes (Gregory Hines).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: In a departure from the buddy-cop norm, neither Costanzo nor Hughes are buttoned-up and/or by the books; in fact, they’re both wisecracking goofballs with a disregard for procedure, which is why their captain (Dan Hedaya) forces them to take a vacation after they narrowly manage to collar a local drug kingpin (Jimmy Smits).Saving the Day: While loafing in Florida, our heroes decide to quit the force — but when they get back to the city and discover that their perp has walked on a technicality, they return to the streets for one last takedown. Even in 1986, the audience knew exactly which beats Running Scared would hit and when it was going to hit them, but Hines and Crystal’s chemistry was more than enough to compensate for any lack of originality. “This genre is so overpopulated that it hardly seems like we need one more example,” agreed Roger Ebert, “yet Running Scared transcends its dreary roots and turns out to be a lot of fun.” 61%Rush HourThe Buddy Cops: Hong Kong detective Lee (Jackie Chan) and his LAPD counterpart Carter (Chris Tucker).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Partly just to be heard over Carter’s rapid-fire, high-pitched squealing, but also because Carter’s arrogance almost ruins his and Lee’s investigation of a mysterious crime lord.Saving the Day: Carter is brash and annoying, but he has reasons for his recklessness, and Lee is just the guy to show him the wisdom of reining in his impulsive attitude. It’s East meets West, and New Line Cinema meets franchise: Chan and Tucker’s delightful chemistry helped Rush Hour rack up nearly $250 million in global grosses, helping spawn a pair of sequels as well as a slew of critical praise from scribes such as Time Out’s Charlotte O’Sullivan, who wrote, “Much of the best dialogue, you suspect, was improvised by Tucker and Chan, who seem truly taken with each other and make a delightful, ordinary-extraordinary pair.” 88%StakeoutThe Buddy Cops: Immaculately mustachioed Seattle detectives Lecce (Richard Dreyfuss) and Riemers (Emilio Estevez).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Lecce is a grizzled vet who should know better than to go and fall in love with the gangster’s ex-girlfriend (Madeleine Stowe) that he and Riemers are supposed to be watching, but he’s suffering from post-divorce loneliness — not that it’s any consolation to the colleagues forced to wonder whether his loyalties have shifted once the con in question (Aidan Quinn) returns to his old tricks.Saving the Day: Lecce and Riemers have a rather prickly working relationship — especially once Lecce starts leaving Riemers alone to man the binoculars while he’s off with his new lady friend. Do the partners bond over a final act that involves quips, firearms, and near-death experiences? If you’ve ever seen a buddy cop movie, you don’t even need to ask — but as Walter Goodman argued for the New York Times, “The director uses the conventions of the action-comedy in so adroit a way that you may even forget the hundred other films you’ve seen lately about a couple of cops kidding around with each other in between battling the bad guys.” 62%Starsky &amp; HutchThe Buddy Cops: Ken “Hutch” Hutchinson (Owen Wilson) and David Starsky (Ben Stiller).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: Mainly because they’re borderline incompetent — and because their commanding officer is the decidedly imposing Captain Doby, played by martial arts master and former AFL defensive back Fred Williamson, who can yell at anyone he wants.Saving the Day: They don’t really trust each other and they’re both sort of useless, but as they fumble about in their pursuit of local drug kingpin Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn), Starsky and Hutch begin to develop a brotherly bond…although that’s really your only good choice after you’ve been involved in the accidental shooting death of a pony. Using the 1970s TV source material as an enthusiastically goofy showcase for Stiller and Wilson’s comedic chemistry, the result is good for more than a few laughs; as James Verniere wrote for the Boston Herald, “The film takes a bad but beloved 1970s TV series and transforms it into an experience of almost transcendent silliness.” 96%SupercopThe Buddy Cops: Hong Kong cop “Kevin” Chan Ka-Kui (Jackie Chan) and Interpol director Jessica Yang (Michelle Yeoh).Their Commanding Officer Yells a Lot Because: The third entry in Chan’s Police Story series, Supercop is definitely a buddy cop movie, but its Hong Kong origins kept it from falling prey to some of the genre’s more annoying cliches. For the most part, Ka-Kui and Yang are on the road during this story, and her upper-level status with Interpol helps keep any interference from commanding officers at bay.Saving the Day: While they do engage in their share of bickering — Supercop‘s finale finds them arguing over whether the ill-gotten goods they’ve reclaimed should go to China or Hong Kong — for the most part, Ka-Kui and Yang make a pretty terrific team here, hunting down a drug lord known as Chaibat (Kenneth Tsang) and bringing his reign of terror to a suitably stunt-filled conclusion. Most Chan movies work a fair amount of humor into (and in between) all those spectacular set pieces, but this one whips up a particularly potent blend; as Stephen Hunter wrote for the Baltimore Sun, “By its second half, Supercop cranks up into such an extravaganza of fighting, blowing things up, spin-kicking, punch throwing and death-defying that it all but takes your breath out of your lungs and packs it up for shipment to Hong Kong.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Along the way, Cameron has also accumulated a fair bit of critical acclaim — and since she’s returning to theaters this week with Jason Segel in director Jake Kasdan’s Sex Tape, we thought it was high time to take a look back at some of her proudest moments. That’s right, film fans — it’s time to Total Recall!Matt Atchity breaks down this week’s list. 63%10. The Last SupperWitty equal-opportunity political humor has become something of a lost art on the big screen over the last decade or so, but thing’s weren’t always this way. For proof, simply look to 1995’s The Last Supper, an ensemble indie comedy about a group of young liberals (including Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, and Annabeth Gish) who begin poisoning conservative dinner guests as part of a misguided campaign to save the world. While the murder victims aren’t terribly sympathetic, their murderers aren’t especially likable either — so by the time they cross paths with a Limbaugh-esque conservative pundit (played by Ron Perlman), loyalties to either ideological extreme have been tested. “In today’s divisive political climate, where compromise is a dirty word,” observed Leslie Rigoulot of Film Scouts, “The Last Supper raises not only timely questions but moral dilemmas as well.” 68%9. Charlie’s AngelsCharlie’s Angels was one of the most popular television series of the 1970s, thanks in no small part to its genius lowbrow blend of runway-ready jiggle and consequence-free violence — so when Drew Barrymore set about producing a big-screen adaptation of the show, she wisely included heaping helpings of both ingredients, enlisting Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz to join her for 98 minutes of skin-tight blockbuster action. As the Ph.D.-sporting test pilot/model/P.I. Natalie Cook, Diaz was able to give a kung fu twist to the bubbly, air-headed persona that Hollywood has foisted on blondes for generations, mixing tongue-in-cheek cheesecake with glossy action set pieces — and as it had in the 1970s, this proved a thoroughly successful combination, blasting through almost $265 million at the box office and impressing critics such as Kirk Honeycutt of the Hollywood Reporter, who wrote, “The good-natured humor of its three stars, who appear to be having a gas playing these ridiculous figures, goes a long way in overcoming the bad jokes and even worse plot twists.” 73%8. My Best Friend’s WeddingIn the years immediately following The Mask, Cameron Diaz tended to appear in movies that either didn’t live up to expectations (Feeling Minnesota, She’s the One) or vanished without a trace (Head Above Water, Keys to Tulsa). Her luck changed, however, with My Best Friend’s Wedding, a romantic comedy which put Dermot Mulroney in the middle of a romantic tug-of-war between his longtime restaurant critic pal (played by Julia Roberts) and his 20-year-old fiancee (played by Diaz, natch). Nothing groundbreaking, obviously, but Wedding gave Diaz a chance to show off her gift for goofy comedy after a few darker films — and its $299 million gross didn’t hurt her bankability, either. Unusually for a romantic comedy, it was also praised by many critics, among them the Globe and Mail’s Rick Groen, who wrote, “Every once in a long while, along comes a refreshing change like My Best Friend’s Wedding, a movie whose appeal rests largely on its knack for defying our expectations by riffing off, even undermining, a familiar genre.” 75%7. In Her ShoesAuthor Jennifer Weiner has been lumped into the “chick lit” subgenre, but you can say this much for her second novel, 2002’s In Her Shoes: It translates well to the screen. Directed by Curtis Hanson and led by a cast that included Diaz, Toni Collette, and Shirley MacLaine, Shoes follows the tale of two sisters: Dowdy lawyer Rose (Collette) and flighty, unemployed Maggie (Diaz). Thrown out by the sisters’ stepmother, Maggie moves into Rose’s apartment, where she quickly demonstrates that she hasn’t changed any of the thoughtless behavior that drove a wedge between them, and leaves Rose little choice but to send her packing. Maggie flees to Florida, where she hunts down their estranged grandmother in search of some easy money…and ends up learning a thing or two about herself in the process. Yes, it’s sort of a hackneyed storyline arc with plenty of familiar ingredients, but Susannah Grant’s screenplay reflects the empathy Weiner has for her characters — and Hanson knows how to get the most from his actors. For Diaz, Shoes represented an opportunity to show a breadth and depth uncommon to many mainstream “women’s movies.” As Tom Long wrote for the Detroit News, “It’s a chick flick for non-chicks too, one of those movies that makes you laugh and cry and leaves you feeling satisfied and drained and vaguely embarrassed for having such a good time.” 73%6. Gangs of New YorkWhen Martin Scorsese decided to dramatize the violent political struggles that took place in 19th century New York, he didn’t skimp on his cast, hiring Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, John C. Reilly, and Liam Neeson to bring his vision to life. Pretty terrific company for Diaz, who co-starred as Jenny Everdeane, the morally ambiguous con artist whose beauty adds a hormonal component to the long tug-of-war between Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), Bill “The Butcher” Cutting (Day-Lewis), and Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas). While not the most substantial role, playing Jenny gave Diaz the opportunity to act alongside some of the biggest names in the business — and earned her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the bargain. One of the biggest award-winners of the year, Gangs of New York enjoyed praise from critics like the New York Post’s Jonathan Foreman, who wrote, “It vividly and energetically evokes a fascinating time and place that has never before been the subject of film, and presents a powerful if imperfectly coherent vision of urban politics at their most primal.” 79%5. The MaskIt wasn’t the largest or most demanding role — in fact, if things had worked out a little differently, it could have doomed her to a career of playing blowsy dames in tight dresses — but Cameron Diaz could hardly have asked for a more memorable introduction to audiences than the part of Tina Carlyle, the vivacious gangster’s moll whose appearance reduced Jim Carrey (and not a few filmgoers) to a leering Tex Avery cartoon. Diaz was so new to acting that she didn’t even start taking lessons until after she was cast in The Mask, but she took to the discipline quickly, and spent the next few years working her way through roles in smaller films that didn’t have the same big-budget sparkle (or co-stars as marquee-hogging as Carrey) as she honed her craft. She quickly developed some star power of her own, and ceased being an afterthought for critics like the Washington Post’s Joe Brown, who wrote, “Even without the state-of-the-art, boundary-busting computerized effects from Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Carrey’s a human cartoon, and his spontaneous, Avery-esque, anything-for-a-laugh outrageousness makes this otherwise blank Mask a must-see.” 83%4. There’s Something About MaryFilmgoers were already familiar with Cameron Diaz in 1998, but There’s Something About Mary still counts as her true cinematic coming out party — it was this $369 million smash hit, after all, that proved Diaz had sharp enough comic timing to hold her own against Ben Stiller and Chris Elliott — and that her brilliant smile could help make even the filthiest gags seem almost wholesome. Though it was ostensibly Stiller’s movie, it was Diaz who made us believe that there really was something about Mary — something that would make her senior prom date (played by Stiller) hunt her down years after the painful zipper incident that cost them their big night out, and drive the other men in her life to contemplate leaving their wives, duck out on the Green Bay Packers, or even adopt entire fake personalities. And along the way she carried the most notorious hair gel joke in the history of modern man, helping send an unapologetically lowbrow comedy all the way up to 83 percent on the Tomatometer. What was Mary‘s appeal for ordinarily stuffy critic types? In the words of Roger Ebert, “What a blessed relief is laughter.” 88%3. ShrekCartoons and fairy tales have gone together for decades, leaving DreamWorks with plenty of rich tradition to spoof with their inaugural adaptation of William Steig’s popular book about the misadventures of a hideous ogre (voiced by Mike Myers). In fact, the studio added a few elements not present in the book, such as Shrek‘s ceaseless, quick-fire pop culture references, a number of satirical, fairy tale-derived characters, and a Smash Mouth song on the soundtrack. Also new and improved: The storyline arc for Cameron Diaz’s character, Princess Fiona, who went from an ordinary ogress to the unwilling, secretly cursed royal fiancee of the loathsome Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), and picked up a few action hero moves in the process. While it wasn’t strictly faithful to the source material, Shrek was lots of fun for critics and audiences alike; it grossed nearly $485 million worldwide, nabbed the first Best Animated Feature Academy Award, and earned the admiration of scribes such as the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, who applauded, “What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies.” 89%2. Shrek 2Three years after Shrek broke the bank for DreamWorks, Cameron Diaz helped prove with Shrek 2 that one good turn as an animated ogre deserves another. After Shrek‘s success, everyone knew a sequel was inevitable, and its May release virtually guaranteed summer blockbuster status; what nobody knew, though, is that critics would like the second Shrek almost as much as the first. Following the rule of sequels, Shrek 2 surrounded the titular ogre (again voiced by Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Diaz) with an array of new characters, including the suave Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) — but what sets it apart from other follow-ups is the depth and intelligence of its storyline, which sends Shrek and Fiona to the kingdom of Far Far Away, where they’re summoned to meet Fiona’s human parents (voiced by John Cleese and Julie Andrews), who are horrified that their daughter has taken so thoroughly to the ogre lifestyle. This sets in motion a plot involving Fiona’s fairy godmother (Jennifer Saunders) and her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) — as well as a lot of unexpectedly poignant commentary on love and marriage, moving Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek to ask, “Is it going too far out on a beanstalk to say that Shrek 2 is one of the most mature movies about adult relationships ever made?” 94%1. Being John MalkovichShe’s been in a number of comedies and dramas, with a dash of action and sci-fi thrown in for good measure, but Being John Malkovich stands alone in Cameron Diaz’s filmography. Then again, it’s safe to say Malkovich is pretty much the only movie of its kind, ever — a dramedy about a miserable puppeteer (John Cusack) whose discovery of a magical portal into the mind of John Malkovich throws his life into turmoil. As Cusack’s wife, the equally unhappy Lotte, Diaz played completely against type, burying her glamor under a frizzy mop of brown hair and following the script into a thoroughly twisted love affair-by-proxy with Catherine Keener — and she was rewarded handsomely for her efforts, picking up a stack of Best Supporting Actress nominations from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards, and other organizations. Malkovich wasn’t a huge success at the box office, but it’s acquired a cult over time, and critics certainly appreciated the opportunity to witness art and entertainment intersecting at the cineplex. “Being John Malkovich is more than just the latest cool, smart, funny movie,” wrote Jay Carr for the Boston Globe. “It jumps off the screen with the kind of freshness, originality, and light-handed stranglehold on the Zeitgeist that moves movies forward.”In case you were wondering, here are Diaz’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Shrek — 90%2. Being John Malkovich — 87%3. Gangs of New York — 81%4. The Holiday — 80%5. My Best Friend’s Wedding — 74%6. Any Given Sunday — 74%7. My Sister’s Keeper — 73%8. Vanilla Sky — 73%9.

In that spirit, we’ve decided to devote this week’s list to a decidedly non-comprehensive overview of some of the best Frankenstein movies ever made. A tall order? Certainly. But with the Tomatometer as our guide, we think we’ve turned up a dozen Frankenstein flicks that lumber with the best. Get Igor, ’cause it’s time for Total Recall!Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein 89%How you feel about Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein may depend on how you feel about Frankenstein — because while it’s one of Abbott and Costello’s funnier pictures, it’s fairly abysmal as a horror film, given the light treatment it affords the monster (not to mention Dracula, played by Bela Lugosi; the Wolfman, played by Lon Chaney, Jr.; and the Invisible Man, “played” by Vincent Price). Basically an excuse for the star duo to run around a creepy castle taking pratfalls while trying to avoid Dracula’s plans to put Costello’s brain in the monster’s body, it’s a far cry from the straight horror of the franchise’s proud early installments. On its own merits, however, it earned applause from critics like David Conner of the Apollo Guide, who wrote, “Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein shows off both the comedy team and the monsters at their best, ranking in my book with Ghostbusters as one of the best horror-comedies ever.”Bride of Frankenstein 98%Bride of Frankenstein‘s poster screamed “The monster demands a mate!,” but it could just as easily have read “The studio demands a sequel!” Fortunately, returning director James Whale wasn’t in a rush to churn out any old follow-up; in fact, he initially turned down the gig, feeling like he’d “squeezed the idea dry” the first time around. Finally, after years of rejected screenplay drafts, Whale and Universal had something they could agree on: Bride of Frankenstein. The rare horror sequel that matches or exceeds its predecessor, it follows the adventures of the monster (again played by Boris Karloff) after he narrowly escapes death in the mill fire at the end of the first film — as does his creator (Colin Clive), only to be shanghaied by his mentor (Ernest Thesiger) into building the monster a bride (memorably played by Elsa Lanchester). “Whale’s erudite genius brings it all together,” applauded Empire Magazine’s Simon Braund. “He sculpts every nuance of self-parody, social satire, horror, humor, wit and whimsy into a dazzling whole, keeping every one of his fantastical plates spinning until the tragic, inevitable finale.”The Curse of Frankenstein 80%Long after Universal turned Frankenstein into comedy fodder, Hammer Studios used the tale as grist for its cinematic breakthrough: 1957’s The Curse of Frankenstein, starring Peter Cushing as an altogether more malevolent Dr. F and Christopher Lee as a thoroughly memorable version of his monster. The end result proved tremendously influential for British horror cinema, and spawned a series of Cushing-led sequels in the bargain; as Kim Newman later observed for Empire, “In its best scenes, it adds dynamism and British grit to a genre that had previously tried to get by on atmospherics and mood alone. It manages to be shocking without being especially frightening, and its virtues of performance and style remain striking.”Flesh for Frankenstein 86%Featuring Andy Warhol in the producer’s chair and Udo Kier as an altogether different kind of mad doctor, 1973’s Flesh for Frankenstein used Mary Shelley’s classic as the springboard for a 3D schlockfest wherein instead of creating one lumbering monster, Frankenstein builds himself a pair of sex-crazed breeders who set about birthing him his very own race. Add in heaping helpings of incest, necrophilia, and a subplot involving a stable boy (the suitably lusty Joe Dallesandro) tasked with satisfying Frankenstein’s wife (Monique van Vooren), and you’re left with a movie so wildly over the top that most critics had no choice but to give in; it is, as James Kendrick wrote for the Q Network Film Desk, “pure camp taken to the highest extremes with a careful and purposeful hand.”Frankenhooker 57%“Wanna date?” Anyone who set foot in a well-stocked video store during the early 1990s had to have run across a “talking box” copy of Frankenhooker, Basket Case director Frank Henenlotter’s enthusiastically weird horror/comedy about an amateur scientist (James Lorinz) who accidentally murders his girlfriend (Patty Mullen) and then sets about rebuilding her with parts collected from the corpses of crack-addicted local hookers he’s blown up with a uniquely lethal home-brewed strain of the drug. Unfortunately for our “hero,” his undead sweetheart wakes up with a predilection for streetwalking, and before you know it, there’s a ticked-off pimp in the lab. “It thinks it’s funnier than it is,” cautioned Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, “but it’s still pretty funny.”Frankenstein 100%It wasn’t the first Frankenstein film — that honor goes to J. Searle Dawley’s 1910 short — but it’s unquestionably the definitive one, featuring a number of additions that have since come to be part of the monster’s legend (including makeup artist Jack Pearce’s distinctive flat-headed design). Led by Boris Karloff’s star making performance, the James Whale Frankenstein terrified audiences to the tune of $12 million at the box office, giving Universal a healthy one-two monster punch with Dracula in 1931 and spinning off a lengthy series of sequels, reboots, and remakes that continues today. Writing after its debut, Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times called it “A stirring grand-guignol type of picture,” recalling that it “aroused so much excitement at the Mayfair yesterday that many in the audience laughed to cover their true feelings.”Frankenweenie 87%Nearly 30 years after a young Tim Burton was fired by Disney for daring to create a freaky live-action short about a young boy who reanimates his dead dog, the studio reached back out to Burton for a stop-motion 3D horror/comedy that took the original, buffed it out to feature length, and turned it into an unlikely critical winner that also managed to put up $67 million at the box office despite falling into the “too young for adults, too scary for kids” trap that studios have been steadily edging away from since the original Gremlins. And even though it represented the umpteenth reworking of the Frankenstein story, most critics were too charmed to care; as Connie Ogle argued for the Miami Herald, “The best thing about an animated monster movie with this much heart is: It’s alive. In the best possible way.”Ghost of Frankenstein 75%Lon Chaney, Jr. took over the role of the monster for 1942’s Ghost of Frankenstein, a sort of road trip buddy picture that sent him on the run with the demented crook-necked Igor (again played by Bela Lugosi, who had somewhat ironically turned down the opportunity to play the monster in the 1931 film) to once again wheedle the reluctant son of Frankenstein (Cedric Hardwycke) into performing an experiment against his better judgment. This time around, Igor wants the monster to receive a fresh brain — Igor’s — and although he initially has other ideas, the doctor eventually gives in, with predictably disastrous results. “It gets the job done with admirable efficiency, no excess of imagination, and all in a compact 67-minute frame, and you really wouldn’t want it to be any longer than that,” wrote a mildly enthusiastic Tim Brayton for Antagony &amp; Ecstasy.The Revenge of Frankenstein 87%Hammer Studios’ second Frankenstein film again featured the icily cool Peter Cushing as the troubled doctor, who opens the film hiding in a small town where he hopes to finally be free to conduct his experiments — only to be discovered by a rival doctor, who instead ends up collaborating with Frankenstein on a new monster. Do things go horribly wrong? Of course they do, but Revenge of Frankenstein‘s predictable denouement didn’t deter praise from critics like Time Out’s David Parkinson, who called it one of Cushing’s best performances and wrote, “the Baron becomes a kind of Wildean martyr, alternating between noble defiance and detached cruelty.”The Rocky Horror Picture Show 79%The cult movie to end all cult movies, 1975’s Rocky Horror Picture Show reimagines Frankenstein as a bawdy, omnisexual musical about a pair of young lovers (Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon) who wind up the unwitting houseguests of the lingerie-sporting transvestite Doctor Frank N. Furter, who unveils his dim-witted (albeit hunky) creation before murdering Meat Loaf. Never destined for box office greatness — yet still probably playing the midnight show at your local oddball-friendly theater — Rocky Horror Picture Show has earned the love of legions of shouting, prop-throwing fans over the years, as well as critical approval from scribes like Time Out’s Trevor Johnston, who bemusedly observed, “A string of hummable songs gives it momentum, [the] admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else.”Son of Frankenstein 95%Boris Karloff booked his final appearance as the monster in 1939’s Son of Frankenstein, which was more or less rushed to theaters after the original re-captivated audiences as a reissued double feature with Dracula in 1938. The movie’s rather crass origins peek through in the plot, which strains the limits of credulity even for the third installment in a monster movie trilogy (Frankenstein’s son inherits his estate and is persuaded to reanimate the monster by a vengeful townie, played by Bela Lugosi), not to mention a deliriously hammy performance by Basil Rathbone in the title role; like the monster itself, it’s the kind of thing that really shouldn’t have been brought to life, but it ended up becoming much more than the sum of its motley parts. “Predictably, with four of the horror genre’s most sinister presences in the cast, this is highly entertaining,” wrote Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, “but Rowland Lee (who made the wonderful Zoo in Budapest) creates a sumptuous, atmospheric tale worthy of following Whale’s originals.”Young Frankenstein 94%Plenty of Frankenstein movies have wandered into camp, but none have been as purposely laugh-out-loud funny as Mel Brooks’ Young Frankenstein. Starring Gene Wilder as the doctor’s grandson, Frederick Frankenstein (pronounced “Fronkensteen,” thank you very much), Cloris Leachman as the duplicitous Frau Blucher, Marty Feldman as cinema’s most perfectly bug-eyed Igor, and Peter Boyle as the soft-shoeing monster with sweet mystery, it sends up the classic tale’s mythology with deep affection and sweet, irresistibly silly aplomb, rendering all further Frankenstein spoofs instantly irrelevant. “Some of the gags don’t work, but fewer than in any previous Brooks film that I’ve seen, and when the jokes are meant to be bad, they are riotously poor,” chuckled Vincent Canby for the New York Times. “What more can one ask of Mel Brooks?”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

In honor of all this Muppet love, we decided to spend this week’s Total Recall paying tribute to the guy who brought them to life way back in the 1950s — writer, director, performer, and puppeteer Jim Henson — and, in particular, the studio he founded. Although his role fluctuated from film to film, Henson’s presence can be solidly felt in every Muppet-related movie — even the ones made after his untimely death in 1990 — and together, they form an enduring tribute to the power of imagination. Let’s play the music, let’s light the lights… it’s time for Total Recall! 63%11. Muppets from SpaceKermit is a frog, Fozzie is a bear, Rowlf is a dog, and Gonzo is a… well, for a long time, nobody seemed to know what he was, really. The mystery was solved with 1999’s Muppets from Space, in which it’s revealed that he’s actually an alien from a distant planet — one whose residents all look like him. Happily, after a suitably madcap plot involving a government agency led by Jeffrey Tambor, Gonzo ended up deciding to stay here on Earth — and although Muppets from Space never took flight at the box office, grossing a disappointing $16.6 million, it enjoyed support from critics like Philip Booth of the Orlando Weekly, who called it “a silly romp that may be just as fun for the younger set as it is for anyone with a nostalgic craving for the antics of the sophisticated puppets.” 73%10. LabyrinthAfter the relative failure of his first non-Muppets feature, 1982’s The Dark Crystal, Henson went all in for his follow-up, enlisting a crew of screenwriting pros (including Elaine May and Monty Python’s Terry Jones), casting David Bowie as the main antagonist, and crafting a sprawling mythology filled with danger, mystery, and fantastical creatures. Unfortunately, all that effort didn’t translate into box office results for Labyrinth, which was lost in a sea of blockbusters and rather lukewarm reviews during its theatrical run; sadly, it ended up being the last film Henson would direct before his untimely death four years later. Still, like so many of Henson’s other works, Labyrinth has acquired a cult following since its release, inspiring everything from a manga trilogy to an annual two-day masquerade ball in its honor — all richly deserved, according to Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who called it “An innovative mix of sophisticated puppetry and special effects” and wrote, “Labyrinth has all the components of classic myth.” 76%9. The Muppet Christmas CarolThe early 1990s were not kind to the Muppet kingdom, claiming puppeteer Richard Hunt (who played Scooter and Beaker, among others, and died in 1992) and Jim Henson, whose shocking pneumonia-related death in 1990 cast a shadow over the company that bears his name — one that, in many ways, still remains. Henson’s daughter Lisa and son Brian assumed the burden of their father’s legacy, and it’s to their immense credit that The Muppet Christmas Carol, released only two years after Jim Henson’s funeral, managed to retain so much of his spirit. Though the Muppets took a back seat to a human cast led by Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, Muppet Christmas offered plenty of vintage franchise humor to liven up what was, at its base, a fairly faithful adaptation of the classic story. “There’s no great show of wit or tunefulness here, and the ingenious cross-generational touches are fairly rare,” admitted Janet Maslin of the New York Times. “But there is a lively kiddie version of the Dickens tale, one that very young viewers ought to understand.” 70%8. Muppet Treasure IslandFour years after adapting Dickens with The Muppet Christmas Carol, the gang gave Robert Louis Stevenson the same treatment with Muppet Treasure Island, in which a crew of familiar human faces (led by Tim Curry, Jennifer Saunders, and Billy Connolly) sets sail for high adventure on the Muppet seas. Though far less Muppet-centric than the original trilogy, Treasure Island still made room for plenty of fan favorites, including Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Sweetums, Lew Zealand, the Swedish Chef, Dr. Teeth, and — of course — Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rowlf, and Gonzo. A modest success at the box office, Treasure Island built on the Muppet comeback started with Christmas Carol while earning positive notices from critics like Susan Wloszczyna of USA Today, who wrote, “Geena Davis and Renny Harlin couldn’t cut it with Cutthroat Island. Steven Spielberg nearly got the hook for Hook. But leave it to Miss Piggy and Kermit to discover uncharted gold in the shipwrecked-pirate genre.” 79%7. The Dark CrystalDespite often being thought of as kids’ stuff, Henson envisioned the Muppets as entertainment for everybody, and his interests were always more varied — and far less mainstream — than many people realized. With 1982’s The Dark Crystal, Henson started pushing the boundaries of puppetry harder than ever, both thematically and technically; it’s a grim, sometimes legitimately frightening fantasy that required a seamless blend of new technology and grueling old-school techniques. Though it ended up being a bit of a confusing turn-off for a large portion of Henson’s Muppet-loving fanbase, and its performance at the box office was stunted by the runaway success of E.T., it’s acquired a devoted cult following over the years; as Gregory Weinkauf argued for the New Times, it “Immerses us in a familiar yet utterly unique world that’s deeper, wider and more vibrantly alive than any mere puppetry.” 77%6. The Adventures of Elmo in GrouchlandIt took the Sesame Street gang nearly 15 years to make their way back to the big screen after Follow That Bird, but when they finally ended their theatrical drought, they did it in style: The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland unites the considerable talents of its adorable furry red star with one of the most over the top performances of Mandy Patinkin’s entire career. Starring as Huxley, the selfish scourge of Grouchland, Patinkin was given free rein to ham it up to his heart’s content — not to mention deliver a few show-stopping musical numbers. “Gary Halvorson’s interactive film strikes a pleasing balance of self-reflexive irreverence and inspired whimsy that’s shown to best advantage in the lesson-laced musical numbers,” wrote Alicia Potter for the Boston Phoenix. “Elmo and his trusty blanket, it seems, have everything covered.” 76%5. The Great Muppet CaperBy the early 1980s, Jim Henson found himself steering a budding media empire: between the massive success of The Muppet Movie, the high-rated The Muppet Show, and continuing praise for Sesame Street, demand for his creations was at an all-time high. The next step, naturally, was a Muppet Movie sequel, which found Henson directing a feature film for the first time — a suitably madcap comedy involving a pair of twin reporters (Kermit and, uh, Fozzie), a jewel thief (Charles Grodin), and the innocent pig framed for his crimes (Miss Piggy, of course). Though The Great Muppet Caper didn’t come anywhere near its predecessor’s $273 million gross, it passed muster with critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who wrote, “The movie contains several more cheery, Disneyesque songs than are necessary, but they are made tolerable by the presence of Kermit and Miss Piggy.” 83%4. The Muppets Take ManhattanThe Muppets’ third big-screen adventure was a film of milestones, both happy (it introduced the Muppet Babies, and marked the solo directorial debut of Frank Oz) and sad (it ended up being the final Muppet movie before Jim Henson’s untimely death in 1990). But in many respects, it held to the formula established by the first two movies — a madcap adventure (in this case, a last-ditch effort to pull off a variety show) assisted by a huge group of human stars (including Dabney Coleman, Elliott Gould, Brooke Shields, Joan Rivers, and Gregory Hines). In other words, The Muppets Take Manhattan gave Muppets fans exactly what they were looking for: as the Chicago Reader’s Reece Pendleton wrote, “The movie is breezily fun and every bit as entertaining as its predecessors.” 88%3. The Muppet MovieThe Muppets made their first journey to the big screen in style, telling their origin story (or, in Kermit’s words, “sort of approximately how it happened”) with a classic Paul Williams soundtrack and an all-star cast that included Charles Durning, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Bob Hope, Milton Berle, 1970s movie mainstay Dom DeLuise, and Orson Welles. That’s a lot of star wattage for a movie unquestionably toplined by puppets, but The Muppet Movie wasn’t kid stuff; it presented a family-friendly blend of sweet-natured drama and sharp, often surprisingly sophisticated humor. Observed Jeffrey M. Anderson for Combustible Celluloid, “Not only was The Muppet Movie a great children’s movie in 1979, one that viewers of all ages could enjoy, but it’s still a great children’s movie today.” 92%2. Follow That BirdTo his immense credit, Henson was never shy about using his creations to explore sensitive themes — even on Sesame Street, which broke television barriers with the way it handled the death of Mr. Hooper in 1983. That tradition was upheld with the first Sesame Street movie, Follow That Bird, in which Big Bird is sent to live with a family of dodos after a social worker decides he needs to be with his own kind — and then he runs away from his new home, inspiring his old friends to mount a cross-country road trip in search of the big yellow fella. Part broad comedy, part heartfelt examination of what it means to be a family, Bird was a surprising disappointment at the box office, where it grossed a mere $13.9 million, but it’s become something of a cult favorite on DVD — and it was always a hit with critics like Walter Goodman of the New York Times, who wrote, “By and large, the script by Tony Geiss and Judy Freudberg and the direction by Ken Kwapis don’t strain for yuks; what they seek, and more often than not attain, is a tone of kindly kidding.” 95%1. The MuppetsWith a tidal wave of nostalgia and years of pent-up Muppet demand hanging over it, 2011’s Jason Segel-led The Muppets had a lot to live up to; fortunately, Segel and co-writer Nicholas Stoller knew exactly how to draw from the characters’ history while bringing them fully into the present — and giving grown-up Muppets fans a handful of sweet new memories in the bargain. Full of all the songs, celebrity cameos, and wacky humor we’ve come to expect from Kermit and the gang, The Muppets was the Muppet movie many filmgoers had given up hope of seeing — it may even have gotten a little dusty in the theater for critics like the Atlantic’s Christopher Orr, who applauded, “The chorus of one of the songs declares, ‘I’ve got everything that I need, right in front of me.’ For 120 minutes, that’s precisely how I felt.”In case you were wondering, here are Brolin’s top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1.

In honor of Ron’s return, we decided to take a look back at some other movies revolving around journalists — and while none of them include chocolate squirrels or baby sharks, they’re all well worth watching in their own right. Stay classy, ’cause it’s time for Total Recall!Absence Of Malice (1981)  81%Media-bashing has become so trendy that you’d almost never know that being part of the Fourth Estate was once regarded as an honorable profession — a public service, even. Of course, that isn’t to say reporters haven’t always been dogged by questions of ethics — and few directors were better at framing a thorny ethical debate than Sydney Pollack, which made him the perfect person to guide the cameras for Absence of Malice, starring Paul Newman as the son of a Mafia boss who is outed as the subject of a murder investigation by an ambitious (and somewhat scruple-deficient) reporter played by Sally Field. Though a large number of critics felt Pollack and screenwriter Kurt Luedtke failed to present a truly compelling picture — and some, like Dennis Schwartz of Ozus’ World Movie Reviews, dismissed it as a “well-meaning liberal message story” — others praised its strong performances and overall intelligence. As James Rocchi wrote, “the ultimate conclusion of the film will leave you thoughtful and even perhaps a touch sad — rare for any film, and even more rare for a thriller.”All the President's Men (1976)  94%Generations of journalists were spawned by the intrepid investigative reporting of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the two Washington Post writers whose dogged pursuit of the Watergate scandal helped fell Richard Nixon’s corrupt administration. Two years after we didn’t have Dick to kick around anymore, screenwriter William Goldman and director Alan J. Pakula collaborated to produce All the President’s Men, a dramatization of Woodward and Bernstein’s book about the case — and thanks in part to an ace ensemble that included Robert Redford as Woodward, Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, and a roster of supporting players rounded out by Jason Robards, Jack Warden, and Hal Holbrook, it ended up becoming a huge (and Academy Award-winning) hit. “A finer political film you will not find,” declared Cinema Sight’s Wesley Lovell. “It should be declared a national treasure.”Broadcast News (1987)  98%Funny, smart, and impeccably cast, Broadcast News might be the prototypical James L. Brooks movie: razor-sharp in terms of its personal insights as well as its broader social statements regarding the massive changes afoot in the television news landscape during the 1980s, it prompted gut-busting laughs while sneaking in thought-provoking (not to mention startlingly prescient) messages, all delivered by a packed roster of brilliantly talented actors that included William Hurt, Holly Hunter, Joan Cusack, and Albert Brooks. “Broadcast News has a lot of interesting things to say about television,” pointed out Roger Ebert, “But the thing it does best is look into a certain kind of personality and a certain kind of relationship.”Citizen Kane (1941)  99%Before the internet came along and turned everything into a circus, a sufficiently motivated person could bootstrap his way into media-magnate riches. Why, just look at Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane, which uses the life of newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst as the inspiration for a finely florid saga about wealth, corruption, insanity, and the quest for lost innocence. Unlike a lot of movies on this list, Kane doesn’t have much to do with the news, but since it’s widely regarded as the finest film ever made, we figured we’d make an exception. As Richard Brody of the New Yorker told it, it’s “An ecstasy of light and shadow, of clashing textures and graphic forms, such as hadn’t been seen since the silent era.”Good Night, And Good Luck (2005)  93%For his second directorial effort, George Clooney took a surprising turn, dramatizing the efforts of legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow to thwart Joseph McCarthy’s Communist witch hunt. Inspired by the increasingly vituperative political atmosphere of the early aughts, Clooney laid more than his career capital on the line for Good Night, and Good Luck — not only did he forsake his usual salary, collecting a dollar apiece for his directorial, screenwriting, and starring roles, but he also went so far as to mortgage his home as collateral. (Well, one of his homes, anyway. But still.) This black-and-white plea for journalistic ethics was a film out of time in the 24-hour cable news era, even with a stellar cast that included Clooney, David Strathairn, Robert Downey, Jr., Patricia Clarkson, and Frank Langella — but it still had enough Luck to rack up six Academy Award nominations and an impressive $54 million worldwide gross, not to mention raves from critics like the Daily Mirror’s David Edwards, who wrote, “George Clooney is emerging as one of America’s bravest, boldest filmmakers. And with this highly-charged political thriller, he’s also emerging as one of its very best.”Groundhog Day (1993)  96%For a modest little comedy that failed to break $100 million at the box office during its theatrical run, Groundhog Day has done pretty well for itself in the 15 years since its release: It’s been added to the United States Film Registry, ranked in the top 40 of the AFI and Bravo “100 Funniest Movies” lists, the top 10 of AFI’s fantasy list, and lauded by Roger Ebert in his “Great Movies” series. Starring a perfectly caustic Bill Murray as a miserable newscaster who falls into a time loop that forces him to relive Groundhog Day — and, of course, learn something about himself in the process, although not before using his newfound awareness of the future in all sorts of brilliantly funny ways — the movie was a sizable box office hit whose pop culture cachet has only grown over the last 20 years, to the point that the annual tradition might now be more closely associated with Murray than Punxsutawney Phil. And for good reason: it remains one of his funniest, most finely tuned performances. In the words of TIME’s Richard Corliss, he “makes the movie a comic time warp that anyone should be happy to get stuck in.”His Girl Friday (1940)  98%Who has time for the news when there’s witty banter to be bantered? Let’s ask His Girl Friday, starring Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell as a pair of wisecracking reporters (and ex-spouses) whose complicated relationship is put to the test by a hot story — right on the eve of Russell’s impending wedding. Future filmmakers attempted to use director Howard Hawks’ effervescent template as a blueprint for remakes, to no avail; there’s simply no substitute for the real thing. As Joshua Rothkopf wrote for Time Out New York, “One is tempted to throw away any semblance of persuasion and simply demand that you go see this movie.”The Insider (1999)  96%Russell Crowe picked up his first Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this Michael Mann film, which dramatizes the real-life story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Crowe), the tobacco executive whose willingness to speak the truth about his industry’s unsavory activities helped lead to a massive financial settlement — and some rather incredible behind-the-scenes drama at CBS News, where a 60 Minutes report on Wigand was temporarily silenced despite the best efforts of producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). As you might imagine, neither Wigand nor Bergman ended up terribly popular with their superiors, and some of the same interests that fought to keep their story silenced also worked to blunt The Insider‘s commercial prospects; in fact, in some cities, Wigand’s former employer sent representatives to screenings of the film to hand out cards directing filmgoers to an 800 number providing a more company-friendly spin on the story. For whatever reason, The Insider never really caught on with audiences, but it was a critical and awards season favorite, netting no fewer than seven Academy Award nominations. Not bad for a movie that, as more than one critic pointed out, spent two and a half hours talking about tobacco. As Andrew Sarris put it in his review for the New York Observer, “What I didn’t expect was an intelligently absorbing entertainment that ran for two hours and 40 minutes, during which I didn’t once look at my watch — just about the highest praise I can bestow upon a film these days.”It Happened One Night (1934)  99%Frank Capra, Clark Gable, and Claudette Colbert — what else do you need? Academy voters of 1934 didn’t want much more than It Happened One Night, awarding this whip-smart screwball comedy all five of the year’s major Oscars. To modern viewers, the plot’s framework — which tosses together a gruff reporter (Gable) and a spoiled heiress (Colbert) on the run from her domineering father (Walter Connolly) — might seem like pretty boilerplate stuff, but you don’t need a high concept when you’re dealing with wit this sharp. And if its ingredients look familiar now, it’s because Night‘s been imitated so often; as James Berardinelli opined for ReelViews, “Its opposites-attract melding of screwball comedy and the road trip elements has become one of about a half-dozen standard love story formulas. Most years, there’s at least one theatrical release that owes a debt to this film.”The Killing Fields (1984)  93%Roland Joffé’s The Killing Fields relays the heartrending true story of the friendship between three journalists — Cambodian Dith Pran (Haing S. Nor), American Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston), and British Jon Swain (Julian Sands) — during the early days of the Khmer Rouge’s rise to power in Cambodia. John Malkovich co-stars in the supporting role of American photojournalist Al Rockoff, who was part of the unsuccessful effort to get Pran out of Cambodia before the regime change; the real-life Rockoff was publicly unhappy with the way he was portrayed, but he was part of a small minority — The Killing Fields was ultimately nominated for seven Oscars, and it became an instant critical favorite. “It must be nerve-racking for the producers to offer a tale so lacking in standard melodramatic satisfactions,” wrote Time’s Richard Schickel, “But the result is worth it, for this is the clearest film statement yet on how the nature of heroism has changed in this totalitarian century.”Network (1976)  91%Much as many of our favorite television pundits like to argue that we’re living in one of the medium’s great golden ages, there’s no denying that wide swaths of the dial have been abandoned and given over to lowest-common-denominator fare. But long before anyone started worrying about trashy talk shows or “reality” TV, screenwriter Paddy Chayevsky had an inkling of the dystopian landscape looming on the horizon — and the result was 1976’s Network, a bitingly bitter satire about a veteran news anchor (Peter Finch) whose unorthodox response to being fired serves as the unintended catalyst for a new era of ever-more-provocative nightly news. “One would assume that a 1976 film about network television would feel dated today,” admitted Forrest Hartman of the Reno Gazette-Journal, “but director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky had such a fine concept that Network seems downright contemporary.”The Paper (1994)  88%Director Ron Howard reunited with his Night Shift star, Michael Keaton, for a very different kind of project in 1994: The Paper, an ensemble dramedy about the frantic goings-on behind the scenes during 24 hours in the life of a New York City newspaper. While things have changed drastically for the publishing industry in the years since The Paper‘s release, rendering the movie’s backdrop rather quaint, the sharp writing (from brothers David and Stephen Koepp) and rock-solid acting — rounded out by a showy cast that also included Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Jason Robards, and Marisa Tomei — are timeless. “Howard, after stumbling with Far and Away, is back in form, and perhaps at the top of his game,” enthused Chris Hicks for the Deseret News. “There are times when the sheer size of the film seems enough to throw it off the track, but Howard manages, for the most part, to keep things rolling along in his usual slick, if sometimes obvious fashion.”Reds (1981)  89%An epic 194-minute biopic about the tortured affair between radical journalists John Reed (Warren Beatty) and Louise Bryan (Diane Keaton) during the early 20th century, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, Reds wasn’t exactly the most commercially friendly film of 1981 — but thanks to positive word of mouth and a stellar cast that also included Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, Gene Hackman, and M. Emmet Walsh, it ended up grossing more than $50 million during its theatrical run, on the way to picking up three Academy Awards (against a dozen nominations). Calling it “Political drama and sweeping romance in one,” Carol Cling of the Las Vegas Review-Journal marveled, “Only Warren Beatty would, or could, do it.”Wag the Dog (1997)  86%We know how great television is at creating images that seem so real we can’t help but believe them in the moment, which makes it the perfect tool for ginning up a distraction — like, say, a fake war — in order to distract American voters from a budding scandal in the Oval Office. That’s the idea behind Wag the Dog, adapted from the Larry Beinhart novel about a commander-in-chief (Michael Belson) whose unfortunate appetite for underage girls leads him to hire a spin doctor (Robert De Niro) who enlists a Hollywood producer (Dustin Hoffman) to whip up a staged conflict in Albania. It seemed a little outlandish at the time, but real-life events would quickly conspire to make Wag seem positively prescient. “Between the laughs,” observed the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, “there are moments that ring so true they can raise goosebumps.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Kaling, Hallmark, stand-up, rotten","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Citizen-Kane.jpg","slug":"total-recall-hollywood-takes-on-the-news"},{"id":"47508972791232","title":"Kenneth Branagh’s Best Films As a Director","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kenneth Branagh's Best Films As a DirectorIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit director.by Jeff Giles | January 16, 2014 |  CommentsLong before Joss Whedon balanced big-budget Marvel epics with arthouse Shakespearean adaptations, Kenneth Branagh got there first — and this weekend, he serves up another popcorn action thriller with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, which reboots the Jack Ryan franchise with Chris Pine in the lead (and Branagh co-starring in a pivotal role). In honor of Mr. Branagh’s latest directorial effort, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a fond look back at some of his more successful features. Yes, there’s plenty of Shakespeare here, but you may not remember just how diverse he’s been — and that’s a big part of why we’re here. It’s time for Total Recall! 38%10. Mary Shelley’s FrankensteinAfter Henry V, Dead Again, Peter’s Friends, and Much Ado About Nothing, Branagh was on a pretty good roll as a director; on paper, turning him loose on Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein seemed like a can’t-miss proposition, especially with none other than Robert De Niro on board to play the monster. But while Branagh’s passionately faithful take on the oft-adapted tale eventually recouped its $45 million budget, it was still regarded as a perplexing misfire in an exciting young career. “Mr. Branagh is in over his head,” wrote a disappointed Janet Maslin for the New York Times. “He displays neither the technical finesse to handle a big, visually ambitious film nor the insight to develop a stirring new version of this story.” 49%9. Love’s Labour’s LostThere’s an element of confident playfulness in all of Branagh’s Shakespeare adaptations, but with 2000’s Love’s Labour’s Lost, he really got wacky, recasting the classic play as a song-and-dance number featuring American Songbook standards like “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” and “The Way You Look Tonight.” It wasn’t exactly the most natural-seeming blend, particularly with a cast that included Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Lillard, and a number of critics responded with pained bewilderment. For others, however, it offered further proof of Branagh’s way with Shakespeare. “The Bard of Stratford’s saga of the four students who swear off women only to have a ton of trouble keeping their promise is dense with dialogue,” wrote Boxoffice’s Mike Kerrigan. “But Branagh axes about two thirds of that — and replaces it with songs by Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, the Gershwins and Jerome Kern. And it’s wonderfully, wildly, winningly entertaining.” 70%8. The Magic FluteMany of Kenneth Branagh’s greatest career achievements have come from embracing the unlikely or unexpected, and 2006’s The Magic Flute is a case in point. How many filmmakers would think to take a Mozart opera and move its setting to the trenches of World War I — and produce a sweet G-rated romance in the bargain? And while its antiquated source material and protracted running time conspired to keep The Magic Flute away from the top of the box office charts, Branagh’s production — timed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Mozart’s birth — managed to blend its disparate elements just often enough to win over a majority of critics. As Stephanie Zacharek put it for Salon, “Even though there were moments in The Magic Flute when I wondered if Branagh hadn’t truly gone off his rocker, I found its audacity exhilarating.” 68%7. Peter’s FriendsBasically a British spin on The Big Chill, only with 1980s nostalgia swapped in for that film’s bittersweet look back at the 1960s, Peter’s Friends found Branagh putting a contemporary slant on the type of ensemble dramedy he’d already proven he could do well with his Shakespeare adaptations. Once again, he reined in a talented and interestingly varied cast, including Stephen Fry, Imelda Staunton, Emma Thompson, and Hugh Laurie, and their almost uniformly sharp grasp of the screenplay’s timelessly resonant themes helped add heft to what might have been an unremarkably derivative film in less accomplished hands. “If the dialogue is witty, if the characters are convincingly funny or sad, if there is the right bittersweet nostalgia and the sense that someone is likely to burst into ‘Those Were the Days,’ then it doesn’t matter that we’ve seen the formula before,” argued Roger Ebert. “This is a new weekend with new friends.” 77%6. ThorIf you’re going to try making a movie about a superhero who often speaks as though he’s a character in a Shakespeare play, you want a director who knows the territory. Of course, Kenneth Branagh had a lot more going for him as the director of Thor than simply a familiarity with iambic pentameter; although he might have seemed a somewhat curious choice for the gig, as the end result demonstrated, his gift for light comedy and sweeping romance helped lend some sweet overtones to what might otherwise have been just another costumed action thriller. As Lisa Kennedy put it for the Denver Post, “[Branagh’s] Shakespearean chops add texture in scenes that require the care and feeding of literature’s grander themes: pride, paternity and honor.” 81%5. In the Bleak Midwinter (A Midwinter’s Tale)After adapting Shakespeare for 1989’s Henry V and 1993’s Much Ado About Nothing, Branagh mixed things up a bit: instead of simply bringing Shakespeare to the screen, 1995’s In the Bleak Midwinter (A Midwinter’s Tale) was about an actor (played by Michael Maloney, serving as a Woody Allen-style Branagh proxy) haplessly trying to mount a production of Hamlet. A meta-laced warmup of sorts for Branagh’s own Hamlet, which would see release the following year, Midwinter offered film fans a funny (albeit admittedly uneven) appetizer that combined old-fashioned comedy and classic prose with a charmingly low-budget visual aesthetic. “There are so many laughs here, so much theatrical temperament on display, that you can’t help but embrace the picture, even with its obvious flaws,” argued Hal Hinson for the Washington Post. 83%4. Dead AgainAn ambitious blend of romantic melodrama and neo-noir with supernatural overtones, Dead Again asked a lot of Branagh — he and co-star Emma Thompson played dual roles, while Branagh the director had to make sure he gave the audience enough visual cues to untangle the fairly complex story of a detective who stumbles across a mute amnesia victim who may or may not have been his wife in a past life. The end result could easily have spiraled into soggy schmaltz or mystical mumbo-jumbo, but Dead Again ultimately kept enough of its plates spinning to draw impressive praise from the majority of critics — including Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote, “As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.” 90%3. Much Ado About NothingFour years after making his directorial debut with Henry V, Branagh returned to the director’s chair for another Shakespeare adaptation: Much Ado About Nothing, an infectiously fleet-footed comedy about star-crossed lovers and royal deceit that, as tends to be his wont, Branagh stuffed with an impressively eclectic roster of stars. On paper, it might have seemed borderline goofy to put Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton, and Denzel Washington together in a film adaptation of a Shakespeare play, but with Much Ado, Branagh made it work. And while the marquee-friendly cast might have made Shakespeare seem a little sexier to younger filmgoers, Branagh backed up all that glitz with a smart, finely crafted take on the play; as Owen Gleiberman wrote for Entertainment Weekly, the director’s “true achievement” with the movie was that he “found his way to the play’s profound yet populist heart, rediscovering Shakespeare’s vision of romantic fulfillment – celebration with an underlying tug of sadness – for an era that believes itself all too wise to the ways of love.” 95%2. HamletTry adapting Hamlet for the screen after all these years, and you’d better bring something special to the table — and to his credit, that’s exactly what writer/director/star Kenneth Branagh did with his 1996 take on the classic Shakespeare play, leaving no dramatic stone unturned in a sprawling four-hour epic boasting the acting talents of an equally hefty ensemble cast that included Kate Winslet, Jack Lemmon, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Richard Attenborough, Judi Dench, Charlton Heston…you get the idea. Although they’d seen it adapted countless times before, critics couldn’t help but be impressed by Branagh’s Hamlet; as James Berardinelli wrote for ReelViews, “I have seen dozens of versions of this play (either on screen or on stage), and none has ever held me in such a grip of awe.” 100%1. Henry VWant to star in a production of Shakespeare’s Henry V? You can always take a page from Kenneth Branagh’s book and take the director’s gig, then cast yourself in the title role. Thankfully, there’s a lot more than ego at play in Branagh’s Henry V, which found him making his directorial debut while surrounding himself with an impeccable cast that included Emma Thompson, Judi Dench, Ian Holm, and Robbie Coltrane. In fact, while a decently mounted Shakespeare adaptation is always a pretty safe ticket to the Fresh side of the Tomatometer, critics were unanimous in their praise for Branagh’s Bard; as Hal Hinson breathlessly enthused for the Washington Post, “Everything about this remarkable production is exhilaratingly unexpected.”In case you were wondering, here are Branagh’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Henry V — 90%2. Hamlet — 90%3. In the Bleak Midwinter (A Midwinter’s Tale) — 89%4. Much Ado About Nothing — 87%5. Dead Again — 78%6. Peter’s Friends — 78%7. Thor — 76%8. The Magic Flute — 66%9.

Given that his appearance opposite Kate Winslet in Jason Reitman’s Labor Day is going wide this weekend, we thought now would be the perfect time to applaud some of the brighter critical highlights in Mr. Brolin’s filmography. Goonies never say die, but they do get Total Recall! 76%10. The GooniesOne of the defining cult classics of the 1980s, The Goonies united a cast of young stars (including Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, and Ke Huy Quan), a slightly older trio (Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, and Brolin), three seasoned character actors (Anne Ramsey, Joe Pantoliano, and Robert Davi), and a heavily made-up former football player (John Matuszak) in the fantastical, Spielberg-inspired tale of a group of kids who go hunting for some legendary pirate treasure in a last-ditch effort to save their families’ homes from a smarmy developer (Curtis Hanson). A fairly big hit in 1985, it’s gone on to enjoy near-mythic status among grown-up kids of the 1980s, and for very good reason: As Ryan Cracknell wrote for Movie Views, “Whether it’s an organ that threatens death if the wrong note is played, a wishing well that talks back to you or a pirate ship, the surface of The Goonies is all about a child’s innocence and faith in the unlikely.” 68%9. Men in Black IIIIt wasn’t exactly a sequel that many people were clamoring for after its relatively underwhelming predecessor, but Men in Black III was pretty much a foregone conclusion once Columbia Pictures finished counting the $441 million generated by Men in Black II. Fortunately — and surprisingly — the series’ third installment turned out to be a creative rebound, using a time-travel twist to send Agent J (Will Smith) back to 1969 in an effort to save Agent K (Brolin, perfectly cast as a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones) from being killed by the nefarious Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement). “Brolin’s performance is funny, masterful, confident, and more than a little unsettling,” marveled Ty Burr in his review for the Boston Globe. “If one human being can sample another, that’s what’s going on here.” 74%8. In the Valley of ElahWriter-director Paul Haggis followed up his Oscar-winning Crash with another sober take on a thorny issue: In the Valley of Elah, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon in the fact-based story of parents desperately trying to uncover the circumstances leading to the death of their son (Jonathan Tucker), a soldier who survived Iraq only to fall victim to a grisly murder. Thwarted by military officials and a disinterested sheriff (Brolin), Jones relies on his own military training — and some help from a compassionate detective (Charlize Theron) — to bring his son’s killers to justice. “It’s a testament to Elah‘s stoicism that the heartbreak at how dishonesty undoes decades of dignity pierces without ever patronizing,” wrote Nick Rogers for Suite101. “It’s an unforgettable, angry film that understands several simple thank-yous can trump eruptive, emotive speeches.” 76%7. The Dead GirlWriter-director Karen Moncrieff earned richly deserved raves for this eminently creepy ensemble drama, starring Brittany Murphy as a murder victim whose lifeless body sends multiple lives spiraling into chaos and heartbreak. Appearing in a supporting role during the movie’s fifth and final segment, Brolin wasn’t given the same amount of screen time he’d be afforded in subsequent films, but for fans of his work, The Dead Girl served as a reminder that he still knew how to pick a decent script. “Those who pass on The Dead Girl are missing something,” warned the Seattle Times’ Moira Macdonald. “Moncrieff has assembled a remarkable (and mostly female) cast, and there are moments in this film that are as powerful as anything currently in theaters.” 76%6. Planet TerrorHow often does a guy have the chance to play an unscrupulous doctor caught in the midst of a genetically engineered psycho outbreak while his wife plots to run off with Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas? Maybe once in a lifetime, if you’re Josh Brolin and you end up starring in Planet Terror, the Robert Rodriguez half of 2007’s Grindhouse, which found Rodriguez working alongside Quentin Tarantino to deliver smut-starved filmgoers a few hours of trashy thrills. “While this is the Grindhouse film that suffers most from being presented solo, it’s still the most fun,” mused Empire’s Nick de Semlyen. “Watch with beer in hand and tongue in cheek for optimal effect.” 81%5. American GangsterPart of the banner year that also found him starring in No Country for Old Men, In the Valley of Elah, and Planet Terror, Ridley Scott’s American Gangster put Brolin in the middle of an impeccably assembled cast that included Denzel Washington (as titular gangster Frank Lucas) and Russell Crowe (as Richie Roberts, the detective whose dogged pursuit of Lucas was unnecessarily complicated by his crooked partner, played by Brolin). With such heavy hitters involved — and a real-life story serving as the inspiration for their on-screen antics — many critics expected more than they got with Gangster, but it was still a sizeable hit at the box office, and for some scribes, Scott’s take on Lucas’ tale was no less powerful for its familiarity. “Scott’s not interested in fireworks,” argued Amy Nicholson for I.E. Weekly, “but small implosions of the soul and ego.” 87%4. Flirting with DisasterIt probably isn’t the first movie that comes to mind when people think of Josh Brolin’s acting career, but give David O. Russell’s Flirting with Disaster this much: It’s the film that gave us the indelible sight of Brolin licking Patricia Arquette’s armpit. Starring Ben Stiller as a man desperate to meet his birth parents and Brolin as a — long story — bisexual ATF agent who ends up wrapped up in Stiller’s quest, Disaster cemented Russell’s early reputation as a guy with a gift for expertly oddball comedies; as Roger Ebert observed, “There are conventions in this sort of story, and Russell seems to violate most of them. He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own.” 93%3. MilkEvery hero needs a villain — and although Brolin has displayed a willingness to play evil on more than one occasion, he might have thought twice about taking the part of Dan White, the unbalanced San Francisco city supervisor who assassinated Harvey Milk (played by Sean Penn) in the horrific 1978 incident that brought Milk’s groundbreaking political career to a heartbreaking end. How do you imbue a guy like White — who went on to make headlines by invoking the infamous “Twinkie defense” during his murder trial — with real humanity? It was Penn who walked away with the Best Actor Oscar, but Brolin picked up a Best Supporting Actor nomination — and his work helped inspire Tom Long of the Detroit News to write, “Progress is slow, but Harvey Milk was one of the first to set the wheels in motion. He more than deserves a movie this good.” 93%2. No Country for Old MenBrolin worked steadily during the 1990s, but for the most part, it was a pretty grim period for his filmography, critically speaking — even when he worked with big-name directors (as he did for Woody Allen’s Melinda and Melinda) or scored roles in high-profile projects (such as The Mod Squad and Hollow Man), the stars didn’t quite align. That all changed with No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers’ adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel about a poor rancher (Brolin) who stumbles across a pile of ill-gotten cash and finds himself in the crosshairs of a psychotic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem). Not exactly the feel-good movie of the year, but No Country hit with a wallop, revitalizing Brolin’s career and reaping a wave of critical hosannas from writers like Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, who enthused, “A masterly tale of the good, the deranged and the doomed that inflects the raw violence of the west with a wry acknowledgement of the demise of codes of honour, this is frighteningly intelligent and imaginative.” 95%1. True GritIf you’re going to remake a movie as well-known (and critically beloved) as John Wayne’s True Grit, you’ll need a few things to make it work, including tons of chutzpah and a whole bunch of talent on the set. Fortunately for filmgoers, the 2010 version of the movie not only satisfied all of the above requirements — with the Coen brothers behind the cameras and an outstanding cast that included Brolin, Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and (making her unforgettable debut) Hailee Steinfeld — but it brought something new to the table in the bargain, focusing on the story as told in Charles Portis’ novel rather than trying to out-Duke the Duke. The result was as charmingly idiosyncratic as you’d expect from the Coens, with Bridges and Damon affecting entertainingly outrageous frontier accents in their characters’ pursuit of the scumbag (Brolin) who murdered the father of a feisty young girl (Steinfeld), and picked up an impressive 10 Oscar nominations. While it didn’t win any, it did earn plenty of accolades from critics like Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir, who wrote, “Some people are expressing amazement that Joel and Ethan Coen would set out to make a classic western in the first place, and then that they’d accomplish it. All I can say is that those folks haven’t been paying attention.”In case you were wondering, here are Brolin’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Goonies — 91%2. Milk — 89%3.

A veteran of stage and screen, Fiennes has amassed an admirably eclectic filmography since making his breakthrough with Schindler’s List in 1993, and while we did draw the line at minor cameo roles (sorry, The Hurt Locker), we think you’ll find a lot to love. Let’s Total Recall, Fiennes style!&nbsp; 77%10. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1After lurking malignantly on the periphery for most of the Harry Potter saga, the evil Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) crept closer to his climactic confrontation with the young wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) during the franchise’s penultimate installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1. And although the story’s construction seemed crass to some — a chunk of the Deathly Hallows book was split out and turned into its own movie, allowing Warner Bros. to reap an extra sequel’s worth of profits from the bestselling series — the move allowed director David Yates to spend another two and a half hours ramping up the grim tension in the last movie’s final battle. Kirk Baird of the Toledo Blade went so far as to call it “the first Harry Potter film that fully delivers on the promise of J.K. Rowling’s works,” crediting it with “expertly balancing a tricky and expansive narrative, along with quiet character moments and some rollicking action sequences.” 77%9. Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixAfter slithering into the spotlight in 2005’s Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Fiennes’ Lord Voldemort returned to wreak havoc anew in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix — and his nefarious schemes received a helpful boost from the Ministry of Magic, whose disbelieving members did everything they could to stamp out rumors of the dark lord’s new lease on life. Denied protection by the adults in his life, Harry has to organize his Hogwarts friends into “Dumbledore’s Army” — and when Dumbledore himself is exiled, Harry is forced into another life-or-death showdown with He Who Must Not Be Named. “With its fifth cinematic outing,” wrote an appreciative James Berardinelli for ReelViews, “the Harry Potter film series has ascended to another level.” 84%8. In BrugesOne of 2008’s best-reviewed limited releases, In Bruges follows the adventures of hitmen Ken (Brendan Gleeson) and Ray (Colin Farrell) who wander through the titular Belgian city while on assignment for mob boss Harry Waters (Fiennes). Things get complicated (and interesting) when Ken realizes he’s been sent there to assassinate Ray — and that’s only the beginning of a tense, brilliantly scripted struggle between the killers and their boss. Nominated for scads of awards, it won the hearts of critics like the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s Colin Covert, who wrote, “If you could hoist a film on your shoulders and parade it through the theater for adulation and hoorays, the new British crime comedy In Bruges would be the one.” 85%7. The English PatientFiennes scored a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his work in this 1996 critic’s favorite, an adaptation of the Michael Ondaatje novel about a geographer (Fiennes) whose past is slowly pieced together by the nurses who mend him back to health after he’s badly burned in World War II. The prototypical Miramax award-winner, The English Patient gave Fiennes the chance to play a role that called for action, romance, and the kind of award-hogging drama that was ripe for parody in an episode of Seinfeld; it was, as Judith Egerton wrote for the Louisville Courier-Journal, “Casablanca set amid the swirling Sahara sands of North Africa and the voluptuous hills of Tuscany.” 84%6. The Constant GardenerFiennes returned to dramatic weepie mode for this adaptation of the John le Carré novel, about a British diplomat who falls in love with a humanitarian worker (Rachel Weisz), takes her to Kenya, and marries her — only to lose her to a grisly murder that hints at the edges of a corporate cover-up. A four-time Academy Award nominee (Weisz won for Best Supporting Actress), The Constant Gardener blended exotic locales with action, politics, and a good old-fashioned love story — and did it well enough to earn praise from critics like Tom Long of the Detroit News, who wrote, “This is not a movie that will shock you or thrill you or rock your world. Instead, it will move you, it will stick with you, it will give you pause and affect you in ways not easily described — which is something the best films always do.” 85%5. SpiderNobody does creepy like David Cronenberg — and even though 2002’s Spider wasn’t one of his more commercially successful ventures, its trippy look at childhood trauma and the untrustworthy nature of memory netted the director some of the best reviews of his career. Likewise Fiennes, who believed so strongly in the project that he gave up his salary for his portrayal of a schizophrenic man making his way back into society while trying to make sense of his troubled past — in place of money, he earned raves from the likes of Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, who called Spider “An artful, carefully regulated explosion of craft led by Miranda Richardson and that prince of prickly intensity, Ralph Fiennes.” 92%4. CoriolanusFiennes swung for the fences with his directorial debut, adapting the Shakespeare tragedy Coriolanus as a modern-day wartime drama about a Roman general whose political ambitions — encouraged by his wheedling mother (Vanessa Redgrave) — lead to his expulsion from the city and, ultimately, the plans for bloody revenge he concocts with his nemesis Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler). It’s the kind of undertaking that’s found many a less fortunate director’s reach exceeding his grasp, but it worked, wresting applause from even the most Bard-crazed critics. “Coriolanus is Shakespeare done right,” enthused We Got This Covered’s Amy Curtis. “Ralph Fiennes takes a play about Roman war and hubris and turns it into a violently charismatic pic.” 96%3. Quiz ShowFiennes followed his starmaking turn in Schindler’s List with Robert Redford’s Quiz Show, a dramatization of the scandal that erupted after a Congressional investigation unearthed tampering behind the scenes of the hit NBC game show Twenty One. As Charles Van Doren, the telegenic professor anointed by the show’s producers to replace reigning champion Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), Fiennes worked with another award-winning director, added another Best Picture nominee to his résumé, and earned raves from critics like Derek Adams of Time Out, who wrote, “Perfectly pitched, the film brims with insight and wit. Highly recommended.” 96%2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2After seven movies and millions upon millions of dollars in box office grosses, stakes were high for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 — and it delivered, with the best reviews of the series and more than $1.3 billion in worldwide ticket sales. It also gave Fiennes his finest hour as the dreadful Voldemort, with a number of dastardly monologues and a long, high-stakes battle between Potter and his lifelong arch-enemy. Sad as they were to see Harry’s story come to a close, most critics couldn’t complain about the way it got there — including Katherine Monk of the Vancouver Sun, who called it “Deeply moving and perfectly phrased at every turn,” and added, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 bids adieu to a little piece of history in first-class style, and a beautifully heavy heart.” 98%1. Schindler’s ListSteven Spielberg, a fan of Fiennes’ previous work, cast him in Schindler’s List as the meddlesome SS captain Amon Göth, whose suspicions — and willingness to accept bribes — help shape Oskar Schindler’s (Liam Neeson) quest to save as many Polish Jews as possible during the Nazi occupation of World War II. Fiennes demonstrated his Method dedication for the role, packing on 30 pounds and submerging himself in the private pain of one of the most notorious war criminals in history. A modern classic, Schindler’s List won seven Academy Awards out of a dozen nominations (including a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Fiennes), as well as almost universal acclaim from critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “Rising brilliantly to the challenge of this material and displaying an electrifying creative intelligence, Mr. Spielberg has made sure that neither he nor the Holocaust will ever be thought of in the same way again.”In case you were wondering, here are Fiennes’ top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Schindler’s List — 97%2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 — 89%3. Quiz Show — 87%4. In Bruges — 86%5. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 — 84%6. The English Patient — 84%7.

Her winsome charm, already put to excellent use in a series of hits that includes The Notebook and Midnight in Paris, returns to the big screen this weekend in the date movie of the season: Richard Curtis’ About Time, a romantic comedy with more on its mind than your average meet-cute. In honor of McAdams’ latest outing, we decided to take a look back at some of the brighter critical highlights from her filmography — which contains a lot more variety than you might expect. It’s time for Total Recall! 53%10. The NotebookMaligned by critics and boyfriends, 2004’s The Notebook positioned Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling for romantic weepie superstardom, placing them opposite one another in a Nick Cassavetes-directed adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks bestseller about star-crossed lovers whose beautifully filmed affair is torn asunder by her controlling parents (and World War II). It’s the kind of stuff that has served as grist for countless Lifetime movies, and not a few scribes rolled their eyes at the swelling music and sweeping cinematography — but for others, The Notebook represented a sensitively assembled, solidly acted paean to a style of filmmaking long out of vogue. Opined an appreciative Rex Reed for the New York Observer, “How rare to see a film that says there is still a value system out there, that being thoughtful and caring is not uncool.” 54%9. Married LifeMcAdams took a stab at a Hitchcock-style psychological thriller with 2008’s Married Life, which found director Ira Sachs co-adapting (with Oren Moverman) John Bingham’s 1953 novel Five Roundabouts to Heaven. Starring Chris Cooper as a middle-aged businessman who embarks on an affair with a pretty young war widow (McAdams), this WWII-set picture takes a dark turn when Cooper’s character decides he wants to end his marriage, but can’t bear to hurt his wife — so he decides to poison her instead, and makes the crucial mistake of telling his friend (Pierce Brosnan), whose own libido ends up putting everyone at risk. “The roundelay structure and Hitchcockian nods could have easily given way to a sardonic puppet theater,” admitted CinePassion’s Fernando F. Croce, “but Sachs and Moverman care too much about their characters to turn them into pawns.” 55%8. Morning GloryRemember the cheerfully old-fashioned, beautifully shot workplace comedies of the 1980s? So does Aline Brosh McKenna. The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter scripted this comfortingly old-school entry in the genre, helmed by Notting Hill director Roger Michell and featuring a cast of pleasantly familiar faces. Starring McAdams as the button-cute executive producer of a flailing national morning show, Harrison Ford as the curmudgeonly new co-host, and Diane Keaton as the show’s put-upon longtime anchor, Morning Glory tapped into a neglected filmmaking vein once regularly drawn upon by everyone from James L. Brooks to Mike Nichols. Unfortunately, in spite of its impressive pedigree, Glory failed to find favor with many critics, and its middling grosses seemed to suggest that modern moviegoers were no longer all that interested in the travails of a heel-kicking upper middle-class gal and her lovably dysfunctional co-workers. Still, it found its defenders, among them Dave White of Movies.com, who wrote, “Ford is a snarling cartoon version of his grim political thriller self played for laughs. And McAdams is no Mary Tyler Moore, but she’s just this side of being that appealing.” 59%7. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of ShadowsWhile it didn’t offer as much screen time as some of her other projects, McAdams’ return to the role of Irene Adler for the Sherlock Holmes sequel, A Game of Shadows, added another top-grossing feature to her résumé — and her rumored million-dollar payday further cemented her status as one of the more in-demand young actors in Hollywood. And although Shadows suffered from the same diminishing critical returns as many sequels, its blend of dark mystery and thrilling action proved sufficiently potent for critics like Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News, who argued, “Ritchie’s franchise — 7% classic formula, 93% adrenaline — is smart in a showoffy way that flatters its star as well as its audience.” 69%6. Sherlock HolmesOver 100 years after he made his debut on the printed page, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective got the CGI-assisted blockbuster treatment in the aptly titled Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the intrepid sleuth and Jude Law as his faithful sidekick Watson. Joined by Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler and assisted by Guy Ritchie’s action-heavy direction, Holmes made solving 19th-century mysteries cool again — and entertained critics such as Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic, who wrote, “Playing literature’s greatest detective as a sort of self-loathing action hero, Downey has an absolute blast. And thanks to his performance in Sherlock Holmes, so do we.” 76%5. Wedding CrashersR-rated comedies enjoyed a box office renaissance after the turn of the century — including Wedding Crashers, which put stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson square in their respective wheelhouses with a storyline about a pair of lecherous buddies whose fondness for shacking up with bridesmaids hits a snag when they meet a pair of sisters (Isla Fisher and McAdams) whose formidable charms prompt some painful re-evaluation. Though some critics had problems with Crashers‘ uneven tone — and the scads of gratuitous flesh on display in the movie’s opening montage — most found it too much fun to resist. “The likes of the sneakily subversive Wilson and Vaughn deserve better,” wrote MaryAnn Johnson of Flick Filosopher, “but this is darn close to a perfect showcase for what they can do, and how much better they do it together.” 79%4. Red EyeRed Eye put director Wes Craven back behind the cameras following a five-year break — and delivered a taut, claustrophobic thriller about a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) who finds herself sitting next to a terrorist (Cillian Murphy) on an overnight flight. The tight-focused setup of Carl Ellsworth’s script eventually gives way to an overblown final act involving an assassination attempt (and an underwater missile), but most critics didn’t mind; as Roger Ebert wrote, “After a summer of crashes, bangs, endless chase scenes and special effects that belittle the actors standing in front of them, what a pleasure to see characters in a thriller doing what people like themselves possibly could do.” 84%3. Mean GirlsRomantic dramas and teen comedies don’t get a lot of critical love, but McAdams struck gold with entries from both genres in 2004, smooching a sun-dappled Ryan Gosling in The Notebook and piling on the lip gloss to play the strikingly pretty leader of a perfectly vapid high school clique in Mean Girls. Lindsay Lohan got the lion’s share of the attention for her solid work as Cady Heron, the bookish recent transplant who struggles to fit in with the popular crowd at her new school, and Tina Fey earned plenty of praise for her funny, smartly written script. But Mean Girls wouldn’t be Mean Girls without its mean girls, and that McAdams-led trio (rounded out by Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert) was a big part of what made the movie for critics like the Globe and Mail’s Liam Lacey, who called McAdams “deliciously evil” in the role. 84%2. State of PlayTimes are tough for reporters in the real world, but in Hollywood, they’re still good for the occasional hard-bitten thriller. Case in point: Kevin Macdonald’s State of Play, which adapts the BBC miniseries about a reporter (Russell Crowe) and his young mentee (McAdams) investigating the death of a Capitol Hill staffer (Maria Thayer) who had been involved in an extramarital affair with a Congressman (Ben Affleck). Loaded with enough old-school intrigue to provoke a slew of All the President’s Men comparisons, State of Play is the kind of thinking man’s thriller that’s all too rare these days (and with an $87 million gross against its $60 million budget, it’s painfully easy to see why studios have lost interest). Even if audiences weren’t in the mood for a political murder mystery, most critics were taken with Play, including Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail, who wrote, “Even if you don’t normally bother with movies, cheer yourself up by seeing this. There hasn’t been a more engrossing or intelligent political thriller in the past three decades.” 93%1. Midnight in ParisWoody Allen endured some relatively bumpy years during the 1990s and early aughts, but things turned around for 2011’s Midnight in Paris, a late-period smash that brought Allen some of the warmest reviews (and the highest grosses) of his career while telling the the fantasy-infused comedic tale of an ennui-addled screenwriter (Owen Wilson) whose rocky relationship with his dismissive fiancee (McAdams) sends him out for a melancholic walk on the streets of Paris, where he ends up taking much more of a journey than he bargained for. “Woody Allen seemed to have lost his fizz as a filmmaker of late,” observed Jason Best for Movie Talk, “and then he uncorked the sparkling Midnight in Paris, a comic fantasy with all the effervescence of vintage champagne.”In case you were wondering, here are McAdams’ top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Notebook — 84%2. Midnight in Paris — 82%3. Sherlock Holmes — 78%4. Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows — 77%5. State of Play — 71%6. Wedding Crashers — 69%7. Mean Girls — 66%8. Red Eye — 65%9.

With so many distinguished entries in his lengthy filmography, it was hard to narrow things down, but even if it presented us with some tough choices, this is one list of definitive films that truly lives up to its name.The Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%1972’s The Godfather&nbsp;was an instant classic, taking home three Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and earning universal critical acclaim — so even if The Godfather Part II&nbsp;had been an absolute failure, Francis Ford Coppola would have deserved credit for extreme chutzpah. Happily for all of us, this turned out to be the rare case where there was another film’s worth of story to tell. Working with Godfather author Mario Puzo, Coppola managed to add a prequel to the original (starring De Niro as a younger version of Vito Corleone) while continuing its story, and the result was a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for De Niro — and one of the very few must-see sequels in American film. “It has an even broader scope than the original,” observed Jeffrey M. Anderson for the San Francisco Examiner, “but does not fail in its depiction of small, intimate moments and surprising emotional reveals.”Watch TrailerTaxi Driver (1976)  96%Deeply unsettling and unrelentingly bleak, Taxi Driver&nbsp;captivated critics and audiences — and earned four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor — by plunging viewers into the waking nightmare of alienation, obsession, and violence experienced by its central character, troubled loner Travis Bickle. Not exactly family fare, in other words, but a film that very much reflected the disillusionment and general unease of its time — and that remains painfully relevant after several decades, as noted by the Apollo Guide’s Dan Jardine: “Its themes of urban decay, anomie and violence which infuse the impending sense of doom at the heart of this film still hang like black clouds over many cities today.”Watch TrailerThe Deer Hunter (1978)  92%De Niro picked up a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award nomination for his work in The Deer Hunter&nbsp;— one of nine nominations the film received against five wins, including Best Picture — continuing a critically acclaimed run that included his Oscar-winning appearances in The Godfather Part II&nbsp;and Raging Bull. Like those films, The Deer Hunter&nbsp;is a challenging, confrontational drama that poses uncomfortable questions in occasionally quite uncomfortable ways, using its main characters (played by De Niro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage) to grapple with the ghosts of the Vietnam War and the uncertain economic climate in late ’70s America. “It has no more moral intelligence than the Clint Eastwood action pictures,” argued Pauline Kael for the New Yorker, “yet it’s an astonishing piece of work, an uneasy mixture of violent pulp and grandiosity, with an enraptured view of common life — poetry of the commonplace.”Watch TrailerRaging Bull (1980)  93%A viscerally violent, ruthlessly gripping, adrenaline-soaked depiction of one man’s self-destructive spiral, Raging Bull&nbsp;represents what can happen when a star believes in a project enough to fight for it — and when a director believes he’s down to his last chance at redemption, not only as a filmmaker but as a human being. De Niro won a Best Actor Oscar for his mesmerizing turn as real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, and it’s easy to understand why — even without the 70 pounds he packed on to play LaMotta’s post-retirement years, his commitment to the role is impossible to miss. Just as impressive is Scorsese’s work, which earned him a Best Director nomination (and the film a Best Picture nomination); this is a movie that presents a protagonist who is essentially unlikeable and wholly relatable in equal measure, and dares the viewer to look away. As Amy Taubin wrote for the Village Voice, “The most obvious basis for the film’s claim to greatness lies in Scorsese’s devastating critique of the very codes of masculinity that shaped him as a filmmaker, and in Robert De Niro’s performance, through which that critique is made flesh.”Watch TrailerOnce Upon a Time in America (1984)  87%Director Sergio Leone pursued Once Upon a Time in America&nbsp;through over a decade of development after falling in love with the source material, Harry Grey’s novel The Hoods, and at one point envisioned completing it as a pair of three-hour films — a fittingly expansive running time for the epic saga of a group of Jewish kids who rise from penny-ante hoods in 1920s Manhattan and later grow up to become key figures among the city’s organized crime element. Portraying main character David “Noodles” Aaronson, De Niro anchored a solid ensemble cast that also included James Woods and Elizabeth McGovern, but none of them were enough to overcome the array of edits faced by the film after Leone turned it in to the studio — including the American edit, which rearranged the storyline into chronological order and trimmed the whole thing down under two hours and 20 minutes. In more recent years, a restored 251-minute version has seen release, finally allowing audiences to experience a closer approximation of its director’s vision. As John Hartl wrote for Film.com, “Seeing what Leone always intended is like getting your dirty glasses washed.”Watch TrailerMidnight Run (1988)  94%Robert De Niro has always been a magnet for tough-guy roles, but he’s also very funny — and although he had an early opportunity to prove it with The King of Comedy, he flashed his comic chops in earnest with 1988’s Midnight Run, which found him playing a tightly wound bounty hunter who tracks down a mobster-swindling accountant (Charles Grodin), only to watch in exasperation as his supposedly easy gig unravels into a miserable odyssey of bickering, property destruction, and close calls with the wrong side of the law. But at the box office, things only went right for Run, where it earned more than $80 million — and it performed just as well with critics like Luke Y. Thompson of the New Times, who wrote, “When it comes to odd-couple action comedies, this is pretty much the epitome of how to do it.”Watch TrailerGoodFellas (1990)  96%De Niro reunited with Martin Scorsese — as well as his Raging Bull&nbsp;and Once Upon a Time in America&nbsp;costar, Joe Pesci — for this masterfully frenetic look at life in the Mafia through the eyes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a onetime mobster who rose through the ranks as a young man before famously turning informant in the early ‘80s. Scorsese employed a stellar ensemble cast for Goodfellas, including a number of future stars (among them Samuel L. Jackson), but the movie’s real draw came from the terrible true story at its center, and how convincingly the seductive pull of the criminal lifestyle was portrayed. “You walk away,” wrote Richard Schickel for TIME Magazine, “tantalized by a view into the darkest part of yourself, glad that that part is still behind bars.”Watch TrailerA Bronx Tale (1993)  97%De Niro made his directorial debut with this mob-themed coming-of-age drama, adapted by Chazz Palminteri (who also starred) from his one-man Broadway show. As Lorenzo Anello, the upstanding, no-nonsense father of a boy who continually finds himself drawn into the orbit of a local gangster (Palminteri), De Niro was able to play another side of a story he’d helped tell on numerous occasions before — and while it wasn’t a major commercial success during its theatrical run, it earned praise from most critics, including Clint Morris of Film Threat, who called it “a superb debut and “a gripping movie” and arguing, “De Niro proves to be just as much a force behind the camera as he does in front of it.”Watch TrailerHeat (1995)  87%The ensemble heist thriller that most ensemble heist thrillers wish they were, Michael Mann’s Heat&nbsp;would have been noteworthy even if all it did was bring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino together for a few scenes. Happily, the movie’s much more than that: Mann juggles his incredible cast (which also included Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd, and Jon Voight) as deftly as he manages the many moving parts in a storyline pitting a dogged cop who’s sacrificed his family for his career (Pacino) against a notorious criminal (De Niro), topping the whole thing off with stellar cinematography that makes Los Angeles look positively incredible. “Just when it seemed that the only hope for crime movies lay in the postmodernist artifice of films like Pulp Fiction, Mann reinvests the genre with brooding, modernist conviction,” applauded Newsweek’s David Ansen. “This one sticks to your gut.”Watch TrailerSilver Linings Playbook (2012)  92%On the whole, De Niro had a fairly grim 2012 at the box office, appearing in a string of duds that spanned the genre spectrum from dark thriller (Red Lights) to light comedy (New Year’s Eve). But there was a gem in this rough patch: David O. Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook, the Oscar-winning dramedy about a troubled teacher (Bradley Cooper) who develops an unexpected friendship with a young neighborhood widow (Jennifer Lawrence) after he’s institutionalized following the collapse of his marriage. De Niro’s appearance as Cooper’s Philadelphia Eagles-loving dad was unquestionably a supporting role, but one that required a surprising amount of dramatic heavy lifting — which the old master proved ready and willing to provide. “I suppose the phrase ‘serious romantic comedy’ sounds like a paradox,” admitted Linda Cook of the Quad City Times, “but that’s exactly what Silver Linings Playbook is: an intelligent, edgy dark comedy with romance at its core.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"drama, Rocky, 2020, fresh, Star, monsters, Country, TruTV, BBC, 2017, Christmas","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Robert-DeNiro.jpg","slug":"definitive-robert-de-niro-movies"},{"id":"47508974386633","title":"Kevin Kline’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Kevin Kline's Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Last Vegas star.by Jeff Giles | October 31, 2013 |  CommentsMichael Douglas, Robert De Niro, and Morgan Freeman’s names might come first in the posters for this weekend’s Last Vegas, but the fourth name on that list boasts a pretty impressive résumé in his own right. In fact, with an Oscar and a pair of Tonys to his credit, Kevin Kline is one of the better-resprected actors of his generation — which is exactly why we decided to dedicate this week’s list to a look at some of the brightest critical highlights from his distinguished career. 71%10. In &amp; OutHoward Brackett (Kevin Kline) seems to have it made — he’s a well-liked English teacher and coach at his small-town high school, with a wedding to his fiancee (Joan Cusack) on the horizon and a former student (Matt Dillon) up for an Academy Award. But Howard’s world comes unglued after his ex-pupil uses the Oscar telecast to tell the world that Howard’s gay — a revelation that proves shocking for everyone, most of all Howard, who thinks of himself as heterosexual. A comedy of errors ensues, ably supported by a cast that also includes Tom Selleck and Bob Newhart, and although it’s a premise that probably wouldn’t fly today, it was handled so nimbly by director Frank Oz and writer Paul Rudnick that most critics couldn’t complain too much. “A man questioning his own sexuality does not seem like the ideal topic for a comedy,” admitted Cinematter’s Madeleine Williams. “But with a good script, and plenty of humor, In &amp; Out tackles this touchy subject matter with aplomb.” 76%9. SilveradoOnce you cast Brian Dennehy as your movie’s bad guy, you’ve won half the battle. Fortunately for Silverado director/co-writer Lawrence Kasdan, he also managed to line up a pretty capable cast of heroes for his stylishly assembled Western. Kevin Kline, Kevin Costner, Scott Glenn and Danny Glover all saddled up and rode against Dennehy’s crooked sheriff, and even the supporting cast managed to shine, with memorable turns from Jeff Goldblum, Linda Hunt, and Rosanna Arquette. Westerns weren’t exactly in vogue during the mid-’80s — especially ones as unabashedly retro as this one — but according to most critics, Silverado made it work; as Roger Ebert wrote, “This is a story, you will agree, that has been told before. What distinguishes Kasdan’s telling of it is the style and energy he brings to the project.” 81%8. The Pirates of PenzanceThe next time you find yourself wondering why more big movies don’t premiere on-demand at the same time they’re in theaters, think about The Pirates of Penzance. A film adaptation of the Broadway hit, starring most of the original stage cast, it bowed to widely positive reviews; problem was, it had a hard time holding on to theatrical engagements due to Universal’s decision to simultaneously send the movie to a pay-TV service. Thus did ticked-off theater owners opt to shun our cinematic Pirates, and lo did the audience suffer — at least in the estimation of most critics, who felt that the cast (including Kline, Linda Ronstadt, Angela Lansbury, and Rex Smith) did a fine job of bringing the stage musical to the screen. In addition to a “well made musical,” Michael A. Smith of Nolan’s Pop Culture Review deemed it “Proof that Kline can do ANYTHING!” 76%7. Cry FreedomThe life of legendary anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko got its big-screen due with Richard Attenborough’s Cry Freedom, starring Denzel Washington as Biko and Kline as Biko’s journalist friend Donald Woods, whose books formed the basis for John Briley’s screenplay. Although it arrived at a moment when the South African government’s racially oppressive policies were under particularly harsh scrutiny on the international stage, Freedom‘s stark drama proved a tough sell for American filmgoers, who mostly failed to turn out during its theatrical run. Critics found it problematic due to what Roger Ebert termed its “liberal yuppie” focus, although he went on to admit, “Cry Freedom is a sincere and valuable movie, and despite my fundamental reservations about it, I think it probably should be seen.” 78%6. Sophie’s ChoiceOne of the heaviest Holocaust movies of the 1980s, Sophie’s Choice found writer/director Alan J. Pakula adapting William Styron’s heartbreaking novel into an equally shattering film, starring Meryl Streep as the titular protagonist, Kline as her emotionally unwell lover, and Peter MacNicol as the young novelist whose arrival at their Brooklyn boarding house coincides with a particularly fraught period in their lives. While its sad story and deliberate pace proved an unappealing blend for some scribes, most critics were won over by the movie’s stellar performances, led by Streep’s Oscar-winning work. “Though it’s far from a flawless movie, Sophie’s Choice is a unified and deeply affecting one,” wrote Janet Maslin for the New York Times, “thanks in large part to Miss Streep’s bravura performance, it’s a film that casts a powerful, uninterrupted spell.” 77%5. Grand CanyonIn 1991, Kline reunited with his Silverado director Lawrence Kasdan for a very different kind of project: Grand Canyon, a thoughtful ensemble drama about a group of Los Angelenos (including Kline’s Silverado castmate Danny Glover) thrown together across racial backgrounds and class lines. Though not without superficial similarities to Kasdan’s 1983 hit The Big Chill, Canyon found the writer/director in a gloomier state of mind, observing the country’s widening income gap with just enough compassion to overcome his script’s more heavy-handed moments. “Even when he wasn’t trying, Kasdan’s camera found tragedy, as with the opening footage of Magic Johnson, filmed before anybody knew he had the AIDS virus,” observed the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley. “The filmmaker and his team have truly caught society on the verge.” 81%4. A Prairie Home CompanionOne of America’s longest-running radio programs celebrated its 31st birthday in style with this Robert Altman-directed ensemble dramedy, an artful blend of fact and fiction that dramatizes one very important night behind the scenes. Completed mere months before Altman’s death, it provided a worthy closing statement for one of Hollywood’s most dignified careers — and gave Harrelson an opportunity to rub shoulders with a cast that included Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Tommy Lee Jones, John C. Reilly, and Kline. “It sparkles with a magic all its own as an engagingly performed piece of Midwestern whimsy and stoicism,” wrote Andrew Sarris for the New York Observer, adding, “Mr. Altman’s flair for ensemble spectacle and seamless improvisation in the midst of utter chaos is as apparent as ever.” 85%3. The Ice StormHe probably wasn’t the first director that anyone expected to weigh in with a trenchant observation on the American cultural mores of the 1970s, but that’s exactly what Ang Lee did with 1997’s The Ice Storm — an impeccably cast, sensitively filmed adaptation of the acclaimed Rick Moody novel about the largely unspoken divisions festering in a well-to-do suburban Connecticut family headed up by former Dave castmates Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. Replete with sadness and populated by deeply flawed characters, Storm could have been an unintentional parody of the 1990s indie scene in less capable hands — but instead, as Rick Groen wrote for the Globe and Mail, it’s “a remarkable film that takes us straight into John Updike territory, duplicating on screen exactly what the writer achieves on the page.” 95%2. A Fish Called WandaKline picked up a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his work in A Fish Called Wanda, a feat made all the more impressive by the stellar company he’d been keeping onscreen — with a cast that included Jamie Lee Curtis, John Cleese, and Michael Palin, this heist caper about bumbling jewel thieves boasted one of the decade’s more remarkable comedic pedigrees. Cleese, who wrote the script and co-directed with Charles Chrichton (both earning Oscar nominations along the way), put all these ingredients to work in the best way — namely, by bringing some very funny people together and giving them some very silly things to do. “Wanda defies gravity, in both senses of the word, and redefines a great comic tradition,” marveled TIME Magazine’s Richard Schickel. 95%1. DaveDave is nothing if not laughably unrealistic — a temp agency owner (Kline) stands in for the President, hires an accountant to fix the federal budget, and dreams up a jobs bill that will provide work for anyone who wants it, making the First Lady (Sigourney Weaver) fall for him along the way — but even in the go-go 1990s, it appealed to our best and brightest hopes for our elected leaders, and in today’s vituperative political climate, it’s more of a funny, warm ‘n’ cuddly fable than ever. Janet Maslin of the New York Times was certainly charmed during its original release, admitting that “In spite of this sogginess, and despite a self-congratulatory, do-gooder streak that the film discovers within Dave, this comedy remains bright and buoyant much of the way through.”In case you were wondering, here are Kline’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Life as a House — 86%2. Sophie’s Choice — 86%3. Cry Freedom — 85%4. The Ice Storm — 79%5. A Fish Called Wanda — 77%6. The Big Chill — 76%7. Silverado — 75%8. The Pirates of Penzance — 75%9.

His reach has occasionally exceeded his grasp, but few careers can boast a range extending from Dumb and Dumber to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And with his appearance as the Colonel in Kick-Ass 2 bowing this weekend, we decided there was no time like the present to take a look at the best-reviewed films of Jim Carrey’s career!10. Man on the Moon (1999)  63%For most of the 1980s and 1990s, Andy Kaufman was a little-remembered comic, mostly known for his portrayal of dimwitted immigrant mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC sitcom Taxi — but the late 1990s witnessed a resurgence in interest surrounding Kaufman’s often pioneering work, thanks to a pair of biographies, a handful of DVD reissues, and the R.E.M.-referencing Man on the Moon. Carrey continued his 1990s run of prestige pictures with Moon, subsuming himself so completely into the role of the inscrutable Kaufman that most critics were willing to forgive the movie’s fuzzy, weightless middle, its fudging of certain facts, and a few fumble-fingered attempts at going meta. Although many scribes were quick to point out the movie’s flaws — and Kaufman’s all-too-apparent flaws as a protagonist — praise for Moon‘s star was all but universal, typified by Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid, who applauded, “Carrey gets inside Kaufman’s skin.”Watch Trailer9. Dumb and Dumber (1994)  68%Sea Bass! Part of Carrey’s 1994 trilogy of broad-as-a-barn, occasionally revolting comedies, Dumb and Dumber paired the rising star with Jeff Daniels as a couple of well-meaning dimwits who stumble into a cross-country adventure involving Lauren Holly and a briefcase full of cash. While not quite the across-the-board smash that There’s Something About Mary turned out to be a few years later, Dumb and Dumber still managed to include enough charm between the goofy jokes to reach 64 percent on the Tomatometer. It didn’t win any points for smarts, obviously, but that was beside the point — as recognized by writers such as Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who noted that “Carrey…does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm.”Watch Trailer8. Earth Girls Are Easy (1989)  69%You might be surprised to find this late-night cable mainstay on a list that includes cult favorites like The Cable Guy and box-office champs like Bruce Almighty, but the Tomatometer does not lie, and critics cheered loudly enough to send this 1989 cult classic all the way up to 65 percent. Although quite a few scribes sniffed at at Earth Girls are Easy‘s low ambitions and thick layer of cheese, a greater number were able to grin and bear Julien Temple’s brightly colored send-up of hokey sci-fi and 1980s life in the San Fernando Valley. As a furry red alien named Wiploc, Carrey received one of his first major chunks of screen time here, and although his efforts were rewarded with minimal box-office success, he did get to trade lines with Geena Davis and Julie Brown — and help earn some delightfully backhanded praise from the likes of Luke Y. Thompson of the New Times, who declared the film to be “stupid but wonderful.”Watch Trailer7. I Love You Phillip Morris (2010)  71%Between Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in 2004 and the end of the decade, Jim Carrey had a pretty rough go of it, vacillating between rehashed broad comedies like Yes Man and ill-advised dramatic fare like The Number 23 — and the best live-action project he booked during that span, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa’s I Love You Phillip Morris, ended up gathering dust in the studio vaults for years. Given that it dramatizes the real-life, stranger-than-fiction love affair between a cop-turned-con man (Carrey) and his charismatic prison cellmate (Ewan McGregor), it’s unsurprising (but still disappointing) that Morris would have a hard time finding a spot on the release schedule — and the minimal box office returns generated by its limited theatrical run seemed to reinforce Hollywood’s belief that audiences weren’t ready for a darkly comic dramedy about a homosexual love affair. Morris resonated with most critics, however — particularly Carrey’s work, lauded by Stephen Holden of the New York Times when he wrote, “With his manic glare, ferociously eager smile, hyperkinetic body language and talent for instant self-transformation, Mr. Carrey has rarely been more charismatic on the screen.”Watch Trailer6. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004)  72%It was a bit of a non-starter at the box office, failing to recoup its $140 million budget with its domestic receipts, but few roles in the history of children’s fiction have ever been better-suited to an actor than the villainous master of disguise known as Count Olaf and his on-screen counterpart, Jim Carrey. Although A Series of Unfortunate Events drew the ire of some fans of the books for softening their frequently nasty edges, it remains a visual feast, as well as a tour de force for Carrey, who was able to take advantage of his manic energy in a way not seen since his mid 1990s heyday. A sequel remains in development limbo, but don’t let Hollywood’s cold feet keep you from giving Unfortunate a rental — as the Reno Gazette-Journal’s Forrest Hartman put it, “not many children’s movies center on recently orphaned children delivered to the home of a homicidal thespian. Then again, not many children’s movies are as good as this one.”Watch Trailer5. The Mask (1994)  79%One of the only films to ever net its star nominations from both the Golden Globes and the Golden Raspberries, 1994’s The Mask presented filmgoers with something of an early 1990s trifecta: State of the art special effects, some marvelously over-the-top mugging from Jim Carrey, and a heaping helping of va-va-va-voom from instant star Cameron Diaz, who turned Carrey’s nebbishy bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss into a leering Tex Avery wolf (and had roughly the same effect on male viewers). It’s loud and far from subtle, but The Mask is also a lot of fun, not least because Carrey’s impossibly limber performance ultimately proves to be as much of a special effect as anything else on the screen. Variety’s Leonard Klady spoke for many of his peers when he summed it up as “adroitly directed, viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun.”Watch Trailer4. Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! (2008)  80%Carrey’s first brush with a Seuss-inspired adaptation didn’t go so well, which may have scared a few viewers away from the CG-animated Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who! — but it was their loss, as attested by the mostly quite positive reviews that greeted the second film adaptation of this timeless tale of a good-hearted elephant who teaches his detractors that “a person’s a person, no matter how small.” As Horton’s voice, Carrey did a better job of adding marquee value than bringing hidden layers of meaning to his character, and critics were quick to point out that Horton suffers most of the same difficulties that are bound to trouble a 90-minute film based on an illustrated short story, but for most, the movie’s charms proved impossible to resist — such as Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide, who happily reported that “taking on Seuss has proven a challenge for Hollywood, but a nice balance has been struck here between authenticity and new ideas. This one’s a winner.”Watch Trailer3. Liar Liar (1997)  82%Given that Carrey and Liar Liar director Tom Shadyac had previously collaborated on Ace Ventura, a person could have been forgiven for assuming that their reunion would rely on the same scatalogical humor and over-the-top physical comedy that the world’s most famous pet detective rode to box-office riches…and they would have been right, to an extent, although Liar Liar features a much softer-edged version of Carrey’s manic persona. It isn’t his sharpest comedy, but at this point, even critics who had grown accustomed to hating Carrey’s work found themselves surprisingly susceptible to his charms — most notably Roger Ebert, who wrote “I am gradually developing a suspicion, or perhaps it is a fear, that Jim Carrey is growing on me.” Filmgoers had no such fear, driving this family-friendly tale of a pathological fibber rendered unable to lie for a day to global grosses in excess of $300 million.Watch Trailer2. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)  92%While he spent the early 1990s mugging it up for fans of perfectly obvious comedy, few people could have guessed that Jim Carrey would wind up sharing top billing with one of the premier actresses of her generation in a mindbending, critically beloved drama about the nature of love and memory — but that’s exactly what he did in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, going toe to toe with Kate Winslet in one of the most unusual and eye-catching films of the early aughts. Armed with a script co-written by Charlie Kaufman, director Michel Gondry riddles the film with stunning visual effects that, depending on what you want out of the movie, either deepen its metaphorical layers of meaning or are simply really cool to look at. It’s admittedly too strange and/or chilly to appeal to everyone, but at its heart, the movie lives up to Mariko McDonald of Film Threat’s assessment of it as “fresh, heartfelt and ultimately heartbreaking in its honest portrayal of a modern relationship.”Watch Trailer1. The Truman Show (1998)  95%Is it science fiction? A comedy? A drama? A psychiatric syndrome? Actually, 1998’s The Truman Show is all of the above — which has a lot to do with why it’s not only the best-reviewed film of Jim Carrey’s career, but a high-water mark for 1990s cinema in general. Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of a wildly popular reality series engineered by a producer named Christof (played by Ed Harris), in which Truman’s life — complete with fake wife, fake friends, and a whole fake town — is lapped up by eager audiences. It didn’t net Carrey the Academy Award that many were anticipating, but The Truman Show has endured over the last 10 years, and predicted the overwhelming popularity of reality television in the years to come. In the words of Hollywood Report Card’s Ross Anthony, “this is clearly one of the decade’s cleverest, most original pictures.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Moore, america, Paramount, Fox, Con, Plus, talk, movies, Fresh, Dates, Brie, dragons, A24, reviews","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Jim-Carrey.jpg","slug":"jim-carreys-best-movies"},{"id":"47508974404049","title":"Jon Voight’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Jon Voight's Best MoviesIn this week's Total Recall, we count down the best-reviewed work of the Getaway star.by Jeff Giles | August 28, 2013 |  CommentsJon Voight‘s latest movie, this weekend’s Ethan Hawke/Selena Gomez thriller Getaway, has been consigned to late August oblivion — but well before he spent summer’s dog days playing an oddly accented kidnapper, Voight earned a reputation for being one of Hollywood’s more talented and hard-working actors, with an eye for scripts that would challenge the audience as well as himself. Naturally, we decided to devote this week’s list to an appreciation of his best-reviewed works, so without further ado…everybody’s talkin’ Total Recall, Jon Voight style! 83%10. Coming HomePart political statement, part slowly unfolding love triangle, Hal Ashby’s Coming Home paid tribute to the nation’s Vietnam vets with an often heart-wrenching drama about a VA hospital volunteer (Jane Fonda) who finds herself drawn to a paraplegic ex-GI (Voight) while her husband (Bruce Dern) is overseas fighting in the war. Both Voight and Fonda won Oscars for their work in the film, and while some critics complained about Ashby’s occasional allowance for melodrama, for others, the complicated relationship between the stars’ characters more than compensated for any flaws. “Thinking about the movie,” reflected Roger Ebert, “we realize that men and women have been so polarized in so many films, have been made into so many varieties of sexual antagonists or lovers or rivals or other couples, that the mutual human friendship of these two characters comes as something of a revelation.” 82%9. The GeneralVoight reunited with Deliverance director John Boorman for 1998’s The General, starring Brendan Gleeson as notorious Irish crime boss Martin Cahill, whose life of ruthless crime — and eventual assassination — serve as the grist for a grimly compelling black-and-white drama whose stark verisimilitude was no doubt aided by the fact that Boorman himself was once a victim of Cahill’s string of burglaries. A Cannes favorite, The General wasn’t much of a box office draw in the States, in spite of Boorman’s pedigree and a cast that included Voight as a police inspector with a link to Cahill — not to mention reviews from critics like Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, who observed, “All the performances are impressive, but Gleeson and Voight are especially memorable, lending an almost tragic air of inexorability to Cahill and Kenny’s cat-and-mouse games.” 80%8. The Manchurian CandidateIt takes some serious chutzpah to remake a movie as well-received as The Manchurian Candidate, but director Jonathan Demme was no rookie by the time he got around to putting together his own adaptation of the Richard Condon novel in 2004 — and he was aided and abetted by a terrific cast that included Denzel Washington as war hero Ben Marco, Meryl Streep as a senator who’s pushing her son (Liev Schreiber) — who was also one of Marco’s officers — into a political career, and Voight as a potential vice-presidential candidate whose ambitions make him an obstacle to her plans. Manchurian‘s 1962 film adaptation proved an eerily timely political thriller, and the passage of time (as well as a handful of storyline changes) did nothing to dull its edge; as David Edelstein wrote for Slate, “Beautifully made and unsurpassingly creepy, it’s the rare remake with something contemporary to add.” 82%7. The RainmakerThe idea of a director as accomplished as Francis Ford Coppola bringing his talent to bear on an adaptation of a John Grisham novel might seem offensive to some cineastes, but at least in the case of 1997’s The Rainmaker, it proved a match made in critical heaven. Matt Damon stars here as Rudy Baylor, a young and (at least temporarily) naive law school grad who ends up filing a lawsuit against a shady insurance company, and he’s in very good company, surrounded by a supporting cast that includes Voight (as the slimy opposing counsel), Danny DeVito, Roy Scheider, Mickey Rourke, and Claire Danes. Critics might have gone in expecting something that would live down to Grisham’s lowbrow reputation, but they came away pleasantly surprised — as Madeleine Williams of Cinematter observed, “With numerous entertaining subplots, plenty of well thought-out characters, brought to life by talented actors, and an invigorating trial, what more do you want from a Grisham film?” 87%6. RosewoodDirector John Singleton snapped a critical dry spell with 1997’s Rosewood, a harrowing dramatization of 1923’s shameful Rosewood massacre, during which the residents of a primarily black Florida town were attacked by whites from a neighboring city, setting off days of horrific racial violence that culminated in Rosewood’s total abandonment. It’s the kind of episode any country would rather forget — and forget it most Americans did, for decades. Rosewood capped a 15-year period when the tragedy was rediscovered, first by journalists, then finally by the politicians who authorized reparations for its survivors. Starring Don Cheadle as a kind-hearted music teacher, Ving Rhames as a stranger whose arrival galvanizes white fear, and Voight as one of Rosewood’s few white residents, the movie resonated with critics like Jose Martinez of Boxoffice Magazine, who wrote, “Comparisons to today’s society can’t help but be made while watching Rosewood; although moviegoers might wish to leave the theatre thinking we are living in a better time, they might not be able to.” 86%5. Runaway TrainWhat do you get when you take a train in the Alaskan wilderness, put an insane Jon Voight on it, give him Eric Roberts for a sidekick, and throw in a little Danny Trejo for good measure? The answer lies in this ’80s action classic about a violent lunatic (Voight) who escapes from prison with the help of a dimwitted convict (Roberts) and ends up stowing away on a train that just happens to be on a collision course…with DEATH! Ahem. The cast and the premise suggest cheesy B-movie thrills, but Runaway Train boasts a surprisingly impressive pedigree — the script was based on a Kurosawa screenplay, and director Andrei Konchalovsky was still years away from succumbing to the nonsense of Tango &amp; Cash. As Geoff Andrew wrote for Time Out, “Somehow one leaves aside the blatant implausibilities, the coincidences, even Eric Roberts, and takes great pleasure in a breakneck ride to the end of the line.” 87%4. HeatIt’s kind of a bit part, but we’d be remiss if we left Voight’s appearance in Michael Mann’s Heat off this list — if for no other reason than that his presence among this impeccably assembled cast of marquee titans and sterling character actors (including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Danny Trejo, William Fichtner, Hank Azaria, and a young Natalie Portman) indicates the dependability (and stature) he’d acquired by the 1990s. Although he certainly filmed his share of duds during the decade (he appeared in Anaconda two years later), Heat proved he was still capable of spotting a good script. As Kenneth Turan observed for the Los Angeles Times, “Michael Mann and a superlative cast have taken a classic heist movie rife with familiar genre elements and turned it into a sleek, accomplished piece of work, meticulously controlled and completely involving.” 79%3. Catch-22The blackest of pitch-black war comedies, Mike Nichols’ Catch-22 arrived during the thick of the Vietnam War, adapting the classic Joseph Heller novel about the absurdity of war into an acidic argument against armed conflict that — despite its World War II setting — underscored the futility of the country’s overseas imbroglio. Although it suffered no small measure of Vietnam blowback with audiences — who turned out for MASH and Patton the same year — it resonated strongly with critics, thanks in part to an impressive cast that included Orson Welles, Alan Arkin, Martin Sheen, Charles Grodin, and (of course) Jon Voight. The end result was, wrote the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, “Quite simply, the best American film I’ve seen this year.” 88%2. Midnight CowboyVoight has spent a substantial portion of his career (especially of late) playing deliciously nasty bad guys, but as the Best Picture-winning Midnight Cowboy proves, he’s also capable of conveying characters from the opposite extreme. As the haunted and heartbreakingly naive Joe Buck, Voight filled up every bit of the screen not occupied by Dustin Hoffman’s fast-talking Ratso Rizzo — no mean feat — and offered a ray of hope among the movie’s clouds of misanthropy. “What has happened to Midnight Cowboy,” reflected Roger Ebert, “is that we’ve done our own editing job on it. We’ve forgotten the excesses and the detours, and remembered the purity of the central characters and the Voight and Hoffman performances.” 89%1. DeliveranceThe movie that forever changed the popular concept of a purty mouth, Deliverance depicted the American South as an inbred horror show populated by banjo-plucking troglodytes and sodomizing hillbillies — and yet it somehow managed to pick up three Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and accrue heaps of critical acclaim. What elevates Deliverance from others of its ilk — aside from director John Boorman’s agonizingly taut work — are the efforts of a terrific cast. Playing four city-dwelling friends on what’s supposed to be a fun weekend in the wilderness, Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ronny Cox, and Ned Beatty imbued their characters’ grueling ordeal with poignant humanity. “It doesn’t all hold together,” admitted Luke Y. Thompson for New Times, “but when it does, it scares you into never ever wanting to vacation down South.”In case you were wondering, here are Voight’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Heat — 91%2. Midnight Cowboy — 86%3. The Champ — 82%4. Rosewood — 81%5. The General — 81%6. Glory Road — 80%7. Deliverance — 79%8. Coming Home — 79%9. National Treasure — 75%10.

We did, however, decide to collect a sampling list, making room for some of the best, worst, and most puzzlingly misguided examples from the genre. Let’s get started, shall we?The Amityville Horror 23%Like many of the movies on this week’s list, the latter-day Amityville Horror was produced by Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes — and like more than a few of them, it suffered in comparison to the original. Which is a shame, because Amityville‘s central story — about a young family moving into a horrifically haunted house — is both devilishly simple and allegedly fact-based, which has helped the franchise retain its aura even through a series of sometimes-silly sequels and spinoffs. Unfortunately, despite a talented cast that included Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, and a young(er) Chloe Grace Moretz, this Horror was mainly scary for the studio execs who had to account for its $64 million domestic gross, which might be why we haven’t seen another installment in theaters since.The Blob 62%Inspired by the way David Cronenberg used modern special effects and less-campy storytelling to amp up the horror in The Fly, Hollywood spent a portion of the late 1980s rushing to the vaults and searching for other long-dormant properties that might benefit from the remake treatment. Hence 1988’s The Blob, in which an alien goo plops down in a small town and starts gorging on its unsuspecting residents. It was just as fantastically cheesy a premise as it had been in 1958, when Steve McQueen starred in the original — but thanks to a solid screenplay from future Shawshank Redemption director/adapter Frank Darabont, as well as a (slightly) more believable Blob, it managed to just about reach the rather low bar set by its predecessor, which is about all one can hope for when making a film about hungry interstellar plasma.Cat People 61%The original Cat People, produced on the cheap by Val Lewton in 1942, emphasized suggestion over explicit horror; four decades later, director Paul Schrader used the movie’s central idea — about people whose sexual desires trigger a sometimes-deadly feline transformation — as the basis for a steamy softcore flick that made up for its lack of genuine scares with an abundance of Natassja Kinski and a cool soundtrack featuring David Bowie and Giorgio Moroder. While it may not be the most terrifying movie on this week’s list, it’s probably one of the hardest to turn away from if you happen across it on the cable dial during a bout of late-night viewing.The Crazies 70%“WHY ARE THE GOOD PEOPLE DYING?” screamed the poster for George A. Romero’s paranoid The Crazies about the side effects of a military accident that resulted in a small American town being poisoned with a biological weapon that turns people into violent lunatics. Sadly, the tagline for Romero’s 1973 effort might as well have been “WHY WON’T MOST THEATERS SHOW THE CRAZIES?,” because the picture died with a whimper at the box office — but a good idea always turns up again in the horror genre, and in 2010, director Breck Eisner repurposed Romero’s original to create a sleek, gleefully nasty update that managed a surprisingly robust 71 percent on the Tomatometer. Alas, while Eisner’s Crazies at least made it to wide release, they didn’t fare a whole lot better at the box office, managing to slash together ony $54 million worldwide. The result of a military-industrial conspiracy, perhaps?Dawn of the Dead 76%Did George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead really need a remake? Perhaps not. But if we were going to get one, it might as well have been one that blended the the visual wizardry of director Zack Snyder with a screenplay from future Guardians of the Galaxy mastermind James Gunn, and that’s just what we got with this 2004 “re-envisioning” of the zombie classic. Using the original’s basic framework as an effective delivery mechanism for a fresh round of gruesome gore and heart-pumping action, the new Dawn proved surprisingly bright for most critics, including Aisle Seat’s Mike McGranaghan, who wrote, “Dawn of the Dead is ultra-violent, excessively bloody, and extremely gory — all in a good way. I left the theater feeling pumped full of adrenaline.”Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark 60%It might seem a little odd to base a horror remake on a TV movie from the 1970s, but the original Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark — starring Kim Darby as a housewife whose new home comes with some nasty little tenants lurking in the basement — is a cult classic for afficionados of the genre, so a theatrical version was probably inevitable. Given that the 2011 edition was co-written and produced by Guillermo del Toro, fans had reason to be hopeful that the remade Dark would be even scarier than the first; alas, after being trapped in studio limbo for months due to Miramax’s shuttering, director Troy Nixey’s update on the story — which focused on an eight-year-old (Bailee Madison) and her father’s girlfriend (Katie Holmes) — was greeted with lukewarm indifference by audiences and critics alike. Perhaps some things are just more frightening on the boob tube.Evil Dead 63%How in the world do you put together a remake of one of the most beloved horror-comedy cult classics of the last 40 years? If you’re director Fede Alvarez, you film a new version of Evil Dead with production input from creator Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell, a much bigger budget, and a far more serious take on the story of young campers who unwittingly unleash a demon plague while goofing around with the Book of the Dead. The amped-up gore in Alvarez’s Evil Dead certainly wasn’t for everyone, but it arguably made more sense, given the film’s narrative outline — and audiences responded strongly enough that plans for a sequel are currently afoot.The Fly 92%The original version of The Fly, released in 1958, was a Vincent Price classic that didn’t really need to be remade, but that didn’t stop producer Stuart Cornfield (working with an uncredited Mel Brooks) from getting the ball rolling on a new version. After several years in development, plenty of studio struggle, and some turnover at the screenwriter and director positions, Cornfield had his movie: David Cronenberg’s gorier, more suspenseful take on The Fly, which went back to George Langelaan’s 1957 short story and emerged with one of the more delightfully suspenseful horror/sci-fi movies of the 1980s. Unfortunately, Cronenberg’s Fly — starring Jeff Goldblum as the ill-fated scientist whose experiments leave his DNA accidentally intertwined with the titular pest, and Geena Davis as the woman who loves him — was too successful to prevent a sequel: 1989’s rather uninspired The Fly II. Rumors of another remake (and a quasi-sequel penned by Cronenberg) have popped up over the years, but it’s all been for naught. So far, anyway.Friday the 13th 26%Featuring a “star” hidden behind a hockey mask and a brilliantly low-budget conceit that needed nothing more than anonymous young actors capable of screaming in various states of undress, the Friday the 13th series was one of the most reliably profitable horror franchises of the 1980s — and ripe for the reboot treatment in the 21st century. Platinum Dunes did the honors in 2009, reimagining the murderous Jason Voorhees as more of a lethal maniac and less of a lumbering dolt, with cooler special effects and plenty of T&amp;A; once again, the formula worked, producing plenty of pure profit for the studio and signaling that perhaps a new slew of sequels was on the horizon. Alas, Jason has slumbered since then, although recent rumors suggest we could see a (sigh) found-footage Friday before too long.Fright Night 72%If director Craig Gillespie had polled horror fans in 2011 and asked them if he really needed to remake 1985’s Fright Night, the answer probably would have been a resounding “no”; after all, the original was not only a surprise hit, it had matured into a solid favorite among scary movie lovers, and little seemed to be gained by updating the story of a horror-loving teen (William Ragsdale) who makes the awful discovery that his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is secretly a vampire. While it may not have been strictly necessary, the new Fright Night — starring Anton Yelchin as young Charley Brewster and Colin Farrell as the undead addition to the neighborhood — proved surprisingly potent, with Farrell’s charismatic performance matching Gillespie’s confident lens. While box office returns were fairly weak, the remake brought the Fright Night franchise back to life, with a direct-to-video sequel arriving in stores earlier this month.Halloween 27%By the 2000s, producer Moustapha Akkad’s once-proud Halloween franchise had fallen on hard times, with deathless serial killer Michael Myers resurfacing in a series of low-budget sequels that bore little resemblance to John Carpenter’s classic 1978 original. All that was left was to start over from the beginning — and that’s what director Rob Zombie did with 2007’s Halloween, which retold Myers’ gruesome origin story and returned him to poor, unfortunate Haddonfield, Illinois for a gorier version of his first grown-up killing spree. While Zombie had previously flirted with critical respectability with 2005’s The Devil’s Rejects, his Halloween mustered a mere 25 percent on the Tomatometer — not as high as 1982’s much-maligned Halloween III: Season of the Witch, but still better than the sixth installment in the series, 1995’s The Curse of Michael Myers, and good enough to greenlight a sequel (dubbed H2) in 2009. A planned 3D follow-up fell off the schedule last year, but if the last 35 years have taught us anything, it’s that we’re never truly safe from Mr. Myers.Invasion of the Body Snatchers 92%If Gus Van Sant’s Psycho serves as an argument against remakes, then the 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers offers an equally persuasive rebuttal. While the 1956 original is one of the most highly regarded sci-fi/horror movies of its era, director Philip Kaufman’s update matched it with a thrillingly gritty, ensemble-driven look at what might happen if alien spores landed on Earth and started sprouting eerily emotionless replicas of our friends and loved ones. Sharpening up the special effects without overly relying on them, the new-look Body Snatchers featured solid performances from a stellar cast that included Donald Sutherland, Leonard Nimoy, and Jeff Goldblum — and although it definitely made its share of money at the box office in 1978, if anything it’s even more highly regarded today. Here’s hoping Kaufman’s Snatchers continues to stand as the most recent version of the movie for many more years to come.My Bloody Valentine 61%If you’re looking for fright value, bad guys don’t come much more elegantly brutal than a bloodthirsty lunatic with a pickaxe, which might be why the low-budget 1981 Canadian slasher flick My Bloody Valentine — about a miner who survives a collapse by dining on his fellow crew members, goes crazy before being rescued, and wages murderous revenge — proved even more potent when its 3D remake surfaced in 2009. And although it may not have generated blockbuster numbers at the box office, it fared surprisingly well with critics; it can’t be long before we’re treated to yet another Bloody Valentine.A Nightmare on Elm Street 15%Given how much money the Nightmare on Elm Street movies made for New Line during the 1980s and early 1990s, remakes and/or reboots were probably always a matter of course; problem was, the series was just as memorable for Robert Englund’s outstanding performance in the role of series killer Freddy Krueger as it was for its scores of inventive on-screen murders. Faced with the unsolvable problem of replacing Englund, the folks at Platinum Dunes hired Jackie Earle Haley to take over the part for their 2010 reboot — and although Haley is certainly a talented actor, and more than capable of exuding a sinister aura, he isn’t as physically imposing as Englund. Add that to a story that hit many of the same beats as the original, and the end result was a movie that, while certainly profitable, failed to land with as much impact as it had the first (eight) time(s) around.Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht 95%Werner Herzog’s filmography offers more than a few case studies in audaciousness, not the least of which is 1979’s Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht. Occasionally referred to by its less cool English title, Nosferatu the Vampyre, this remake of F.W. Murnau’s classic 1922 silent film finds Klaus Kinski stepping into the bloodsucking role so memorably inhabited by Max Schreck, with all parties involved acquitting themselves admirably. No less a cinematic authority than Roger Ebert agreed, writing that “To say of someone that they were born to play a vampire is a strange compliment, but if you will compare the two versions of Nosferatu you might agree with me that only Kinski could have equaled or rivaled Max Schreck’s performance.”Psycho 39%Of all the remakes on our list, Gus Van Sant’s Psycho embraces the concept more eagerly than most, delivering a somewhat bafflingly precise update on the 1960 Hitchcock classic with a shot-for-shot replication that, while assembled and acted by talented creative types, exhibited no real creativity of its own. But while Van Sant’s Psycho wound up bottoming out at a rather miserable 37 percent on the Tomatometer, he dodged a few bullets in at least one sense — unlike a lot of remakes of classic films, his attempt to re-Hitchcock Hitchcock inspired more critical bafflement than anger or derision. Ultimately, the 1998 Psycho serves as a perfectly persuasive (albeit most likely unintentional) argument against remakes in general.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 37%A man, a plan, a chainsaw. Oh, and a facemask made out of human skin. It may not sound like much, but from the moment 1974’s Texas Chainsaw Massacre terrified its first audiences, it’s served as the basis for one of the horror genre’s more surprisingly durable franchises — in spite of the mostly miserable track record suffered by its spate of periodic prequels, sequels, and spinoffs. The horror remake enthusiasts at Platinum Dunes tried to take things back to the beginning (again) with their 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and although most critics claimed time had dulled Leatherface’s blade, audiences still turned out to the tune of more than $100 million in box office grosses. Yet another prequel followed in 2006, and this year brought a 3D sequel to the original, with yet another chapter planned for 2015. Confused? Don’t think too hard; in the end, it all goes back to those first simple ingredients.The Wicker Man 15%There are worse (and far, far better) horror remakes than Neil LaBute’s update on The Wicker Man, but we absolutely had to include it here, because no other film provides its particular brand of sheer, cackling lunacy. While it’s misguided on just about every level, the 2006 Wicker is chiefly noteworthy thanks to Nicolas Cage’s presence as police detective Edward Malus, whose journey to a secluded island in search of his abducted daughter ends very badly for all concerned — including any audience members not prepared for the unforgettable sight of Cage punching a woman in the face while wearing a bear suit, or the equally memorable sound of Cage screaming “Oh God! Not the bees!” Avoid it if you’re looking for truly scary viewing, but it still needs to be seen in order to be believed.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Awards, YouTube, Columbia, target, travel, Fall, strong","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/The-Fly.jpg","slug":"memorable-horror-remakes"},{"id":"47508975495638","title":"Total Recall: Woody Allen’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Woody Allen's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Blue Jasmine director.by Jeff Giles | July 25, 2013 |  CommentsHe’s never been a blockbuster filmmaker, but with more than a half century in Hollywood under his belt — and dozens of movies along the way — Woody Allen‘s consistently prolific output stands as a continuing testament to the ability of brainy, low-budget cinema to find an audience, even during an era in which superheroes, sequels, reboots, and remakes seem to exert an ever-stronger grip on the box office. Love him or hate him, Allen’s one of the few directors left who can film people sitting around talking and turn it into a wide release — and with his latest, Blue Jasmine, arriving in theaters this weekend, we knew now would be the perfect time to pay tribute by looking back at his best-reviewed efforts. Call your therapist, because it’s time for Total Recall, Woody Allen style! 94%10. Crimes and MisdemeanorsAfter suffering relatively lukewarm reviews for 1987’s September and 1988’s Another Woman, Allen enjoyed a rebound — and picked up a pair of Academy Award nominations — for 1989’s Crimes and Misdemeanors, which found him writing, directing, and starring alongside Martin Landau in a rather pensive drama that interweaves the stories of an adulterous opthalmalogist (Landau) and a struggling filmmaker (Allen) for whom love and romance are fraught with difficulty (or even danger). Calling it “A relative of Hannah and Her Sisters in its duplex structure and of The Purple Rose of Cairo in its bitter theme,” the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley bestowed praise befitting Crimes‘ parallel narrative, calling it “two movies in one, a blend of Allen’s satiric and pretentious dramatic styles.” 93%9. Midnight in ParisWhile it would be inaccurate to say that Allen’s work went unappreciated during the 1990s and aughts, critical accolades were no longer in such ready supply, and his box-office profile — which never approached mega-blockbuster heights even during his 1970s and 1980s peak — lost more than a bit of its luster. But things turned around for 2011’s Midnight in Paris, a late-period smash that brought Allen some of the warmest reviews (and the highest grosses) of his career while telling the the fantasy-infused comedic tale of an ennui-addled screenwriter (Owen Wilson) who heads out for a melancholic walk on the streets of Paris and ends up taking much more of a journey than he bargained for. “Woody Allen seemed to have lost his fizz as a filmmaker of late,” observed Jason Best for Movie Talk, “and then he uncorked the sparkling Midnight in Paris, a comic fantasy with all the effervescence of vintage champagne.” 97%8. Bullets Over BroadwayOne of Allen’s more critically successful late-period movies, 1994’s Bullets Over Broadway found him stepping completely behind the camera in order to tell the tale of a naive 1920s playwright (John Cusack) whose budding Broadway career threatens to derail itself almost before it’s begun, thanks to the cascading series of compromises forced when he accepts financial backing from a mobster who insists his talentless girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) be given a role in the show. Sadly met with indifference at the box office, Bullets made a direct hit with critics like Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle, who called it “Woody Allen at his best — a gem of a Broadway fable with a crafty premise, a raft of brilliant actors at the top of their form and a bouncy, just-for-pleasure attitude.” 94%7. ManhattanFollowing the Oscar-winning Annie Hall, Allen reunited with Diane Keaton for their sixth collaboration, 1979’s Manhattan, the story of a neurotic TV writer caught in a(n admittedly unlikely-seeming) love triangle between a teenager (Mariel Hemingway) and an intellectual (Keaton). Adding another pair of Academy Award nominations to Allen’s growing stack (including one for Best Screenplay), it rounded out his 1970s hot streak with typically neurotic flair — and another round of unbridled love from critics like Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York, who wrote, “This is a deeply self-critical film about immaturity and the gift of real love. Many films can be said to put an epitaph on the decade, but few remain as relevant.” 96%6. Annie HallThe word “iconic” gets thrown around a lot more often than it should, but this movie fits the description — a film that so perfectly expresses its creative principals’ gifts that when you say “Woody Allen and Diane Keaton,” the picture that leaps to mind for most film fans is a black-and-white still from Annie Hall. Keaton’s career was already well on its way in 1977, but her performance here rocketed her into Hollywood’s upper echelon, earning her a Best Actress Oscar and heaps of critical accolades for a performance of a character who’d form the (often misunderstood) template for countless quirky-but-lovable leading ladies in subsequent rom-coms, and she wasn’t the only one who enjoyed recognition for the film; Allen picked up a pair of Oscars of his own (for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay), as well as heaps of praise from critics like TIME’s Richard Schickel, who observed, “Personal as the story he is telling may be, what separates this film from Allen’s own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability.” 100%5. Love and DeathThe second in a string of Woody Allen/Diane Keaton movies that started with Sleeper and included Annie Hall, 1975’s Love and Death found the duo starring in a satire on Russian literature that used the story of a reluctant war hero (Allen) and his equally reluctant bride (Keaton) to offer a cockeyed, tightly scripted take on Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Eisenstein, melding satirical philosophical debates with visual homages only a film buff could truly love — and became one of the more unlikely hits of the 1970s in the process. As Vincent Canby argued for the New York Times, “Besides being one of Woody’s most consistently witty films, Love and Death marks a couple of other advances for Mr. Allen as a filmmaker and for Miss Keaton as a wickedly funny comedienne.” 100%4. ZeligAllen’s early years found him bringing his unique style and sense of humor to bear on a wide variety of mediums and genres, from sci-fi to Russian lit. With 1983’s Zelig, Allen delivered a suitably smart, poignant take on the mockumentary format, using his screenplay’s nominal focus — the life of a fictional ardent conformist named Leonard Zelig — to offer more of the subtly intelligent commentary on modern American life that his audiences had come to expect. Arguably more interesting, however, were the techniques Allen employed to insert Zelig into a series of historical situations, from batting practice with Babe Ruth to the Nuremberg rally with Adolf Hitler; among its many award recognitions was a BAFTA nomination for Best Special Visual Effects. As for the film itself, Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian echoed the sentiments of many of his colleagues when he deemed it “A masterpiece: a brilliant, even passionate historical pastiche, a superbly pregnant meditation on American society and individuality, and an eerie fantasy that will live in your dreams.” 100%3. Broadway Danny RoseSlight, quirky, and wry, 1984’s Broadway Danny Rose is vintage Woody Allen, in terms of form as well as function. While it starts from an absurdly broad premise, following the hapless adventures of a borderline incompetent talent agent (Allen) whose clients have little talent to speak of, there’s a sweet, somewhat sober message underneath all the shenanigans, with a final act that underscores the value of loyalty and forgiveness — even in the face of violent mobsters and opportunistic lounge singers. While Broadway‘s rather modest narrative scope was matched by middling box office grosses, it earned substantial admiration from critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who called it “one of Mr. Allen’s more modest films but also one of his very best” and enthused, “Mr. Allen works with such speed and confidence these days that a brief, swift film like this one can have all the texture and substance of his more complicated work.” 100%2. SleeperAfter the impressive commercial performance of 1972’s Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask), Allen opted for a follow-up with a somewhat larger scale: Sleeper, a futuristic comedy about a health food store owner (Allen) who’s cryogenically frozen after dying during a gall bladder operation, thawed out 200 years later, and becomes an unlikely leader in a resistance movement — while falling in love with the woman who briefly thought he was a robot (Diane Keaton). Billed as a “nostalgic look at the future,” Sleeper offered a humorous counterpoint to the dry sci-fi epics of the day, predicting (sadly accurately, some would argue) that technological advancement wouldn’t be able to stem the rising tide of pure human foolishness. Mused Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “Pound for pound and minute for minute, Sleeper may just have more laughs in it than any other Woody Allen movie.” 93%1. Husbands and WivesThe perils of romance, the wisdom of long-term commitment, and the foibles of the modern American male — they’re all themes that will be quite familiar to anyone who’s seen more than a couple of Allen’s films (let alone any of those inspired by his work). So it’s saying something that 1992’s Husbands and Wives was greeted with such critical acclaim, despite the fact that its sad portrait of two turbulently self-destructing marriages looked a lot like Allen pictures previous. Although Husbands‘ theatrical release was overshadowed by the messy end of the real-life relationship between Allen and his long-term muse Mia Farrow (who co-stars here as his dissatisfied wife), dooming it to disappointing grosses, it found favor with critics like Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who — while admitting that it was “less a drama than a series of overly chewed-on observations” — argued, “as Woody’s angst-a-thons go, this one is singularly lively and well acted.”In case you were wondering, here are Allen’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Annie Hall — 91%2. Manhattan — 91%3. Crimes and Misdemeanors — 89%4. Hannah and Her Sisters — 88%5. Love and Death — 88%6. Zelig — 86%7. The Purple Rose of Cairo — 85%8. Husbands and Wives — 84%9.

TombstoneAn ensemble Western depicting the adventures of the legendary lawman Wyatt Earp and his confederates, Tombstone transcended a number of behind-the-scenes difficulties (including an early tiff with would-be co-star Kevin Costner, who then attempted to kill its chances at distribution, as well as the firing of screenwriter and original director Kevin Jarre) to emerge as one of 1993’s better-reviewed dramas — thanks in large part to the stellar supporting cast assembled behind Kurt Russell. Paxton, who played Wyatt’s brother Morgan, joined an eclectic crew that included Val Kilmer, Charlton Heston, Sam Elliott, and Powers Boothe. “It has an energetic flow, and a genuinely rugged, exciting feel,” wrote an appreciative Jeffrey M. Anderson for Combustible Celluloid, “unlike many of the more bloated, picturesque examples of the Western genre.” 74%9. FrailtyPaxton flashed a bit of his directorial ambition early in his career, helming the cult classic music video “Fish Heads,” but it wasn’t until 2002 that he made his feature-length debut behind the camera with Frailty, a dread-soaked suspense film about two young brothers (Matthew O’Leary and Jeremy Sumpter) held in thrall by their psychotic, religiously fervent father (Paxton) — and driven to rid the earth of “demons” by any means necessary. While a number of critics were disquieted (or just plain turned off) by the deep darkness of the story, Paxton earned widespread praise for his work on either side of the lens. “Frailty may be only a genre film,” admitted the New York Times’ Stephen Holden, “but it forcefully reminds us of the degree to which all of us are our parents’ ideological captives when we’re children.” 79%8. TravellerTruly entertaining stories about con men are difficult to come by — and even the best of the bunch tend to focus on the thrill of the grift, leaving the characters themselves in the background. 1997’s Traveller reversed the formula, examining the knotty feuds and traditions of a tight-knit clan of small-time North Carolina con artists, in particular Bokky (Bill Paxton), a Traveller whose life is thrown out of balance when he crosses paths with the son of an exiled member (Mark Wahlberg) and develops an honest emotional attachment to one of his victims (Julianna Margulies). It isn’t one of Paxton’s better-known movies, but it was a hit with critics like ReelViews’ James Berardinelli, who wrote, “The script is smart and sneaky — by never telling the audience more than is necessary, it develops a keen sense of suspense that persists until the gritty final reel.” 80%7. HaywireA sleek, pleasantly pulpy woman-on-the-run action thriller with an uncommonly sharp cast, Steven Soderbergh’s Haywire essentially doubled as two films — one that acted as a showcase for the bone-crunching skills of star (and real-life MMA fighter) Gina Carano, and another that served to highlight the ever-dependable work of her supporting players, a group that included Paxton, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, and Antonio Banderas. “Carano is nothing special as an actress,” admitted Eric D. Snider for Film.com, “but darned if it matters when she’s supported by a killer screenplay, a sharp cast, and Steven Soderbergh’s unmistakably sly, mordant direction.” 89%6. TitanicAfter appearing in The Terminator, Aliens, and True Lies, Paxton seemed safely ensconced in James Cameron’s stable of favorite actors — so it came as no surprise when Cameron enlisted Paxton for Titanic, casting him as the modern-day treasure hunter whose quest for booty on the titular wrecked luxury liner helps move along the movie’s framing device, which stars Gloria Stuart as the aged modern-day version of the youthful beauty (Kate Winslet) whose doomed love affair with a poor passenger (Leonardo DiCaprio) helped launch a million Celine Dion-anchored mixtapes. “We know the story ends badly,” admitted Time Out’s Cath Clarke, “but Cameron still sweeps us up in the romance between Kate Winslet’s rebellious posh girl and DiCaprio’s steerage kid.” 91%5. A Simple PlanAre people inherently good or evil, or are their morals and ethics driven by the choices available to them? That’s the devilishly grim question at the heart of Sam Raimi’s A Simple Plan, an adaptation of the Scott Smith book about a pair of brothers (played by Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton) who happen upon a downed plane full of cash during a hunting expedition with a friend (Brent Briscoe). One secret and one lie seem like a small price to pay for a $4.4 million windfall split three ways, but their simple plan begins to unravel surprisingly quickly, making the trio — and, by extension, the audience — helpless witnesses to an increasingly gruesome tumble into darkness. “A Simple Plan is a suspenseful, unnerving movie that ranks as one of the best thrillers in recent years,” marveled Mike McGranaghan for Aisle Seat. “The plot and characters converge nicely, and by the end, you are left to wonder how much money is enough to entice you to sell your soul.” 82%4. Near DarkBefore she was the Academy Award-winning director of The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow cut her directorial teeth with 1987’s Near Dark. Originally pitched as a straight Western, then rejiggered to take advantage of Hollywood’s 1980s vampire infatuation, Dark starred a then-unknown Adrian Pasdar as a small-town guy whose nookie with a mysterious drifter (Jenny Wright) ends with her turning him into a vampire — and then drafting him into a gang of undead drifters that includes a ruthless leader (Lance Henriksen) and his sociopathic second in command (Paxton). While Near Dark played to a lot of half-empty houses during its theatrical run, it became a cult classic on the home video market once audiences caught up to critics like TIME’s Richard Corliss, who wrote that it “has filmmaking finesse to spare, but puts its dank characters on display rather than cadging sympathy for them” and applauded, “It is the Blue Velvet of date-night spook shows.” 96%3. Apollo 13This dramatization of NASA’s aborted 1970 lunar mission combined one of star Tom Hanks’ biggest personal passions — space travel — with Hollywood’s favorite thing: a blockbuster prestige picture. With a cast that featured a number of similarly prolific actors (among them Paxton, Ed Harris, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Sinise), Apollo 13 probably would have made decent money even if it had played fast and loose with the real-life details of the launch, but director Ron Howard and his crew strove for verisimilitude, going so far as to shoot portions of the film in actual zero gravity. The result was a summertime smash that restored some of space travel’s luster for a jaded generation — and made for an exceedingly good filmgoing experience according to most critics, including Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who wrote that “It chronicles one of the most dramatic of all spaceflights, an American catastrophe that became an American victory, and it does this in a way that’s so authentic, so brilliant in its technical details, that it succeeds in putting us on that ship.” 94%2. One False MoveIts commercial prospects were fatally hobbled by a lack of studio faith so profound that it wasn’t even originally supposed to have a theatrical release, but thanks to overwhelmingly positive reviews, 1992’s One False Move — starring Billy Bob Thornton as the ringleader of a gang of criminals that runs afoul of an Arkansas sheriff (Paxton) who teaches them a thing or two about small-town justice — ended up sneaking into theaters long enough for Gene Siskel to call it his favorite movie of the year. Siskel’s enthusiasm for the Carl Franklin-directed thriller was shared by the majority of his peers, including Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times, who enthused, “Franklin’s convincing portrait of life on both sides of the color line isn’t quite like anything I’ve come across before, making One False Move one very assured directorial move. We need more filmmakers like him.” 97%1. AliensIt’s a little hard to believe in today’s Hollywood, but in the 1980s, Fox balked at James Cameron’s proposal for an Alien sequel, claiming that the original hadn’t made enough money — and then, even when The Terminator‘s incredible success earned Cameron a shot at putting together a follow-up to Ridley Scott’s sci-fi classic, the whole thing almost fell apart when the studio refused to pay returning star Sigourney Weaver what she felt she deserved. Happily, it all came together, and Cameron’s Vietnam-inspired concept — which imagined a conflict in which our protagonists are armed with “a lot of firepower and very little wisdom” — turned into a $130 million hit that spawned a slew of sequels and spinoffs. Paxton, who’d played a bit part in The Terminator, earned a Best Supporting Actor Saturn Award for his work here as Private Hudson — and (spoiler alert!) his on-screen demise put him two-thirds of the way toward his eventual distinctive cinematic trifecta: getting killed by a Terminator, an Alien, and a Predator. “The ads for Aliens claim that this movie will frighten you as few movies have,” warned Roger Ebert, “and, for once, the ads don’t lie.”In case you were wondering, here are Paxton’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Tombstone — 92%2. Aliens — 90%3. Apollo 13 — 80%4. Frailty — 77%5. A Simple Plan — 75%6. Near Dark — 72%7. Titanic — 70%8. True Lies — 69%9. One False Move — 68%10.

Now just look how things have changed: Having reinvented himself as a critically lauded director with 2007’s Gone Baby Gone, Ben’s back in front of the camera this weekend in Runner Runner, playing the sleazy head of an online gambling empire who lures a college student (Justin Timberlake) into his operation. What better time to take a fond look back at Mr. Affleck’s critical highlights, Total Recall style? 68%10. HollywoodlandBen Affleck knows a thing or two about actors who take jobs for the wrong reason and end up paying for it — and that knowledge, along with his lantern-jawed good looks, made him a natural for Hollywoodland. Helmed by first-time feature director Allen Coulter, this fact-based drama looks at the final days of George Reeves, the actor who played Superman in the long-running Adventures of Superman television series. Reeves’ mysterious death is probed by a private detective named Louis Simo (Adrien Brody), whose own messy private life shadows the investigation; though the case was never solved, Simo’s sleuthing traces an outline of what might have been for the audience. A modest commercial success, Hollywoodland earned Affleck a Golden Globe nomination and strong praise from critics like Andrew Sarris of the New York Observer, who urged his readers, “Take my word for it: Hollywoodland is well worth seeing.” 68%9. Going All the WayNot one of Affleck’s most widely seen pictures, this adaptation of Dan Wakefield’s 1970 novel won a Sundance award (for production design, but still). It also warmed the thorny cockles of most critics — no small achievement considering that the story, about the small-town struggles of a pair of Korean War vets (Affleck and Jeremy Davies), hits many of the same beats as plenty of other coming-of-age dramas. While recognizing its derivative aspects, most critics found Going All the Way ultimately worthwhile — like Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, who conceded, “Even if it’s too self-conscious, Going All the Way, set in 1950s Indianapolis, nevertheless has a mix of the sweet and the forlorn that somehow works.” 77%8. Changing LanesNotting Hill director Roger Michell tackled a decidedly more serious topic with 2002’s Changing Lanes, a tension-filled drama about the war of attrition that erupts after a car accident involving a beleaguered insurance salesman (Samuel L. Jackson) and a lawyer (Affleck). Examining uncommonly thorny themes of race and privilege, wrapped up in good old-fashioned high-octane Hollywood thrills, Lanes wasn’t quite the box office smash it seemed poised to become, but it enjoyed praise from critics like Robert Koehler of Variety, who appreciated the way it “combines a knack for storytelling with a rare instinct for exploring ideas within the framework of a major, star-driven Hollywood movie.” 84%7. State of PlayAffleck joined a star-studded cast for this adapation of the BBC miniseries, appearing alongside Russell Crowe, Helen Mirren, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright Penn, and Jason Bateman in the story of a reporter (Crowe) investigating the murder of a woman who worked (in more ways than one) for a Congressman (Affleck) who just happens to have been his college roommate. Like most conspiracy flicks, State of Play hinges on a multitude of plot twists and unlikely coincidences, but most critics were too happy to find a rare adult thriller to complain. “The journalist in me loved State of Play,” wrote Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer. “The moviegoer in me even more so.” 87%6. Chasing AmyBefore Good Will Hunting made him a household name, Affleck came into his own with Chasing Amy, Kevin Smith’s frank tragicomedy about the unlikely romance between a comic book artist (Affleck) and his lesbian crush (Joey Lauren Adams). The sort of small, thoughtful feature that Affleck would slowly drift away from after achieving his post-Hunting success, Amy found Smith regaining his critical mojo after Mallrats, and gave Affleck some of the best dialogue of his career. “What really makes the film special,” posited Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “is that, while still being packed with foul language and pop culture references, this film is the only one in which Smith really seems to care about his characters and their lives.” 92%5. Shakespeare in LovePart of Miramax’s 1990s hot streak — an incredible run that also produced Pulp Fiction, The Piano, The English Patient, and many others, including some of the films on this list — John Madden’s Shakespeare in Love used a tremendously talented cast to explore what might have happened if the Bard experienced a little of the forbidden love he was so gifted at writing about. Here, Affleck plays Ned Alleyn, arguably the foremost actor of his generation (and, according to his characterization in the film, also a bit of a boor). It was a supporting role — sort of ironic, given Alleyn’s status — and legend has it Affleck only signed on in order to spend time with Gwyneth Paltrow, who was his girlfriend at the time, but he’d go on to star in worse films for flimsier reasons. Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Shakespeare earned almost universal admiration from critics like Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, “A happy conceit smoothly executed, this is one of those entertaining confections that’s so pleasing to the eye and ear you’d have to be a genuine Scrooge to struggle against it.” 92%4. Dazed and ConfusedAffleck had filmed small roles in School Ties and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but he scored his most memorable early gig with the part of the lunkheaded bully Fred O’Bannion in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused. Featuring a smartly assembled cast of 1990s phenoms (Jason London, Parker Posey) and future stars (including Affleck and Matthew McConaughey), Dazed was something of a bust at the box office, but the critics were always fond of it, and it’s since gone on to enjoy a dedicated cult following. Summing up the appeal of this 1970s-set high school comedy, the Austin Chronicle’s Marjorie Baumgarten pointed out, “Every one of these characters is completely familiar and recognizable; so far this has held true for every viewer I have spoken with, whether they graduated from high school 25 years ago or last week.” 92%3. The TownGood Will Hunting taught us that Affleck was a capable screenwriter, but nothing in that movie’s blend of comedy and drama suggested he might be able to script a hard-hitting crime drama like The Town. Working from Chuck Hogan’s novel Prince of Thieves, Affleck co-wrote, directed, and starred in an ensemble piece about a bank robber who ends up falling for a woman his gang victimized during a bank heist (Rebecca Hall) over the strenuous — and potentially violent — objections of his longtime right-hand man (Jeremy Renner, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his work). “Affleck’s direction is clipped when the plot requires, but he lingers on character-driven scenes (at a garden, a restaurant, a corner) in no apparent rush,” observed Amy Biancolli for the Houston Chronicle. “Why hurry, after all? He’s arrived.” 96%2. ArgoAffleck’s segue from marquee actor to prestige director helped him pull off a remarkable 180-degree reversal of fortune, taking him from the laughingstock star of duds like Gigli to the guy behind the cameras for critical winners like Gone Baby Gone and The Town. And with 2012’s Argo, an often unbearably tense dramatization of the secret CIA mission to rescue American ambassadors during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis, he completed his career rehabilitation with a Best Picture-winning Oscar champ. “Ben Affleck doesn’t merely direct Argo, he directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense,” argued Peter Travers for Rolling Stone. “There’s no doubt he’s crafted one of the best movies of the year.” 98%1. Good Will HuntingThe massively profitable drama that earned Affleck and Matt Damon an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, Good Will Hunting opened every door in Hollywood to its young stars/creators — and even if Affleck ended up using that power to star in Reindeer Games and Surviving Christmas, this story of friendship, forgiveness, and the importance of being true to one’s self served as a powerful reminder of what made him a star. These days, Affleck has re-emerged as a talented director, as well as a more mature, seasoned actor — a fine second act for a success story that took off with the movie the Cincinnati Enquirer’s Margaret A. McGurk described as “another auspicious sign that the best of Young Hollywood is not only bringing back respect for the craft of acting, but for the cogent telling of tales as well.”In case you were wondering, here are Affleck’s top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1. Good Will Hunting — 92%2. Argo — 91%3. Dazed and Confused — 88%4. Dogma — 83%5. The Town — 83%6. Mallrats — 80%7. Chasing Amy — 80%8. Shakespeare in Love — 75%9. Armageddon — 74%10.

Cinematic legends, all of them, but this week we’re focusing on Keaton’s contributions, and when you take a look at the amazing array of films she’s appeared in, we think you’ll understand why. Break out your favorite vests, baggy pants, and fedoras — it’s time for Total Recall! 93%10. Manhattan Murder MysteryThe most recent of the eight films she’s made with Woody Allen, 1993’s Manhattan Murder Mystery, almost didn’t come Keaton’s way; initially, the part of Carol Lipton, an amateur detective whose efforts to solve the mystery of a neighbor’s death draw in her neurotic husband (Allen) and a family friend (Alan Alda), was supposed to go to Allen’s longtime muse Mia Farrow — but when their notorious breakup forced him to find a new leading lady, he reached out to a dependable friend. The result was decidedly one of his more lightweight films, but for quite a few critics, that was part of its affable charm; as Owen Gleiberman wrote for Entertainment Weekly, “Nobody labors quite like Woody Allen to produce a modest entertainment.” 89%9. RedsAn epic 194-minute biopic about the tortured affair between radical journalists John Reed (Warren Beatty) and Louise Bryan (Keaton) during the early 20th century, set against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution, Reds wasn’t exactly the most commercially friendly film of 1981 — but thanks to positive word of mouth and a stellar cast that also included Jack Nicholson, Paul Sorvino, Gene Hackman, and M. Emmet Walsh, it ended up grossing more than $50 million during its theatrical run, on the way to picking up three Academy Awards (against a dozen nominations). Calling it “Political drama and sweeping romance in one,” Carol Cling of the Las Vegas Review-Journal marveled, “Only Warren Beatty would, or could, do it.” 97%8. Play It Again, SamWoody Allen didn’t direct the 1972 film adaptation of his Broadway hit Play It Again, Sam, but he did star in it and write the screenplay — and he did make sure to bring over Keaton, his leading lady from the stage. While the whole thing still didn’t amount to much more than an affable homage to Casablanca, there’s no denying the strength of that impeccable source material, or the skill and affection with which Sam pays tribute to an assortment of scenes, lines, and characters that every film buff knows by heart. “Maybe the movie has too much coherence, and the plot is too predictable; that’s a weakness of films based on well-made Broadway plays,” admitted Roger Ebert. “Still, that’s hardly a serious complaint about something as funny as Play It Again, Sam.” 94%7. ManhattanBy the end of the 1970s, Keaton had starred in six Woody Allen films — with the fifth, Annie Hall, sending her home with an Academy Award for Best Actress. She didn’t repeat the feat with their sixth collaboration, 1979’s Manhattan, but it’s safe to say audiences and critics responded to the end result; Allen’s story of a neurotic TV writer character caught in a(n admittedly unlikely-seeming) love triangle between a teenager (Mariel Hemingway) and an intellectual (Keaton) is regarded as one of the high points of his distinguished career. As Vincent Canby wrote for the New York Times when Manhattan was released, “Mr. Allen’s progress as one of our major filmmakers is proceeding so rapidly that we who watch him have to pause occasionally to catch our breath.” 96%6. Annie HallKeaton’s career was already well on its way in 1977, but her turn as the title character in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall rocketed her into Hollywood’s upper echelon, earning her a Best Actress Oscar and heaps of critical accolades for a performance of a character who’d form the (often misunderstood) template for countless quirky-but-lovable leading ladies in subsequent rom-coms. While Keaton’s affinity for the character makes sense, given that Allen constructed it based on what she’s described as an “idealized version” of herself, that doesn’t detract from the sheer winsomeness in the film; as Vincent Canby observed for the New York Times, “There will be discussion about what points in the film coincide with the lives of its two stars, but this, I think, is to detract from and trivialize the achievement of the film, which, at last, puts Woody in the league with the best directors we have.” 96%5. The Godfather, Part IIIn the closing moments of The Godfather, trouble loomed for the marriage of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his wife Kay (Keaton), as Kay watched Michael assume the mantle of his father’s responsibility for their family’s criminal empire in spite of his promise to make their business legal. But that was just foreshadowing for the full-on rupture between the young couple in The Godfather Part II, which finds Kay increasingly hostile toward her husband’s lifestyle — especially after a botched assassination attempt leaves their bedroom riddled with bullet holes. The movie’s silent final moments drive home the price of life as a Corleone, adding an intimate denoument to a sequel that often reaches for — and achieves — epic status. “This film has an even broader scope than the original,” mused Jeffrey M. Anderson for Combustible Celluloid, “but does not fail in its depiction of small, intimate moments and surprising emotional reveals.” 100%4. Lovers and Other StrangersAfter kicking off her stage career with a Tony-nominated performance in Woody Allen’s stage version of Play It Again, Sam, Keaton made a graceful transition to film with a supporting role in Cy Howard’s ensemble dramedy Lovers and Other Strangers, a triple Oscar nominee that united an enormously talented corps of actors (including Richard Castellano, Cloris Leachman, Bea Arthur, and Bonnie Bedelia) to portray the romantic trials and tribulations endured by the friends of one couple (played by Bedelia and Michael Brandon) during the days leading up to their wedding. “This might have been an opening for a good deal of cynicism, but the movie is optimistic at heart,” observed Roger Ebert. “Not optimistic that love can survive unchanged throughout a lifetime, but that love and lovers can occasionally reach an accommodation that is not positively painful.” 100%3. Love and DeathBetween Sleeper and Annie Hall, Keaton and Woody Allen starred in Love and Death, a satire on Russian literature that used the story of a reluctant war hero (Allen) and his equally reluctant bride (Keaton) to offer a cockeyed, tightly scripted take on Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Eisenstein, melding satirical philosophical debates with visual homages only a film buff could truly love — and became one of the more unlikely hits of the 1970s in the process. As Vincent Canby argued for the New York Times, “Besides being one of Woody’s most consistently witty films, Love and Death marks a couple of other advances for Mr. Allen as a film maker and for Miss Keaton as a wickedly funny comedienne.” 100%2. SleeperAfter making a big splash in 1972 with The Godfather and Play It Again, Sam, Keaton continued her hot streak the following year with Sleeper, a reunion with Sam writer/director Woody Allen that swapped out that film’s Humphrey Bogart pastiche for a futuristic comedy about a health food store owner (Allen) who’s cryogenically frozen after dying during a gall bladder operation, thawed out 200 years later, and becomes an unlikely leader in a resistance movement — while falling in love with the woman who briefly thought he was a robot (Keaton). Mused Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “Pound for pound and minute for minute, Sleeper may just have more laughs in it than any other Woody Allen movie.” 97%1. The GodfatherWhile it wasn’t her first film role, Keaton’s appearance as the future Kay Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather is generally regarded as her breakout performance — and for good reason, because while it isn’t one of the more substantial parts in her career, Keaton’s work provides a crucial component of the trilogy-to-be’s sprawling, multi-generational saga. It also doesn’t hurt that The Godfather enjoyed blockbuster success, briefly earning the distinction of being the top-grossing film of all time, or that it was impeccably cast overall, employing the talents of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, and Marlon Brando (the latter two of which were nominated for and won Academy Awards) to deliver what TIME’s Jay Cocks praised as “that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art.”In case you were wondering, here are Keaton’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Godfather — 97%2. The Godfather, Part II — 96%3. Annie Hall — 92%4. Manhattan — 91%5. Love and Death — 88%6. Play It Again, Sam — 86%7. Manhattan Murder Mystery — 81%8. Reds — 80%9.

Big career moves were clearly in play for him, but mega stardom would have to wait as McGregor used his post-Trainspotting boost to continue doing diverse and challenging work in the UK. Films like Little Voice, Velvet Goldmine, and The Pillow Book came out in this period.But soon American blockbuster entertainment came knocking and, well, McGregor actually didn’t have to go anywhere to answer the call since Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace shot in England and Europe abroad. George Lucas cast McGregor as young Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his consistency in the role made him a steady highlight in a very inconsistent trilogy of prequel films.Phantom Menace put a spotlight on his first post-Star Wars project, which unfortunately was the bewildering Ashley Judd mystery Eye of the Beholder, representing the lowest point of his career. McGregor bounced back quickly with Moulin Rouge! and Black Hawk Down, which are spectacles in very different ways.By 2005, the Star Wars prequels were all released, freeing McGregor up to go on a long run of critical disappointments, like The Island, Angels &amp; Demons, and Amelia. The 2010 political thriller The Ghost Writer represented something of a comeback for McGregor (and its director Roman Polanski), and he’s since added Beginners, Haywire, The Impossible, and T2 Trainspotting to his portfolio of Certified Fresh hits.With his most recent movies Doctor Sleep and Birds of Prey out there in the universe, we’re looking back with all of Ewan McGregor’s movies ranked by Tomatometer!#56Eye of the Beholder (2000) 9%#56Adjusted Score: 11.657% Critics Consensus: Improbable and muddled.Synopsis: Part high-tech spy thriller and part psychological study, Eye of the Beholder was Ewan McGregor's first feature film following his...

They’ve all been dead for millions of years, but at the box office, they’ll never go extinct. This weekend’s 3D re-release of Steven Spielberg’s classic blockbuster Jurassic Park is just the latest example of how much filmgoers love getting stomped on by the big scaly beasts, but Hollywood has a long tradition of studios reaping Tyrannosaurus-sized grosses out of dino-thrillers — or occasionally looking like cavemen when audiences don’t show up. In honor of the movie biz’s continued love affair with our prehistoric pals, this week’s list offers a look back at some of the most dino-centric movies we could think of. It’s time for Total Recall!\n\n\n\n\n\nBaby: Secret of the Lost Legend\n 13%\nFilmed at a unique moment in cinema history — when animatronic effects were really starting to come into their own, and before the advent of affordable, good-looking CGI — 1985’s Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend is a sweetly affable, family-friendly drama about a husband-and-wife team of paleontologists (played by Sean Young and William Katt) racing against time through the jungles of Africa to rescue a cute widdle baby dinosaur and its mother from an evil scientist (Patrick McGoohan). Unfortunately, despite the studio’s insistence that Baby would take filmgoers on “the greatest adventure ever born,” it ended up being a bit of a box office disaster for Disney/Touchstone — and a different kind of nightmare for critics like Marie Mahoney of the Austin Chronicle, who pleaded, “Even if your children like dinosaurs, don’t let them be exposed to the offensive, insensitive, intolerably anti-humanist and racist propagandizing that is draped around them in this film. No plot, no heart, no soul.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinosaur\n 64%\nUnlike a lot of modern-day animated movies, Disney’s Dinosaur doesn’t offer much in the way of a flashy voice cast; its stars included D.B. Sweeney, Ossie Davis, Alfre Woodard, Della Reese, and a young(er) Hayden Panettiere. But what it lacked in marquee oomph, it made up with sheer visual brilliance, bringing most of its $127 million budget to bear on breathtakingly detailed computer animation. That was enough for audiences, who turned out en masse to witness the story of Aladar (Sweeney), an orphan Iguanodon adopted by a family of lemurs, bringing in nearly $350 million in worldwide grosses. Dinosaur wasn’t quite as much of a hit with critics, but it still had its supporters — including Roger Ebert, who marveled, “The movie sends the message that computer animation is now sophisticated enough to mimic life itself in full motion, with such detail that the texture of reptilian skin seems as real as a photograph in National Geographic.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinosaurus!\n 67%\nCombining two of sci-fi’s most well-worn tropes — modern man’s propensity for uncovering exotic corpses while building modern stuff and lightning’s ability to resuscitate said corpses — 1960’s Dinosaurus! takes viewers to a Caribbean harbor, where construction workers unknowingly dig up a caveman alongside some million-year-old dinosaur bodies, leave them out to be zapped by bolts from the sky, and trigger a bit of low-budget Jurassic Park action. The result isn’t really anyone’s idea of a classic dinosaur movie — but it’s also, in the words of Ken Hanke of the Mountain Xpress, “Too goofy to dislike.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurassic Park\n 91%\nHeralding the full-on arrival of Hollywood’s CG era with a throwback to good old-fashioned creature features, Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park offered sublime spectacle without forgetting the cardinal rule of filmmaking: You have to tell a story audiences are going to care about. To that end, Park assembled a cast of savvy character actors (including Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, and Richard Attenborough) to lend heart and believability to a sci-fi-infused tale about a goofy millionaire (Attenborough) who bankrolls a vacation destination filled with real live dinosaurs. Having said that, it would be disingenuous to suggest that David Koepp and Michael Crichton’s script spent much time on human characterizations; it was far too busy zipping around from one dino-peril to the next. But that was just fine with audiences, who made Jurassic Park the year’s top-grossing film by a wide margin — and with most critics, including Movieline’s Stephen Farber, who admitted “True, the dialogue and performances are feeble, but the thing is basically no more — and no less — than a nifty monster movie that delivers crackerjack thrills.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Land Before Time\n 70%\nAnimator Don Bluth was one of the more star-crossed filmmakers of the 1980s, finding his promising career derailed by a series of business setbacks throughout the decade in spite of generally well-received work. But no amount of bad luck could stop 1988’s The Land Before Time, which used the power of cute talking dinosaur toddlers to reap big box office bucks (and spawn a franchise that currently includes a dozen direct-to-video sequels). If you grew up in the 1980s, spending time with Littlefoot, Ducky, Cera, and Petrie was a rite of passage; as critic Steve Rhodes put it, “It is full of the delightful merriment of childhood, albeit dinosaur childhood not Homo sapiens. For a sweet and simple little picture the whole family can gather round the tube and watch with delight, this one delivers the goods.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand of the Lost\n 26%\nWill Ferrell, Danny McBride, and dinosaurs — plus a loose creative affiliation with one of the most beloved live-action Saturday morning serials of the 1970s. It’s a can’t-miss proposition, right? Universal certainly seemed to think so, given that the studio ponied up $100 million and a plum June release date for 2009’s Land of the Lost. Sadly, the result — which starred Ferrell as a nincompoop paleontologist who triggers a time warp and finds himself trapped in the distant past with a college student (Anna Friel) and a gift shop owner (McBride) — didn’t even try to recapture the low-budget magic of the original series, opting instead for a satirical approach that failed to resound with filmgoers and critics alike. “With his belligerent blankness and gawky aplomb, Ferrell has made me laugh as much as any comic of his generation, but he’s not doing anything fresh in Land of the Lost,” opined a disappointed Peter Rainer for the Christian Science Monitor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Land That Time Forgot\n 43%\nWorld War I was pretty terrible, what with the trench warfare and the mustard gas and the screaming death — but for the unlucky survivors of a sunken British merchant ship who were taken captive by a German U-boat, the war ended up seeming like a vacation. For these poor folks, whose adventures were immortalized in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1918 novel and adapted for the screen in Kevin Connor’s 1975 The Land That Time Forgot, becoming prisoners of war was just the beginning of a journey that ended up taking them all the way to Antarctica — where they discovered a menagerie of supposedly extinct creatures, including dinosaurs and Neanderthal humans. Of course, the dinosaurs looked a heck of a lot like puppets — and the boat, for that matter, looked an awful lot like a model — but unless you’ve been to Antarctica yourself, who are you to judge? Audiences were only too happy to make the journey to this Land, making it one of the year’s surprise hits, and though most critics rolled their eyes at its low-budget effects and hammy performances, others appreciated its throwback matinee vibe. Time’s Jay Cocks, for one, promised that “instant second childhood is guaranteed in less than 90 minutes.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanet of Dinosaurs\n \nForget about traveling into the distant past or wasting time resurrecting a few measly velociraptors. For 1978’s Planet of Dinosaurs, director James Shea and an army of low-wage effects engineers cooked up a story about a spaceship crew crash-landing on a distant planet that just happened to be covered in dinosaurs. Shea didn’t have any stars in his cast or much money to work with (as the movie’s Wikipedia page politely puts it, Planet “was filmed on a significantly limited budget”), leaving his film to suffer an ignominious fate at the box office, but it’s developed something of an ironic cult following among the Rifftrax crowd — even if, as critics like Cinefantastique’s Steve Biodrowski caution, “Although set in the future, Planet of Dinosaurs is pure 1970s camp, with hairstyles and jump-suits that evoke unpleasant memories of the horrible disco era.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Valley of Gwangi\n 78%\nLong before Cowboys &amp; Aliens blended Westerns &amp; sci-fi, The Valley of Gwangi imagined what might happen if a traveling Wild West show had its tiny horse stolen by a pack of gypsies and, in the process of trying to get it back, unwittingly unleashed stop-motion dinosaur havoc. While perhaps not objectively a “good” movie, Gwangi is notable for employing special-effects titan Ray Harryhausen, who brought his singular animation style to bear on the movie’s array of rampaging prehistoric creatures. “How can a dinosaur fan of any age not love Gwangi,” queried Commercial Appeal’s John Beifuss, “in which the title Allosaurus makes his public debut with the unscheduled addition of a screaming dwarf between his jaws?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story\n 38%\n1993 turned out to be the year of the dinosaur for Steven Spielberg, who executive-produced this animated adventure through his Amblin imprint — and sent it to theaters just a few months after unleashing Jurassic Park on throngs of suitably impressed filmgoers. The reaction to We’re Back! A Dinosaur’s Story turned out to be quite a bit less enthusiastic, in spite of a family-friendly story about dinosaurs popping up in modern-day New York City and a bizarrely eclectic voice cast that included everyone from John Goodman and Rhea Perlman to Walter Cronkite and Jay Leno. “We’re Back is an exercise in endurance,” groaned James Berardinelli of ReelViews. “Not only is it dull, but it has such an overwhelming sense of sweetness that it threatens to become nauseating.”\n\n\n\nTake a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Character actors don’t come with much more character than Mr. Jenkins, so with all due respect to Emmerich’s effects and Tatum’s pecs, we knew this was the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to one of Hollywood’s most distinguished supporting players. It’s time for Total Recall! 76%10. Intolerable CrueltyTwo years after popping up in The Man Who Wasn’t There, Jenkins reunited with the Coen brothers for Intolerable Cruelty, a comedy that — while taking as jaundiced a view of fate and human nature as anything else in their filmography — offered a relatively frothy take on the old-fashioned Hollywood battle-of-the-sexes farce. Starring George Clooney as a well-known divorce lawyer and Catherine Zeta-Jones as the woman he lives to regret railroading out of a potentially huge settlement (during a segment in which he steamrolls her lawyer, played by Jenkins), Cruelty struck some critics as excessively mean-spirited in its enthusiastically nasty depiction of unscrupulous attorneys and money-grubbing divorcees — but it struck just the right balance for Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, who found it “Elegant, cheerfully cynical fun of the kind we used to get regularly from Billy Wilder, Howard Hawks and other masters of the classic Hollywood screwball comedy.” 74%9. Killing Them SoftlyJenkins’ world-weary face and soft-spoken demeanor can be used to convey warmth and kindness or coldly pragmatic cruelty, depending on the occasion, and in writer/director Andrew Dominik’s Killing Me Softly, they were called upon for a bit of both. Here, Jenkins plays a Mafia go-between for a hitman (Brad Pitt) who’s been contracted to kill a shady game room proprietor (Ray Liotta) in order to restore dignity to the local gambling operation; it seems like a straightforward enough job, but things get complicated, owing to the involvement of a pair of incompetent crooks (Scoot McNairy and Ben Mendelsohn) as well as the unpredictable hitman Pitt’s hired to rub them out (James Gandolfini). Although it wasn’t one of Pitt’s more commercially successful efforts, it earned praise from critics like Mick LaSalle, who wrote, “There is not one moment in the film that doesn’t represent the director’s carefully considered thought, whether we’re talking about acting values, camera placement, sound or style of presentation.” 76%8. Sea of LoveJenkins’ career has grown to the point where he’s capable of landing central roles, but in his earlier years as a film actor, he developed a reputation as the kind of guy who could imbue even smaller parts with enough three-dimensional believability to make them seem larger than they really were. Case in point: 1989’s Sea of Love, the slow-burning thriller about an alcoholic cop (Al Pacino) who becomes embroiled in a disturbing murder case while falling in love with the sultry femme fatale (Ellen Barkin) who may or may not be the serial killer he’s looking for. As the fellow cop who ended up marrying Pacino’s character’s wife after she walked out on him, Jenkins is mostly relegated to the background, but he’s one of several characters (as well as actors smartly chosen by director Harold Becker) who help ground the lurid and often ridiculous film with some semblance of normalcy. “Sea of Love has its Cinemax lapses in taste,” admitted Bill Chambers of Film Freak Central, “but most films of the genre lack sophistication from which to lapse.” 77%7. The Mudge BoyA Sundance Grand Jury Prize nominee, this little-seen indie starred Emile Hirsch as the painfully shy son of a widowed recluse (Richard Jenkins) who can’t seem to figure out what to make of him — which is understandable, seeing as how the kid sleeps with a chicken and likes to dress up in his late mother’s clothes. Such personality quirks don’t do Hirsch’s character any favors in the small social circles he’s forced to run at school, and from The Mudge Boy‘s earliest scenes, the viewer can sense that things aren’t going to end well for him, but it’s still hard to look away. Calling it “Unsettling and mildly shocking at times,” Newsday’s Jan Stuart wrote, “this is an adolescent tale of the sort one might expect from Flannery O’Connor or Paul Bowles if they were in the business of coming-of-age dramas.” 78%6. Burn After ReadingPart of Jenkins’ prolific breakthrough year in 2008 — which also included The Visitor and Step Brothers — the Coen brothers production Burn After Reading employed an eyebrow-raising cast of character actors (including John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and, of course, J.K. Simmons) to unravel a pitch-black comedy about a burnout CIA analyst (Malkovich) whose memoirs are stolen and end up in the hands of a pair of dunderheaded health club employees (McDormand and Brad Pitt) who misunderstand their meaning and try selling them to the Russians, all while a philandering U.S. Marshal (George Clooney) complicates matters by unwittingly carrying on affairs with all of the women involved. “None of it makes strict sense, which is why it’s called screwball,” admitted the Toronto Star’s Peter Howell, “but in its own crazy way Burn After Reading nails the essential folly of humans pretending to be civilized.” 81%5. The Man Who Wasn’t ThereThe first of Jenkins’ three Coen brothers films (so far), 2001’s The Man Who Wasn’t There gave him the small but pivotal role of Walter Abundas, friend and next door neighbor to Ed Crane (Billy Bob Thornton), the small-town barber whose marital difficulties form the basis for a noir-influenced misadventure that includes a murder, a seedy lawyer (Tony Shalhoub), and a crucial moment of indiscretion with Walter’s piano-playing teenage daughter (Scarlett Johansson). Admitting that it’s “Slowly paced for a thriller and with a hero many will find off-putting,” Empire’s Kim Newman argued that “this is nevertheless a gripping, unusual and challenging work from the most consistently brilliant filmmakers of the last decade.” 87%4. Flirting With DisasterJenkins earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his work in this David O. Russell comedy, starring Ben Stiller as an adopted man who refuses to name his newborn child until he can learn the identity of his biological parents — thus kicking off a cross-country road trip involving his wife (Patricia Arquette), an adoption agency employee (Tea Leoni), and a pair of ATF agents who happen to be in a relationship with each other (Jenkins and Josh Brolin). As can often be the case with Russell’s films, it’s a bit of an unwieldy setup, but it all came together satisfyingly enough for most critics — including Roger Ebert, who observed, “There are conventions in this sort of story, and Russell seems to violate most of them. He allows the peculiarities of his characters to lead them away from the plot line and into perplexities of their own. To watch that happening is a lot of fun.” 90%3. The VisitorAfter a career’s worth of “that guy” roles, Jenkins earned his moment to shine (and a Best Actor Oscar nomination) in 2008’s The Visitor, a quietly graceful indie drama about a college professor whose lonely existence is upended when he’s forced to attend a conference in New York and, arriving at the old apartment he rarely visits, is startled to discover a pair of illegal immigrants renting it from a fraudulent “realtor.” Rather than having them thrown out, he decides to let them stay — an act of uncommon kindness that ultimately proves more rewarding to the professor than his unexpected tenants. Calling it a “parable of decency,” Tony Macklin of the Fayetteville Free Weekly wrote, “The best movies are those that understand the human condition and have a personal vision. The Visitor is one of those rare creations.” 88%2. Let Me InHollywood doesn’t exactly have a spotless track record when it comes to adapting foreign films, so many cineastes feared the worst when Relativity Media announced plans to remake the Swedish critical favorite Let the Right One In with Cloverfield director Matt Reeves at the helm. Happily, even with the language switch — and a new cast that included Kodi Smit-McPhee, Chloe Moretz, and Jenkins — the original story’s uncommonly smart, creepy take on the vampire genre came shining through, and although Let Me In wasn’t a huge box office success, it resonated with appreciative critics like Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle, who called it “A striking piece of character-driven horror” that “ranks (despite the effects) among the more understated fright fests to hit the mainstream in recent memory.” 92%1. The Cabin in the WoodsStudio difficulties held up its release for over two years, but unlike the vast majority of films that spend an extended period of time in the vault before reaching theaters, The Cabin in the Woods enjoyed an enthusiastic critical response — partly because members of its cast and crew had gone on to bigger things since production wrapped in 2009 (including director/co-writer Drew Goddard, producer/co-writer Joss Whedon, and cast member Chris “Thor” Hemsworth), and partly because of the way the story manages to embrace horror movie tropes while subverting them with an infectious blend of love and intelligence. It’s hard to discuss Cabin‘s plot without spoiling it for anyone who hasn’t seen it, but the Atlantic’s Christopher Orr described it pretty well, calling it “A horror movie embedded in a conspiracy flick embedded in another horror movie” and “the most inventive cabin-in-the-woods picture since The Evil Dead and the canniest genre deconstruction since Scream.”In case you were wondering, here are Jenkins’ top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Visitor — 82%2. The Man Who Wasn’t There — 81%3. Eye Of God — 78%4. The Cabin in the Woods — 76%5. Let Me In — 74%6. North Country — 72%7. The Mudge Boy — 71%8. Jack Reacher — 69%9.

But all those people didn’t get together to make any old film: Movie 43 is part of the rich Hollywood tradition of anthologies — movies in which sometimes-disparate collections of filmmakers come together to create a larger statement. We decided to dedicate this week’s list to those efforts, and while limiting our choices to movies with multiple directors forced us to make some painful cuts (sorry, Creepshow fans), we still ended up with a pretty broad overview of a genre that’s probably never gotten enough love from mainstream audiences. It’s time for Total Recall!Amazon Women on the Moon 61%The Directors: Joe Dante, Carl Gottlieb, Peter Horton, and John LandisThe Big Idea: Perhaps because the format lends itself to larger casts and crews, anthology films tend to explore big ideas and weighty themes — but they can also work pretty well as comedy collections, as evidenced by 1987’s pleasantly scattershot late-night cable staple Amazon Women on the Moon. Offering a manic 1980s update to earlier goofball shorts compendiums like The Boob Tube and Kentucky Fried Movie (whose director, John Landis, helmed a segment here), Amazon Women is probably silly more than anything else, but on the whole, it generates a surprising amount of laughs. Janet Maslin of the New York Times was suitably entertained, calling it “An anarchic, often hilarious adventure in dial-spinning, a collection of brief skits and wacko parodies that are sometimes quite clever, though they’re just as often happily sophomoric, too.”Boccaccio ’70 50%The Directors: Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, Federico Fellini, and Mario MonicelliThe Big Idea: Weighing in at a hefty 208 minutes, the complete Boccaccio ’70 is more of a cinematic endurance test than most anthology films, at least in terms of sheer length — but for devotees of the titular 14th-century essayist, its four segments offered valuable insights into timeless truths regarding morality and love. “It has glamour, sophistication, color, wit and sensuality (not necessarily in that order), all of which blend very well in the enveloping air of a facility that is to be devoted to the showing of sophisticated films,” asserted an approving Bosley Crowther for the New York Times.Eros 34%The Directors: Wong Kar-wai, Steven Soderbergh, and Michelangelo AntonioniThe Big Idea: Love, goes the saying, makes the world go ’round — but lust and sex are some pretty powerful locomotive forces on their own, and all three of them get their share of the spotlight in this 2004 Italian drama. In spite of its universal themes, talented crew of directors, and a cast that included Robert Downey Jr. and Gong Li, Eros played on relatively few screens during its brief North American run — and it was greeted with widespread critical disdain, with the New York Observer’s Rex Reed calling it “a triptych only a film festival could love.” Still, it was worth a look for critics like Jan Stuart of Newsday, who summed it up by writing, “Wong’s is the sexiest, Soderbergh’s the funniest, Antonioni’s the most Italian.”Four Rooms 14%The Directors: Allison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin TarantinoThe Big Idea: Like the long-running ABC drama Hotel with an indie sensibility, Four Rooms plunged viewers into the wacky goings-on at a posh Los Angeles hotel on New Year’s Eve. With its rich premise and a splendidly eclectic cast that included Antonio Banderas, Jennifer Beals, Madonna, Marisa Tomei, and Ione Skye — plus Tim Roth as the hapless bellhop whose absurd travails framed the four segments — Rooms should have been a winner; alas, it was more of a critical punching bag for writers like Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle, who called it “a batch of shrill, self-indulgent sketches that turn so wretched in spots you start to wonder if the filmmakers wanted them to be bad.”New York Stories 75%The Directors: Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin ScorseseThe Big Idea: A trilogy of short films about New York City, all made by three of the most talented — and NYC-indebted — directors in modern film, New York Stories should have been a slam dunk. The reality turned out to be a little more complicated, with critics sort of shrugging their shoulders at the film and audiences neglecting to turn out in sufficient numbers for it to earn back its $10 million budget, but all in all, Stories is one of the more critically well-regarded anthologies of the 1980s — which is really as it should be, given the talents at work behind the cameras, not to mention appearances from Nick Nolte, Rosanna Arquette, Mia Farrow, Steve Buscemi, and many others. It is, as Joe Brown wrote for the Washington Post, “A novel and fascinating foray into highly stylized, highly personal filmmaking.”Paris, je t’aime 86%The Directors: Olivier Assayas, Frédéric Auburtin, Emmanuel Benbihy, Gurinder Chadha, Sylvain Chomet, Ethan Coen, Joel Coen, Isabel Coixet, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuarón, Gérard Depardieu, Christopher Doyle, Richard LaGravenese, Vincenzo Natali, Alexander Payne, Bruno Podalydès, Walter Salles, Oliver Schmitz, Nobuhiro Suwa, Daniela Thomas, Tom Tykwer, Gus Van SantThe Big Idea: As you’ve probably already inferred from its title, Paris, je t’aime is all about the City of Light — and whatever you think about the movie itself, let’s say this much for it: With 18 segments and more than 20 directors wrapped into its two-hour running time, this is one anthology that takes the “short films” part of “collection of short films” seriously. With so many disparate talents jostling for attention, Paris probably should have been a disjointed mess, but according to most critics, it was quite the opposite — as Owen Gleiberman put it for Entertainment Weekly, “Anthology films usually work better in theory than execution, but this feature parade of shorts is a blithe, worldly, and enchanting exception.”7 Days in Havana 40%The Directors: Benicio del Toro, Pablo Trapero, Julio Médem, Elia Suleiman, Gaspar Noé, Juan Carlos Tabío, and Laurent CantetThe Big Idea: It’s pretty much what the title says: Seven short films, each revolving around one day in the Cuban capital. Given that the project bought itself a little narrative cohesion thanks to a screenplay written by one author — Cuban novelist Leonardo Padura Fuentes — a surprising number of critics felt that 7 Days in Havana was too dull and clichéd to justify such a long cinematic trip. As Tara Brady queried in her review for the Irish Times, “It’s enough to justify the admission price, but only just. 7 Days? Is there a weekend package we might avail of?”Six in Paris 75%The Directors: Claude Chabrol, Jean Douchet, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Daniel Pollet, Eric Rohmer, and Jean RouchThe Big Idea: As you can probably guess from its title, Six in Paris united six Gallic filmmakers for an omnibus trip through the French New Wave, combining to offer one of the stronger anthologies of the early-to-mid 1960s. At the time, some critics dismissed it as little more than a mildly diverting trifle, but Paris has held up over time — as evidenced by the words of the Minneapolis Star Tribune’s Kathie Smith, who later mused, “What most ensemble films lack in cohesiveness, Six in Paris finds in historical context. Forty years later, it is an essential testament of the French New Wave’s energy, ingenuity and aesthetic.”Spirits of the Dead 86%The Directors: Federico Fellini, Louis Malle, and Roger VadimThe Big Idea: A horror anthology with a remarkable pedigree, Spirits of the Dead presented film fans with three segments, all inspired by Edgar Allan Poe stories. Anchored by an impressive cast that included Jane and Peter Fonda, Terence Stamp, and Brigitte Bardot, Dead transcended its genre trappings to earn enthusiastic reviews — and it still continues to resonate with currently active scribes such as Nathan Rabin of the A.V. Club, who argued that “It offers pleasures above and beyond its status as a relic of a groovier and exponentially more swinging era.”Tokyo! 76%The Directors: Michel Gondry, Leos Carax, and Bong Joon-hoThe Big Idea: Quite a few anthology films are based around cities, but rather than offering viewers an insider’s perspective into the titular city, 2008’s Tokyo! took the opposite approach, enlisting three non-Japanese directors to use Tokyo as the background for a wildly diverse trio of segments. (Example: Gondry’s short film adapted a comic, while Carax’s concerned an onerous sewer-dwelling creature). “Grasping a unifying theme from the three distinct tales is one of the pleasures of watching the movie,” mused Steve Ramos of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “Loneliness gets my vote, but Tokyo! is adventurous enough to spark many different theories.”Triangle 53%The Directors: Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam, and Johnnie ToThe Big Idea: A sort of Chinese action flick version of the grade-school game Telephone, Triangle used three directors, all working independently with separate crews and screenwriters, to tell the overarching tale of three friends (Louis Koo, Simon Yam, and Sun Honglei) who come into possession of a treasure map — and who subsequently discover that finding said treasure may not be everything it’s cracked up to be. Although a sizable number of critics found the result every bit as disjointed as you might expect, given the process that produced it, Triangle is notable for being the now-retired Lam’s final film — and, in the words of Little White Lies’ Anton Bitel, for being “a convoluted crime caper with strong ethical underpinnings to support its many moods and styles.”Twilight Zone: The Movie 57%The Directors: John Landis, Steven Spielberg, Joe Dante and George MillerThe Big Idea: The Twilight Zone had been off the air for nearly 20 years when its cinematic counterpart arrived in theaters in 1983, but its basic proposition — offering a series of unrelated, grimly disquieting short stories to viewers looking for a few things that went bump in the night — remained just as brilliantly effective. And given that Warner Bros. lined up a stable of suitably talented directors to usher filmgoers into its theatrical Zone, it should have been a huge hit — but while it more than recouped its $10 million budget, critics and audiences were relatively lukewarm to the movie, which also suffered from being overshadowed by a real-life on-set tragedy that killed actor Vic Morrow. For Keith Breese of Filmcritic, however, the overall effect was “a roller-coaster homage to adolescence.”V/H/S 57%The Directors: Adam Wingard, David Bruckner, Ti West, Glenn McQuaid, Joe Swanberg, and Radio Silence (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett, Justin Martinez and Chad Villella)The Big Idea: Giving a smart-in-theory twist to the burgeoning crowd of found-footage horror flicks, V/H/S used a framing device (a group of criminals break into a house to steal a VHS tape for a client) to unite a series of lo-fi-looking shorts into a 116-minute whole. Unsurprisingly, critical mileage varied wildly, with some scribes hailing it as brilliantly scary and others dismissing it as two hours of footage that was visually as well as narratively shaky. “The mostly played-out found footage aesthetic has its limitations, and V/H/S doesn’t escape all of them,” admitted Ian Buckwalter for the Atlantic. “But the collected directors do manage to make many of those limitations into the films’ strengths.”Visions of Eight 50%The Directors: Milos Forman, Claude Lelouch, Yuri Ozerov, Mai Zetterling, Kon Ichikawa, John Schlesinger, Arthur Penn, and Michael PflegharThe Big Idea: Admirable in theory if perhaps not entirely in execution, Visions of Eight united eight of the most noteworthy directors of the early 1970s to offer their unique takes on the 1972 Summer Olympics. Intentionally incomprehensive and willfully scattered, Visions resisted the familiar narrative frameworks of traditional sports films, and paid for it with largely dismissive reviews that accused the film of — in Variety’s words — “[forgetting] the idea of sport and competition itself, to indulge in ideas.” It found an appreciative audience in Roger Ebert, however; as he wrote approvingly, “What nobody could have anticipated, perhaps, is how similar many of those visions would be.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

If you’re anything like us, Ralph‘s Q*Bert and King Koopa cameos will trigger long-buried arcade flashbacks, but even if you’ve never lost a quarter (or hours of your life) to a game, you’ve probably seen at least a few of the movies on our latest list. Yes, this week, we’re paying tribute to movies whose plots hinge on video games, and you know what that means — limber up your thumbs, because it’s time for Total Recall!Cloak &amp; Dagger 67%One of two Dabney Coleman appearances on our list, 1984’s Cloak &amp; Dagger starred a post-E.T. Henry Thomas as an 11-year-old gamer whose relationship with his distant father is healed after he inadvertently stumbles into a real-life case of espionage involving a copy of his favorite game (named — you guessed it — Cloak &amp; Dagger). Featuring Coleman in a dual role as Thomas’ father as well as his imaginary game hero, Jack Flack, Dagger offered a big 1980s spin on the 1940s noir picture The Window while incorporating trendy video game tropes — and if it didn’t fare quite as well as The Last Starfighter, with which it was originally paired as a double feature offering, it was good enough for critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “The last thing we need right now is another movie about a boy caught up in the world of computer games — but Cloak and Dagger, while fitting that mold, is clever and enjoyable anyhow.”eXistenZ 74%One of the more enjoyable, and overlooked, futuristic thrillers of the ’90s, David Cronenberg’s eXistenZ follows a game developer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a low-level employee at her company (Jude Law) on the run from bad guys wielding freaky guns that shoot human teeth. Sound bizarre? It is, and that doesn’t even take into account the script’s constant shifts between the real world and an increasingly difficult-to-detect virtual reality. Not a film with particularly broad appeal, in other words, but it tickled the neuroreceptors of critics like Jim Ridley of the Nashville Scene, who wrote, “Cronenberg makes leaps of logic, character, and setting so baffling that they don’t become clear until the end. Even then, the final outcome is so devious you’ll sit poking yourself to make sure you won’t disappear with the click of the projector.”Gamer 30%Given how strongly their visual sensibilities seem to have been influenced by video games, you’d think Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor would be a natural fit for a movie like Gamer, which takes place in an imaginary future when technology allows unscrupulous individuals to engage in the “ultimate video game” by using mind control to play a grisly first-person shooter in which the stakes are literally life and death. Alas, most critics felt that the end result was a cynical piece of shoot-’em-up action possessing none of the duo’s signature flair — although it found a few supporters in critics like AMCTV’s Maitland McDonaugh, who argued, “A streak of genius runs through this dystopian vision of a world where VR games are played with real people… it touches some exposed nerves before retreating into clichés.”The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters 97%A lot of movies about video games highlight the way they can blur the line between reality and its virtual facsimile — but perhaps none so effectively as King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, Seth Gordon’s 2007 documentary about the war that continues to rage over ultimate high score supremacy among classic arcade game aficionados. By focusing on the bitter rivalry between mulleted arcade kingpin Billy Mitchell and Steve Wiebe, his soft-spoken challenger for the Donkey Kong world record, King of Kong manages some thought-provoking commentary on human nature while also serving as a pleasantly nostalgic trip down memory lane for the grown-up kids who haunted arcades in the 1980s — and for those who never lost their allowance to the machines, Adam Graham of the Detroit News writes that it “illuminates and draws you into a subculture you never knew existed and makes you genuinely care about its characters.”The Last Starfighter 76%A teen-friendly interstellar action flick that brought hardcore gamers’ dreams to life while presaging the future direction of military technology, 1984’s The Last Starfighter follows the adventures of a small-town teen (Lance Guest) whose incredible skill with a video game (called Starfighter, natch) leads to his being recruited as a pilot in an alien space war. It’s familiar stuff — especially during an era when the memory of one of cinema’s most memorable wannabe space warriors, Luke Skywalker, was fresh in everyone’s minds — but it’s capably handled, and it’s easy to see how The Last Starfighter became one of the most beloved cult classics of the decade. As Rob Vaux of the Flipside Movie Emporium cautioned, “If you’re going to shamelessly rip off Star Wars, make sure you do it with as much spirit as this film.”Ra. One 60%Plenty of films have imagined computer programs invading the real world, but Ra. One offers a Bollywood spin on that well-worn plot outline — and uses it as a high-tech framing device for a story about the bumpy relationship between a struggling game designer (Shahrukh Khan) and his young son (Armaan Verma). It’s the kind of setup that can easily spill over into cheap sentimentality, not to mention the overuse of the sort of CG visuals and 3D effects that helped make Ra. One one of the most expensive films ever produced in India, but as far as most U.S. critics were concerned, the end result proved perfectly entertaining — in the words of Rachel Saltz of the New York Times, a “sci-fi superhero thriller… a kind of entertainment machine set to dazzle, Hindi cinema with a crush on high-tech.”Scott Pilgrim vs. the World 82%Teenage love can feel as high-stakes as the biggest boss battle in the toughest video game, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World captures that struggle brilliantly — right down to the power-ups and tongue-in-cheek sound effects that follow Scott (Michael Cera) on his dangerous quest to win the hand of Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). No, it isn’t as much of a literal gamer film as some of the others on this list, but as a cinematic interpretation of video games’ uniquely adrenaline-fueled appeal, it’s just about perfect — and on another level, writes Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News, it’s “a romantic adventure for the ADD age, a pop poem for Millennials that could just as well be titled Scott Pilgrim vs. the Old Ways of Storytelling.”Spy Kids 3-D – Game Over 45%Robert Rodriguez has always had a gift for gonzo visuals, and for the third chapter in his Spy Kids saga, he decided to go all-out, imprisoning his young protagonists in a virtual reality game designed by the nefarious Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) and presenting the action in 3D. While most critics crossed their fingers in the hopes that the Game Over part of Spy Kids 3D‘s title would prove prophetic, for others, it was a fun family time at the movies; as Claudia Puig argued for USA Today, “This third installment follows up on the thrills and dazzling visuals that charmed audiences in the first film.”TRON 72%The home computers of the 1980s weren’t quite the souped-up gaming machines that some of today’s desktops are, but when Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) ran afoul of competing programmer Ed Dillinger (David Warner) and wound up being zapped into the digital realm in 1982’s Tron, it was no surprise that he found himself in a gamer’s landscape filled with lightcycles and deadly discs — or that the stakes for those games were suddenly life and death. Calling it “a dazzling movie from Walt Disney in which computers have been used to make themselves romantic and glamorous,” Roger Ebert applauded, “Here’s a technological sound-and-light show that is sensational and brainy, stylish, and fun.”WarGames 93%The movie that forever changed the meaning of the phrase “how about a nice game of chess,” WarGames tried to capitalize on the early 1980s video game craze by spinning a far-fetched yarn about a teen hacker (Matthew Broderick) who worms his way into a NORAD computer and, thinking he’s playing a cool new game before it hits stores, ends up nearly triggering World War III. It’s the kind of bleep-and-bloop-assisted high-stakes drama that Hollywood’s been messing up since computers were invented, but in this case, it works — partly because the drama was amplified by our very real Cold War paranoia, and partly because of a terrific cast that also included Ally Sheedy, Dabney Coleman, and a young (but still quite crusty) Barry Corbin. Observed Roger Ebert, “As a premise for a thriller, this is a masterstroke.”The Wizard 29%After a few fallow years in the mid-1980s, video games were once again big business by the end of the decade, riding a resurgence largely powered by the wildly popular Nintendo Entertainment System home console. The phenomenon grew so large that it earned what was essentially an extended cinematic commercial for the NES: 1989’s The Wizard, starring Fred Savage and Jenny Lewis as a pair of tweens who hitchhike across the country with his kid brother, a nearly mute young gamer whose skills seem tailor-made for the “Video Armageddon” competition. Chiefly notable for giving NES fans their first glimpse of the hotly anticipated Super Mario Bros. 3, the movie died early and often with critics; one of its few positive reviews came from the Arizona Daily Star’s rather sarcastic Phil Villarreal, who chuckled, “I love The Wizard. It’s so bad.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives. And don’t forget to check out the reviews for Wreck-it Ralph.Finally, here’s a young Emilio Estevez doing battle with a malevolent arcade game called The Bishop of Battle, from the 1983 horror anthology Nightmares:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"new, John, Max, Mary, Awards, Arts, Wars, News, and, medical","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Scott-Pilgrim.jpg","slug":"total-recall-movies-about-video-games"},{"id":"47508978576886","title":"Total Recall: Jean Reno’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Jean Reno's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Alex Cross star.by Jeff Giles | October 18, 2012 |  CommentsMost American filmgoers didn’t know who he was prior to The Professional in 1994, but Jean Reno was already a César-nominated titan of French cinema at that point — and his filmography has only broadened in the nearly 20 years since, with comedies, dramas, and big-budget action pictures being added to the list along the way. With Reno making an appearance in this weekend’s Alex Cross, we decided now would be the perfect time to take a look back at some of his brightest critical highlights, and you know what that means: It’s time for Total Recall! 56%10. La RafleFilms inspired by the Jewish Holocaust of World War II are a crowded genre, but writer/director Roselyne Bosch’s La Rafle stands out from the pack — not only is it inspired by a true story, but it features performances from some of the people who lived through the incident referenced in its title, the Rafle du Vel’ d’Hiv of 1942. Reliving the travails of French Jews who were arrested with the assistance of policemen working with the Nazis, La Rafle has some weighty stuff to deal with — and although some critics felt that Bosch played things a little too safe to achieve maximum impact, others were deeply moved. “Bosch is working in unabashed historical epic mode here, balancing individual stories with grand-scale awfulness effectively,” argued Tom Long of the Detroit News. “She never swerves for cheap sentiment, she just lays it all out.” 66%9. Mission: ImpossibleAfter breaking through in The Professional, Reno started fielding offers from Hollywood, and by 1995, American filmgoers were seeing him in films like French Kiss — as well as Mission: Impossible, which found him playing a member of the secret team assembled by an on-the-run Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to flush out a rogue agent (Jon Voight). Blending big-budget action set pieces with all the disguises, double-crosses, and cool gadgets that fans of the TV show could hope for, M:I proved a mission impossible not to accept for critics like Roger Ebert, who summed up its appeal succinctly: “Tom Cruise looks cool and holds our attention while doing neat things that we don’t quite understand.” 62%8. The Big BlueFrance’s biggest box-office hit of the 1980s, The Big Blue follows the real-life relationship between a pair of competitive free divers (played by Reno and Jean-Marc Barr) whose childhood friendship fosters a bond that not even their grown-up competition can break. While a number of critics found the movie’s feel-good melodrama a little hard to take, audiences certainly responded to it — and even if the fictionalized exploits cooked up by writer/director Luc Besson didn’t really correspond with the true story that inspired them, they resonated with critics like Ian Nathan of Empire, who wrote, “This simple tale of love, friendship and the sea lingers in the mind long after the final credits.” 68%7. The Crimson RiversReno has attracted a lot of attention while playing characters on the wrong side of the law, but for 2000’s The Crimson Rivers, he was one of the good guys — an upstanding cop whose investigation into a brutal murder leads him to a faraway town, and into the path of a separate case being followed by a younger officer (Vincent Cassel). Writer/director Mathieu Kassovitz delved unflinchingly into the story’s gory details — but unlike a fair number of grisly cop thrillers, Rivers didn’t neglect to develop a cast of interesting characters to support all the mystery and horror. And the cast was more than up for the challenge, according to critics like Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, who observed, “Some actors are just automatically the moral locus of every scene they’re in. They’re the major movie stars, and Reno is one of those.” 68%6. RoninAction thrillers set in Europe are a dime a dozen, but 1998’s Ronin boasts a better pedigree than most: Its script was co-written by David Mamet (working under a pseudonym) and it was helmed by director John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate), working with a cast that included Robert De Niro, Stellan Skarsgard, and — naturally — Jean Reno. Filled with plenty of car chases, double-crosses, and exotic locales, Ronin drummed up $70 million at the box office while earning positive reviews from critics like Variety’s Todd McCarthy, who called it “a pleasurable throwback to the sort of gritty, low-tech international thriller that was a staple of the 1960s.” 74%5. MargaretLong before it arrived in theaters, Kenneth Lonergan’s Margaret was a source of widespread fascination — not only for film fans who waited patiently while it moved slowly through post-production, but also for the lawyers involved in the multiple lawsuits sparked by Lonergan’s years-long struggle to settle on a final cut that both he and the studio could agree upon. All’s well that ends well, however, and when all two and a half hours of Margaret finally debuted in late September of 2011, a good many critics deemed it well worth the wait, heaping praise upon the tale of a Manhattan teenager (Anna Paquin) who becomes embroiled in a lawsuit against a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo). Part of an attention-getting supporting cast that included Allison Janney, Matt Damon, and Matthew Broderick, Reno helped round out what Moira MacDonald of the Seattle Times called “Messy but masterful; a sprawling portrait of what it means to be a bright young woman who’s realizing that the world isn’t the warm bath of acceptance that her privileged life would indicate.” 73%4. Flushed AwayWith a voice cast led by Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, and Ian McKellen, the marketing muscle of DreamWorks Animation, and animation courtesy of the geniuses at Aardman, Flushed Away should have been a Shrek-sized hit. Alas, audiences just weren’t terribly interested in the story of a mouse (Jackman) who is flushed down the toilet by a vengeful rat and ends up tangling with an amphibious sewer overlord (McKellen) and his French cousin (Reno). It didn’t live up to expectations, but for a ‘toon with such strong British themes (including a subplot involving the World Cup), it did fairly well with American audiences — and though Aardman’s experiences with DreamWorks on the movie led to a split between the studios, the end result was still charming enough to earn a 73 percent Tomatometer rating, thanks to positive reviews from critics like the New York Times’ A.O. Scott, who enjoyed its “exuberant and infectious silliness.” 74%3. Léon: The ProfessionalIt’s his mug on the poster — and it’s his ruthlessness as a hitman that gives the movie its name — but Reno had The Professional more or less stolen out from under him by the 12-year-old Natalie Portman, who played a young orphan who’s seen her crack-dealing family mowed down by vengeful DEA agents (and who then goes on to pursue a terribly inappropriate relationship with Reno’s character). Add a borderline insane performance from Gary Oldman into the mix, and The Professional could easily have skidded into B-movie territory; in fact, a few critics felt that’s exactly where it belonged. The majority, however, were too entranced by the sweetly deadly chemistry between Portman and Reno to notice the film’s flaws. As Time’s Richard Schickel wrote, “The bonding of Mathilda and Leon may be among the strangest in the long, tiresome history of odd-couple movies.” 89%2. La Femme NikitaAfter working together on The Big Blue and Subway, Reno and Luc Besson reunited for one of their more successful (and influential) collaborations: 1990’s Nikita (La Femme Nikita), starring Annie Parillaud as a sociopathic young woman whose arrest for her role in a violent robbery leads to employment in a secret government agency and training as a lethal assassin. Reno’s role, as a fellow agent who’s sent to help Nikita clean up a bungled mission, was far from the biggest of his career — but it helped set up his breakout performance in The Professional four years later, and made him a part of what was to become a durable Transatlantic franchise that would eventually spin off an American remake and two TV series. As Film Threat’s Felix Vasquez Jr. put it, “This Besson thriller sparked many a wannabe, but it’s clear this film stands on its own two feet — and kicks you in the head.” 91%1. Hotel RwandaThis will be a controversial choice for many readers, seeing as how Reno isn’t in Hotel Rwanda for more than a few minutes — but we limit our choices for these lists to films that have been released in the U.S., and while he’s made a ton of movies overseas, he’s had less of a presence Stateside, so we made more room for smaller roles than we ordinarily might have. In any case, Reno’s appearance as Sabena Airlines President Mr. Tillens, while brief (and uncredited), provides a powerful moment in a film full of them; this fictionalized dramatization of events taking place during the Rwandan genocide earned multiple Academy Award nominations (including Best Actor for Don Cheadle), as well as copious praise from critics like Eric Harrison of the Houston Chronicle, who wrote, “Because of the subject matter, this feels like one of those films you see because it’s good for you. But it also is an extraordinarily moving drama.”In case you were wondering, here are Reno’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Léon: The Professional — 94%2. Hotel Rwanda — 94%3. The Big Blue — 91%4. The Tiger and the Snow — 83%5. La Femme Nikita — 80%6. Ronin — 76%7. For Roseanna — 73%8. Mission: Impossible — 70%9. French Kiss — 69%10.

Alonso Duralde is not only an esteemed film critic and an RT compatriot, he literally wrote the book on Christmas movies (check out Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas here), so we asked him to share some of his favorite underrated holiday pictures.)I grew up in a household that owned four Christmas albums — Bing Crosby, Andy Williams, Dean Martin, and the Boston Pops. And that was it. So part of what I enjoy about Christmas as an adult is the discovery of the vast thicket of vintage holiday music out there, from Pearl Bailey and Lena Horne to the Ray Conniff Singers and the Three Sons.Same deal with movies; I came of age in the 1970s, the golden era of It’s a Wonderful Life being in the public domain and airing all day, every day, throughout the month of December. As I got older (and wrote the book Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas), I was delighted to find that I had as many new buried treasures among Christmas films as I’ve had with music.If you’re looking to diversify your holiday viewing past A Christmas Story and Miracle on 34th Street (which are both great, don’t get me wrong), you should pick up the book. In the meantime, here’s a taste of some great Christmas movies that may have gone under your radar but which might become part of your December viewing routine. 92%Arthur ChristmasLost in the holiday shuffle last year opposite The Muppets, Hugo, Tintin and Happy Feet 2 was this thoroughly charming kids’ movie from Aardman Animation. My chapter on the worst Christmas movies is loaded with films about Santa Claus, so for this 3-D cartoon to get jolly old St. Nick just right feels like a holiday miracle. In this film, the job of Santa Claus is actually passed down from generation to generation, so while the current Father Christmas (voiced by Jim Broadbent) is getting ready to retire, his hyper-efficient next-in-line son Steve (Hugh Laurie) has souped up the sleigh and computerized the whole gift-giving process. But when one little girl doesn’t get her present, it’s up to Steve’s younger brother Arthur (James McAvoy), gift-wrapping elf Briony (Ashley Jensen of Extras and Ugly Betty) and grouchy old “Grandsanta” (Bill Nighy) to save the day. (I remember feeling self-conscious about tearing up at the press screening, until I looked over and saw Rotten Tomatoes’ Grae Drake doing likewise.) 47%The Ice HarvestWhile Die Hard successfully combined gunplay and holiday cheer, other violent and darkly funny Christmas movies haven’t fared so well at the box office, from the hilarious Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to this twisted caper about lowlifes trying to get out of town on December 24 with stolen mob money. Said lowlifes are John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton, trying not to draw suspicion to themselves on a frozen, slushy night in Wichita, Kansas, where they will dodge strippers (particularly Connie Nielsen), crime lords (Randy Quaid), and enforcers (Mike Starr), while Cusack drives around his ex-wife’s new husband (Oliver Platt), who has a tendency to get unwell while drunk and riding in a car. If you’re looking for some bleak humor to cut through the seasonal sweetness and light, this black-hearted cult fave should do the trick. 100%Remember the NightDespite boasting a script from the legendary Preston Sturges and starring Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck (playing characters much, much nicer than they did in Double Indemnity), this holiday treat languished in the vaults until recently being rediscovered by TCM. New York D.A. MacMurray takes pity on shoplifter Stanwyck and takes her home to Indiana with him so she won’t have to spend Christmas behind bars. After a chilling visit with her unloving mother, Stanwyck blossoms in the loving care of MacMurray’s mom (Beulah Bondi, who also played Ma Bailey in It’s a Wonderful Life). Sweet, smart and funny, Remember the Night offers a quick course in rom-coms done right that today’s practitioners would benefit from studying. 50%Some GirlsHere’s a movie that, despite rave reviews out of Sundance, got little attention upon its original release. Part of the problem was that MGM was teetering on the verge of one of its bankruptcies, but few studios would know how to sell a movie this eccentric and unusual: a sophisticated American sex comedy. Patrick Dempsey (post-Can’t Buy Me Love, pre-Grey’s Anatomy) comes to Quebec City to visit college girlfriend Jennifer Connelly (post-Labyrinth, pre-A Beautiful Mind) for Christmas, only to have her inform him upon his arrival that she no longer loves him. Throw in two beautiful sisters, an academic father (played by Andre Gregory) who can only write in the nude, and a grandmother (Lila Kedrova) who thinks Dempsey is her late husband reincarnated, and you have a witty, naughty romance set against a gorgeous wintry backdrop.Click here to order Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas.

Although its Tomatometer fate can probably be guessed by the fact that it isn’t being screened for critics, don’t feel too badly for Butler — his filmography has plenty of critical highlights to fall back on, and this week’s list offers proof. From period drama to family-friendly fantasy and bone-crunching action, he’s stayed plenty busy over the last 15 years and change — and now it’s time to pay tribute, Total Recall style! 42%10. Reign of FireThe only film to combine the acting might of Gerard Butler, Matthew McConaughey, and Christian Bale with the special-effects majesty of fire-breathing dragons and the giddy thrill of witnessing a post-apocalyptic dystopian future, 2002’s Reign of Fire had a lot going for it. After all, it isn’t every day filmgoers get to watch British construction workers accidentally open an underground cave full of dragons, triggering 10 years of panic, death, and mayhem — or watch an axe-wielding McConaughey leap into the mouth of one of the filthy beasts. Unfortunately, while Fire proved a medium-sized box office hit, most critics felt it squandered all the potential of its premise on a movie that sacrificed compelling story in favor of eye-popping visual effects. For Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, however, that was precisely the point — as she argued in her review, “The season could do with more grinning, spinning, un-self-important, happy-to-be-B throwback movies like this one.” 49%9. Beowulf &amp; GrendelTwo years before Angelina Jolie exerted a disconcerting level of mo-cap sexitude in 2007’s more succinctly titled Beowulf, Gerard Butler played the titular warrior in director Sturla Gunnarsson’s Beowulf &amp; Grendel, a beautifully filmed retelling of the ancient saga about the generations-spanning grudge that erupts after a Danish king (Stellan Skarsgård) slays a troublesome creature that’s been pestering his lands, only to let its offspring go free. He lives to regret this decision after the orphan grows up to be Grendel (Ingvar Sigurdsson), who returns to terrorize the kingdom and can only be stopped by the fearless Beowulf (Butler). Despite its impressive scenery and unimpeachable source material, most critics were unmoved by Beowulf &amp; Grendel, and after scoring with Canadian filmgoers, it sputtered out quickly in U.S. theaters. Their loss, according to William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who wrote, “Shot entirely in the outback of Iceland, it’s a gallery of hauntingly beautiful locations, and director Sturla Gunnarsson skillfully uses its bleak otherworldliness to distance us from anything familiar and evoke a lost heroic age.” 49%8. Harrison’s FlowersWhile far from his biggest role, Butler’s brief turn as Chris Kumac in the Elie Chouraqui-directed war drama Harrison’s Flowers added to his early film résumé while giving him a chance to share space in the closing credits with a long list of solid actors, including Elias Koteas, Brendan Gleeson, and Adrien Brody — not to mention David Strathairn, who played photojournalist Harrison Lloyd, and Andie MacDowell, who plays the wife that travels overseas to search for him after his presumed death in a building collapse. Clearly, Harrison’s Flowers contained the seeds for a powerful drama; unfortunately, most critics felt that the movie zoomed past it and soared straight into soggy melodrama. But that wasn’t enough to deter Robert W. Butler of the Kansas City Star, who argued, “Despite its melodramatic framework and thin characterizations, the movie does deliver an unforgettable sense of the desperate civil conflicts that seem to be a recurrent phenomenon of our troubled times.” 51%7. Nim’s IslandOn paper, Nim’s Island had a lot going for it: A solid cast, strong visuals, and bestselling, family-friendly source material in Wendy Orr’s book about a young girl (Abigail Breslin) forced to seek help from an agoraphobic adventure author (Jodie Foster) after a shipwreck strands the girl’s scientist father (Butler). Unfortunately, things didn’t exactly work out the way they were supposed to when the movie kicked off its theatrical run in April 2008 — while it easily recouped its $37 million budget with a $100 million worldwide gross, reviews and word of mouth were disappointingly lukewarm. That isn’t to say the movie was without its defenders, however — including USA Today’s Claudia Puig, who wrote, “Nim’s Island is a win-win proposition: an entertaining, diverting adventure saga that offers excitement and a relatable heroine for children, and also will remind their parents of favorite classics from their own youth.” 60%6. RocknRollaHe’s returned to Fresh territory with his Sherlock Holmes movies, but for awhile there, it looked like Guy Ritchie’s post-Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels career was going to be a study in diminishing critical returns. Case in point: 2008’s RocknRolla, a London-set action thriller about a group of scuzzy underworld types including a crimelord (Tom Wilkinson), unscrupulous accountant (Thandie Newton), rough-and-tumble thug (Butler), and punk musician (Toby Kebbell) who only stop shooting long enough to betray their supposed allies. Familiar territory for Ritchie, but most critics found RocknRolla a case of style at the expense of substance. For others, however, that was more than enough: As Michael O’Sullivan put it for the Washington Post, “Style is what RocknRolla is all about. And it has it in spades, from the cockney Pulp Fiction dialogue to the music-video editing of the rambling narrative.” 61%5. 300Arguably the most gloriously ab-riffic swords ‘n’ sandals action epic ever filmed, Zack Snyder’s 300 blended newfangled bluescreen technology with time-tested bloody murder to produce a fictionalized adaptation of the Battle of Thermopylae. Working from Frank Miller’s comic series of the same name, Snyder pulled out all the stops in pursuit of a faithful reproduction of his source material — and the results worked so well that, combined with 2005’s similarly striking, also Miller-inspired Sin City, they briefly seemed to usher in a new era of hyper-visual graphic novel adaptations. A $210 million box office hit, 300 was less of a sure thing with critics, but it carried enough firepower for Richard Roeper, who called it “Excessively, cheerfully violent — and it is gorgeous to behold. It looks like the world’s most sophisticated and expensive video game, and I mean that in a good way.” 81%4. Dear FrankieOne of the reasons Butler’s been such an alluring target for directors of romantic comedies is his ability to convey rough edges and soulful tenderness in equal measure — and anyone who thought those qualities would save movies like The Bounty Hunter, and learned the hard way that they couldn’t, would do well to check out 2004’s Dear Frankie, starring Butler as an anonymous seaman who agrees to help a single mother (Emily Mortimer) preserve the long-running lie that her son’s (Jack McElhone) father is a sailor on a ship that just happens to be docking in town. Sweet and mournful, Frankie failed to make much of a dent at the box office, but it definitely left an impression on critics like Film Journal International’s Shirley Sealy, who called it “A quietly told film that–by casually tossing in a surprise here and a plot twist there–builds up to an ending that carries an intense emotional impact.” 92%3. Mrs. BrownButler made his film debut with a relatively minor role in John Madden’s Mrs. Brown, playing the younger brother of a Scottish servant (Billy Connolly) whose relationship with the widowed Queen Victoria (Judi Dench) throws the royal court into a tizzy. Originally intended to air as an episode of Masterpiece Theatre, it went on to accrue acclaim — and a healthy $13 million at the box office during its arthouse run — while bringing Dench her first Best Actress Academy Award nomination. Observed Janet Maslin of the New York Times, “Mrs. Brown’ transcends its period setting not only with a keenly observed struggle between love and duty but also with the kind of controversy that envelops the Queen and her servant.” 92%2. CoriolanusThis critically lauded, Ralph Fiennes-directed period piece is an adaptation of the Shakespeare play that follows the adventures of the titular Roman general (Fiennes) who’s manipulated by his domineering mother (Vanessa Redgrave) into angling for higher office — and then finds himself exiled from the city. Who does he turn to when it comes time to hatch a plan for his return? Why, his burly archenemy Tullus Aufidius — who’s played to seething, bearded perfection by Butler, coming full circle by reprising the role for the cameras after scoring one of his earliest career breaks in a stage production of the play. Offering resounding proof that all Butler really needs is to step away from the regrettable rom-coms and pick a few solid scripts, Coriolanus earned the praise of critics like Slant’s Chuck Bowen, who called it “a savage action movie that somehow manages to preserve the heart of the Bard’s work while reducing his words to devastating shards.” 99%1. How to Train Your DragonIf you’re casting the voice of the head of an ancient Viking village — and you don’t happen to have an actual ancient Viking lying around — you could do a heck of a lot worse than Gerard Butler, who stepped in to lend his beefy-sounding burr to the animated Stoick the Vast, patriarch of the dragon-infested island of Berk, in DreamWorks’ massive 2010 hit How to Train Your Dragon. Though the movie’s impressive 3D CGI visuals were undeniably the star of the show, Butler was part of a sharp voice cast that included Craig Ferguson, Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera, Jonah Hill, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse — and part of the reason the Houston Chronicle’s Amy Biancolli said the movie “uses its whiz-bang technology to amplify feelings as well as dimension and scale. The big optical wow is only the half of it.”In case you were wondering, here are Butler’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. 300 — 90%2. How to Train Your Dragon — 90%3. Dear Frankie — 89%4.

Heck, Burton’s even proven his mettle as a director of animated fare (Corpse Bride) and served as a producer on at least one movie he didn’t direct, but you probably thought he did (The Nightmare Before Christmas). This week, Burton brings his unique style to bear — in 3-D, no less! — on a feature-length, stop-motion animated expansion of his early short film Frankenweenie, and to celebrate, we decided to take another look back at his 10 best-reviewed films. Let’s Total Recall, shall we? 71%10. BatmanThese days, superhero films are all the rage, but in the late 1980s, the genre was at sort of a low ebb (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, anyone?). It’s understandable, in retrospect, that Warner Bros. dawdled on greenlighting Batman, leaving Burton to work through multiple drafts of Sam Hamm’s script before the success of Beetlejuice finally convinced the studio to get serious about bringing the Dark Knight back to the big screen. Of course, fans of the comic were a little harder to convince, and it isn’t hard to see why — with the director of Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure at the helm and the star of Gung Ho and Mr. Mom playing Batman, it seemed like a reprise of the campy Adam West era was nigh. As it turned out, Burton’s Batman vision was darker than anyone gave him credit for — and the film’s runaway success proved that movies based on comics didn’t have to be kids’ stuff. Calling it “a success for several reasons,” Cinemaphile’s David Keyes added that “most of the credit goes to director Tim Burton’s brilliant visual interpretation of a dark, ominous comic book.” 75%9. Big FishAfter facing the loudest critical catcalls of his career with 2001’s Planet of the Apes, Burton needed a rebound — and he got it with Big Fish. It certainly had its detractors — Jim Lane of the Sacramento News &amp; Review, for one, was annoyed by what he called “Burton’s flourishes of self-satisfied frippery” — but most critics were satisfied with the way Burton brought his signature visual style to bear on this adaptation of Daniel Wallace’s novel about a father whose propensity for tall tales has driven a wedge between himself and his son. Burton, who had recently lost both of his parents, knew a thing or two about strained family relations, and that no doubt enabled him to bring an extra personal touch to this whimsically bittersweet drama. As Rob Nelson of the Minneapolis/St. Paul City Pages observed, “Burton, favoring form over content, flavor over fact, has been often criticized for not knowing how to bring his work to satisfactory resolution. But I’d call that a good thing. Blame it on his dad.” 80%8. Batman ReturnsThough he was initially reluctant to film a Batman sequel, Burton was eventually persuaded to return to Gotham after wresting complete creative control from Warner Bros. and hiring Daniel Waters (who worked with Burton on an attempted Beetlejuice sequel) to write the script. The result was 1992’s Batman Returns, a casting dream that found Batman (Michael Keaton, donning the cowl for the final time) facing off against Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer, resplendent in leather) and the Penguin (a scenery-chewing Danny DeVito). Though some critics (and parents) felt the film was too dark, most reviews were positive; in fact, before Christopher Nolan came along with Batman Begins, Batman Returns was the best-reviewed film in the franchise, something Desson Thompson of the Washington Post attributed to the fact that it “Comes closer than ever to Bob Kane’s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.” 85%7. BeetlejuiceBurton and Warner Bros. toiled for years on a Batman script, leaving him free to entertain other projects — but it wasn’t until Michael McDowell’s original screenplay for Beetlejuice crossed Burton’s desk that he felt like he’d met his match. After hiring Warren Skaaren to give McDowell’s rather dark and violent script a more family-friendly polish, Burton set about filming what would end up becoming one of 1988’s most successful movies — an absurd ghost comedy starring Michael Keaton as the titular “bio-exorcist” that a pair of ghosts (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) hire to rid their home of its obnoxious living residents. Bustling with kooky special effects, off-the-wall humor, and Harry Belafonte songs, Beetlejuice racked up almost $75 million in domestic grosses, cementing Burton’s status as a bankable filmmaker (and speeding Batman‘s development in the process). More than just a fine early example of Burton’s skewed sensibilities, Beetlejuice remains a thoroughly enjoyable comedy; in the words of eFilmCritic’s Scott Weinberg, it “Coasts by like a rocket, thanks to Keaton’s inspired performance and Burton’s dark-carnival lunacy.” 83%6. Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryIf a movie had never been made from Roald Dahl’s classic tale of a reclusive, legendarily eccentric candy maker and the children whose lives he alters forever, Tim Burton would have been the perfect director to make it happen. Of course, as we all know, Mel Stuart directed Gene Wilder in a 1971 adaptation — one that, despite Dahl’s negative reaction, was remembered fondly by many of the kids who grew up with it. Greeted with a fair amount of skepticism, Burton’s new take on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory threatened to be a misfire of epic proportions — Johnny Depp playing Wonka as a cross between Anna Wintour and Michael Jackson? Say what? — but Burton’s instincts ultimately proved both lucrative (Charlie grossed nearly $475 million worldwide) and critically successful. Writing for the Independent, Robert Hanks echoed the sentiments of many of his peers when he pointed out, “In its combination of fidelity to its source and wacky visual ideas, Burton’s take is a triumph of common sense and imagination — exactly the qualities for which we admire children.”&nbsp; 84%5. Tim Burton’s Corpse BrideTim Burton was heavily involved with 1993’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, but it wasn’t until 2005’s Corpse Bride that he got around to directing his first full-length animated film, an update on a centuries-old legend about a man (Johnny Depp) who unwittingly hitches himself to an undead wife (Helena Bonham Carter). Perhaps unsurprisingly, Corpse Bride‘s spindly, pale characters looked a lot like Jack Skellington and his friends — and the movie sounded mighty familiar, too, featuring the voices of a number of Burton vets (including Depp, Carter, and Albert Finney) as well as the requisite Danny Elfman score. With Burton surrounded by familiar faces and firmly ensconsed in his thematic wheelhouse, it only makes sense that Corpse Bride was successful with filmgoers (grossing over $100 million worldwide) as well as critics; as Zertinet’s Steven Snyder opined, “Tim Burton so believably brings his worlds to life, with such a dark, dreamy and dazzling imagination, that we all but take for granted that he has taken us on some of the most delightfully absurd adventures of modern cinema.” 86%4. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet StreetLove, vengeance, madness, and lots of blood — what could be more perfect than Tim Burton directing an adaptation of Sweeney Todd, the Victorian tale of an unjustly imprisoned barber who uses his razor to get even (and then some)? On the other hand, once word got out that Burton was using Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd musical as inspiration, skeptics immediately scoffed at the idea of asking Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Alan Rickman to sing the songs of a Broadway legend — particularly Depp, whose musical aspirations had always been limited to the guitar. While it’s true that Burton’s Sweeney may not have featured the most stageworthy singing, any vocal deficiencies were more than compensated with the sheer bloody spectacle of a talented director bringing his lens to bear on one of the grisliest tales ever to grace the Great White Way. Calling it “As unsettling as it is riveting,” Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch promised, “even Sondheim aficionados will see the story with fresh eyes, unless those eyes are covered.” 90%3. Edward ScissorhandsAfter Batman went down as the biggest box office hit of 1989, Tim Burton had his pick of projects — and he chose the one closest to his heart. Edward Scissorhands was a story that had been gestating since Burton’s lonely days as a teenager in Southern California; granted creative control by Fox (which purchased the rights from a distinterested Warner Bros.), he ran through a list of actors that included William Hurt, Robert Downey, Jr., and Toms Hanks and Cruise before deciding Johnny Depp would be perfect to play the film’s central character, the lonely, blade-fingered creation of a mad scientist (Vincent Price). Of course, at the time, nobody knew Edward Scissorhands would mark the beginning of a partnership between Burton and Depp that currently stands at seven films and counting; they only knew, in the words of the Deseret News’ Chris Hicks, that the film was “quite a surprise” and “an utterly enchanting fairy tale.” 92%2. Ed WoodHe’s enjoyed more critical acclaim and commercial success than most directors, but it seems fair to say Tim Burton has spent a good portion of his career feeling misunderstood — which is surely part of what drew Burton to Ed Wood, a biopic of the oft-derided director who gifted the cinema with films such as Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Its screenplay was penned by Problem Child writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski — both of whom knew a thing or two about battling the low expectations of others — and befitting its subject, Ed Wood was punted around the studio system before landing at Disney, where Burton received the full creative control he craved. The result, running more than two hours in deeply unfashionable black and white, was a predictable box office flop — but it resonated strongly with critics, who embraced it as, in Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing’s estimation, “A gentle valentine that celebrates the creative spirit, no matter how misguided that particular spirit happens to be.” 87%1. Pee-Wee’s Big AdventureBurton’s cult classic short films Vincent and Frankenweenie caught the eye of Paul Reubens, who drafted the as yet unproven director for his first big-screen foray, 1985’s Pee Wee’s Big Adventure. On paper, it seems rather unlikely that filmgoers would be interested in plunking down for the absurd adventures of a bow tie-wearing man-child who hitchhikes across the country in search of his stolen bike, but Big Adventure was a big hit, kickstarting Burton’s career and leading to five delightfully strange Saturday morning seasons of Pee-Wee’s Playhouse on CBS. A quarter century after it was released, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure remains a cult classic — and it will always be, as Cole Smithey described it, “Goofy, silly, and just plain funny.”In case you were wondering, here are Burton’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Edward Scissorhands — 88%2. Big Fish — 86%3. Ed Wood — 83%4. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street — 81%5. Sleepy Hollow — 79%6. Batman — 78%7. Beetlejuice — 77%8.

This weekend, the amazingly prolific actor — who’s acted in nearly 30 films over the last 10 years alone — pops up in Seven Psychopaths, so we decided to take the opportunity to take a fond look back at some of his most critically beloved performances. Break out your cowbells, it’s time for Total Recall! 78%10. Biloxi BluesEver wondered what the word “latrine” means? Look no further than Biloxi Blues. In one of the most colorfully memorable scenes from Mike Nichols’ adaptation of the Neil Simon play, Walken’s marvelously named Sergeant First Class Merwin J. Toomey provides a rather in-depth definition for his latest batch of U.S. Army recruits. This being a family site, we can’t reprint the whole thing; suffice it to say that it’s pronounced, as Toomey puts it, “La-trine, from the French.” The interplay between Walken and Biloxi‘s star, Matthew Broderick, was what set the movie apart for the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, who chortled, “With superb performances by Mr. Broderick and Christopher Walken, who plays Mr. Simon’s nearly unhinged, very funny variation on the drill sergeant of movie myth, Biloxi Blues has a fully satisfying life of its own.” 87%9. At Close RangeAdding a cop mustache, co-starring support from Sean Penn, and a Madonna hit on the soundtrack to Walken’s arsenal, 1986’s At Close Range dramatized the tragic real-life story of a Pennsylvania crime family whose patriarch (played by Walken) returns from exile to darken the lives of his grown sons (Sean and Chris Penn). In spite of its compelling story and excellent cast — which included Mary Stuart Masterson, Kiefer Sutherland, and Crispin Glover — the movie didn’t make much of an impact at the box office, but it resonated with critics like Roger Ebert, who wrote that “Penn and Walken [are] at the top of their forms in roles that give them a lot to work with.” 82%8. Pennies From HeavenIf you’re filming a musical and you need someone to play a singing, dancing pimp, there’s really only one person to call. Walken added a little bit of off-kilter genius to 1981’s Pennies from Heaven, screenwriter Dennis Potter’s adaptation of his hit BBC miniseries about an unhappy married couple during trying economic times; here, directed by Herbert Ross and starring Steve Martin as a Depression-era sheet music salesman, it went down as one of the decade’s more ignominious flops at the box office, although it’s gained something of a cult following over the years — and it’s always been a favorite among critics like Mark Athitakis of Flimcritic.com, who called it “Dark as night but perfectly lit, a little sad but with a song in its heart.” 89%7. The Dead ZoneWalken earned a Saturn Award nomination for his role in David Cronenberg’s The Dead Zone, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel about a psychic (played by Walken) who discovers that a Presidential candidate (Martin Sheen) will trigger nuclear war if elected — and sets about planning a one-man assassination attempt. Unlike a number of 1980s King adaptations, The Dead Zone proved successful with audiences as well as critics; Luke Y. Thompson of New Times called this “The classic Walken role, by which all subsequent ones are measured” and argued that it’s “Possibly the best Stephen King adaptation too.” 92%6. True RomanceWe don’t normally include single-scene roles in Total Recall, but Christopher Walken’s appearance in True Romance is something special — in fact, the character he plays in the movie, Vincenzo Coccotti, boasts his own Wikipedia entry, thanks to the memorably racist monologue delivered by Dennis Hopper during their few moments of shared screentime. And as for the rest of the movie, which stars Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as a couple on the run from bloodthirsty mobsters? It isn’t bad either. As TIME’s Richard Corliss observed at the time, “If shoot-’em-up, gobble-’em-down movies like The Fugitive and Jurassic Park are rated PG-13 these days, what does an R-rated action adventure look like? Like True Romance: violent to a fault, glam to the max.” 92%5. The Deer HunterWalken earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work in this Michael Cimino classic, which takes a grueling look at three Pennsylvania steelworkers (played by Walken, Robert De Niro, and John Savage) whose lives are irrevocably altered by their experiences serving in the Vietnam War. As Nick, the soldier whose introspective nature finds him ill-equipped for the horrors of combat, Walken provided the film with some of its most haunting moments; as Vincent Canby argued in his review for the New York Times, “Its feelings for time, place and blue-collar people are genuine, and its vision is that of an original, major new film maker.” 91%4. HairsprayFor fans of Walken’s nuttier script choices, 2007 proved a banner year — not only did he appear as an evil ping-pong crimelord named Feng in Balls of Fury, he played loving husband to a cross-dressing, prosthetic-laden John Travolta in Adam Shankman’s hit Hairspray. A screen adaptation of a Broadway musical that was itself an adaptation of John Waters’ 1988 comedy, Hairspray certainly had tangled roots — but even if its origins made it look like a cash grab, the end result proved to be a sweetly effervescent musical comedy with a better-than-average cast. “Enjoyable movies are released every week,” conceded the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle. “But movies that have the capacity to delight — movies like Hairspray — are few and far between.” 92%3. AntzThe 1990s found Walken evolving into something of an indie/direct-to-video mainstay, appearing in cult flicks like Suicide Kings far more often than he managed to make it to the big screen — and that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, given that his higher-profile projects at the time included stuff like MouseHunt. But with 1998’s Antz, Walken made his first foray into animated voicework, appearing alongside the disembodied vocals of an eclectic cast that included Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Gene Hackman, and Jennifer Lopez. While it’s arguably best-remembered today for being overshadowed at the box office by A Bug’s Life, it was well-received by critics like Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, who enjoyed “the relief felt by star actors freed from the constraints of their physical selves and the egos that go with them.” 92%2. Pulp FictionWalken took a one-scene appearance in True Romance and pretty much walked away with the movie — so when Romance screenwriter Quentin Tarantino came calling with another small-but-memorable role in Pulp Fiction, he wasn’t about to say no. Again, Walken only appears in one scene, but it’s a doozy: As Captain Koons, a returning soldier who brings young Butch Coolidge a watch owned by the boy’s killed-in-action father, he delivers a monologue that provides one of the most memorable moments in a film with more than enough to go around. “Tarantino’s dialogue, with its densely propulsive, almost lawyerly fervor, its peppery comic blend of literacy and funk, has more snap and fight than most directors’ action scenes,” pointed out Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman. 96%1. Catch Me If You CanBy the early aughts, we’d been conditioned to look for Walken in strange places (e.g. Joe Dirt and The Prophecy 3), where he could generally be found doing strange things — things that, it bears mentioning, tended to liven up otherwise dull movies (Last Man Standing). With 2002’s Catch Me If You Can, however, Steven Spielberg brought Walken back down to Earth — and helped him nab his second Oscar nomination — with the small-but-important role of Frank Abagnale, Sr., the man whose financial ruin and shattered marriage inspires his son Frank, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) to embark on a legendary life of crime. Robert Denerstein called the result “Precisely what a mainstream movie should be: fleet, savvy and, like a good con, executed as if it were the easiest thing in the world.”In case you were wondering, here are Walken’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

Of course, Cooper’s character isn’t the first to pretend to be something he isn’t — and with that in mind, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to some of the many noteworthy plagiarists, imposters, liars, and frauds from films of the past. Lock up your valuables and don’t believe everything you’re told, because it’s time for Total Recall!Catch Me if You Can 96%In his long and incredible career as a master fraud and forger, Frank W. Abagnale Jr. managed to pass himself off as a teacher, doctor, lawyer, and airplane pilot — and pass millions of dollars in phony checks while he was at it. It’s the kind of story that could play as a horribly sad drama, but with Catch Me if You Can, Steven Spielberg used it as the basis for a light (and thoroughly entertaining) caper in which Abagnale (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) dashes from con to con while striking up a bizarre long-distance friendship with the FBI agent who’s doggedly pursuing him (Tom Hanks). The end result, wrote John Anderson for Newsday, is “A very adult, very funny, very well-acted daydream that should delight just about anyone who’s ever been asked for picture ID.”The Hoax 86%A sort of spiritual cousin to this week’s big movie, The Hoax dramatizes the real-life adventures of struggling author Clifford Irving, who cooked up an audacious million-dollar scheme to pass off his own forgeries as the authorized memoirs of reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. It sounds like a ridiculous way to get yourself sent to prison rather than the basis for a Richard Gere movie, but Irving almost pulled it off — and that’s what makes The Hoax such gripping stuff. Saying it “never wanders too far from its pitiful but somehow joyously deceitful center,” Tom Long of the Detroit News applauded Gere for capturing “the sheer electricity of a man who, even for only a few moments, seems to have made reality play by his rules.”The Imposter 95%Some of the best documentaries are the ones that persuasively demonstrate that truth really can be stranger than fiction. Case in point: The Imposter, which details the unsettling tale of Frédéric Bourdin, the French con man who impersonated a missing 13-year-old boy and went to live with his family, despite a number of telling differences between them. Bourdin was eventually forced to confess, thanks to the dogged efforts of a private investigator, but that’s only one dark chapter in a terribly disturbing — and still unsolved — true story. “The Imposter emerges as a brilliantly slippery film that demands brain-stretching consideration. Astonishing, indeed,” wrote the Irish Times’ admiring Donald Clarke.Just One of the Guys 45%Good journalists stop at nothing to get their big scoop — even if they happen to be high school students, and researching the story means illicitly transferring to a new campus and pretending to be a boy. Witness Just One of the Guys, the mid-1980s teen cross-dressing comedy starring Joyce Hyser and an eclectic supporting cast that included Ayre Gross, Sherilyn Fenn, and — as was required by law in 1985 — Billy Zabka. While many critics thought Guys was too shallow and unbelievable to prove its own point, others were too busy yukking it up to care — like Nikki Tranter of PopMatters, who wrote, “Just One of the Guys is worth repeated viewing, especially for Hyser’s hilarious and charismatic performance.”Mata Hari 63%Whether she was truly a German spy who caused the death of more than 50,000 soldiers or simply an exotic dancer who attracted the wrong kind of attention is still up for scholarly debate — but either way, Mata Hari’s story is a fascinating one, and it proved solid grist for this loose biopic, which made a million dollars in 1931 and ultimately proved to be Greta Garbo’s signature film. “Miss Garbo may not be any more like Mata Hari, whose real name was Margaret Zelle MacLeod, than the film narrative is like an authentic account of the spy’s career,” admitted Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times. “There is, however, in the skillfully arranged series of incidents enough truth to make a most compelling melodrama.”&nbsp;The Music Man 94%The film world has certainly seen more daring cons than the one attempted by “Professor” Harold Hill (Robert Preston) in The Music Man, but we’d argue that none of them were as persuasively soundtracked — which is only fitting, given this Broadway adaptation’s storyline about a flimflam artist who strolls into a small Iowa town with the intention of tricking the residents into bankrolling a junior marching band. Of course, Hill has a change of heart by the third act, due to the feminine wiles of the town’s comely librarian (Shirley Jones), but even if his schemes were all for naught, the movie stole the hearts of critics like Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, who lauded its soundtrack “full of standards” and called the film “endowed with a warming nostalgia for old-fashioned ways.”The Secret of My Success 50%With Michael J. Fox on the poster and Night Ranger on the soundtrack, The Secret of My Success was a quintessentially 1980s film even before the first frame was screened; the fact that its plot happened to revolve around a young mailroom employee (Fox) who impersonates his way up the corporate ladder just in time to save the company and find true love (with Helen “Supergirl” Slater) was just a bonus. Like a lot of the decade’s business-themed comedies, Success was burdened with mixed messages — it tried to lampoon corporate skullduggery while suggesting that overweening career ambition justifies pretty much any amount of fraud — but under all those synths and snappy blazers, it was really just another good old-fashioned comedy from director Herbert Ross. “The movie builds up a lot of good will early on, which is needed when the time comes to resolve its farcical complications,” admitted a begrudging Vincent Canby for the New York Times.Shattered Glass 92%He may not have earned many raves for his performance as the petulant Anakin Skywalker of the Star Wars prequels, but Hayden Christensen proved his acting mettle with Shattered Glass, a biopic about Stephen Glass, the disgraced former New Republic writer whose journalism career came to an ignominious end after he was caught fabricating chunks of his articles. It registered barely a ripple at the box office, but this Billy Ray drama was a favorite with critics like Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who observed, “More than being a smart and accurate look at magazine journalism — no small matter — Shattered Glass is also a compelling portrait of a psychosis at work.”Sommersby 62%On the big screen, imposters tend to be nefarious, and for good reason — nine times out of 10, if you’re going to go to the trouble of stealing another person’s life, you’re probably up to no good. Sommersby, however, reminds us that there’s still that 10th guy. Starring Richard Gere as the returning Civil War vet (or is he?) who comes home from the war a noticeably better man, stirring confusing emotions in his puzzled wife (Jodie Foster) and setting in motion a painful chain of events, Sommersby tried to say a number of things about love and redemption — and while a number of critics found the end result too diffuse to recommend, others swooned at its old-fashioned romance. Argued James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “From start to finish, it is a well-crafted film: part love story, part mystery, and all drama.”Tootsie 90%Dudes in dresses are usually played for laughs in Hollywood, and to an extent, Tootsie is no exception; it is, underneath all that makeup and hosiery, a romantic comedy about an actor (Dustin Hoffman) who masquerades as a woman in order to take what he initially views as a demeaning gig on a soap opera. But rather than the sort of broad-as-a-barn-door farce we’ve grown accustomed to via movies like White Girls and Big Momma’s House, it uses its gags to sweeten what’s actually a rather thoughtful drama about dishonesty and the struggle to earn a living in modern America — with a Stephen Bishop ballad on the soundtrack for good measure. Critics, grateful to be spared a film that had nothing more to offer than the sight of Dustin Hoffman in a dress, showered Tootsie with praise: “It turns out to be a touching love story, after all,” observed Roger Ebert. “So touching that you may be surprised how moved you are at the conclusion of this comedy.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

It’s probably no surprise that bicycles aren’t exactly the greatest source of screenwriting inspiration, but that doesn’t mean there haven’t been a few noteworthy entries in the genre — and besides, it’s hard to complain when a list gives us the opportunity to write about Rad. Grab your helmet — it’s time for Total Recall!American Flyers 65%Six years after penning Breaking Away, screenwriter Steve Tesich returned to cinematic bicycling — albeit with a slightly more action-centric bent — with American Flyers. Directed by John Badham (then riding a WarGames-fueled hot streak) and starring Kevin Costner in one of his earliest major roles, Flyers traces the turmoil surrounding a pair of brothers (played by Costner and David Marshall Grant) as they begin training for a race across the Rockies under the shadow of potentially life-threatening illness. Though it didn’t do much at the box office and most reviews were rather lukewarm, Flyers resonated with critics like About.com’s Fred Topel, who called it a “classic ’80s sports movie” and lauded its “surprising twist, and thrilling bike scenes.”Bicycle Thieves 98%Long before Pee-Wee Herman dashed off across the country on a madcap search for his stolen bike, Vittorio De Seca used the theft of a bicycle to help tell a far more dramatic tale. Considered a classic of Italian neorealist cinema — not to mention one of the best all-around films of all time — 1948’s Bicycle Thieves follows the grim struggles of a desperate family man (Lamberto Maggiorani) whose efforts to provide for his wife and children are dealt a severe blow when the bicycle he needs for work is stolen. As it wends its way to its brave, thoughtful conclusion, argues Kenneth Turan of the LosAngeles Times, Thieves “manages to appeal to the better angels of our nature in a way that only deepens as we grow older along with the film.”Beijing Bicycle 62%Adapting the loose framework of The Bicycle Thief for a story about modern Communist China, Beijing Bicycle follows a rural Chinese teen (Cui Lin) on his journey to the city in search of work. It’s a journey that becomes complicated when his bike is stolen, prompting a difficult search, some turnabout thievery, and the potentially violent complications that ensue. Part of a series of films from young Chinese directors highlighting the social issues affecting modern citizens, Beijing Bicycle gave viewers what Peter Howell of the Toronto Star described as “a picturesque morality tale that slyly depicts the hopelessness of communism while pointing up the essential similarities between people of all classes.”BMX Bandits 71%The poster promised “a high flying ride to adventure,” and while this family-friendly Australian action flick from director Brian Trenchard-Smith might not quite achieve flight, it manages to add a fun twist to the old kids-sticking-it-to-the-Man formula — and it also boasts a (very) early screen appearance by Nicole Kidman, who stars here as one of a gang of young bikers who steal a box of walkie talkies without realizing they belong to a crew of bank robbers. Hijinks ensue, of course, including an extended chase that serves as a tourist brochure for various Sydney landmarks; it all adds up to an enduring cult classic that’s earned the admiration of critics like Brian Orndorf, who applauded, “Just hand Trenchard-Smith explosives, an anamorphic lens, and a game cast, and he’ll whip up something appealing, preferably with a saucy Aussie wink.”Breaking Away 95%A sensitive evocation of small-town life, the awkward restlessness of life after high school, and class struggle — not to mention a darn good biking movie — Breaking Away offered a solid early career break for stars Dennis Christopher, Dennis Quaid, Daniel Stern, and Jackie Earle Haley while racking up $20 million at the box office and earning a slew of awards (including the Golden Globe for Best Film and the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay) along the way. Starring Christopher as a bicycle racing-obsessed Indiana teen (patterned after real-life rider Dave Blase) whose working-class roots put him and his blue-collar friends at odds with the wealthy college kids in town, Breaking culminated in a rousing dramatization of Indiana University’s venerable Little 500 race. The action proved memorable, but for most critics, the movie’s true value lay in what Richard Schickel called the film’s “many moments of shrewd insight into the lives of amusingly shaded but very recognizable human beings.”&nbsp;Key Exchange 43%Bike racing collides with mid-1980s sexual mores in Key Exchange, a little-remembered 1985 rom-com about a TV producer (Brooke Adams) who’s struggling to cope with her jealous boyfriend’s (Ben Masters) strikingly selfish commitment issues while finding herself drawn to his racing partner and best friend (Daniel Stern). It’s a familiar plotline — and indeed, some critics felt it was an Exchange where the audience handed over its time and got nothing in return — but for Vincent Canby of the New York Times, “What sustains Key Exchange is not surprise, but the intelligence of its characters and of the people who made it.”Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure 87%The movie that taught a generation of young filmgoers that the Alamo has no basement, Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure frames one of the most absurd road trip adventures of the 1980s inside the simple tale of one strange man-child’s all-encompassing love for his bicycle. Featuring two-wheeled larceny, biker gangs, Twisted Sister, ninjas, assorted Hollywood studio lot mayhem, and one sweet red ride, Adventure took the training wheels off director Tim Burton’s career, broadened Pee-Wee’s burgeoning pop culture cachet, and delighted critics like Beth Accomando of KPBS, who marveled, “The filmmakers create a zany and surreal world for Pee-wee yet it all seems perfectly natural and credible. Plus, it’s all infused with a subdued yet rampant silliness that’s enchanting.”Quicksilver 13%Featuring Kevin Bacon, breakdancing, and a soundtrack stuffed with big 1980s artists like Ray Parker Jr., John Parr, and Tony Banks of Genesis, 1986’s Quicksilver must have looked like a sure thing on paper. Alas, critics and filmgoers weren’t along for the ride with this allegedly dramatic tale of a stock trader (Bacon) who quits the business and becomes a bike messenger after suffering financial ruin, and in later years, Bacon himself reportedly referred to it as the lowest point in his career. “As long as the characters are doing stunts or whizzing impossibly through city traffic to a strong rock beat, there’s something to watch,” conceded Walter Goodman of the New York Times. “For the rest of the time, Quicksilver is as much fun as a slow leak.”Rad 42%Smokey and the Bandit director Hal Needham hit a rough patch in the ’80s, releasing a string of flops that started with 1982’s Megaforce and continued through 1987’s alleged pro wrestling comedy Body Slam. Along the way, he helmed Rad, a BMX-focused teen movie starring Bill Allen as a smalltown kid, Lori Loughlin as his equally bike-obsessed love interest, and the villainous Jack Weston as the meanie who wants to keep Allen out of the big Helltrack race. Despite the added presence of Ray Walston as a kindly old man and Olympic champ Bart Conner as Allen’s Zabka-esque Helltrack rival, Rad bit the dust during its theatrical run, grossing a little over $2 million and suffering the withering scorn of critics like HeraldNet’s Robert Horton, who scoffed, “Any film calling itself Rad had best be taken with a grain of salt, regardless of its subject matter. As it happens, the subject matter of Rad constitutes probably the dorkiest storyline we’ve seen this year.”The Triplets of Belleville 97%When a young man’s dreams of racing in the Tour de France are derailed by a mobster who wants to use his skills for nefarious purposes, his grandmother rides to the rescue in The Triplets of Belleville, writer/director Sylvain Chomet’s beautifully animated ode to classic French cinema, 1920s jazz, and the inestimable strength of family love. A two-time Oscar nominee and solid indie hit, Triplets earned almost universal critical acclaim from writers like Rick Groen from the Globe and Mail, who observed, “In an era when live-action movies often play like cartoons, this is an animated film that feels all grown up.”Take a look through Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s best-reviewed movies, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.

At the box office, anyway. This week, we’re under attack from a crew of nasty aliens, and only Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna stand between us and certain doom. We’re talking about Battleship, of course, and all that aquatic derring-do got us thinking about other movies featuring thrilling peril, men and women of valor, and lots and lots of water. It’s time to celebrate some Victory at Sea — the Total Recall way!The Battle of the River Plate 82%Copious amounts of CGI definitely helped Peter Berg make it look like aliens were invading Earth in Battleship, but it doesn’t take fancy computers to approximate the thundering chaos of naval warfare. Case in point: 1956’s Battle of the River Plate (released in the U.S. as Pursuit of the Graf Spee), which earned bonus points for realism after directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger used actual American and British cruisers to relive the first naval battle of World War II. But more importantly, at least as far as most critics were concerned, the duo’s screenplay presented the war as a conflict between actual human beings rather than a cartoonish collision of good guys and bad guys. “Though it’s mostly a waiting game, the film is tense and involving, thanks to Powell’s fluid shifting of the point of view,” observed the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr. “You root for the Germans as much as for the Allies.”The Bedford Incident 86%A sort of Moby Dick for the nuclear age, The Bedford Incident offers a poignant (and, at the time, rather terrifying) meditation on the cost of war. Sidney Poitier stars as a reporter who boards an American destroyer as part of a profile on its captain (Richard Widmark), only to find himself an unwilling participant in his increasingly dangerous pursuit of a Soviet submarine that has been detected nearby. With an amped-up ending that diverged from the Mark Rascovich novel that inspired it, Bedford offered something to enjoy even for critics like the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, whose largely ambivalent review described the film as “a cinematic blooper” but admitted, “If you view it as straight, unchallenged fiction… you may find this austerely masculine picture of a maritime episode in the cold war a grimly absorbing speculation on how wrong one ship’s captain might be.”The Caine Mutiny 92%Featuring a fine late-period performance from Humphrey Bogart and fleshed out by a solid cast that included Jose Ferrer, Van Johnson, and Fred MacMurray, 1954’s The Caine Mutiny adapted the Pulitzer-winning Herman Wouk novel that traced the deteriorating relationship between a hard-nosed Navy commander (Bogart) and his crew — some of whom suspect him of being genuinely mentally unfit to safely lead the ship. While it contains its fair share of naval warfare, Caine‘s most important battles are fought with low-key performances instead of torpedos; as Film4 put it, “The drama is compulsive and the starry cast make the most of a mountain of words.”Das Boot 98%Das foregone conclusion for this list, yes? Wolfgang Petersen’s 1981 war epic is almost universally recognized as not only a classic naval drama, but one of the finer films of the 1980s as well as a towering classic of German cinema. Here in the States, Das Boot earned nearly $85 million (spread out over two theatrical runs spaced 16 years apart) and six Academy Award nominations — not bad for a World War II movie with zero American stars and long stretches without battle action. “It is unlike any other war film in that it confines the audience in a confined submarine where we digest the fear and panic of the human beings on screen,” enthused Cole Smithey. “In short, Das Boot is a religious experience.”The Final Countdown 50%There have been any number of movies about Pearl Harbor, and quite a few films featuring modern-day nuclear wessels — but the only one that’s ever dared to combine the two of them is The Final Countdown, starring Kirk Douglas as the skipper of a supercarrier that somehow wanders through a time vortex and ends up traveling back in time from 1980 to 1941 — one day before the attack at Pearl Harbor. It’s an intriguingly silly premise, at the very least; sadly, audiences weren’t terribly interested in seeing how it all played out, and critics, for the most part, weren’t impressed. Calling the movie “utter nonsense,” Vincent Canby of the New York Times allowed, “In defense of Don Taylor, the director, I must say I don’t think there was any way in which he could have made sense out of the screenplay or could have directed the actors to speak this dialogue with conviction.”The Hunt for Red October 89%Okay, so it’s technically more a film about the avoidance of naval warfare, but because we know we’ll get a bunch of “what about Hunt for Red October” comments if we leave it off the list, here’s the 1990 classic about a defecting Soviet submarine commander (Sean Connery) whose entry into U.S. waters puts the two nations on the brink of World War III, with only Jack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) standing between them. “The film is a piece of heightened prosaic suspense,” marveled Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman. “It comes at you in big, chewy gobs of exposition and dialogue.”Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World 85%Nominated for an impressive 10 Academy Awards, Peter Weir’s Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is an aquatic epic every bit as huge as its title, and a bid to launch a film franchise from Patrick O’Brian’s lengthy series of books about 19th century British Navy Captain Jack Aubrey (played by Russell Crowe) and his ship’s surgeon, Dr. Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany). Over two hours of ocean pursuit, cannon fire, and righteous fury from Crowe, Master and Commander pits Aubrey’s outmatched ship against a mysterious (and deadly) member of Napoleon’s fleet, with battles stretching halfway around the world (hence that unwieldy title). Though it only performed, in Weir’s words, “well…ish” at the box office, Master proved a sturdy critical vessel, earning praise from the likes of Cole Smithey, who called it “an expansive cinematic achievement that sits well against such adventure classics as Lawrence of Arabia, and a sure bet for fans of ocean-bound drama.”Operation Petticoat 81%There aren’t too many comedies on this list, but we’ll make a happy exception for this 1959 hit starring Cary Grant and Tony Curtis as quarrelling shipmates on a World War II submarine that suffers a string of indignities, including being sunk in a Philippine harbor, painted pink, and locked into combat with a friendly vessel — a battle brought to an end when Curtis suggests using a torpedo tube to fire a bra from one of the female nurses on board. Though it was one of the bigger box office hits of 1960, Operation Petticoat hasn’t aged particularly well with critics like Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, who called this early effort from director Blake Edwards a “Splendid, if a little long, service comedy.”Tora! Tora! Tora! 55%Long before Michael Bay took us to Pearl Harbor, this impressively ambitious collaboration between American and Japanese filmmakers offered its own sprawling, two hour-plus take on the attack that stunned the United States into entering World War II. Although some critics derided Tora! Tora! Tora!‘s occasionally dawdling pace — Roger Ebert called it “one of the deadest, dullest blockbusters ever made” — it marked an admirable attempt at presenting both sides of the infamous battle, earned five Oscar nominations, and won the admiration of critics like Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, who called it “A must-see for any war buff.”U-571 67%The only film on this week’s list to feature the acting talents of Jon Bon Jovi, 2000’s U-571 wrings some surprisingly effective suspense from its overly familiar World War II plot framework, thanks to some sharp direction from Jonathan Mostow (who also came up with the story and co-wrote the screenplay) and a generally distinguished cast that included Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, and Harvey Keitel. Pitting Allies against Axis in a race to acquire top-secret technology from a sinking German sub, U-571 surfaced with more than $125 million in global grosses, as well as praise from critics like Robert Horton of Film.com, who said it “concocts just enough genuinely surprising moments to make its own satisfying niche amongst the other examples of the genre.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

He helped kick off the summer of 2012 with Men in Black 3, and now, with this week’s decidedly more mature Hope Springs, he’s helping usher it out; in appreciation of his efforts, we decided to dedicate this week’s list to some of the many critical highlights from Jones’ distinguished filmography. Get ready to squint into the distance and give us your best world-weary sigh, because it’s time to Total Recall, Tommy Lee Jones style! 80%10. Captain America: The First AvengerMaking one of Marvel’s oldest (and squarest) heroes relevant for post-Dark Knight audiences seemed just about impossible on paper, but with 2011’s Captain America: The First Avenger, director Joe Johnston pulled it off by doing two things: One, embracing the character’s World War II roots with an origin pic joyously reminiscent of old-fashioned matinee adventures; and two, casting the heck out of the movie with an eyebrow-raising lineup of talent that included Dominic Cooper, Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving as Cap’s arch-nemesis the Red Skull, and Tommy Lee Jones as Cap’s hard-as-nails commanding officer, Colonel Chester Phillips. Sighed Mark Pfeiffer of Reel Times, “In the era of the tortured superhero in movies, it’s refreshing to come across one with enthusiasm and a pure spirit.” 78%9. The ClientJohn Grisham’s bestselling books have had their ups and downs on the big screen — and in the years following his epic mishandling of the Batman franchise, it may seem hard to believe that Joel Schumacher directed one of the best Grisham adaptations we’ve seen thus far. Believe it: Not only did 1994’s The Client rack up a robust $117 million at the box office, it earned the admiration of the vast majority of critics — and Susan Sarandon, who starred opposite Jones as a pair of lawyers duking it out over the case of a boy (Brad Renfro) whose life is in danger after he witnesses a mob-related suicide. “This isn’t a masterpiece of suspense,” cautioned James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “but it has its moments and is capable of providing some light summer entertainment.” 81%8. A Prairie Home CompanionHow do you turn one of America’s most famous (and long-running) radio shows into a movie? Well, in the case of A Prairie Home Companion, the answer turned out to be hiring Robert Altman to direct a suitably character-stuffed script by the show’s creator and host, Garrison Keillor. A long list of stars showed up for what turned out to be Altman’s final film, including Meryl Streep, Woody Harrelson, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, John C. Reilly, and — as the heartless heavy who shows up to cancel the show-within-a-film — Tommy Lee Jones. “It sparkles with a magic all its own as an engagingly performed piece of Midwestern whimsy and stoicism,” applauded the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris. “Mr. Altman’s flair for ensemble spectacle and seamless improvisation in the midst of utter chaos is as apparent as ever.” 86%7. Rolling ThunderBefore Sylvester Stallone wrapped a bandana around Vietnam vets’ anguish in First Blood, there was Rolling Thunder, the Peckinpah-worthy revenge saga of a freed POW (William Devane) who receives a hero’s welcome after returning to his Texas hometown — but only truly comes alive after a band of sadistic thugs comes looking for the stash of silver dollars he was awarded for his service. With his war buddy (played by a young, convincingly haunted-looking Jones) by his side and a sharpened hook for a right hand, he brings Thunder to a suitably bloody conclusion — and while its grindhouse overtones rubbed a number of critics the wrong way, for most scribes, it offered an intoxicating blend of palpable thrills and rock-solid acting. “Devane and Jones are outstanding,” marveled Film4. “Their characters are as numb as scar tissue, emasculated by peace and alienated by an ashamed and horrified society. The folly of the Vietnam War permeates every frame.” 84%6. JFKOliver Stone outdid himself when it came time to cast JFK, populating his conspiracy-fueled retelling of the chaos surrounding the aftermath of John F. Kennedy’s assassination with a bevy of famous faces (including Kevin Bacon, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, and of course Kevin Costner). And for the villain of the story, mysterious New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw, Stone settled on an actor’s actor, picking Jones (who earned an Academy Award for his work) to lend his epic an air of shadowy menace. Though some criticized JFK for playing fast and loose with historical data, most critics felt the ends justified the means; as John Hartl wrote for Film.com, “For all its outlandish and preachy moments, Stone’s movie is anything but boring.”&nbsp; 85%5. The Three Burials of Melquiades EstradaJones marked his directorial debut with this grim, well-received drama, inspired by the real-life killing of a Texas teenager by a confused border patrolman (Barry Pepper) and the subsequent efforts of his friend (Jones) to uncover the true story of his death despite the indifference of the local sheriff (Dwight Yoakam). Providing an on-screen reunion between Jones and his Coal Miner’s Daughter co-star Levon Helm, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada also earned Jones plenty of praise — including a Cannes award for Best Actor, a Golden Palm nomination, and raves from critics like Tom Long of the Detroit News, who described it as “Funny, tough, filled with cut-to-the-bone moments and bleached in the heat of the Texas sun” and called it “a movie that sears itself into the viewer with uncompromising vision and stark approach.” 92%4. Men in BlackThe success of The Fugitive catapulted Tommy Lee Jones from “distinguished character actor” to “leading man” status, and after Bad Boys, the mid-to-late 1990s pretty much belonged to Will Smith — so Men in Black wasn’t just your average action/comedy/sci-fi summer blockbuster, it was an Event Movie with almost $590 million in ticket sales (and a pair of sequels) waiting to happen. It didn’t win any awards for storytelling depth (although it did win a Best Makeup Oscar), but its unapologetic popcorn thrills, fueled by Smith and Jones’ easy interplay, entertained a whole lot of people — including Slate’s David Edelstein, who called it “The smartest, funniest, and best-looking sci-fi comedy since the movies learned to morph.” 96%3. The FugitiveThe original Fugitive was one of the more highly regarded TV dramas of the 1960s, and its central plot device — a man on the run for a crime he didn’t commit, and in pursuit of the real villain — was exceedingly easy to move to the big screen and turn into a pulse-pounding 1990s action thriller. What The Fugitive really had going for it, though, was a pair of terrific leads in Harrison Ford and the Oscar-winning Tommy Lee Jones. As the titular wanted man, Dr. Richard Kimble, Ford got to play another of the reluctant action heroes he embodied so well in the 1980s and 1990s — and Jones might as well have been born to play the blunt, brilliant, and driven U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard. A movie so successful it made the studio think 1998’s “spiritual sequel” U.S. Marshals would be a hit, The Fugitive sold tons of tickets while earning high praise from critics like the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley, who wrote, “A flurry of stunts, close shaves and deeds of desperate daring, it easily transcends its television origins to become a stylish pacemaker-buster on the order of Die Hard, MD.” 93%2. No Country for Old MenAfter spending much of the late 1990s and early aughts muddling through unloved fare like Double Jeopardy and Man of the House, Jones started finding solid scripts again toward the middle of the decade — chief among them No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers’ adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel about a blue-collar laborer (Josh Brolin) who stumbles across a drug deal gone bad and absconds with the money, triggering the scarily dispassionate wrath of a hitman (Javier Bardem) and drawing a world-weary sheriff (Jones) into their blood-soaked feud. “No Country for Old Men is the first movie I’ve seen in a very long while that deserves to be called a masterpiece,” enthused Lou Lumenick for the New York Post. “It’s such a stunning achievement in storytelling.” 86%1. Coal Miner’s DaughterJones earned his first Golden Globe nomination for his work in this Loretta Lynn biopic, adapted by director Michael Apted and screenwriter Tom Rickman from the country legend’s own autobiography. Co-starring alongside Sissy Spacek (who took home an Oscar for her performance as Lynn) as her tirelessly supportive husband Oliver, the Texas native helped add to the film’s air of Southern verisimilitude — and beefed up an already-impressive cast that also included Beverly D’Angelo and Levon Helm. “The movie isn’t great art, but it has been made with great taste and style,” observed Roger Ebert. “It’s more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.”In case you were wondering, here are Jones’ top 10 movies according&nbsp;to RT users’ scores:1.

This isn’t the first time multiple movies have shared a title, of course, but noticing the latest example on the release schedule got us thinking — and by the time we’d finished thinking, we had ourselves a list. From Oscar winners to infamous duds, here are 24 movies with only a dozen titles between them. It’s time for Total Recall!The Accused (1948, 1988), 91%They’re separated by nearly 40 years — and completely different storylines — but the 1988 The Accused, like its 1949 predecessor, has a plot set in motion by an act of sexual violence. Key difference: When a college professor (played by Loretta Young) suffers an attempted rape in the 1949 film, she brains her attacker with a tire iron and spends the rest of the movie battling her guilt. In the 1980s, things got a lot more brutal for Jodie Foster — and her character dealt with the repercussions in court, for better or worse.Bad Boys (1983, 1995) 89%, 42%A dozen years before Will Smith and Martin Lawrence blew up half of Florida in Michael Bay’s Bad Boys, Sean Penn starred in a gritty juvie drama with the same name, proving he had the dramatic chops to do more than antagonize poor old Mr. Hand. Critics loved the 1983 Boys a lot more than Bay’s film, but Smith and Lawrence took the box office crown, racking up more than $140 million in worldwide grosses and spawning a franchise that, although it’s lain dormant for nearly a decade, may yet produce a Bad Boys III.Betrayed (1954, 1988), 42%More than 30 years before Debra Winger played an FBI agent whose mission to infiltrate a group of Iowan white supremacists is complicated when she (whoops!) falls in love with local racist Tom Berenger, 1954’s Betrayed starred Clark Gable and Lana Turner as a spy and the suspected Nazi he’s ordered to keep tabs on. Which one gives you more bigoted bang for your buck? It’s hard to argue with Gable and Turner — or the film that ultimately inspired Top Secret! — but the 1988 version is no slouch either, boasting direction from Costas-Gavras and a supporting cast that included the inimitable John Mahoney.Blue Steel (1934, 1990), 75%In 1990, as in 1934, the title Blue Steel referred to firepower, but these two films are a pretty compelling case study in Hollywood’s changing attitude regarding who could safely wield it. The original Steel is a pretty standard 1930s Western, starring John Wayne as a U.S. marshal pursuing a bandit, while its 1990 counterpart stars Jamie Lee Curtis in a creepy Kathryn Bigelow thriller about a rookie cop who unwittingly falls for the successful broker/secret psycho killer (Ron Silver) who tampered with a crime scene and cost Curtis her badge. While it’s hard to beat the Duke, it’s Curtis’ Blue Steel that really hits its target, offering a few nifty twists on a very familiar formula.Crash (1996, 2005) 63%, 74%One is an attempt to use a star-studded cast and narrative gimmickry to make audiences think about institutionalized racism in modern-day America and the other is a chilly softcore flick about a couple with a fetish for automobile accidents, but other than that, 1996’s Crash and its 2004 counterpart are exactly the same. Oh, wait, another key difference: The 2004 version picked up an Academy Award for Best Picture that’s still being debated today, while the 1996 Crash skidded out at 57 percent on the Tomatometer.Employee of the Month (2003, 2006) 11%, 20%If we told you two movies shared the title Employee of the Month and asked you to guess which one had the lower Tomatometer, you’d probably pick the one that starred Jessica Simpson and Dane Cook. But not so fast: Although Simpson and Cook certainly took a beating from reviewers, tumbling all the way to 20 percent on the meter with their alleged retail comedy, it’s the 2003 Employee that takes turkey honors with a lowly 11 percent. Starring Matt Dillon and Christina Applegate as a fired bank employee and the woman who dumps him, it found its only friend in Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, who couched his three-star review in the extreme qualification that it “has moments a-plenty both cute and clever, but it doesn’t quite generate enough interest to make you really vest yourself in the plot.”Fair Game (1995, 2010) 12%, 79%On paper, the 1995 Fair Game looked like a blockbuster — the big-screen debut of Cindy Crawford, acting opposite a Baldwin brother in the action thriller saga of a lawyer who runs afoul of an ex-KGB mobster. In reality, of course, it was critically dogpiled and sputtered out at $11.5 million at the box office — less than half the earnings of 2010’s Fair Game, a solidly reviewed arthouse thriller starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts as real-life diplomat Joseph C. Wilson and his outed CIA agent wife, Valerie Plame. Turns out having Cindy Crawford in a tank top on your poster isn’t the ticket to cinematic immortality. Who’d have guessed?Gladiator (1992, 2000) 31%, 77%Say “Gladiator,” and most people are going to think you’re talking about Russell Crowe’s Oscar-winning smash about a Roman general who loses his family and his freedom after the emperor dies and his devious son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes control of the empire. And that’s probably just the way Cuba Gooding, Jr. likes it, given the commercial indifference and rash of negative reviews that greeted his Gladiator, a 1992 boxing drama about two kids from the wrong side of the tracks who have to face each other in the ring after getting mixed up with an unscrupulous promoter (Brian Dennehy).Glory (1956, 1989), 93%Feeling the need for some cinematic Glory, but not in the mood for an Oscar-winning Civil War epic? We have just the movie you’re looking for: One of several unsuccessful forays into adult roles for child actor Margaret O’Brien, 1956’s Glory follows the efforts of a horse owner and her grandmother to take their steed from dud to Kentucky Derby winner with the help of a plucky trainer (Walter Brennan, in the later stages of an Oscar-winning career). Sadly, if you’re looking for a movie that will give you Matthew Broderick resplendent in a jaunty military cap and mustache, you still really only have one choice.Heat (1972, 1987, 1995) 100%, 17%, 87%Well, “heat” is definitely one of the more evocative words in the English language, so it makes a certain amount of sense that filmmakers would be drawn to it when trying to figure out a title. Here we have not two, but three movies named Heat: the 1995 Michael Mann action thriller about a cop (Al Pacino) and the crafty crook (Robert De Niro) he’s sworn to bring down, the infamous 1987 turkey about a bodyguard (Burt Reynolds) pursuing a vendetta against a sadistic mobster (Neill Barry), and the 1972 Warhol production about a gigolo (Joe Dallesandro) who beds a fading film star (Sylvia Miles) in an effort to further his acting career. Imagine the disappointment and confusion if you rented the wrong one?Kicking and Screaming (1995, 2005) 57%, 41%One is the art house comedy debut of the ampersand-friendly director who’d go on to helm The Squid &amp; the Whale; the other is a soccer-themed family comedy from the guy who brought subtitles back to the cineplex with Casa de Mi Padre earlier this year. Not the most similar films in the world, in other words, but both Kicking &amp; Screamings have one thing in common: Neither represents a critical highlight for its creative principals, who had to endure slights like “boring” and “barely watchable.” Maybe the title’s cursed?Twilight (1998, 2008) 60%, 49%In terms of pedigree, the two Twilights couldn’t be more different — the 1998 version (forced to ditch its original title, The Magic Hour, because Magic Johnson was debuting a talk show by the same name) was a low-key P.I. story starring a cast of wily vets that included Paul Newman, James Garner, Gene Hackman, and Susan Sarandon. Despite all that star power, it faded from theaters without making much of an impression, and by the time Stephenie Meyer’s saga of young vampires and werewolves made its way to the screen 10 years later, few filmgoers remembered that it shared a title with a decidedly less fang-friendly film.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

In honor of Honest Abe’s return to the big screen, we decided to take a look at some other films about real-life Presidents — and although none of them feature commanders-in-chief slaying the undead, we think you’ll still find a few classics in the bunch. Hail to the Total Recall!Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940)  83%Abe Lincoln in Illinois was a Pulitzer-winning hit on the stage before it arrived in theaters, and the film adaptation did right by its source material, earning a pair of Academy Award nominations — including a Best Actor nomination for Raymond Massey, who reprised his stage performance as Honest Abe on his way to the White House. (Fun trivia note: Ruth Gordon, who went on to win an Oscar for her performance as Minnie Castavet in Rosemary’s Baby, makes her screen debut here as Mary Todd Lincoln.) “It’s a grand picture they’ve made from Robert Sherwood’s Pulitzer Prize play of two seasons back,” enthused Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times. “A grand picture and a memorable biography of the greatest American of them all.”Dick (1999)  71%With a pair of bikini-topped girls on the poster, the involvement of someone named Deep Throat, and a title like Dick, you might expect something other than a cheerful political parody from director Andrew Fleming’s 1999 release. But all winking aside, Dick is actually a fairly clever re-imagining of the Watergate scandal, with a pair of teenage girls (played by Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst) who stumble into jobs as White House dog walkers after unwittingly ruining the break-in — and subsequently wind up altering the course of the entire administration. Mused Sue Pierman of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, “The film is such a delight not only because it’s clever, but because it so perfectly captures the era.”Frost/Nixon (2008)  93%Ron Howard’s best-reviewed film in ages, 2009’s Frost/Nixon adapts the Peter Morgan play that dramatized British broadcaster David Frost’s (played by Michael Sheen) efforts to secure and sell a series of TV interviews with the politically exiled former president (portrayed by Frank Langella). Although plenty of pundits took umbrage at the way Morgan’s screenplay took liberties with the actual events that inspired the film, for the vast majority of critics, Frost/Nixon‘s flaws seemed pretty minor when weighed against the script, direction, editing, completed picture, and Langella’s performance — all of which received Oscar nominations. For the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Steven Rea, it all added up to “A must-see for political junkies, history buffs, and folks still fascinated by the paranoia-fueled follies of the twitchy, sweaty, decidedly uncharismatic 37th president.”Give 'em Hell, Harry! (1975)  100%Samuel Gallu’s hit play came to the screen with this 1975 film, which used nine cameras to capture a tour de force performance from the show’s one-man cast. James Whitmore earned Best Actor nominations from the Academy Awards as well as the Golden Globes for his portrayal of Harry S. Truman, which revisited highlights from the 33rd President’s career — and benefited greatly from post-Watergate America’s yearning for leaders they could trust. Roger Ebert captured this feeling in his review, praising Give ‘Em Hell, Harry! for its “nice, wicked partisan spirit sure to delight Democrats and inspire Republicans to wonder glumly why Richard, Dwight, Herbert, Calvin and Warren, not to mention Gerald, don’t seem to lend themselves to this treatment.”Jefferson in Paris (1995)  31%Could Thomas Jefferson have projected Nick Nolte’s air of rumpled insouciance in a mugshot? We’ll never know for sure, but we do know Nolte is capable of pulling off a pretty solid facsimile of our nation’s third president. The evidence: 1995’s Jefferson in Paris, which imagines what may have transpired during his French ambassadorship during the years leading up to his eventual election — specifically, his alleged affairs with Maria Cosway and Sally Hemings. Directed by James Ivory and featuring a terrific cast that included James Earl Jones, Thandie Newton, and Gwyneth Paltrow, Jefferson seemed like critical catnip; alas, most scribes turned up their noses at the finished product’s sluggish pace and scattered screenplay. James Berardinelli of ReelViews acted as a voice of dissent, arguing, “Though it may be occasionally slow-moving and perhaps a half-hour too long, this film is put together with care and a mindfulness of quality.”JFK (1991)  84%A two-time Oscar winner and controversial smash hit for director Oliver Stone, JFK reconstructs John F. Kennedy’s assassination and then spends most of its epic 189-minute length sifting through the wreckage, treating the killing as a murder mystery that New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) doggedly attempts to solve at any cost. With an impeccable supporting cast that included Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Oldman, as well as a screenplay that challenged long-held assumptions about Kennedy’s death, JFK reignited interest in the assassination, eventually leading to new legislation that ordered a reinvestigation and promised that all documents related to the killing would be made public by 2017. And while many critics agreed that the movie could have benefited from a more rigorous approach to the facts, it remains, in the words of the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, “A riveting marriage of fact and fiction.”Nixon (1995)  75%Part of the Tricky Dick trifecta on this list, Oliver Stone’s Nixon gave us Anthony Hopkins as the disgraced former president and Joan Allen as his wife Pat — and while the 192-minute political epic failed to generate much heat at the box office, both Hopkins and Allen received Oscar nominations for their work in the film, which follows a non-linear path through Nixon’s life and career, taking viewers from his California youth through his resignation. “What it finally adds up to,” argued Janet Maslin of the New York Times, “is a huge mixed bag of waxworks and daring, a film that is furiously ambitious even when it goes flat, and startling even when it settles for eerie, movie-of-the-week mimicry.”PT 109 (1963)  64%The first theatrical release inspired by a sitting president, 1963’s PT 109 used Vincent Flaherty and Howard Sheehan’s nonfiction bestseller about John F. Kennedy’s heroics during World War II as the basis for a war film starring Cliff Robertson as JFK, James Gregory as his crusty commander, and a young(er) Norman Fell as one of his crewmates. Made with no shortage of reverence for its subject — and White House veto power over the director and star — PT 109 struck many critics as too long and dull to recommend during its theatrical run, but most scribes found something to enjoy. As Allmovie’s Craig Butler pointed out, “Not everyone was involved with the major assaults; many spent their time risking their lives in places and situations of which most people are totally unaware, and it’s a nice change of pace to see this aspect of the war dramatized.”The President's Lady (1953) Before he played Moses, John the Baptist, or Michelangelo, Charlton Heston portrayed Andrew Jackson in The President’s Lady, dramatizing the seventh President’s early years in a sweeping historical drama that centers on his marriage to Rachel Donelson Robards. Arguably more interesting than most presidential unions, Jackson’s relationship with Robards was complicated after the lovebirds discovered that their marriage was technically invalid on account of the fact that her previous husband had lied about filing for divorce, thus clouding Jackson’s political ambitions with accusations of bigamy. “Through it all,” observed Variety, “Charlton Heston supplies the kind of ammunition to this film that is as loaded as any carbine slung across his broad shoulders. It is a forthright steely-eyed portrayal.”1776 (1972)  69%A musical about the founding fathers? It might sound like a Family Guy sketch, but 1776 is actually very serious — and although it arrived in theaters a few years too early to take advantage of bicentennial fever, director Peter H. Hunt’s song-and-dancefied look at our nation’s birth found critics in a generally forgiving mood. How can you argue with a musical starring Ken Howard as Thomas Jefferson? Vincent Canby of the New York Times couldn’t — although he groused that “the music is resolutely unmemorable” and “the lyrics sound as if they’d been written by someone high on root beer,” he had to concede that this adaptation of the hit 1969 play “insists on being so entertaining and, at times, even moving, that you might as well stop resisting it.”Sunrise at Campobello (1960)  88%A key figure in some of the most crucial events in American history, Franklin Delano Roosevelt led an eminently biopic-worthy life — but 1960’s Sunrise at Campobello sidesteps most of his time on the world stage, opting instead to concentrate on the difficulties he faced in the weeks after suffering partial paralysis at the age of 39. Ralph Bellamy stars here as FDR, reprising his role in the hit stage run of the Broadway play, alongside Greer Garson (who earned an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for her performance) as Eleanor Roosevelt. For most critics — who were, along with the rest of the country, learning the extent of the former President’s health struggles for the first time — the end result was well worth watching. “Ralph Bellamy’s performance of Mr. Roosevelt is every bit as strong, as full of feeling and characteristic gesture, as Mr. Bellamy made it on the stage,” wrote Bosley Crowther in the New York Times. “The picture he gives us of a strong man enduring a dark Gethsemane and coming through it with cheerfulness and courage is one of the finest of this year on the screen.”Thirteen Days (2000)  83%Nearly a decade after he scored a huge hit with JFK, Kevin Costner starred in another film that drew inspiration from events surrounding the Kennedy administration: Thirteen Days, which found Costner playing presidential aide Kenneth O’Donnell alongside Bruce Greenwood (JFK) and Steven Culp (Bobby Kennedy) in a tense behind-the-scenes dramatization of what went down in the White House during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. While it wasn’t a huge hit during its theatrical run, Days scored with critics such as Eric Harrison of the Houston Chronicle, who mused, “Who would’ve thought this nearly 40-year-old piece of history could be turned into such a riveting motion picture?”W. (2008)  58%The most recent chapter of Oliver Stone’s presidential trilogy, W. served George W. Bush — who was wrapping up his second term while it was filmed — with a somewhat muted, surprisingly sympathetic biopic that traced his occasionally haphazard rise from political scion to oil baron and back again. While Josh Brolin earned near-universal praise for his work in the title role, critics found W. as a whole a little harder to take, citing its laconic pace and insufficiently hard-hitting approach as particularly troublesome flaws. For others, however, it proved a warm, fairly witty farewell for the GWB years; as the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Phillips put it, “The film may be ill-timed, arguably unnecessary and no more psychologically probing than any other Stone movie. But much of it works as deft, brisk, slyly engaging docudrama.”Wilson (1944)  89%A prolific legislator, successful — albeit occasionally begrudging — proponent of progressive causes (including women’s suffrage), and dedicated diplomat, Woodrow Wilson offered producer Darryl F. Zanuck plenty of material for a biopic — and Zanuck obliged, turning the 28th President’s life into the 154-minute epic known simply as Wilson. Sadly, in spite of its inspiring source material (and generally positive reviews), Wilson was a costly flop; according to the film’s Wikipedia entry, “its failure upset him to the point that he forbade any of his employees from ever mentioning the film in his presence again.” Still, the movie earned an impressive 13 Academy Awards, winning six. “Zanuck, fresh from his experiences of WWII, was keen to make a movie which addressed the problems of the age,” explained Time Out. “The result’s handsome, worthy and solemn.”Young Mr. Lincoln (1939)  100%Offering a somewhat fictionalized version of real-life events, Young Mr. Lincoln blends the 16th President’s early years into some vintage courtroom drama with surprisingly successful results. Starring Henry Fonda as Lincoln, the film begins with the chance encounter that sparks his journey from humble shopkeeper to skilled attorney, culminating in a court case that finds young Mr. Lincoln saving a couple of men framed for murder — and winning Mary Todd’s heart in the process. Eventually enshrined in the National Film Registry, Young Mr. Lincoln boasts a perfect Tomatometer rating thanks to reviews like the writeup printed by Douglas Pratt of the Hollywood Reporter, who enthused, “Fonda’s physical presence throughout the film is a thing of magic, as he seems to glide from one position to the next, never looking awkward even when he is bent in three places to fit within the frame.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"pirates, Searchlight, Hulu, boxoffice, NYCC, Walt, blaxploitation, San, OneApp, America, Box","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/W.jpg","slug":"total-recall-us-presidents-on-film-2"},{"id":"47508978599419","title":"Total Recall: Part Fives","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Part FivesWith Resident Evil: Retribution hitting theaters, we look at other movie franchises with stories too big for just four installments.by Jeff Giles | September 13, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;Sequels! We love to complain about them, but clearly, we can’t get enough of ’em — or at least that’s the message we keep sending at the box office, where they seem to take up a greater percentage of the grosses every year. Of course, nothing lasts forever, and when it comes to film franchises, the audience’s fondness for the characters tends to run out around the third film — but there are some notable exceptions, such as the Resident Evil series, which makes its fifth(!) trip to the big screen this weekend with Resident Evil: Retribution. In honor of this momentous achievement, we decided to take a look at other fifth installments, and came up with a list that’s more impressive (and less reliant on horror sequels) than you might think. One, two, three, four, five: this Total Recall’s working overtime!Battle For The Planet Of The Apes 36%Why Five? Mainly because the execs at 20th Century Fox couldn’t help themselves — even though the Planet of the Apes sequels had been a study in diminishing box office returns, the films were still cheap enough to make that they all turned a healthy profit, so a fifth installment was more or less inevitable.Franchise Changes: As the ticket receipts slowed for the series, the studio’s purse strings tightened, making Battle for the Planet of the Apes a rather cheap-looking affair; in addition, screenwriter Paul Dehn, who’d written the second, third, and fourth films, had to bow out — although he was later brought in to polish the eventual script, resulting in a cobbled-together story (and an eventual credit tussle in front of the WGA).The End? Sort of, although Apes lived on as a pair of TV series before returning to the screen in 2001 (with Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes remake) and 2011 (the series reboot Rise of the Planet of the Apes).The Dead Pool 55%Why Five? Because the fourth Dirty Harry movie, 1983’s Sudden Impact, was the highest-grossing in the series, raking in nearly $70 million in the U.S. while spawning the endlessly parroted catchphrase “Go ahead — make my day” and proving that when you have a squinty guy with a gun, the sequels pretty much write themselves.Franchise Changes: Each Dirty Harry movie has a different director, and The Dead Pool was no different; Buddy Van Horn, a onetime stunt double for Clint Eastwood who went on to direct him in a number of films, steps in here. Other than that, Pool adheres pretty strictly to the formula (which is exactly as it should be).The End? Yes. Despite having a prime summer opening slot, Pool went down as the least profitable entry in the series, and Dirty Harry Callahan was finally allowed to retire — although not before sharing screen time with the members of Guns N’ Roses and a young Jim Carrey.Death Wish V: The Face of Death 0%Why Five? Because even over the age of 70 (and just a few years away from hip replacement surgery), Charles Bronson wasn’t finished with the Death Wish series — and there were still people willing to cut a check to make another sequel happen.Franchise Changes: Habitual vigilante Paul Kersey (Bronson) is now a member of the Witness Protection Program, which has given him a new alias (and bizarrely decided to move him back to New York City, site of the original Death Wish and Death Wish 3). Other than that, not much has changed — there are bad guys who need killing, and Kersey’s there to help.The End? Most definitely — Bronson was much too old to convincingly portray an action hero, and the box office returns for Death Wish V were awful. Still, every so often, someone floats the idea of a remake; although Sylvester Stallone apparently thought better of it after publicly mulling taking over the series in 2006, it seems likely that someone will eventually (ahem) pull the trigger.Fast Five 77%Why Five? Because just when it seemed like the Fast and Furious franchise had run its course — or at least veered off into a Bring It On-style series of endless, vaguely connected sequels — 2009’s Fast &amp; Furious pulled it back on course with a $363 million hit that reunited members of the original cast. Clearly, it couldn’t stop there.Franchise Changes: Well, it added Dwayne Johnson and sent the action to Rio. But other than that, this series has a formula that you don’t alter — fast cars, furious drivers — and Fast Five reaped more than $625 million in exchange for not messing with it.The End? Nope — Fast Six is scheduled to roar into theaters on May 24, 2013.Final Destination 5 62%Why Five? People like watching teenagers die ugly, apparently.Franchise Changes: The vast majority of the cast members in any Destination movie don’t last long enough to pop up again in a sequel, so fans know each film is going to give them a whole new crop of victims. This time around, one small wrinkle was introduced in the form of some advice from recurring character Coroner Bludworth (Tony Todd), who reveals that anyone who cheats Death has to claim someone else’s life in order to stay alive.The End? It remains to be seen, although the last installment’s $157 million worldwide gross would seem to suggest future Destinations in store.Friday the 13th, Part V – A New Beginning 19%Why Five? The fourth Friday the 13th was billed as “the final chapter,” but the enduring commercial popularity of the series meant it was only a year before a hockey mask-wearing maniac would once more terrorize the randy teens of Crystal Lake.Franchise Changes: This Friday lives up to its “A New Beginning” subtitle by leaving Jason Voorhees dead and buried, instead imagining a grim future for young Tommy Jarvis, his killer in Part 4. Now grown up and played by John Shepherd, the understandably troubled Tommy is sent to a camp for wayward teens — only to find himself forced to contend with a wave of killings perpetrated by a seemingly revived Jason.The End? Absolutely not — the Friday the 13th movies would continue to provide teen scream fodder throughout the 1980s, 1990s, and aughts, sending Jason to Manhattan, Hell, and outer space before pitting him against Freddy Krueger (more on that guy later) and ultimately rebooting the series with 2009’s Friday the 13th.Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers 12%Why Five? Because Michael Myers needed to get revenge, silly. Also, 1988’s Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers put the slasher franchise back on track (after 1982’s Myers-free Halloween III: Season of the Witch), and producer Moustapha Akkad wanted to keep the gravy train rolling.Franchise Changes: While the ending of Halloween 4 suggested that Myers’ niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) was going to follow in his serial-killing footsteps, Halloween 5 mostly stuck to the established formula of having Myers begin the film in some sort of coma, wake up in late October, and embark on a murderous rampage. One significant twist this time around was the introduction of the Man in Black, a Myers accomplice whose purpose would eventually be revealed in Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers.The End? Nope. Like Myers himself, the Halloween franchise just keeps lumbering along, with H20 and Halloween: Resurrection following in 1998 and 2002, and the Rob Zombie-directed reboots Halloween and Halloween II hitting theaters in 2007 and 2009. We’re sure we haven’t seen the last of Michael Myers.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix 77%Why Five? Because J.K. Rowling wrote seven Harry Potter books — and with each film adaptation grossing an average of nearly $300 million in the United States alone, there was no way we weren’t going to see all seven of them on the big screen.Franchise Changes: The fifth Potter film brought a new director (David Yates) and screenwriter (Michael Goldenberg), as well as the franchise’s first foray into IMAX 3D; in terms of casting, it marked the first appearances of Helena Bonham Carter as the gleefully wicked Bellatrix Lestrange, as well as Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. A fair amount of change — but it didn’t put a dent in the reviews, which were again largely positive, or the box office tally, which topped out near $940 million worldwide.The End? No; in fact, thanks to Warner Bros.’ decision to split the series-concluding Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two chapters, the film franchise went on to outnumber the books.The Muppet Christmas Carol 76%Why Five? Because the Muppets had been missing from the big screen for too long — their last appearance was in Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird — and after Jim Henson’s untimely death in 1990, the company that bears his name needed to prove that the show must go on. What better way than with a Muppetized interpretation of the Dickens classic A Christmas Carol?Franchise Changes: Apart from the obvious major change — Steve Whitmire stepping in as the voice of Kermit the Frog in Henson’s absence — Carol also finds human actors figuring in more prominently than previous Muppet movies. An annoying development for hardcore fans, perhaps, but one mitigated by the presence of Michael Caine, who lent his signature charm to the role of Ebenezer Scrooge.The End? Certainly not. Although the Muppets’ box office fortunes weren’t exactly spectacular during the 1990s, and they spent the early aughts absent from theaters, they returned in a big way with 2011’s The Muppets — and with a sequel in development, we should be seeing more of them soon.&nbsp;Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child 29%Why Five? It was occasionally rather clumsily handled, but the Nightmare on Elm Street series actually used its first few sequels to establish a deepening mythology around the character of Freddy Krueger — one which unfortunately took a turn into the excessively silly and convoluted with 1989’s The Dream Child.Franchise Changes: Freddy’s mother, Amanda Krueger, was more of a presence in Dream Child, which picks up a year after A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master left off and finds Freddy using the unborn fetus in the womb of his previous adversary, Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), to reach out into the dream world and claim new victims.The End? Impossible as it might seem, the Elm Street producers actually found somewhere else to go after the storyline described above, putatively wrapping up the franchise with 1991’s Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare before bringing the character back for the cleverly meta Wes Craven’s New Nightmare, the 2003 mashup Freddy vs. Jason, and 2010’s Jackie Earle Haley-led A Nightmare on Elm Street reboot. Is Freddy finally dead? We doubt it.Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach 0%Why Five? Because even without Steve Guttenberg starring as the wisecracking Mahoney, the Police Academy series was one of the most reliable moneymakers of the 1980s — and with a returning ensemble that included Michael Winslow, Bubba Smith, G.W. Bailey, and George Gaynes, Assignment Miami Beach still managed to debut at the top of the box office charts.Franchise Changes: Aside from the notable lack of Guttenberg (and Bobcat Goldthwait), which necessitated the introduction of Matt McCoy as Sgt. Nick Lassard, the biggest change was one of location — the gang headed to sunny Florida for a visit to the National Police Chiefs Convention, which of course turned into a laff-a-minute mixup with some local jewel thieves.The End? Not at all. The movies continued through 1994’s Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow, and the franchise spilled over into a pair of TV series (one syndicated, one animated), plus a pending series reboot.Rocky V 31%Why Five? From a narrative standpoint, it’s hard to say, really. While the first four Rocky movies had their bumpy spots, they were all feel-good stories about faith and redemption — the increasingly over-the-top saga of a guy from the streets who fought his way to the top — while the fifth installment managed to be darker and more depressing while also finding a way to be cheesier. It really all boiled down to money; as Sylvester Stallone put it a few years ago when asked about Rocky V, “I’m greedy, what can I tell you?”Franchise Changes: Rocky V picks up at the end of Rocky IV, with the Italian Stallion going from defeating the Soviet champ, Ivan Drago, to discovering he has brain damage — and that his accountant has bankrupted him. Rocky’s new shot at redemption turns out to be managing a younger boxer (Tommy Morrison), but their relationship is complicated by the advances of a Don King-esque promoter (Richard Gant), and the whole thing culminates in a poorly staged street brawl.The End? For a long time, it seemed that way, but to Stallone’s credit, Rocky V nagged at him for years, until he finally gave his most famous character the sendoff he deserved with 2006’s warmly received Rocky Balboa.Saw V 13%Why Five? Because by 2008, the Saw films had become an annual Halloween tradition for filmgoers who like some thrillingly devious on-screen torture with their popcorn — and because we were just starting to figure out what made the Jigsaw Killer (Tobin Bell) tick.Franchise Changes: With the Jigsaw Killer dead at the end of Saw III, the story started to spiral off into (somewhat) new directions in Saw IV, continuing into the fifth installment, which traced the steps leading up to a police detective (Costas Mandylor) becoming Jigsaw’s apprentice.The End? Nope — the series continued up through Saw 3D, which concluded the grisly saga with an extra dimension in 2010.Seed of Chucky 34%Why Five? Because if you’re lucky enough to get away with making a hit movie about a psychotic doll possessed with the soul of a serial killer, you might as well keep the sequels coming until people stop showing up.Franchise Changes: After three installments of relatively straightforward horror, the series went off the deep end with Bride of Chucky, which introduced Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), an ex-girlfriend from Chucky’s human years who winds up also becoming a living doll. The lunacy continued with Seed of Chucky, which follows the adventures of Chucky, Tiffany, and their offspring Glen (or Glenda).The End? Yes and no. Although the next sequel, Curse of Chucky, is heading straight to video, there’s also a rumored franchise reboot in the works, so Brad Dourif should be busy with homicidal voicework for years to come.Star Trek V: The Final Frontier 21%Why Five? Because 1986’s Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home turned whales and nuclear wessels into a $133 million hit, and with Star Trek: The Next Generation earning healthy ratings, Trek mania was near its peak.Franchise Changes: After Leonard Nimoy directed the franchise’s well-received third and fourth installments, William Shatner stepped behind the cameras for the fifth, which finds the crew of the Enterprise entering deep space in search of God (or something).The End? According to Trek legend, The Final Frontier nearly destroyed the franchise — and although the story came from an idea of Shatner’s, it wasn’t entirely his fault; Frontier was plagued by all manner of problems, from a writer’s strike to set problems and studio interference. Still, the end result was the same: An ignominious box office flop and triple Golden Raspberry winner whose odor would linger until the release of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country in 1991.Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones 65%Why Five? Because ever since Star Wars fans heard about the Clone Wars — way back in A New Hope — we’d been waiting to see just what the heck they were. Also, there’s no way the series could have ended with The Phantom Menace.Franchise Changes: It’s here that we get our first glimpse of Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker — as well as some of his earliest struggles with the rage that made him such an attractive recruit for the evil Sith. With plenty of interplanetary jetsetting and an epic battle sequence, it’s also the longest installment in the Star Wars series.The End? Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo — we all lined up to watch the saga conclude with Revenge of the Sith in 2005.You Only Live Twice 73%Why Five? Because when your main character is a suave secret agent with a license to kill, the possibilities are limitless — just ask the folks who are already impatient to see the next James Bond movie in November.Franchise Changes: Sean Connery was getting tired of playing Bond, but he agreed to come back for You Only Live Twice, which represented the first time a 007 movie had deviated strongly from the Ian Fleming source novel. Unlike a lot of the other Bond flicks, Twice doesn’t include a lot of globetrotting — spacejacking opening sequence notwithstanding — but it still makes room for an iconic villain (Donald Pleasance as Blofeld) and memorable love interest (Mie Hama as Kissy Suzuki).The End? Not even close. He’s had some rough patches, but as of this writing, Bond is as cool as ever, and his 23rd adventure, Skyfall, is one of fall 2012’s most eagerly anticipated releases.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But these days, he’s focused on expanding the Alien&nbsp;franchise — and with the latest installment, Alien: Covenant, landing in theaters this weekend, we decided now would be the perfect time to take a fond look back at 10 of the brightest critical highlights from the Ridley Scott oeuvre while letting you rank your own personal favorites.

Geeks! For years, they bore the brunt of hostility from all the cool kids — but now, in a turn of events that would have infuriated Fred “The Ogre” Palowakski, they are the cool kids, and this week they’re celebrating their ascendance with the ultimate annual pilgrimage of nerddom and geekitude. Yes, friends, we’re talking about Comic-Con, and in honor of the total geekout scheduled to take place in San Diego between tomorrow and Sunday, we decided to devote this week’s list to some of our favorite nerd- and geek-dedicated films. Hike up those floodwaters, Poindexter, because it’s time for Total Recall!The 40 Year Old Virgin 85%Judd Apatow and Steve Carell co-wrote the script for The 40-Year-Old Virgin, which gave Carell his long worked-for star-making role: action figure-collecting geek Andy Stitzer, whose quest to end his virginity sets up two hours of raunchy gags, Michael McDonald bashing, and inspired lunacy from Jane Lynch. $177 million in worldwide grosses later, Apatow and Carell were household names — and “Kelly Clarkson!” was an acceptable epithet — thanks in part to critical praise from writers like Paul Greenwood of Future Movies, who wrote, “It’s a joy to be in the hands of filmmakers who intuitively know the difference between rude and crude, who know that horny and heartfelt can exist in tandem and that jokes about race and sexuality are not the same as racism and homophobia.”Ghost World 93%Perhaps you’ve noticed that when Hollywood wants to make a movie about nerds or geeks, they tend to focus on male characters. Not so Terry Zwigoff’s Ghost World, a bleakly funny adaptation of the Daniel Clowes comic book about a pair of teenage misfits (Scarlett Johansson and Thora Birch) whose casually mean-spirited prank on a lonely middle-aged man (Steve Buscemi) has unforeseen consequences on their friendship. A cult and critical favorite, Ghost World resonated with scribes like Angie Errigo of Empire, who wrote, “This is ‘teen comedy’ of startling sophistication — with horribly funny bits as well. A true original, with sharp humour, subtle detail and painfully realistic characters.”Hackers 32%Boasting the tagline “Boot up or shut up! On line this fall,” posters for 1995’s Hackers promised slick, futuristic action — and, as is so dreadfully often the case, delivered a muddled assortment of computer culture cliches and plot points whose wild implausibility indicated a complete misunderstanding of the way technology works. However unlikely the events of the storyline, some critics enjoyed this tale of teen computer whizzes (led by Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie) and their battle against a swindling security expert (Fisher Stevens) — including Christopher Null of Filmcritic, who chuckled, “The real draw to Hackers is that it is so unexpectedly funny. Really funny. The comic scenes with the kids (and there are lots of them) are totally hilarious. The ‘serious’ scenes are too, because they are often so ridiculous.”The Nutty Professor 84%With all due respect to Eddie Murphy’s very funny update, for this week’s list we have to give the nod to the original Nutty Professor, because nobody nerds out quite like Jerry Lewis in his 1960s prime. Acting out a revenge fantasy for spurned nerds everywhere while delivering a brilliant dual performance, Lewis starred as the brilliant-yet-socially-inept scientist Julius F. Kelp and his suave, chemically induced alter ego, Buddy Love — while also directing and co-writing the script. “Credit the effervescent Mr. Lewis for trying something different — a comical character study, with an edge of pathos,” urged A.H. Weiler of the New York Times. “The surprising, rather disturbing result is less of a showcase for a clown than the revelation (and not for the first time) of a superb actor.”Pi 88%Combining elements of Old Testament mysticism, psychological thriller, and noir, Darren Aronofsky’s Pi marked his directorial debut with distinctive flair, plunging viewers into the intensely paranoid world of an unstable genius (Sean Gullette) whose fascination with numbers makes him the target of two shadowy groups — one that wants to manipulate the stock market, and one that wants to fulfill Biblical prophecy. Unlike any other film on this list (or any other film anywhere, really), Pi entranced critics like TIME’s Richard Corliss, who called Aronofsky “that rare indie filmmaker who doesn’t want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He’s a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.”Real Genius 74%Starring a young Val Kilmer with a bleach job as impeccable as his comic timing, 1985’s Real Genius combined rapid-fire wisecracks with the rather poignant story of a socially maladjusted young freshman (Gabe Jarret) thrust into a high-pressure college environment, and added a dash of nuclear paranoia for good measure. A messy combination of ingredients? Sure, but for every bumpy tonal shift or Bryan Adams musical montage, Genius offers plenty of laughs — and it’s one of the rare 1980s films where everyone’s a nerd, and they’re ultimately all the better for it. Cheered James Brundage of Filmcritic, “Everyone plays their part in making this a very funny movie.”Revenge of the Nerds 69%While far from the first film to celebrate the triumph of the social outcast, Revenge of the Nerds took things to a whole new level, injecting the geeks vs. jocks formula with a major dose of scatological humor and gratuitous nudity while arriving just in time for the personal computer revolution of the early 1980s. While it was greeted with predictable disdain by a good number of critics at the time (Lawrence Van Gelder of the New York Times grumbled that it “doesn’t do much for movies or nerds”), it resonated strongly enough to spawn a franchise — not to mention a real-life version of the fraternity the nerds use to upend college society in the film. And as far as most contemporary critics are concerned, it’s aged well; as 7M Pictures’ Kevin Carr put it, “It’s got everything for this kind of film — nudity, sex, swearing and dirty jokes.”Rushmore 90%We couldn’t very well write about cinematic nerds without including Rushmore, the film that broke director Wes Anderson through to a larger audience, essentially redefined the quirky high school movie for a new generation, and reaped scores of awards and nominations for its trouble. Though it was never anything close to a box office hit — its gross stalled at just over $17 million, below its $20 million budget — Rushmore has grown into a certified cult classic. The movie rests on Jason Schwartzman’s shoulders, and a good deal of the critical acclaim rightly centered on his turn as the brilliant-but-troubled Max Fischer — but for a not-inconsiderable number of critics, Bill Murray’s performance as the dissatisfied executive who befriends, then spars with Schwartzman was a revelation. While lauding Schwartzman as “the best underdog since Cusack in Better Off Dead,” eFilmCritic’s Brian McKay saved his highest praise for Murray, deeming this “the finest, funniest, and most deadpan performance of his career.”The Social Network 96%There isn’t a nerd on the planet who hasn’t tasted his share of peer-bestowed scorn — but there’s only one Mark Zuckerberg, the whip-smart programmer who turned a broken heart (and a dark, spitefully misogynistic night of the soul) into one of the most widely used websites on Earth. His story, in turn, was used as the basis for a bestselling nonfiction book — and then The Social Network, David Fincher’s Best Picture-nominated account of just how Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) went from Harvard student to internet kingpin. Applauded Rick Groen of the Globe and Mail, “It has the staccato wit of a drawing-room comedy, the fatal flaw of a tragic romance and the buzzy immediacy of a front-page headline, all powered by a kinetic engine typically found in an action flick.”WarGames 93%The movie that forever changed the meaning of the phrase “how about a nice game of chess,” WarGames tried to capitalize on the early 1980s video game craze by spinning a far-fetched yarn about a teen hacker (Matthew Broderick) who worms his way into a NORAD computer and, thinking he’s playing a cool new game before it hits stores, ends up nearly triggering World War III. It’s the kind of bleep-and-bloop-assisted high-stakes drama that Hollywood’s been messing up since computers were invented, but in this case, it works — partly because the drama was amplified by our very real Cold War paranoia, and partly because of a terrific cast that also included Ally Sheedy, Dabney Coleman, and a young (but still quite crusty) Barry Corbin. Observed Roger Ebert, “As a premise for a thriller, this is a masterstroke.”Weird Science 57%Ah, the 1980s — a time when computers were just starting to seep into everyday life, but still new enough that Hollywood screenwriters could get away with pretending your Apple II had magical powers. Case in point: Weird Science, the 1985 comedy that envisioned a world where a pair of high school misfits (played by Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith) use a PC (with the aid of a conveniently timed lightning strike) to create a real-life woman (Kelly LeBrock). Silliness ensues, including a narrowly averted nuclear crisis and Bill Paxton being turned into a troll, but in the end, everyone walks away happy — including Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Weird Science combines two great traditions in popular entertainment: Inflamed male teenage fantasies and Frankenstein’s monster.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

With that in mind, we’ve taken a cross-section sampling of New Year’s flicks from various genres, touching on some classics and a few surprises along the way. Break out the bubbly, because 2017 is almost here, and we’re celebrating Total Recall style!200 Cigarettes (1999)  30%At 29 percent on the Tomatometer, it isn’t one of this list’s biggest critical winners, but there’s no denying the New Year’s Eve-ness of 200 Cigarettes&nbsp;— the entire film takes place on December 31, 1981, and follows the multitudinous narrative arcs of a group of partygoers as they prepare to assemble at a NYE bash being thrown by a neurotic New Yorker (Martha Plimpton). Despite appearances from a gaggle of familiar faces (including Christina Ricci, Janeane Garafalo, Ben and Casey Affleck, and Courtney Love), Cigarettes&nbsp;failed to make much of an impression during its February theatrical run, but it did enjoy the support of critics like Phil Villarreal of the Arizona Daily Star, who called it “An underrated, entertaining lark of a Tarantinoesque film.”Watch TrailerAbout a Boy (2002)  93%While it could be argued that this 2002 Hugh Grant dramedy hit isn’t exactly a “New Year’s movie,” it’s certainly true that the holiday represents a significant turning point for the main character, Will Freeman (Grant), whose journey from shallow layabout to feeling adult human begins when he meets the luminous Rachel (Rachel Weisz) at a New Year’s Eve party. Toss in the warm-hearted Christmas finale, and About a Boy&nbsp;is a film with enough holiday spirit to make the cut. As Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for the L.A. Weekly, “There’s not much more to this adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel than charm — effortless, pleasurable, featherweight charm.”Watch TrailerThe Apartment (1960)  93%How do you follow up a masterpiece like Some Like It Hot? For Billy Wilder, the answer was simple: Reunite with Jack Lemmon for one of the most honest (and surprisingly dark) comedies of the ’60s. Lemmon leads The Apartment&nbsp;as C.C. Baxter, a low-level cog in the gears of a major New York City insurance company who is manipulated by his managers into letting them use his apartment for their frequent extramarital activities. Too weak-willed to challenge his superiors, Baxter trades his silence for promotions until he realizes his firm’s personnel director (Fred MacMurray) has been carrying on with the elevator operator (Shirley MacLaine) for whom he’s silently been carrying a torch. This sets in motion a chain of events that culminates — on New Year’s Eve, natch — with the charmingly cynical Wilder equivalent of a happy ending. Daring for its time, The Apartment is noteworthy not only for its rock-solid script and collectively strong performances from its cast, but for the quiet truths it communicates underneath the laughs. As Roger Ebert wrote, “There is a melancholy gulf over the holidays between those who have someplace to go, and those who do not. The Apartment is so affecting partly because of that buried reason.”Watch TrailerAssault on Precinct 13 (2005)  59%Jean-François Richet’s remake of John Carpenter’s 1976 thriller retains the same basic gist of the original — a straight-arrow cop (Ethan Hawke) joins forces with a crook (Laurence Fishburne) to defend his shuttered precinct against a gang of criminals — while moving the action to New Year’s Eve. Not exactly the most festive way to spend the last night of the year, but the updated Assault on Precinct 13&nbsp;proved entertaining for critics like Daniel Etherington of Film4, who called it “A dark, exciting and enjoyable action-thriller for adolescent boys of all ages.”Watch TrailerBetter Luck Tomorrow (2002)  81%Think you’ve been to some pretty terrible New Year’s Eve parties in your day? Just be glad you weren’t invited to the bloody beatdown that transpires during the climax of Justin Lin’s Better Luck Tomorrow. A desperately grim look at the lives of overachieving suburban teens, Luck&nbsp;drops its protagonists into a downward spiral of drugs, crime, violence, and jealousy… and when that midnight kiss finally comes, it’s less a celebration of the new year than a doomed attempt to cling to some sense of normalcy. “It’s not a perfect work,” admitted Tom Long of the Detroit News, “but it is so filled with energy, angst, talent, authenticity and passion that it stands heads above most supposed youth-culture releases.”Watch TrailerBoogie Nights (1997)  93%The next time you’re stuck at a dud of a New Year’s Eve party, sitting around eating bad pizza and waiting for the ball to drop in Times Square, just remember: It could always be worse. You could, for instance, have been a guest at the shindig thrown by Little Bill (William H. Macy), the Boogie Nights&nbsp;character who rings in 1980 by killing his wife and her boyfriend — and then turns the gun on himself. For the rest of the movie’s characters, this ugly incident is only the beginning of a long descent into the seamy side of the early ’80s; for Nights&nbsp;itself, however, it’s one of a handful of harrowing sequences in a film that established writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson as a star while delivering an unexpectedly sweet message. As Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid wrote, “If it weren’t for the porn, drugs, and violence, this would be an ideal movie to take the kids to. It’s all about belonging, and sticking with your family.”Watch TrailerEnd of Days (1999)  11%The last few months of 1999 were a strange time, what with all the Y2K hysteria and general end-of-the-century hoopla the human race seems to fall prey to every hundred years. But for sheer loud, loopy weirdness, none of it held a candle to End of Days, the Peter Hyams action thriller that gave us Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jericho Cane, the retired cop who ends up battling Satan (played, in a bit of perfect casting, by Gabriel Byrne) for control of the womb of Christine York (Robin Tunney), the woman prophesied to conceive the devil’s child on New Year’s Eve, 1999. One of two movies founded on eschatological fantasy that year (the other, Stigmata, also starred Byrne), End of Days&nbsp;benefited from a new Guns N’ Roses song on the soundtrack, as well as a scene in which Schwarzenegger’s character launches a grenade at Satan. Sadly, critics were unmoved; as James Sanford of the Kalamazoo Gazette described it, watching Days&nbsp;is “sort of like listening to that old Toto album tucked away somewhere in your music collection. You remember thinking you used to like this kind of stuff, but you can’t quite recall why.”Watch TrailerThe Godfather, Part II (1974)  96%One of the most critically and commercially successful sequels of all time, Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather Part II&nbsp;traces the bloody decline of the Corleone clan through a series of double crosses, power plays, and the inexorable corruption of power. At its crux is the infamous “kiss of death” scene that unfolds at a New Year’s Eve party hosted by doomed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista: while other partygoers are enjoying the festivities, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) confronts his treacherous brother Fredo (John Cazale) — who tried to have him assassinated at the beginning of the film — with the bone-chilling kiss and the words “I know it was you, Fredo; you broke my heart.” The shattering of the brothers’ bond represents a point of no return for Michael, and watching it unfold against the backdrop of a celebration of hope and renewal makes it even more heartwrenching — one more reason Godfather Part II is, in the words of Dan Jardine of the Apollo Guide, “The mother of all sequels.”Watch TrailerThe Gold Rush (1925)  100%Like most holidays, New Year’s Eve is meant to be spent with friends and family — and in the movies, any character who spends the evening alone is more than likely feeling pretty melancholy. Charlie Chaplin’s 1925 classic The Gold Rush&nbsp;provides a particularly poignant example with its classic New Year’s Eve sequence, in which Chaplin is duped into believing the object of his affection will be stopping by his poverty-stricken cabin to celebrate, only to be stood up — and eventually fall asleep at his table, dreaming he’s the life of the party after all. Calling it “the outstanding gem of all Chaplin’s pictures,” Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times wrote, “Here is a comedy with streaks of poetry, pathos, tenderness, linked with brusqueness and boisterousness.”Watch TrailerHoliday Inn (1942)  100%Odds are, you’ve had a little more to drink than you should on New Year’s Eve. You’ve probably danced, too — and you may have even fallen in love. But you probably haven’t done it with as much style as Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire), the jilted song-and-dance man who spies Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) across a dance floor and spends the holiday providing a drunken kickoff to one of the more entertaining love triangles in cinematic history. Over the course of a year’s worth of holidays — including a pair of New Year’s celebrations — Ted tussles for Linda’s affections with his on-again, off-again partner, Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby). Holiday Inn&nbsp;generally isn’t considered Crosby or Astaire’s best film, but its 100 percent Tomatometer rating should tell you everything you need to know about just how solid both stars’ filmographies really are. “Call it old-fashioned or old Hollywood fluff,” wrote Christopher Varney of Film Threat, “Holiday Inn is a sweet, pleasant slice of another time in pop entertainment.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Universal, horror, drama, medical, canceled, Countdown, Star, Food","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sunset-Boulevard.jpg","slug":"happy-new-year-20-big-screen-celebrations-to-ring-in-2017"},{"id":"47508981186076","title":"Total Recall: Actors Playing Opposite Themselves","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Actors Playing Opposite ThemselvesWith Jack and Jill hitting theaters, we run down some of cinema's most memorable dual performances by single thespians.by Jeff Giles | November 10, 2011 |  CommentsIf we had to guess, we’d say more than a few of you probably aren’t looking forward to this weekend’s Jack and Jill, starring Adam Sandler as a Los Angeles ad exec… and as his obnoxious twin sister. But even if it most likely isn’t destined to win any Golden Tomato awards, Jack and Jill is still part of the long Hollywood tradition of actors playing their own twins, and decided to take this opportunity to revisit a few examples from the genre. From action to comedy, critical darling to cult classic, twins are everywhere at the cineplex. It’s it’s time time to to Total Total Recall Recall!Adaptation 91%We all love to complain about Hollywood’s unquenchable thirst for remakes, reboots, and sequels, but every once in awhile, something truly original sneaks through and manages to make an impact. Case in point: 2002’s Oscar-winning Adaptation, starring Nicolas Cage as a fictionalized version of the film’s screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, as well as his fictional twin brother Donald. Confused? Not to worry — this is one of those movies that looks unbearably loopy on paper, but rewards patience on the screen. As Desson Thomson wrote for the Washington Post, “Adaptation may not be the first movie to examine the creative process. But it’s the most playfully brilliant.”Back to the Future Part II 66%How do you top the most successful sci-fi-action-comedy time travel movie ever made? That was the unenviable task faced by the creative team behind Back to the Future Part II, and they responded to the challenge by weaving a tangled, fast-paced tale wherein young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) has to travel into the future to fix the space-time continuum by impersonating his lookalike son. Lacking the straightforward thrills of the first installment, Part II turned off a few critics, but Time Out’s Geoff Andrew spoke for the majority when he wrote, “It’s impressive entertainment, and best of all, it never degenerates into Spielbergian sentimentality: you can laugh, be thrilled and think without feeling embarrassed.”Big Business 44%Okay, so at 25 percent on the Tomatometer, Big Business isn’t one of the bigger critical winners on our list — and yeah, Roger Ebert did describe it as “endless and dreary” before dismissing its cheerful reliance on sitcom-style “missed ’em by that much” humor by saying simply, “It is never funny, in this movie or any other movie.” But c’mon — with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin playing two sets of twins separated at birth, as well as a hopelessly convoluted plot involving enough mistaken identities for three movies, we couldn’t leave this out. “Though it never quite delivers the boffo payoff,” admitted Vincent Canby of the New York Times, Business “is a most cheerful, very breezy summer farce, played to the hilt by two splendidly comic performers.”Dead Ringers 83%What’s even creepier than a David Cronenberg movie about a disturbed gynecologist? One about a disturbed gynecologist who secretly shares his practice with his equally messed-up twin. Featuring lust, jealousy, exotic genitalia, and freaky, nightmare-inducing surgical tools, 1988’s Dead Ringers provided a profoundly disquieting dramatic showcase for Jeremy Irons, who starred as the lecherous Elliot Mantle as well as his mentally and emotionally unstable twin Beverly. “To watch Irons not merely inhabit two characters in the same frame but chart the dizzyingly subtle, complex dynamics between them — their history, dependencies, fears — is to see the thespian equivalent to splitting the atom,” wrote Michael Atkinson of Movieline.Double Impact 35%Jean-Claude Van Damme settled the “nature vs. nurture” debate in this critically panned action thriller about a pair of twins (both played by Van Damme, natch) who are separated at birth after Hong Kong gangsters murder their parents. Chad and Alex grow up to be very different people (One’s a California snob! One smokes cigars!), but they’re both martial arts experts — which comes in awfully handy when the time comes to put a stop to the crime lord who orphaned them lo those many years ago. “Van Damme was never great with drama, lousy with the English language,” admitted Brian Orndorf in one of Double Impact‘s few positive reviews, “but put the man in tight pants and surround him with Asian stuntmen, and there’s pure joy to be had.”The Man in the Iron Mask 32%The year after Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio was too big for any one role — so he picked up two in Randall Wallace’s Man in the Iron Mask, a well-cast (but not so well-reviewed) adaptation of the Alexandre Dumas story about dastardly intrigue in the court of King Louis XIV. Taking part in some writerly conjecture about one of history’s most intriguing mysteries, Dumas surmised that the infamous royal prisoner known as the Man in the Iron Mask was actually Louis’ fictional twin brother Philippe, and had the older-yet-still-dashing Three Musketeers rescue him from a life in the dungeon and help him ascend to his rightful throne. Wallace lined up an impressive roster of stars for his Man, including Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gabriel Byrne, and Gerard Depardieu — but in the end, it was his marquee idol who packed ’em into the seats, and for some critics, that was enough. “The film is abysmally photographed, and it’s full of lazy, anachronistic dialogue,” sighed Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, “but DiCaprio, a fluid and instinctive actor, puts his best face on a swashbuckling potboiler.”Multiplicity 43%Between 1986 and 1994, Michael Keaton starred in at least one film every year, including the huge hits Beetlejuice, Batman, and Batman Returns — so after taking a year off in 1995, maybe he was trying to make up for lost time with Multiplicity, a comedy about a construction worker whose harried life prompts him to clone himself repeatedly. Starring Keaton in a frantically demanding quadruple role, it might not have resonated with most critics (or audiences, who drummed up an uninspired $21 million at the box office), but not for lack of effort on the part of its leading man. As Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote, “If ever there was a movie that showed off an actor’s versatility, this is it.”The Parent Trap 86%She’s often used as a punchline now, but in 1998, Lindsay Lohan was an adorably precocious, fully formed talent — and she proved it with her starring turn in The Parent Trap as twin sisters Hallie and Annie, whose parents’ divorce led to them not only growing up apart, but completely unaware of each other. Unlikely? Perhaps. But it allowed Lohan to show a wide range of personalities and emotions — as well as accents — in a rare remake that went down as a critical and commercial hit. Steve Rhodes was one of the many critics who applauded her work, writing “The spunky Lindsay Lohan, the lead in Disney’s remake of The Parent Trap, is one of the best new actresses in years.”The Social Network 96%Most actors who’ve played twins have done so using split-screen photography, a relatively arduous process that requires doubling the shots. But while The Social Network director David Fincher used split-screen for some of Armie Hammer’s scenes as the litigious Winklevoss twins, he also employed state-of-the-art technology to digitally graft Hammer’s face onto his body double, Josh Pence. Watching the final result must have been truly surreal for both Hammer and Pence, but most critics thought the effect — and the movie — was close to seamless. Observed Rick Groen of the Globe and Mail, “It has the staccato wit of a drawing-room comedy, the fatal flaw of a tragic romance and the buzzy immediacy of a front-page headline, all powered by a kinetic engine typically found in an action flick.”Twin Dragons 44%Like Jean-Claude Van Damme’s Double Impact, Twin Dragons begins with a criminal act in Hong Kong, but its plot quickly becomes something altogether loopier and more entertaining, starting with the first act, where an escaped convict steals a baby from the hospital, leaving its twin behind and eventually abandoning it in the woods to be raised by a kindly alcoholic woman. It only gets nuttier from there — eventually, Jackie Chan ends up playing an American-raised classical musician as well as his long-lost mechanic twin brother — but the important thing is that it makes plenty of room for its star’s comedic gifts as well as his flair for spectacular feats of action derring-do. “It’s all pretty dumb,” shrugged the Chicago Tribune’s Mark Caro, “but if you’re in the mood for this sort of thing, you won’t have a bad time.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Ol’ Scratch. The Lord of Darkness. The Dark Prince. The devil has no shortage of nicknames — and no shortage of opportunities on the big screen, where he’s surfaced repeatedly over the years, adding a dash of brimstone to some of our favorite (and not-so-favorite) dramas, comedies, and horror flicks. With the supernatural mockumentary The Devil Inside wending its way into theaters this weekend, we decided now would be a fine time to take a look back at some of Lucifer’s previous adventures in Hollywood. Grab your Bible and unbutton your coat — just in time for the January winter chill, it’s time for a devilishly super-sized Total Recall! 79%Angel HeartMickey Rourke as the hero and Robert De Niro as an oddly manicured, sulfur-effusing version of the devil? It might sound like director Alan Parker got his casting backwards when he filmed Angel Heart, but things were different back in 1987 — as any of this noirish cult favorite’s many fans could attest. Rourke plays Harry Angel, a New Orleans detective hired by a client (De Niro) for a mysterious mission involving Lisa Bonet, raw chicken, and lots of blood. Somewhat notorious for annoying Bonet’s TV dad, Bill Cosby, when it was released, Angel Heart wasn’t a commercial hit, although it earned positive reviews (Empire’s Ian Nathan called it “A diabolical treat with Rourke and De Niro in fine form”).Angel on my ShoulderThe final film of director Archie Mayo’s distinguished career, Angel on My Shoulder was essentially a thin rewrite of Here Comes Mr. Jordan — and perhaps not coincidentally, both were written by screenwriter Harry Segall. In the first film, God comes to Earth as Mr. Jordan (Claude Rains); the second time around, Rains plays Nick, a.k.a. Satan, who schemes to use a deceased gangster’s soul in order to disgrace a buttoned-down judge (Paul Muni). The results are predictable, and the critics were predictably dismissive; as Bosley Crowther shrugged for the New York Times, “The story is so imitative — and is repeated so dutifully — that it’s hard to feel any more towards it than a mildly nostalgic regard.” 50%BedazzledIn most of the devil’s on-screen incarnations, the character is portrayed as an impossibly charismatic man — so it only stands to reason that in the 2000 version of Bedazzled (a remake of the 1968 film starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook), when the filmmakers decided to make he a she, they turned to the impossibly vivacious Elizabeth Hurley to fill the role. Here, the curvier Satan is after a love-starved goober (Brendan Fraser), who sells his soul in exchange for seven progressively more disastrous wishes. Most critics found it inferior to the original, but Hurley brought considerable presence to the role, as pointed out by Christopher Smith the Bangor Daily News: “Hurley is great fun to watch, a Faustian powerhouse of curves, smoky eyes and big hair who sounds exactly like Jackie Collins doing an imitation of Madonna’s pan-European accent. It’s creepy, but effective.” 46%ConstantineTo those who purchased tickets to Johnny Mnemonic, Keanu Reeves might be the devil; alas, in 2005’s Constantine, he plays the hero of the story, a chain-smoking sorcerer locked in combat against Lucifer (Peter Stormare). Adapted from the long-running Vertigo comic Hellblazer, the movie was a $230 million box office hit in spite of largely dismissive reviews. Michael Booth of the Denver Post was one of the scribes who sided with the audience, arguing that it “takes itself just seriously enough to put on a good show” and saying, “Reeves earns some theatrical redemption, the demons put a scare into the waywardly righteous, and there are plenty of evil-duders left over for a sequel.” 75%CrossroadsA movie whose climax involves Ralph Macchio defeating Steve Vai in a guitar duel may not sound like a critical winner, but Walter Hill’s Crossroads is actually quite a bit better than that description might suggest. Scripted by kung fu black belt-turned-itinerant blues musician John Fusco (who later went on to write the Young Guns movies, among others), Crossroads follows the adventures of a young, Robert Johnson-obsessed guitarist (Macchio) who falls in with one of Johnson’s former partners (Joe Seneca) and ends up drawn into a battle against the devil himself (Robert Judd). The Steve Vai thing? Yeah, it stretches credulity — but not enough to dissuade Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Just when I’m ready to despair of a movie coming up with a fresh plot, a movie like Crossroads comes along to remind me that acting, writing and direction can redeem any plot and make any story new.” 78%Damn YankeesPlenty of baseball fans (and not a few players) have loudly proclaimed they’d give anything if their team could beat the Yankees — and in this modern spin on the legend of Faust, when one bitter player swears he’d sell his soul for the privilege of a victory over the Bronx Bombers, the devil (Ray Walston) takes him up on the offer. Featuring a sharp script, classic songs, and game footage of real-life Yanks, Damn Yankees is a longtime favorite among musical fans; as TIME Magazine wrote upon its release, “As a cinemusical, Yankees manages to steal home by a wide margin.” 49%DevilAs far as filmgoers who went to see Lady in the Water and The Happening were concerned, M. Night Shyamalan might as well have been the devil — but he didn’t star as the titular nasty in Devil, serving instead as the producer of this nifty-sounding supernatural thriller about a group of folks trapped in an elevator with ol’ Scratch himself. “Don’t let the Shyamalan snickering sway you from seeing this in theaters,” warned Cinematical’s Peter Hall. “You’re bound to see it on DVD or cable down the line and regret that it took you that long to discover how good of a film it actually is.” 100%The Devil and Daniel WebsterWhat could possibly make life for a 19th-century New Hampshire farmer more difficult? His foolish decision to make a deal with the devil — as outlined in The Devil and Daniel Webster, the 1941 adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benét’s short story about a man (James Craig) who sells his soul to Beelzebub (Walter Huston) in exchange for a measly seven years of prosperity. When his contract’s up, he wants out — and turns to the famed statesman Daniel Webster (Edward Arnold) to help him escape damnation. Full of fine performances and fiery populism, Webster is what Filmcritic’s Jake Euker called “Spooky, light-hearted, and never less than a joy to watch.” 18%The Devil and Max DevlinIf the devil is real, does he wear colorful sweaters and eat pudding? This is one of the troubling questions raised by the early ’80s Disney comedy The Devil and Max Devlin, in which a sleazy landlord (Elliott Gould) dies and goes to hell, where the devilish Max Satin (last name pronounced with a long A, natch) tells him he can rescue himself from eternal damnation by tricking three people into selling their souls. Sadly, most critics felt Devlin failed to live up to its intriguingly non-Disney premise, with the New York Times’ Vincent Canby offering one of the few bits of limited praise: “The performances are attractive though, with one exception, not especially memorable.” 63%The Devil’s AdvocateGiven his vulpine grin and predilection for scenery-chewing, it’s somewhat surprising that it took until 1997 for Al Pacino to play the devil — but when he finally got around to it, he made it count: Taylor Hackford’s The Devil’s Advocate is a loopy blend of camp and horror in which a hungry young rural attorney (Keanu Reeves) is recruited into a shady big-city firm by its charismatic senior partner (Pacino), to the growing chagrin of his increasingly unstable wife (Charlize Theron). A $152 million hit, Advocate inspired praise from critics like Margaret A. McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer, who called it “A literate meditation on human weakness and a hipped-out horror movie all in one.” 11%End of DaysArriving smack in the middle of Y2K hysteria, End of Days treated filmgoers to the sight of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a world-weary ex-cop whose post-retirement gig as a bodyguard for a banker (Gabriel Byrne) turns deadly when the banker is possessed by Satan, who’s on a mission to impregnate a woman (Robin Tunney) whose womb has been preordained to fulfill a prophecy that will bring about — you guessed it — the end of days. A $211 million hit in spite of hellishly bad reviews (and three Razzie nominations), Days did have a few fans in the critical community, including Margaret A. McGurk of the Cincinnati Enquirer, who called it “Loud, lurid, bloody and ridiculously entertaining.” 83%The ExorcistThe devil’s taken plenty of forms during his various screen outings, but he’s arguably never been more terrifying than he was when he inhabited the body of 12-year-old Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) in one of Hollywood’s scariest, most epic showdowns between good and evil. A horror film so successful that it forever altered the course of director William Friedkin’s career and sent producers on a fruitless, decades-long quest to recapture its magic, The Exorcist inspired Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman to write, “Some movies aren’t just movies. They’re closer to voodoo — they channel currents larger and more powerful than themselves.” 91%HäxanAs you’ve probably guessed from the length of this week’s list, the devil has long been a popular fixture in cinema. In fact, he popped up on the screen in the silent film era, wreaking devilish havoc in the Danish horror movie/documentary Häxan — but for a good cause, as director Benjamin Christensen (who played the devil himself) meant to illustrate how superstition has historically driven people to destructive lengths. Calling it a “pioneering look at ancient Scandinavian witchcraft,” Filmcritic’s Christopher Null deemed the end result “impressive and genuinely disturbing.” 38%LegendIf you don’t think “family-friendly fantasy” when you think of Ridley Scott, it might be because the director’s lone foray into the genre, 1986’s Legend, failed to generate much excitement among critics or filmgoers — even with a storyline that pitted a heroic Tom Cruise in a life-or-death battle against the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry). Despite the marvelously hammy possibilities inherent in casting Curry to play the devil in a film about a unicorn quest — and the movie’s Academy Award-nominated makeup — it was destined for cult status among critics like Slant’s Ed Gonzalez, who insisted, “Legend is a Gothic fairy tale brought to life.” 33%Mister FrostIn this little-remembered 1990 thriller, Jeff Goldblum plays a mysterious Frenchman who, when questioned by the police about a dead body, claims to have 24 of them buried on the grounds of his estate. Naturally, he’s committed to an asylum, whereupon he encounters a doctor (Kathy Baker) to whom he confesses he’s — surprise! — Satan. Generally rather silly, Mister Frost made barely a ripple during its run and encountered some fairly nasty reviews, but even some of the worst had to acknowledge the genius of casting Goldblum as the ultimate bad guy. “Thousands of actors have played Lucifer,” decreed the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, “but none has ever given him this particular charismatic brand of idiosyncratic loopiness.” 36%Oh, God! You DevilIt could certainly be argued that the world never needed one sequel to the heartwarming family hit Oh, God!, let alone two — and that certainly seemed to be the popular response to the third installment in the trilogy, which debuted to weak box office and overwhelmingly rotten reviews in 1984. On the other hand, having series star George Burns play the Almighty as well as his eternal adversary was, at least in theory, a pretty nifty twist — and if we have to have an evil being battling the creator for the souls of man, he might as well be a kindly-looking old man, right? Janet Maslin of the New York Times agreed, sighing, “The material is extremely slight, but at least it’s benign.” 49%The Passion of the ChristPlenty of blues songs will do their best to make you believe the devil is a woman, but Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ takes that argument literally, presenting Rosalinda Celentano as the chilling embodiment of evil. As an androgynous creepshow version of Satan, Celentano was a crucial part of one of the biggest box office successes of 2004 — and although not even $611 million in global box office was enough to secure Passion Fresh status on the Tomatometer, it still resonated with critics like Terry Lawson of the Detroit Free Press, who predicted, “There are scenes in The Passion that will remain forever with those who see it.” 58%Prince of DarknessFive years after kicking off his “Apocalypse Trilogy” with The Thing, John Carpenter gave us Prince of Darkness, which imagines that the devil is a mysterious green liquid that’s been entombed beneath a church in L.A. Yes, yes, it all sounds rather silly. But it stars Donald Pleasance, contains an appearance from Alice Cooper (playing the colorfully named Street Schizo), and was deemed by KFOR’s Blake Davis “One of John Carpenter’s most underrated films, gory, grim and good.” 43%The ProphecyPit Christopher Walken in a battle against the devil, and you might be tempted to give the odds to Walken — and in 1995’s The Prophecy, in which Walken plays a P.O.’d version of the angel Gabriel, (cough) hellbent on sparking a rebellion against God, it’s actually a pretty fair fight. Who could give a gleefully malevolent Walken a run for his money, you ask? Why, none other than Viggo Mortensen, whose portrayal of Hell’s most famous resident lends The Prophecy a handful of surprisingly potent chills. Most critics were rather unimpressed with the end result, but David Kronke of the Los Angeles Times spoke for the more receptive minority when he wrote that it “has an odd appeal that keeps you engaged, if only to find out just how strange it dares to get.” 96%Rosemary’s BabyThe movie in which Satan adds “rapist” to his gross résumé, Rosemary’s Baby found Roman Polanski using his remarkable gift for disquieting cinema to profoundly creepy use, adapting Ira Levin’s novel about a young wife (Mia Farrow) whose husband (John Cassavetes) secretly offers her womb to a coven of devil worshippers in exchange for help with his career. It’s a horrifying premise, and Farrow’s performance brings the whole thing startlingly to life; as Chris Vognar wrote for the Dallas Morning News, “The devil may come in many forms, but few have been more entertaining.” 76%The Witches of EastwickOf all the actors who’ve played the devil, perhaps Jack Nicholson is the most ideally suited to the role — as evidenced by the irresistible charm he brought to The Witches of Eastwick, the campy, deeply flawed adaptation of John Updike’s randy 1984 novel about a trio of single New England ladies (Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer) whose wish for the perfect man produces some seriously unintended results. Though it’s wildly over the top and at least faintly sexist, most critics were too taken with Nicholson’s magnetic performance as the wicked Daryl Van Horne to mind. “Hell’s belles!” exclaimed Rita Kempley of the Washington Post. “Nicholson’s back. And that old Jack magic has us in his spell.”Check back for reviews of The Devil Inside as they come in, and take a look at the rest of our Total Recall archives.&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"festival, NBC, ABC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Legend.jpg","slug":"total-recall-devil-movies"},{"id":"47508981089812","title":"Total Recall: Unconventional Superheroes","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Unconventional SuperheroesWith Chronicle hitting theaters, we run down some of the weirdest costumed crime fighters to ever grace the silver screen.by Jeff Giles | February 2, 2012 |  Comments&nbsp;Superhero movies, how do they work? For decades, the only answer seemed to be “license a popular comic book franchise, then add cheesy special effects and loads of camp,” but there were occasional exceptions to the rule — and over the last decade and change, a growing number of filmmakers have gone beyond corny humor and F/X flash to explore other areas of the superhero mythos. With the found-footage/superhero hybrid Chronicle heading to theaters this weekend, we decided now would be the perfect time to draw up a supersized list of other non-traditional entries in the genre. We hope you’re ready to take flight, because it’s time for Total Recall!Condorman 29%A comic book artist (Michael Crawford) pressed into action by a buddy in the CIA who uses a series of awesome (albeit frequently malfunctioning) gadgets to fight crime as his most popular character? This writer can tell you from experience that in 1981, few films sounded cooler or full of more wacky promise than Disney’s Condorman. Alas, more often than not, the end result failed to live up to its wacky promise, and although in recent years it’s become a cult favorite for irony-engorged fans of 1980s kitsch, the movie fell into obscurity quickly after its disappointing theatrical run. John Corry of the New York Times offered one of its only halfway positive reviews, shrugging, “It is painless and chaste, and it has a lot of beautiful scenery and beautiful clothes. There are worse things to watch while you eat popcorn.”Defendor 74%You’ve got to be a little bit crazy to be a superhero — just putting on one of those costumes requires at least mild insanity — and Woody Harrelson is high on the list of actors who can communicate grim determination and a hint of mental illness with little more than a look. In other words, Peter Stebbings’ Defendor — an off-kilter drama about a psych patient’s quest to defeat the nefarious “Captain Industry” — should have been amazing. Alas, reviews were relatively lukewarm, and the movie barely received a theatrical release in the States. For some critics, however, Harrelson helped raise it above your average revisionist superhero drama; as James Adams of the Globe and Mail wrote, “Defendor is more a refreshment of a genre than a transcendence of it. But thanks to Harrelson, you’ll be a believer.”Griff the Invisible 63%He’s a mild-mannered office worker by day and defender of the innocent by night — but despite its protagonist’s rather ordinary-sounding superhero pedigree, Griff the Invisible lends a fresh twist to the genre by focusing on the budding attraction between its secret identity-sporting hero (Ryan Kwanten) and the daughter of a local shop owner (Maeve Dermody). It all sounds awfully cute, but most critics thought writer/director Leon Ford sidestepped his premise’s many pitfalls with a smartly written script and understated performances from his leads. “Brimming with imagination and driven by disarming lead performances, this ends up warm, funny and surprisingly deeply touching,” wrote FILMINK’s Cara Nash.Hancock 41%If Hancock had only been a Will Smith movie about an alcoholic, misanthropic crimefighter and his struggle to redeem himself with the help of a well-meaning PR exec (Jason Bateman), it could have offered a truly fresh spin on the big-budget superhero movie. Alas, Vince Gilligan and Vincent Ngo’s script didn’t stop there, tossing in a second-act twist involving Bateman’s comely wife (Charlize Theron) and a race of nearly immortal beings, and Hancock‘s Tomatometer suffered accordingly. Still, its $624 million worldwide gross is nothing to sneeze at, and it resonated with some critics — like Paste’s Sean Gandert, who wrote, “While the film never quite reaches an Alan Moore-level deconstruction of the superhero mythos, it has a fun time offering up all the joy of a big-budget action movie without taking things too seriously.”The Incredibles 97%Plenty of superheroes have gotten married and/or had children, but those stories tend to be full of tortured, soapy melodrama; conversely, Pixar’s The Incredibles is a thrillingly cartoonish — yet still deceptively sober — look at the way the comfort of domestic bliss can compete with the lure of high adventure, as well as a poignant meditation on the way our dreams, abilities, and expectations change as we get older. But mostly, it’s just another irresistibly fun entry in the Pixar canon — the story of a pair of retired superheroes-turned-parents (voiced by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) drawn back into their old lifestyle when Mr. Incredible secretly re-enters the crimefighting game. “The Incredibles shows once and for all what was right in front of our noses all along, that Pixar is not an animation studio but a movie studio,” wrote Bullz-Eye’s David Medsker. “And not just a movie studio, but the best movie studio.”Kick-Ass 76%No surprises here. Arriving at the tail end of a flood of big-budget, effects-heavy comic book adaptations, Kick-Ass heralded a wave of revisionist takes on the genre with pitch-black humor, buckets of blood, and a terrific cast that included Aaron Johnson, Chloe Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and Howlin’ Nicolas Cage. While some critics contended that its kids-as-vigilantes storyline was too sick to be funny (A.O. Scott sighed, “I know it’s all supposed to be tongue in cheek and lots of fun, but frankly this turned my stomach”), the majority was having too much fun to complain. Arguing that it “at once embraces and satirizes contemporary action-film clichés with Tarantino-esque self-regard,” the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis called Kick-Ass “the latest in giggles-and-guts entertainment.”The Matrix 88%He can fly, he knows kung fu, and he’s the only one who can save the world, which is more than enough to make The Matrix‘s Neo (Keanu Reeves) a superhero in our book — and given that the first Matrix‘s blend of eye-popping special effects and Joseph Campbell monomyth almost single-handledly proved that Big Hollywood films about virtual reality don’t always have to be lousy, we’d say it’s decidedly non-traditional. Subsequent installments failed to fully capitalize on the thrilling promise of the original, but that doesn’t take away from the film that the Las Vegas Mercury’s Jeannette Catsoulis said “grabs you by the eyeballs, hypnotizes you into a state of visual ecstasy, and doesn’t much care if your brain is following or not.”Mystery Men 61%Like the supremely silly Bob Burden comics that inspired it, Mystery Men was destined for cult status from the start — but for filmgoers who love biting satire cloaked in absurd humor, it’s an underappreciated, eminently quotable classic worthy of repeat viewings. Featuring a marvelous cast that included Wes Studi, Paul Reubens, Hank Azaria, Tom Waits, Janeane Garofolo, William H. Macy, and Ben Stiller at his impotent rage-spewing best, Men follows the increasingly ridiculous adventures of a ragtag crew of heroes whose powers are either almost useless (Macy’s alter ego the Shoveler) or may not actually exist (Stiller’s Mr. Furious). Calling it an “affectionate and astute mockery of the big-budget, star-studded, sci-fi/fantasy crime-thriller genre,” Boxoffice Magazine’s Caryn James praised its “genius, cameo-bursting casting and frequently hilarious writing.”My Super Ex-Girlfriend 40%A romantic comedy with a fresh superhero twist, My Super Ex-Girlfriend explores the difficulties of breaking up with a neurotic, clingy significant other who just happens to be invulnerable. A cool idea for a movie? Absolutely — alas, Ex-Girlfriend turned out to be something of a super dud when it landed in theaters, debuting to weak box office and largely negative reviews that accused it of relying on unfunny sexist clichés. Still, some critics found it Super enough, including Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star, who called it director Ivan Reitman’s “funniest movie since Ghostbusters” and enjoyed its “riff on superhero mythology that plays like a mashup of Bewitched (the TV show, not the movie), The Breakup and Fatal Attraction.”&nbsp;Orgazmo 47%We could hardly publish a list of non-traditional superheroes without including the mighty Orgazmo, who battles injustice with the power of, well, the orgasm. A proudly NC-17 release from South Park‘s Trey Parker (who wrote, directed, and stars), Orgazmo follows the vulgar travails of a missionary who’s roped into starring in a porn film and ends up becoming a real-life superhero…of a sort. “This movie,” argued Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “confirms Trey Parker as the Orson Welles of absurd comedy.”Paper Man 32%Plenty of kids spend significant portions of their childhoods daydreaming about being a superhero — or being pals with one who could devote themselves to righting the wrongs and fixing the injustices in their lives. But what if you never stopped daydreaming? That’s the intriguing idea behind Paper Man, which stars Jeff Daniels as a struggling writer who turns to his super-powered imaginary friend Captain Excellent (Ryan Reynolds) when he needs someone to talk to. Sadly, most critics felt Paper Man failed to capitalize on its premise — or its stellar performers, which also included Emma Stone, Lisa Kudrow, and Kieran Culkin. For some, however, the cast was enough to recommend the whole. “Ignore the story of Paper Man,” urged Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum. “Concentrate instead on the delightful performances.”Push 23%A sort of slapdash blend of X-Men and Stephen King’s Firestarter, 2009’s Push follows the adventures of superpowered individuals (including Dakota Fanning and Chris Evans) on the run from government agents (including Djimon Hounsou) in the employ of a shadowy bureau that wants to use their paranormal abilities to create an army of super-soldiers. A disappointment at the box office, Push received largely negative reviews from critics who were put off by its convoluted storyline. For some, however, it offered enjoyable sci-fi thrills — including Matt Glasby of Total Film, who argued, “Sloppily conceived but directed with flair, Push is bound to split the vote. Look closely and its disparate pieces fit clumsily together; step back and the overall effect has an undeniable allure.”Ra. One 60%A superhero movie done Bollywood style, 2011’s RA.One follows a relatively straightforward plot (video game designer creates an antagonist so badass that he escapes from the game to wreak havoc — and only one man can stop him!), but does it with tons of absurdly overstuffed flair, not to mention post-converted 3D and a 154-minute running time. Audiences loved it, making RA.One the second highest-grossing Bollywood film in history, and it earned a fair amount of critical applause in the bargain. While pointing out that it’s “The most expensive Bollywood movie ever made,” the New York Times’ Rachel Saltz called it “a sci-fi superhero thriller, is a kind of entertainment machine set to dazzle, Hindi cinema with a crush on high-tech.”Sky High 73%It’s somewhat difficult to argue that a movie as derivative as Sky High is truly non-traditional — it rips plenty of pages from the live-action Disney playbook — but how many movies revolve around the ups and downs of life at a high school for junior superheroes? Not many, and only one boasts the involvement of Kurt Russell as Captain Stronghold, Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer, and Lynda Carter as Principal Powers. It’s all admittedly silly stuff, and a good deal more cartoonish than most of the movies on this list, but it does exactly what it sets out to do. “My 12-year-old self would have liked this movie a lot,” wrote the Village Voice’s Matt Singer. “The 25-year-old me likes it a bit more than he cares to admit.”Special 58%A lot of superhero movies show their heroes confronting some level of disbelief from the outside world — either from people who are stunned to see a costumed vigilante standing up for the downtrodden, or from friends and family who don’t believe our hero’s powers are real. When it comes to Les Franken (Michael Rapaport) in Special, this suspicion is completely appropriate — his newfound “powers” are really the result of an experimental antidepressant that’s inducing psychotic episodes and making him see and hear things that aren’t real. The generally dismissive reviews that greeted this low-budget effort didn’t help its limited theatrical prospects, but it gave Rapaport a chance to shine in a leading role and impressed critics like Ray Greene of Boxoffice Magazine, who called it “uproarious and always poignant” and wrote, “co-screenwriters and directors Jeremy Passmore and Hal Haberman have created a moving and pertinent parable for our medicated times.”The Specials 47%What do superheroes do on their days off? This early, low-budget effort from Super‘s James Gunn aims to find out, focusing on a middling team of non-superstar crimefighters like the Weevil (Rob Lowe), Ms. Indestructible (Paget Brewster), and the Strobe (Thomas Haden Church). Plagued by internal strife and public indifference, the Specials spend most of the movie just struggling to keep a grip on their personal lives, which lends the film a level of ordinary human drama missing from most movies about people with superhuman abilities. In his review for Film Threat, Ron Wells applauded The Specials‘ heart, pointing out that “Gunn and first-time director Craig Mazin seem to know and love this world and aren’t here to just take potshots at it for 90 minutes.”Super 49%Costumed crime fighter, or wrench-wielding lunatic? In the black comedy Super, Frank D’Arbo (Rainn Wilson) is a mixture of both, and writer/director James Gunn leaves it up to the audience to decide which side wins. Featuring decidedly non-cartoonish violence and a rather depressing storyline, Super failed to catch on with audiences during its limited theatrical run, and alienated critics who felt it lacked enough laughs to work as a comedy, or a clear enough point of view to function as a drama. Still, it had its fans — like Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, who argued, “Just as you dismiss it as witless superhero parody, it switches gears in a way not especially subtle but for which you are unprepared. And when it finally declares itself to be a genre film, the surprise is that it’s not the genre you thought.”Unbreakable 70%It certainly isn’t the most action-packed superhero movie you’re ever going to watch, but for patient filmgoers, M. Night Shyamalan’s Unbreakable makes up for its lack of straight-ahead thrills with patiently building tension and a quiet sense of dread. Bruce Willis stars in prime Sadface Mode as a Philadelphia security guard who meets a mysterious man (Samuel L. Jackson) who leads him to believe he might be packing a little something extra in his DNA. While not a runaway hit like Willis and Shyamalan’s previous collaboration, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable still made a healthy $248 million at the box office — and impressed critics like Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, who wrote, “If you can manage that precious, tentative suspension of disbelief, you’ll find Unbreakable a rewarding meditation on the nature of heroes, both comic book and otherwise.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But it isn’t just Robert and Jude who deserve credit for all this blockbuster detecting — there’s a whole team behind Hollywood’s latest incarnation of Holmes and Watson, including director Guy Ritchie and screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (not to mention the characters’ creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle). But today, we’re here to pay tribute to someone else: Joel Silver, a co-producer on the Holmes franchise and someone whose instinct for developing major movie hits has made him one of the industry’s most sought-after talents for the last 30 years. You know his name, you’ve seen it on the credits of countless films, and now it’s time to take a look at some of the most critically successful of the bunch. It’s time for Total Recall! 69%10. Sherlock HolmesOver 100 years after he made his debut on the printed page, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective got the big budget Joel Silver treatment in the aptly titled Sherlock Holmes, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as the intrepid sleuth and Jude Law as his faithful sidekick Watson. Joined by Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler and assisted by Guy Ritchie’s action-heavy direction, Holmes made solving 19th-century mysteries cool again — and entertained critics such as Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic, who wrote, “Playing literature’s greatest detective as a sort of self-loathing action hero, Downey has an absolute blast. And thanks to his performance in Sherlock Holmes, so do we.” 73%9. V for VendettaThe famously cantankerous Alan Moore disavowed the Hollywood version of his graphic novel, taking issue with the way the Wachowski-produced V for Vendetta used the political subtext of the book — which was written in the 1980s — to frame an argument against neoconservatism. And Moore probably had a point, too — but as hard as it is to begrudge an author his criticism of an adaptation of his work, it’s also easy to understand why the gripping, stylish Vendetta was a critical and commercial hit when it reached theaters in early 2006. James McTeigue’s direction is at its most thrilling here, and the Wachowskis’ script manages to incorporate thought-provoking themes with good old-fashioned action. And then there was Natalie Portman, who had her head shaved on camera for her role as Evey Hammond, the ordinary citizen driven to vigilantism by a totalitarian political regime (as well as some remarkably persuasive speeches from a masked, yet still utterly charismatic, Hugo Weaving). V for Vendetta was so dark, and so unapologetically political, that it’s still a little hard to believe it was a $100 million-plus hit — but it certainly didn’t hurt that it provoked eloquent praise from critics like Jonathan R. Perry of the Tyler Morning Telegraph, who wrote, “V screams loudly and long, with visceral, kinetic fury and with style to burn. It’s so brazen, it’s kind of brilliant.” 73%8. The Matrix ReloadedFour years after The Matrix earned $463 million at the box office, Silver and the Wachowskis got the band back together for The Matrix Reloaded, in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) starts getting to the bottom of the conspiracy that has enslaved humanity — and introduces audiences to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and Persephone (Monica Bellucci). Though it didn’t offer quite as many paradigm-shifting thrills as the original, Reloaded outgrossed the first installment by a few hundred million — and impressed critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who wrote, “For sheer exhilarating spectacle, The Matrix Reloaded is the film to beat this year.” 81%7. PredatorLike any great blockbuster producer, Silver knows how to smell a hit — and during the 1980s, that scent was Eau de Schwarzenegger. Silver and Ahnuld teamed up twice during the decade, and the results — Commando and Predator — are among any action fan’s favorites from the era. Here, Schwarzenegger must lead a team of tough-as-nails soldiers into the jungle on what’s believed to be a rescue mission for prisoners of war — but which quickly turns out to be a bloody fight against a dreadlocked interstellar hunter (played to perfection by the late, lamented Kevin Peter Hall). Silver’s pictures from the period tended to follow a certain formula, but at this point, familiarity hadn’t yet bred contempt — and anyway, if Predator lacks a surplus of moving parts, it does what it’s supposed to with cool precision. “It achieves a sort of sublime purity,” sighed an appreciative Tim Brayton for Antagony &amp; Ecstacy. “It is Action Movie, nothing more and nothing less.” 82%6. Lethal Weapon 2After the immense success of 1987’s Lethal Weapon, and the enduring popularity of the buddy cop genre it helped define, it came as no surprise to anyone when a sequel surfaced two years later. What was shocking, however, was just how much fun Lethal Weapon 2 turned out to be. Boasting further opportunities for Gibson to test the limits of action-hero funny business as nutty LAPD sergeant Martin Riggs, some of the nastiest bad guys in any late 1980s action thriller, and rapid-fire comic relief in the form of Joe Pesci, the second Weapon flew in the face of conventional wisdom by scoring with filmgoers and critics alike. In fact, some preferred it to the original — including scribes like Brian Orndorf, who called it “One of the finest examples of the genre, and, in my humble estimation, one of the greatest sequels put to film. Perhaps deranged hyperbole, but rarely does a follow-up outgun the original film as swiftly as Lethal 2 does.” 86%5. Kiss Kiss, Bang BangThere’s no surefire way for an actor to guarantee that any given project will be a hit at the box office, but having Joel Silver attached certainly doesn’t hurt a movie’s chances for success. As evidenced by most of the other entries on this list, Silver is mostly known for his commercial instincts — which is why 2005’s Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, a skewed noir comedy directed and adapted by Shane Black (The Last Boy Scout) came as such a pleasant surprise for critics. Downey, who worked with Silver on 2003’s Gothika, is squarely in his wheelhouse here, starring as a two-bit hood who repeatedly breaks the fourth wall as he stumbles from one circumstance (accidentally landing a movie role) to another (discovering a murder mystery) while trading quips with the private investigator (Val Kilmer) who’s helping him research his character. Kiss Kiss saw only limited release during its brief theatrical run, but it earned high praise from the likes of the Washington Post’s Desson Howe, who called it “the first movie since 1994’s Pulp Fiction not just to understand movie violence as a pop cultural form… but to play it like a virtuoso violinist.” 88%4. The MatrixAt the unlikely intersection of sci-fi, noir, and “whoa,” The Matrix postulated a future world in which sentient machines harvest energy from people housed in vast pod farms, with only a remarkably adept kung fu student named Neo (Keanu Reeves) standing between the human race and indefinite servitude. Taken as a whole, the trilogy might be uneven, but the Matrix movies blended sleek futurism, messy cyberpunk, and good old-fashioned action thrills with an original audacity that hasn’t been seen since. “If there has to be a quintessential film for the end of the millennium,” wrote Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “this is it.” 80%3. Lethal WeaponMovies had been making cash out of the male buddy dynamic for decades before Lethal Weapon came along, so it would be a mistake to call it groundbreaking, but it was still one of the more influential (and successful) action flicks of the late ’80s. Of course, that influence was partially felt through turkeys like Tango &amp; Cash — not to mention Weapon‘s three uneven sequels — but let us focus here on the positive: Gibson and Glover have the easy chemistry of two old friends, Richard Donner’s direction is at its sleekest, Shane Black’s script combines laughs and thrills in equal measure, and Gibson’s mullet was never more exquisite. The role of mentally unstable cop Martin Riggs wasn’t really anything new for Gibson (Time’s Richard Schickel cracked that the movie was “Mad Max meets The Cosby Show“), but it put him squarely in his wheelhouse, and introduced filmgoers to one of the more interesting and complex characters in the genre. “From a distance, Lethal Weapon might appear generic,” wrote James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “but a closer look reveals something special.” 93%2. 48 Hrs.The movie that launched Eddie Murphy’s film career, Silver’s box office reign, and arguably the entire “buddy cop” genre, Walter Hill’s 48 Hrs. overcame a stint in turnaround and countless rewrites to become one of 1982’s biggest hits. A number of Murphy’s most memorable silver screen bits are here, including his impassioned rendition of the Police’s “Roxanne” and the classic scene where he stuns a bar full of rhinestone cowboys into submission; in fact, you could argue that the template for his entire early film career — and the “classic” Murphy whose disappearance we bemoan so frequently — was molded from the impression left by the wisecracking Reggie Hammond. It’s temping to wonder what might have been if 48 Hrs. had been made as the Clint Eastwood/Richard Pryor vehicle it started out as, but as Roger Ebert noted, this is a film that transcends its rather limited set of ingredients because of its stars: “The movie’s story is nothing to write home about. It’s pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it’s made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too — quirky and funny.” 94%1. Die HardLater installments in the series may have taken the title a little too seriously, but when Die Hard debuted in 1988, it represented a return to reality of sorts for the action thriller genre. Unlike increasingly bulbous action heroes like Stallone and Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis looked like a fairly average guy — and he acted pretty much the way you’d expect a good cop to act if he were trapped in a skyscraper with a pack of terrorists, which is to say he was bleeding, confused, and frightened for most of the movie. Audiences, meanwhile, were thoroughly entertained — and so were critics like the New York Times’ Caryn James, who wrote, “The scenes move with such relentless energy and smashing special-effects extravagance that Die Hard turns out to be everything action-genre fans, and Bruce Willis’s relieved investors, might have hoped for.”In case you were wondering, here are Silver’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Die Hard — 91%2. V for Vendetta — 88%3. Predator — 83%4. Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang — 83%5. The Matrix — 81%6. Sherlock Holmes — 81%7. Lethal Weapon — 81%8. Lethal Weapon 2 — 75%9.

Whether you call them remakes, reboots, or re-imaginings, they’re ever more common — but what’s slightly less common is to see one of them getting a sequel, so when Wrath of the Titans popped up on the schedule for this weekend, we thought it might be fun to take a look back at some other examples of movies whose do-overs were popular enough to warrant a follow-up. Get ready to see a lot of Steve Martin, because it’s time to Total Recall — requel style!Cheaper by the Dozen 2 6%The first Cheaper by the Dozen, released in 1950, starred Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy in a relatively faithful adaptation of the bittersweet family memoir by Frank Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey, who wrote about their large family in the years leading up to Frank Senior’s death. The 2003 remake, on the other hand, was your average wacky Steve Martin comedy, starring Martin alongside Bonnie Hunt and a passel of cute kids (including Hilary Duff) in $190 million worth of goofy slapstick. The sequel, released in 2005, added Eugene Levy and Carmen Electra, and was…well, slapstickier. Or as Desson Thomson of the Washington Post put it, “This is definitely a family trip to stay home and skip.”The Dark Knight 94%Batman &amp; Robin earned more than $238 million during its theatrical run, but it endured an avalanche of critical brickbats along the way — which was enough to send the franchise into hibernation for eight years, ultimately triggering a reboot with 2005’s Batman Begins. After reinvigorating the series with Begins, director Christopher Nolan took it to the next level with The Dark Knight — earning more than $1 billion and eight Oscar nominations along the way. Spearheaded by an Academy Award-winning performance from Heath Ledger, it won almost universal praise from critics like Manohla Dargis of the New York Times, who wrote, “Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, The Dark Knight goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.”Dr. Dolittle 2 42%With Eddie Murphy in the title role, a perfectly 1990s R&amp;B soundtrack, and very little resemblance to the Hugh Lofting stories that inspired the movie — or the original film adaptation, released in 1967 — the Dr. Dolittle remake spoke to audiences as well as animals, earning an impressive $294 million and launching a franchise that stands at five films and counting. But only the first sequel, 2001’s Dr. Dolittle 2, made it to theaters — and despite a voice cast that included Steve Zahn, Lisa Kudrow, and Norm Macdonald, as well as a cameo from Steve “Crocodile Hunter” Irwin, it brought in over $100 million less than its predecessor, along with dismissive reviews from the likes of Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, who said it “lurches from one scene to another with the grace of a pratfall and the script reads more like a skit comedy than a story.”Father of the Bride Part II 50%When Steve Martin scored a huge hit with his 1991 remake of the Spencer Tracy classic Father of the Bride, it was only natural to want a sequel — and the filmmakers didn’t have far to look for a script, because the original got its own follow-up, 1952’s Father’s Little Dividend. Sadly, the Dividend-inspired Father of the Bride Part II was less enthusiastically received by critics, including Film Threat’s impressively sarcastic Pete Vonder Haar, who quipped, “A sequel to a lousy remake? How droll.”The Fly II 29%The original The Fly kicked off a trilogy in 1958, and when director David Cronenberg resurrected the franchise with a 1986 reboot that used modern special effects technology to heighten the drama around the story of a scientist whose teleportation experiments cause him to unwittingly splice his own DNA with a housefly’s, its rave reviews and solid grosses seemed like the foundation for another couple of films. Alas, this iteration of the series reached a dead end with 1989’s The Fly II, which starred Eric Stoltz as the original Fly’s son and added a corporate villain to the plot. Most critics weren’t having any of it, including Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, who called it a “Worthless sequel to a very good film.”H2: Halloween II 21%After eight movies and nearly 30 years, the Halloween franchise went looking for someone to give it a reboot — and found an enthusiastic partner in director Rob Zombie, whose 2007 Halloween took the story of serial killer Michael Myers back to the beginning. Critics were unkind, but the movie made tons of money, so two years later, Zombie returned with Halloween II — and carte blanche from producer Malek Akkad to ignore the long-standing rules of the franchise’s mythology. The result? A lower Tomatometer, a lower gross, and brutal reviews from critics like Empire’s Kim Newman, who dismissed it as “In a word, ugly.”&nbsp;The Hills Have Eyes II 12%According to legend, Sawney Bean was a serial killer who ate the bodies of more than a thousand victims with the help of his family. It’s a grisly tale, and obviously great fodder for a horror franchise: The Hills Have Eyes series stands at five films and counting since 1977, although after a non-canonical second sequel was released in 1995, a reboot was clearly in order. Alexandre Aja and Grégory Levasseur came to the rescue in 2006, consulting with series creator Wes Craven to produce a $70 million hit; the following year, they scored another moneymaker with the sensibly titled The Hills Have Eyes 2. Despite a script written by Craven and his son Jonathan, most critics felt it wasn’t worth the effort — as Elizabeth Weitzman put it, the sequel “feels like the work of a guy who’s spent a few too many days lost in the desert.”Nutty Professor II – The Klumps 26%Before Eddie Murphy disappeared into a fat suit for Norbit, he piled on the prosthetics — to far greater effect — in 1996’s The Nutty Professor, a remake of the 1963 Jerry Lewis comedy about a socially backward scientist whose efforts to develop a serum that will cure his awkwardness unwittingly trigger a (hilarious) split personality. Four years and over $270 million later, he returned in Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which found Murphy once again playing multiple roles while buried under mounds of latex. Sadly, the results weren’t twice as nice for critics like the Boston Globe’s Jay Carr, who accused it of being “neither funny nor endearing enough to conceal the fact that, like its star, it fills the screen with a lot of padding.”Ocean’s Twelve/Thirteen 69%The original Ocean’s Eleven was a star-studded but mostly inconsequential trifle — an excuse for the Rat Pack to hang out and have a good time on camera. So when Steven Soderbergh convened a glitzy lineup of famous faces for the 2001 remake starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts, a sequel hardly seemed necessary — at least until the $450 million worldwide gross rolled in. Although 2004’s Ocean’s Twelve turned out to be a critical and commercial step back, the series rebounded with 2007’s Ocean’s Thirteen, which overcame all odds and went out on a high note with critics like Michael Booth of the Denver Post, who admitted, “In Hollywood’s version of Vegas, I’ll have the surf, and the turf, and the vegetarian, and anything else Soderbergh wants to serve me.”102 Dalmatians 31%Disney’s decision to film a live-action remake of 1961’s One Hundred and One Dalmatians might have seemed a little curious if not for the involvement of Glenn Close, who was pretty much born to give the world her marvelously campy take on the villainous Cruella de Vil. But did that mean we needed the sequel, 2000’s 102 Dalmatians? It did not, according to critics like James Plath at Movie Metropolis, who cringed, “We can only hope that no one at Disney can count to 103.”Pink Panther 2 12%Stretching all the way back to 1963, the Pink Panther series encompasses 11 films — and six of them feature footage of the incomparable Peter Sellers, whose work as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau should have prevented any sane individual from attempting to carry the franchise forward after his death. Alas, it lumbered on, first with a posthumous hodgepodge of old Sellers clips (1982’s Trail of the Pink Panther), then with a pair of weak stabs at reboots (1983’s Curse of the Pink Panther, starring Ted Wass, and 1993’s Son of the Pink Panther, starring Roberto Benigni). No stranger to reboots, Steve Martin took the keys to the franchise with 2006’s The Pink Panther, which did well enough to spawn The Pink Panther 2 three years later — but that was one Panther too many for critics like USA Today’s Claudia Puig, who sighed, “Remember when Martin was funny?”The Ring Two 20%By the time it reached these shores, the Ring franchise was a certified phenomenon, shattering Japanese box office records and spawning two sequels, a prequel, and a Korean remake. Gore Verbinski brought the scary with 2002’s The Ring, which retained the basic core of the original’s plot (cursed videotape brings insanity and death to all who watch it) while adding plenty of uniquely terrifying visuals. Nearly $250 million later, a sequel was unavoidable — and sure enough, 2005 brought The Ring Two, which brought original Ring director Hideo Nakata on board to extend the first installment’s story. Critics were unimpressed — Richard Roeper called it “an unnecessary second chapter that dumbs down all the main characters and is curiously lacking in quality scares” — but it scared up more than $160 million at the box office, and rumor has it we’ll be seeing The Ring 3D someday soon.Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 13%With six grisly films over nearly 40 years — and another one slated for release (in 3D!) next year — the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise has done for chainsaws what Jaws did for sharks and Star Wars did for lightsabers. Yet the series started falling off track as quickly as the first sequel, which found director Tobe Hooper using the cannibalistic Leatherface and his horrific family for darkly comedic effect, and by the time 1994’s The Next Generation rolled around, it was time for a reboot. Director Marcus Nispel took the series back to its roots in 2003, and three years later, Jonathan Liebesman followed with a prequel, The Beginning. Unfortunately, most critics felt an origin story wasn’t what Leatherface needed; the Arizona Republic’s Randy Cordova spoke for the vast majority when he shrugged it off as “Gross and sadistic but never scary.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

To help concerned filmgoers navigate the landscape (and improve upon the outdated Hays Code), Hollywood implemented a voluntary ratings system in the late 1960s, and for the most part, it’s done its job — although it certainly hasn’t been without its detractors. The “X” designation, created as a catchall category for movies with adult content, has proven particularly problematic; despite the occasional release of “real” X-rated films (such as Midnight Cowboy, Fritz the Cat, and Last Tango in Paris), the rating quickly became shorthand for pornography.In order to help differentiate between high art and cheap thrills, the MPAA introduced the NC-17 in 1990, and although it hasn’t done anything to improve the box office prospects of films receiving the rating, it has given an alternative to filmmakers who want to create challenging and/or provocative movies for grown-ups without dealing with the “rated X” stigma. With Steve McQueen’s Shame heading for limited release this weekend (and already courting controversy), we decided now would be the perfect time to pay tribute to the NC-17. Get ready for plenty of skin, violence, and broken taboos — and bring your ID, because it’s time for an adults-only Total Recall!Bad Education 88%If there is such a thing as your average drama about the aftereffects of a Catholic priest molesting young boys, Pedro Almodóvar’s Bad Education isn’t it. Using the shame and betrayal of the Church scandal as a jumping-off point, Education spirals into layers of colorful, typically Almodóvarian melodrama, including a film-within-a-film, multiple cases of hidden identity, blurred gender lines, and drug use. It was all too much for the MPAA, but just enough for critics like the AV Club’s Scott Tobias, who wrote, “In accounting for Almodóvar’s identity as an artist and a man, Bad Education comes together like a bold and far-reaching summation of his career to date.”Bad Lieutenant 77%Long before Nicolas Cage started hallucinating iguanas in Werner Herzog’s Bad Lieutenant “rethought,” Harvey Keitel took filmgoers into the darkest depths of man’s soul with the 1992 original. Directed by Abel Ferrara, Bad Lieutenant earned its NC-17 with 96 minutes of generally depraved behavior (not to mention full-frontal nudity from both sexes), but there was real meaning to the movie’s madness — not to mention a bravura performance from its star, who inspired Empire’s Clark Collis to write, “Keitel is onscreen for pretty much the entire movie and clearly relishes the opportunity of playing someone not so much teetering on the abyss as leaping off with a grand piano manacled to each ankle.”Crash 63%He’s explored a handful of different genres, from period pieces to outright horror flicks, but along the way, director David Cronenberg has remained resolutely provocative — which made him a natural fit to adapt Crash, J.G. Ballard’s 1973 novel about an emotionally bankrupt film producer (James Spader) who discovers new purpose (and a rather creepy fetish) after embarking on an affair with the widow (Holly Hunter) of a man he kills in a head-on car crash. Exploring the world of car crash porn with his singularly detached precision, Cronenberg raised a considerable ruckus with the film at Cannes — where it won a prize for “originality, daring and audacity” despite some jury members’ very vocal disapproval — and at the studio level, where Fine Line owner Ted Turner fought to keep it out of U.S. theaters. It also divided critics, although a number of top scribes were able to find beauty in the high-speed wreckage — including Roger Ebert, who observed, “It’s about the human mind, about the way we grow enslaved by the particular things that turn us on, and forgive ourselves our trespasses.”The Dreamers 60%Sometimes, filmmakers venture into NC-17 territory in order to stay true to their stories by offering unflinchingly honest depictions of adult behavior. And sometimes — as in the case of Bernardo Bertolucci’s The Dreamers — they push the ratings envelope simply on account of what the MPAA likes to call “nudity and sexual content.” The tale of an American exchange student (Michael Pitt) who comes to Paris and falls in with a disconcertingly close pair of siblings (Eva Green and Louis Garrel), Dreamers totters between a tribute to cinephilia, a statement on the French political unrest of the late 1960s, and an excuse for lots of weird sexual tension — a tricky blend that was appreciated by critics like Kimberley Jones of the Austin Chronicle, who wrote, “The Dreamers is infused with the same kind of wistful melancholy that made the French New Wave films so winning, and it’s all gorgeous to look at.”Henry &amp; June 62%The original NC-17 film, Philip Kaufman’s Henry &amp; June underscored the need for some sort of distinction between bawdy pornographic fare and films that braved the line between safe commercialism and challenging art. Starring Fred Ward as Henry Miller, Uma Thurman as his wife June, and Maria de Medeiros as Anaïs Nin, the movie — based on Nin’s memoir of the same name — details the pan-sexual love triangle between the trio. Tagged with the NC-17 rating for some relatively mild stuff (including a shot of a famously explicit postcard), it delivered thoughtful subtext along with prurient thrills; as Owen Gleiberman wrote for Entertainment Weekly, “After many fits and starts, Henry &amp; June becomes another feminist-awakening movie — the story of a lesbian attraction that, for Anaïs, is really a dawning of the self.”Lust, Caution 72%What do you get when you put together a spy thriller inspired by the real-life Second Sino-Japanese War with Ang Lee’s eye for scenes of sumptuously filmed beauty? 2007’s Lust, Caution, which earned an NC-17 for its explicit sex scenes, but had more on its mind than simply the naughty bits. At heart, it’s really a piercing love story, albeit one whose stakes are raised against the backdrop of its life-or-death setting. Though some critics yawned at its sprawling 157-minute length, most scribes found Lust, Caution worth the investment — including Kevin Harley of Film Threat, who wrote, “Lee’s saucy, sumptuous slow-burner is a complex, elegant seduction, drawing on Hitchcock but putting a singular stamp on a rich spread of spies and sex, repression and sacrifice. Just don’t try those moves at home…”Man Bites Dog 74%As perversely, chaotically violent as its title, Man Bites Dog takes viewers on an unrelentingly grim descent into the mind of a homicidal maniac (Benoît Poelvoorde) who matter-of-factly gives a documentary crew a series of hands-on “lessons” in his sickening craft. A sort of neo-noir/mockumentary study of the seductive nature of violence — as well as its lingering, unpredictable side effects — Dog earned its NC-17 with frank depictions of violence and sexual situations, but it offered more than just cheap thrills for critics like James Berardinelli of ReelViews, who admitted that it’s “Obviously not a movie for everyone” but insisted, “if you do venture to see Man Bites Dog, you would have to be made out of stone to miss the visceral, sardonic impact of a highly-unusual film.”Orgazmo 47%Unlike most NC-17 films, which tend to earn the distinction through serious (and frequently high-minded) efforts to push the boundaries of mainstream cinema, Orgazmo is nothing more than a comedic exercise in cheerful vulgarity — albeit one that bears the distinctive creative stamp of its director, screenwriter and star, South Park co-creator Trey Parker. The tale of a Mormon missionary who stars in a porn flick in order to earn enough money to marry his sweetheart — and ends up becoming a real-life superhero in the bargain — it won’t teach you anything about the human condition, and it probably gets about as close to the old-school X-rated spirit as any NC-17 theatrical release. But that doesn’t mean Orgazmo is without merit; as Kevin N. Laforest argued for the Montreal Film Journal, “This movie confirms Trey Parker as the Orson Welles of absurd comedy.”A Serbian Film 47%At what point does a film cross over from being disturbingly provocative to being irredeemably offensive? For a sizable portion of film critics, Srđan Spasojević’s A Serbian Film crossed that line with depraved abandon, and it’s easy to see their point — there’s little you can say about the movie on a family website, and just reading the plot synopsis is enough to make your stomach turn. (Long story short, it’s about what happens when a semi-retired porn star, played by Srđan Todorović, decides to take one last job that is not what he signed up for.) For some scribes, however, Serbian had an important message to deliver underneath all of its horrific sex and violence. As Scott Weinberg wrote for FEARnet, “I admire and detest it at the same time. And I will never watch it again. Ever.”Showgirls 23%For better or worse, Showgirls is the most widely seen film on this week’s list — and depending on your point of view, it’s either an unwatchable mess or a work of kitschy, misunderstood genius. Either way, it went down as one of the most notorious flops of the 1990s, with critics leading the charge against its gratuitous nudity, wooden acting, and unintentionally hilarious script (for which screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was paid an astonishing $2 million). A misbegotten attempt by Saved by the Bell star Elizabeth Berkley to prove she could handle more adult roles, it’s since gone on to become something of a cult favorite among deeply ironic filmgoers, but it certainly didn’t help further the NC-17 cause — although it did entertain Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, who said, “Showgirls is fun, pure and simple, as long as you don’t take any of it seriously.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Only this time instead of Brendan Fraser making his way to the center of the earth, we’ve got Dwayne Johnson muscling to the shores of The Mysterious Island in the company of Michael Caine, Vanessa Hudgens, and the inimitable Luis Guzmán — who’s been stealing scenes throughout his career, and now gets his first chance to upstage some giant bees. In honor of Luis’ latest role, we dedicate this week’s list to the best films in a résumé filled with memorable moments. It’s time for Total Recall! 73%10. The Count of Monte CristoFor its tenth adaptation, Alexandre Dumas’ classic novel received a bit of a facelift — and, as is their wont, a number of critics were fairly cheesed about the storyline alterations and beefed-up action that director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert brought to the tale. For most, however, the most crucial elements of the story remained intact — namely, the injustice endured by a French sailor (James Cavizel) who is betrayed and sent to prison by his supposed friend (Pearce), only to escape and pursue vengeance with the aid of his trusty sidekick (Guzmán). As Peter Bradshaw put it in his review for the Guardian, “Dumas’s classic tale is such a rattling good yarn, there’s nothing you can do to derail it as it hurtles down the track.” 77%9. The Hard WayIts plot reads like a high-concept parody (spoiled, wisecracking actor gloms onto hard-boiled cop while researching a role…and gets more than he bargained for!), but John Badham’s The Hard Way is better than you might think — if only because it plays so squarely to its stars’ strengths. As the pampered Nick Lang, Michael J. Fox gets to use his squirrelly energy and sharp comic timing; as John Moss, the perpetually exasperated NYPD detective saddled with Lang, James Woods is a tightly wound bundle of volcanic, barely suppressed rage. (Guzmán appears as a fellow detective who works as a sort of Jiminy Cricket, trying to keep Woods from going too far off the reservation.) While acknowledging that it was “just another version of the reliable old cop partner movie,” Roger Ebert praised the end result as “funny, fun, exciting, and, when you look beneath the glossy surface, an example of professionals who know their crafts and enjoy doing them well.” 82%8. Carlito’s WayIf you’re looking to make a visually stylish gangster epic, you could certainly do worse than hiring Brian De Palma to direct — and when casting the aging ex-con who wants to leave his criminal lifestyle behind, you could hardly do better than Al Pacino. Case in point: Carlito’s Way, which adapts a pair of Judge Edwin Torres novels about the title character’s doomed dreams of a new life. Ultimately earning a pair of Golden Globes nominations for Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller, Carlito’s offered Guzmán another memorable supporting role and surrounded him with another stellar cast and crew. “De Palma and Pacino tread some very familiar ground,” admitted eFilmCritic’s Brian McKay. “But while it all feels a bit recycled at times, it still works.” 79%7. Punch-Drunk LoveAfter picking up roles in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Guzmán returned for Anderson’s third outing — but unlike the first two, Punch-Drunk Love is more of a quiet character study than a sprawling ensemble piece. Here, Guzmán stars as the supportive friend and employee of novelty warehouse owner Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), whose painfully earnest quest for love takes some memorably surreal turns (including a bizarre, unforgettable showdown with some tire iron-wielding lunatics and their boss, a psychotic mattress vendor played by Anderson mainstay Philip Seymour Hoffman). It remains what Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman ruefully prophesied would be “the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear.” 87%6. Q &amp; AThe film that Guzmán credits with putting him on the map as a character actor, Sidney Lumet’s Q&amp;A offered him a pivotal supporting role in an impeccably acted drama about the unbearably tense conflict between a corrupt cop (Nick Nolte), the officer investigating him (Timothy Hutton), and the crime boss with ties to them both (Armand Assante). While admitting that its themes had been visited many times by other filmmakers — and repeatedly by Lumet — ReelViews’ James Berardinelli noted, “Q &amp; A is testimony to the validity of the old adage: a good story, when well told, can never be told too many times.”&nbsp; 83%5. MagnoliaEmboldened by the success of Boogie Nights, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson increased his scope for the follow-up, 1999’s wildly ambitious Magnolia. Indulgent in pretty much every respect (not least its three-hour running time), Anderson’s magnum opus was grounded by its crowded cast, which included Tom Cruise, Philip Baker Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore… really, the list goes on and on. It goes on so long, in fact, that Guzmán had only a small role — but as always, it was a memorable one: an obnoxious version of himself. Argued Michael Wilmington for the Chicago Tribune, “The more you think about Magnolia — the dry wit, the bravura staging, the intricate design, the wondrous performances — the better and more unusual the film seems.” 93%4. Boogie NightsGuzmán started acting in the late 1970s, and accumulated an impressive stack of “that guy” roles as a busy character actor throughout the 1980s — but his film career really started to take off in the 1990s, when he became a favorite actor for directors Steven Soderbergh and Paul Thomas Anderson. Guzmán’s first Anderson production, Boogie Nights, helped free him from a lifetime of playing cops and gangsters by casting him as the flamboyant manager of a nightclub where struggling high school dropout Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) begins his transformation into legendary porn star Dirk Diggler. One of the best-reviewed films of the year, Nights earned praise from critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “Everything about Boogie Nights is interestingly unexpected, even the few seconds of darkness before the film’s neon title blasts onto the screen.” 92%3. The LimeyAfter stealing his few onscreen moments in Steven Soderbergh’s Out of Sight, Guzmán scored a bigger role in the director’s next project. Starring Terence Stamp as a British ex-con who goes on the warpath after learning of his daughter’s death, The Limey makes up for its short running time and slender script with hard-hitting violence and some thoroughly compelling performances (including Guzmán as a friend of Stamp’s daughter and Peter Fonda as her boyfriend); while it didn’t make much of an impact at the box office, it impressed critics like Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle, who called it “A first-rate crime thriller and further proof that director Stephen Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists.” 92%2. TrafficGuzmán has been part of some mighty fine ensemble casts in his day, and arguably none of them have been finer than the impressive array of talent Steven Soderbergh lined up for 2000’s Traffic. Nestled between Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, Dennis Quaid, and others, Guzmán helped anchor Soderbergh’s sprawling look at the American drug trade with a fine performance in a film full of them. “In compelling terms, it puts bitter economic, social and racial truth before our eyes,” wrote Susan Stark of the Detroit News. “Continue to blink or see. Your choice.” 93%1. Out of SightThe first of Guzmán’s three films with Steven Soderbergh, Out of Sight found the director pulling what would become a familiar trick: using a spectacular cast (including George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Albert Brooks, and Don Cheadle) to tell what could have, in the wrong hands, been a relatively unremarkable story. Adapting Elmore Leonard’s hit novel, Sight follows the adventures of a U.S. Marshal (Lopez) drawn into the orbit of a charismatic crook (Clooney) on his quest for one last score after he takes advantage of a fellow inmate’s (Guzmán, in a small but memorable role) plan to escape from prison. Observed Kenneth Turan for the Los Angeles Times, “As always with the best of Leonard, it’s the journey, not the destination, that counts, and director Soderbergh has let it unfold with dry wit and great skill.”In case you were wondering, here are Guzmán’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Magnolia — 88%2. Carlito’s Way — 88%3. The Count of Monte Cristo — 85%4. Boogie Nights — 84%5. Traffic — 81%6. The Limey — 75%7. Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story — 74%8. Punch-Drunk Love — 72%9.

For decades, filmmakers have been fascinated with the possibilities of body-switching, and it’s easy to see why: it’s a premise that’s equally useful for comedies, dramas, and sci-fi thrillers. For this week’s Total Recall, we decided to take a look at some noteworthy examples, including a few from each of the genres mentioned above — and some that aren’t so easily categorized. Which are your favorites? Which movies would you add to the list? Let us know in the comments!All of Me 85%Quibble, if you must, over the fact that All of Me is less about body switching than body sharing — the fact remains that this is a film in which Lily Tomlin ends up in Steve Martin’s body, and the two of them fight for control over his faculties for the better part of its 93 minutes. That makes it close enough for our purposes — and it also makes this one of the better comedies of the decade, featuring some of Martin and Tomlin’s most inspired work. “Martin has become a superb physical comic, and Tomlin brings some unexpected warmth to a cruelly written part,” observed Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader, adding, “A manic fuzziness takes over in the last reel and spoils some of the pleasure, but it’s still a sympathetic effort.”Avatar 82%People don’t change bodies here the same way they do in, say, Freaky Friday or Vice Versa, but when we have to choose between bending the rules a little to take Avatar or filling the list with stuff like Like Father, Like Son, well… we’ll bend the rules. In James Cameron’s 2009 blockbuster, Earth is at war with blue, 10-foot aliens named the Na’vi who want to protect their planet, called Pandora, from humans intent on mining it. Pandora’s environment is toxic to earthlings, but scientists have figured out a way to control genetically engineered Na’vi bodies — ahem, avatars — via a fancy mental linking process that puts humans inside their minds. But then, you already knew that, because as its nearly $3 billion gross proves, everyone saw Avatar — and most of them loved it, including A.O. Scott, who gushed in his At the Movies review, “I had the feeling coming out of this movie that I haven’t felt since maybe I was eleven years old in 1977 and I saw Star Wars for the first time.”Day Watch 62%Boasting eye-popping special effects, a brain-bendingly twisty plot, and some of Timur Bekmambetov’s most assured direction, Day Watch proved a worthy sequel to its predecessor, 2004’s Night Watch, taking audiences on a journey involving a body-swapping protagonist (of course), a war between supernatural combatants called Light Others and Dark Others, a history-altering tool called the Chalk of Fate, and… hey, why are you chuckling and shaking your head? Admittedly, Day Watch isn’t the easiest sci-fi thriller to explain, but it was a huge hit with Russian audiences — and with American critics like Matt Peterson of the New York Press, who wrote, “Bekmambetov succeeds in crafting a movie so fast-paced and stylish that it doesn’t matter why there’s a battle sequence or car chase, you just sit back and enjoy the ride.”Dream a Little Dream 0%Part goofy teen comedy, part poignant meditation on the bittersweet experience of growing old alongside your lifelong love, 1989’s Dream a Little Dream starred Corey Feldman as Bobby Keller, a lovesick high school student who (literally) runs into the object of his teen obsession (Meredith Salenger) at the precise moment that his wacky old professor neighbor (Jason Robards) is attempting to meditate his way into immortality with his wife (Piper Laurie). Next thing you know, the professor is trapped in Bobby’s body, and has mere days to find his way back before his wife — whose spirit is trapped in Salenger’s body — forgets the love they shared. Oh, and did we mention Corey Haim plays a guy named Dinger? It sounds sort of messy, and it is; the movie flopped at the box office, coming too late to capitalize on the Coreys’ waning popularity, not to mention the late 1980s body-swapping craze. And although it’s grown into something of an ironic cult classic, critics thought it stunk: as Richard Harrington wrote for the Washington Post, “Folks staggering out of Dream a Little Dream may well wonder what the heck they just saw.”Face/Off 92%Okay, so the protagonists in this movie don’t switch bodies so much as they swap faces, but let’s not argue semantics — the important thing is that in this John Woo action thriller, an FBI agent (played by John Travolta) has the face of his terrorist nemesis (Nicolas Cage) grafted onto his body so he can trick the bad guy’s brother into divulging secret information. Only then, the terrorist ends up stealing the FBI agent’s unattached face, and infiltrates his family, and…well, it’s all pretty ridiculous, but if nothing else, Face/Off gave Cage and Travolta the opportunity to spend most of a movie pretending to be each other, with explosions thrown in. As Variety’s Todd McCarthy put it, “Watching John Travolta and Nicolas Cage square off and literally exchange roles brings back the old-fashioned pleasure of astutely judged movie star pairings in a major way.”Freaky Friday 88%Well, of course we were going to put this one on the list. And we decided to use the 2003 remake for two reasons: One, it has a higher Tomatometer, and two, Jodie Foster has made plenty of solid films, and appears in Total Recalls more regularly than the once-mighty Lindsay Lohan. Lindsay really came into her own here, going toe-to-toe with an equally game Jamie Lee Curtis in the wacky — and surprisingly thoughtful — tale of a rebellious teen who trades bodies with her mother thanks to a magical fortune cookie. Audiences made Friday‘s second theatrical outing a $160 million success, and critics applauded right along with them, including John Monaghan of the Detroit Free Press, who weighed in, “Wise but not too preachy, warm but never snuggly, it’s also one of the funniest films this year.”Prelude to a Kiss 63%Most of the movies on this list — and in this genre, really — use body-switching as a framing device for goofy comedy, but Prelude to a Kiss is something altogether different: the story of a newlywed couple (played by Meg Ryan and Alec Baldwin) who find themselves in an unusual predicament when an elderly man (Sydney Walker) kisses the bride and ends up trading bodies with her. Though not without comedic moments, Prelude is really a romance — and one that comes with some thoughtful commentary on standards of beauty, the laws of attraction, and the meaning of love. “The ‘change of body’ plot device is nothing new,” wrote James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “but it’s rarely employed as intelligently or effectively as in this motion picture.”Source Code 92%A body-switching sci-fi thriller with a Groundhog Day-style twist that’s played for anything but laughs, Duncan Jones’ Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens, a military pilot who wakes up on a speeding train in another man’s body. The premise is a lot more complex than that — it involves a terrorist attack and a government program called, you guessed it, Source Code — but this is the type of movie that’s better the less you know going in. Suffice it to say that it is, in the words of the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, “A thriller that takes a science fiction premise and uses it, not for the sake of splashy effects, but as a doorway into the human soul.”TurnaboutFor anyone who thought screwball body-swapping comedies got their start with Freaky Friday, here’s evidence to the contrary: 1940’s Turnabout, starring John Hubbard and Carole Landis as a fabulously wealthy (and fabulously irritating) couple who repeatedly insist that each of them has it worse than the other — and then, wouldn’t you know it, they come across a mystical Indian artifact that gives them more than they bargained for. One of director Hal Roach’s less-remembered efforts, Turnabout was snubbed by critics like Bosley Crowther of the New York Times, who called it “a tired and tiresome jape, as subtle as a five-cent stogie and just as aromatic.”Vice Versa 43%Few actors in the 1980s communicated open-mouthed, childlike wonder better than Judge Reinhold — and few child actors played wise beyond their years better than Fred Savage. So in terms of casting, 1988’s Vice Versa was a perfect match — a tale of a harried executive (Reinhold) who ends up in the body of his young son (Savage) thanks to a magic skull that overhears them arguing about whose life is harder. Of course, once you say the words “magic skull,” you’ve given yourself a tough row to hoe in terms of what your audience is willing to accept, and it certainly didn’t help that Vice Versa arrived in the midst of a glut of similarly themed comedies. Although it ultimately flopped at the box office and received generally negative reviews, it was warmly received by some critics — including Roger Ebert, who called it “a treasure of a movie, in which the performances hold the key” and wrote, “What makes Vice Versa so wonderful is the way Reinhold and Savage are able to convince us that each body is inhabited by the other character.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

This week, he returns to theaters with Katie Holmes and a house full of creepy-crawlies in the Guillermo del Toro-produced Don’t Be Afraid Of The Dark, and we’re celebrating by taking a look back at his critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall! 58%10. First SnowA thriller starring Guy Pearce as a man with a haunted past who’s told by a fortune teller that he may not have long to live, First Snow should have been a slam dunk with critics — especially considering that the fortune teller was played by consummate character actor J.K. Simmons, and that the supporting cast was rounded out by dependable faces such as William Fichtner and Adam Scott. Alas, a sizable percentage of writers felt the finished product was too slow, and didn’t do enough with its intriguing premise — although for Stephen Holden of the New York Times, it was pretty strong stuff. Calling it “a pointed little thriller with metaphysical pretensions,” Holden argued that “First Snow is shrewd enough to approach basic philosophical questions in sneaky, offhand ways.” 65%9. TraitorIt’s hard to decide which is more surprising about Traitor — that it presented a sympathetic view of a Muslim terrorist (or is he?) in 2008, or that the story was cooked up by none other than Steve Martin. Either way, Traitor represented a nice opportunity for star Don Cheadle to show off his dramatic chops, along with a terrific supporting cast that included Pearce as an FBI agent whose relentless pursuit of Cheadle helps frame the final act of the movie. It didn’t do much at the box office, but for critics like Salon’s Stephanie Zacharek, Traitor was “an earnest, efficient, serviceable thriller that makes a valiant effort to untangle some of the moral complexities of the post-9/11 world.” 73%8. The Count of Monte CristoFor its tenth adaptation, Alexandre Dumas’ classic novel received a bit of a facelift — and, as is their wont, a number of critics were fairly cheesed about the storyline alterations and beefed-up action that director Kevin Reynolds and screenwriter Jay Wolpert brought to the tale. For most, however, the most crucial elements of the story remained intact — namely, the struggle for vengeance of a French sailor (James Cavizel) who is betrayed and sent to prison by his supposed friend (Pearce). As Peter Bradshaw put it in his review for the Guardian, “Dumas’s classic tale is such a rattling good yarn, there’s nothing you can do to derail it as it hurtles down the track.” 78%7. Two BrothersThe two brothers of the title are a pair of tigers that viewers meet as adorable cubs in the opening act, but this isn’t the syrupy cuddlefest it might look like. Really, although Two Brothers doesn’t lack for coo-inducing shots of the fuzzy protagonists, it’s also a darker and altogether more intense animal movie than American audiences have grown accustomed to — the tale of a tiger family torn asunder by an unscrupulous hunter (played by Pearce) who wreaks havoc in the brothers’ lives. Does it all end on a heartwarming note? Of course. But as the Arizona Republic’s Randy Cordova argued, “Anyone older than 12 can figure out what’s going to happen, but the movie still packs an emotional punch that will keep adults entertained as much as the young ones.” 85%6. The PropositionWith John Hillcoat behind the cameras and a script by Australian musical icon Nick Cave, The Proposition is a modern Western with offscreen credentials that fairly ooze cool — and the same could be said of its cast, a lineup that included Pearce, John Hurt, Emily Watson, Ray Winstone, and Danny Huston. They all came together to help dramatize the tale of the Burns brothers gang, a notorious group of 19th century Australian outlaws who weren’t above raping and/or murdering anyone who got in their way. Not exactly a family film, in other words — but one whose finely tuned sense of violent dread mesmerized critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who wrote, “Hillcoat creates a vision as nihilistic as any horror film ever put on a screen, but so well acted and carefully conceived that it transcends exploitation.” 96%5. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertA road trip movie with a decidedly flamboyant twist, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert follows the trail of three drag queens (played by Pearce, Hugo Weaving, and Terence Stamp) on their journey across the Australian Outback in an unreliable tour bus. Containing drama, comedy, and a fair amount of social commentary, Priscilla was an arthouse favorite during its theatrical run, spun off a pair of musical stage adaptations, won an Oscar (for Best Costume Design, natch), and earned raves from critics like Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures, who asked, “Where else are you going to see General Zod, Agent Smith and the guy from Memento as drag queens stranded in the Australian Outback?” 93%4. MementoThe grim noir puzzle that reaffirmed Pearce’s leading-man talent and served as Christopher Nolan’s full-fledged Hollywood coming-out party, Memento offered an early glimpse of Nolan’s fondness for narrative games — as well as his ability to get the most out of his actors. Playing a man who spends most of the film as not only a mystery to the viewer, but to himself, Pearce won a pile of honors from various film critics’ circles, and was a major part of what led the Los Angeles Times’ Kenneth Turan to call Memento “provocatively structured and thrillingly executed film noir, an intricate, inventive use of cinema’s possibilities that pushes what can be done on screen in an unusual direction.” 94%3. The King’s SpeechThis Best Picture winner is really Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush’s show, but that doesn’t mean there wasn’t room for some stellar supporting roles — including Pearce’s work as Edward VIII, the British king whose relationship with a divorced American prompted a constitutional crisis during his brief, tumultuous reign. While not the focal point of the film, Pearce’s performance illuminated a complex character whose conflicted relationship with Firth’s George VI helps lend additional weight to the story’s central relationships. “It is an intelligent, winning drama fit for a king — and the rest of us,” wrote Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post. “And this year, there were far too few of those coming from Hollywood.” 94%2. Animal KingdomBased on the true story of a crime family that won acquittal in a case involving the murder of two police officers, 2010’s Animal Kingdom was nicknamed “the Australian GoodFellas” — and although Kingdom never approached that film’s heights at the box office, it earned plenty of acclaim, including seven Australian Film Institute Awards against a dozen nominations — including a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Pearce, who played a cop trying to break up the family by swaying its youngest member (James Frecheville). Calling it “a coiled rattlesnake of a family-crime drama,” Ty Burr of the Boston Globe wrote, “You probably won’t see a better directorial debut this year than David Michôd’s Animal Kingdom.” 99%1. L.A. ConfidentialIn the midst of the 1990s neo-noir movement that brought us films like Pulp Fiction and Heat, writer/director Curtis Hanson took a sharply retro approach with L.A. Confidential — and won two Academy Awards (against nine nominations) for his trouble. A 1950s-set murder mystery involving mobsters, corrupt politicians, drugs, a pair of bickering cops (Pearce and Russell Crowe, making their American breakthroughs), and one righteous dame (Kim Basinger, who won one of those Oscars), Confidential managed to add to the genre’s history while paying its respects. As Roger Ebert put it, “L.A. Confidential is immersed in the atmosphere and lore of film noir, but it doesn’t seem like a period picture — it believes its noir values and isn’t just using them for decoration.”In case you were wondering, here are Pearce’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Memento — 93%2. The King’s Speech — 93%3. L.A. Confidential — 90%4. The Count of Monte Cristo — 85%5. The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert — 84%6. Animal Kingdom — 80%7.

But that isn’t to say Hollywood hasn’t produced its share of cinematic statements about work — and with Seth Gordon’s Horrible Bosses opening this weekend, we decided now would be a fine time to look back on some of the most noteworthy entries in the genre. Whether you’re looking for inspirational dramas, thoughtful statements on what it means to be truly gainfully employed, or just a few laughs, this week’s Total Recall has something that (ahem) works for everyone!Clerks 89%For most of the movies on this list, working life forms the backdrop for a larger plot or some kind of sweeping statement about the world we live in. Not Clerks. The 1994 indie classic that launched Kevin Smith’s career only wants to show you a day in the life of a pair of strip mall employees: the upstanding, uptight, and generally miserable Dante (Brian O’Halloran) and his acerbic, laid-back, and generally incompetent friend Randal (Jeff Anderson). Over the course of the film, the duo fill a shift with half-hearted stabs at work, a brief game of roof hockey, a visit to a wake, and dense gobs of dialogue about everything from relationships to the moral implications of the Star Wars films. Hugely profitable and hugely influential, Clerks captured a moment in time for a generation of disaffected twentysomethings biding their time in unfulfilling jobs while they tried to figure out what to do with their lives — something EW’s Owen Gleiberman hinted at when he observed, “The way our culture is going, this may be what a hip sitcom looks like in 15 years.”The Devil Wears Prada 75%Meryl Streep is surely a lovely person in real life, but she sure is good at playing nasty when the cameras are rolling. Case in point: The Devil Wears Prada, the film adaptation of Lauren Weisberger’s novel about the havoc wreaked by a tyrannical fashion magazine editor (Streep, playing a thinly fictionalized version of Vogue’s Anna Wintour) on the lives of her subordinates (led by a never-more-charming Anne Hathaway). Streep’s character is cartoonishly awful, but audiences couldn’t get enough of her — to the tune of over $325 million in ticket sales and a Best Actress Academy Award nomination. As David Edwards opined for the Daily Mirror, “Comedy doesn’t get much blacker — or more brilliant — than this.”Glengarry Glen Ross 95%You think the dynamic at your company is brutal? Try swimming with the sharks of Glengarry Glen Ross, a pitch-black, deeply profane case study in how quickly an office will disintegrate when a sales team is told that it’s about to enter a competition — and everyone who winds up lower than second place is going to lose his job. The result, as you might expect, is a bile-drenched free-for-all, brilliantly scripted by David Mamet (adapting his own Tony- and Pulitzer-winning play) and brought to painful life by an ace cast that included Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin, Kevin Spacey, Alan Arkin, and Al Pacino (who earned an Academy Award nomination for his work). It isn’t for the faint of heart, and it might provoke a few winces of recognition, but it is, in the words of Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “An utter masterpiece.”Gung Ho 33%Filmed at the peak of Japan’s 1980s economic resurgence, Ron Howard’s Gung Ho played upon American concerns about their struggling auto industry with a comedy about an out-of-work foreman (Michael Keaton) who convinces a Japanese company to take over his town’s shuttered plant. Its premise set the stage for an interesting combination of culture-clash humor and socioeconomic observations, but the script was more interested in setting up easy gags based on outdated cultural stereotypes (industrious Japanese, lazy Americans) and tacitly endorsing union-bashing. Ultimately, most critics found Gung Ho lacking, with Roger Ebert labeling it “a disappointment” and TV Guide pointing out that “Keaton is lovable, as usual, but he comes across as a dumb jerk.” Still, even if it didn’t live up to its potential, Gung Ho was a $36 million hit at the box office, ending in the year’s top 30 and inspiring a short-lived TV spinoff. As Variety’s review argued, “the conflict between cultures is good for both a laugh and a sober thought along the way.”The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit 75%In the years after World War II, an era of relative peace and prosperity gave rise to new standards of affluence for the American middle class — and a new set of expectations for career-minded breadwinners. Today, we tend to chuckle at the stereotype of the 1950s as an era of closely cropped lawns, gleaming appliances, and martini lunches at the country club — but even then, some recognized that the new societal mores weren’t always everything they were cracked up to be. Case in point: 1956’s The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, an adaptation of the Sloan Wilson novel in which a troubled World War II vet (played by Gregory Peck) returns from the front and joins the workforce, where he receives a dispiriting education in the emotional costs of a life spent in the office. It has its weaknesses, but The Man in the Gray Flannel suit is a surprisingly thoughtful early look at modern consumer culture — and, in the words of the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, “A mature, fascinating and often quite tender and touching film.”Modern Times 98%Part slapstick classic, part pointed observation on the far-reaching effects of modern industrialization, Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times used the Great Depression as a poignant backdrop for the tale of a hapless assembly line worker subjected to ever-greater indignities — first at work, where simply trying to keep up triggers a nervous breakdown, and then out in the increasingly senseless modern world, where just trying to get by is often enough to put him on the wrong side of the law. It’s 75 years old, but parts of Modern Times‘ message remain as timely as ever — and the film is, as Bill Weber of Slant Magazine argued, “a treasure of Depression America’s zeitgeist and the curtain call of the movies’ first comedic icon.”9 to 5 83%A boisterous ode to any woman who ever had to endure the lecherous overtures of a co-worker, 9 to 5 united Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and — making her big-screen debut — Dolly Parton, who banded together to deliver a lesson in workplace sensitivity to one of cinema’s most deliciously unlikable bosses. As played by Dabney Coleman, the proudly chauvinistic Franklin Hart, Jr. makes life miserable for his female subordinates — until they get revenge by making him a prisoner in his own home, and use his forced absence as an opportunity to start making changes around the office. Goofy? You bet, but it also packed a prescient message, and it jump-started a film career for Parton, who inspired Roger Ebert to write, “she is, on the basis of this one film, a natural-born movie star, a performer who holds our attention so easily that it’s hard to believe it’s her first film.”Norma Rae 89%Sally Field won her first Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of the labor heroine that Norma Rae is named for — a feisty union organizer based on Crystal Lee Sutton, the cotton mill worker whose real-life struggle to improve conditions at her factory inspired a bestselling book, not to mention countless moviegoers. When it was released in 1978, Norma Rae was a tip of the hat to the sacrifices borne by union members in the early 20th century (including Sutton, who ended up losing her job); today, it serves as a reminder that the battle for workers’ rights is far from over. Either way, it’s the movie that Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain XPress called “A beautifully made, splendidly acted film that more than achieves its aims.”Office Space 80%It certainly beats ditch-digging, but working in an office is fraught with its own perils. And if you find yourself stuck in the wrong one, your life can start to feel like the mind-numbing purgatory endured by Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston), the disgruntled corporate drone whose war against the Initech company drives Office Space — and provides 89 minutes of richly cathartic comedy for anyone who’s ever wished they could tell their boss or co-workers exactly what they think of them. Though it was a box office flop, Office Space has earned cult classic status over the years; as the Arizona Daily Star’s Phil Villarreal asked, “Who hasn’t sat at his desk after lunch and spaced out for an hour? Who wouldn’t love to march the copy machine into a field and go to town on it with a baseball bat?”Silkwood 74%American industry’s relentless drive toward higher productivity has helped make us an economic powerhouse, but it isn’t without its drawbacks; our focus on the bottom line can lead to sloppy work — or, in the worst circumstances, life-threateningly dangerous conditions. Take, for example, the story of Karen Silkwood, whose whistleblowing campaign against the plutonium plant where she worked — and her mysterious death — are dramatized in this Oscar-nominated effort from director Mike Nichols. Though the plant eventually settled out of court in a civil suit, it never admitted wrongdoing, forcing Silkwood to end on an ambiguous note that frustrated some critics — but for others, like Nick Davis of Nick’s Flick Picks, it “achieves impressive credentials as a drama of human character, not just as a screed against intolerable public practice.”Up in the Air 90%Losing your job can be a deeply traumatic experience. We tend to tie our sense of purpose so closely to our work — and live so close to the edge of our means — that sudden unemployment is often a terrifying prospect. However, firing people (or, to use the cleaner modern euphemism, “downsizing” them) can take its own psychic toll. Observe Up in the Air, Jason Reitman’s adaptation of the Walter Kirn novel about a benumbed corporate downsizer (played by George Clooney) who makes a good living by flying around the country doing the dirty work for companies shedding workers — only to discover that his own job is on the chopping block, thanks to efficiency measures being considered by his boss (Jason Bateman). A troubling film for troubled times, Up in the Air touched a nerve in post-recession America, earning more than $160 million at the box office and six nominations from the Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Clooney, and Best Supporting Actress for Vera Farmiga and Anna Kendrick). Observed At the Movies’ A.O. Scott, “I think that this is a classic in the making.”Working Girl 84%Career advancement often has as much to do with who you know — and your gender — as the quality of your work. It’s a sad fact that’s handled with a light touch in Mike Nichols’ Working Girl, a sharply written, solidly cast romantic comedy starring Melanie Griffith as a secretary whose acumen for investment banking is ignored at her firm because she didn’t go to the right school. Using an injury to her boss (Sigourney Weaver) as an opportunity to make her move, she proves her hidden potential — while falling in love, of course, with an executive (Harrison Ford) who doesn’t know she’s “just a secretary.” Portions of the plot seem dated now, but in its day, Working Girl offered audiences a bright blend of screwball comedy and social commentary. As Rita Kempley wrote for the Washington Post, “This scrumptious romantic comedy with its blithe cast is as easy to watch as swirling ball gowns and dancing feet. But oh me, oh my, how much more demanding it is to be a fairy tale heroine these days.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Like the romantic comedy, we love to disparage the “dead teenager” movie (the term was famously coined by Roger Ebert as a pejorative for 1980s slasher flicks), but we clearly can’t get enough: some of Hollywood’s longest-lasting franchises (not to mention a few horror classics) have been built on the fresh corpses of teen characters who ran afoul of supernatural forces or homicidal maniacs. For this week’s Total Recall, we decided to take a look back at a few noteworthy examples from an often critically maligned — yet always quite popular — subgenre. Which ones made the (ahem) cut? Read on to find out!Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon 76%Cross Scream with The Blair Witch Project and you’ve got Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, a mockumentary-style look at the trail of bloody terror left by a budding serial killer (Nathan Baesel) who’s so excited about his new career field that he invites a film crew along to watch him plan (and, ahem, execute) his dastardly deeds. “The dialogue has wit, and the rug gets pulled out from under us and the characters in several short, sharp jolts. At a certain point,” observed the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr, “Behind the Mask loses the tatty digital-video and immerses us in cinema.”Carrie 93%Repressed sexuality, religious fundamentalism, peer pressure, high school cliques, bullying — Stephen King rolled them all into one tightly wound bundle of supernatural horror with his debut bestseller, and Brian De Palma brought it screaming to the screen with this 1976 adaptation. Starring Sissy Spacek as the miserably put-upon victim of her brutally vindictive peers — not to mention her lunatic mother (Piper Laurie) — Carrie includes some of the most memorable sequences in the genre, as well as what TIME’s Richard Schickel called “An exercise in high style that even the most unredeemably rational among moviegoers should find enormously enjoyable.”Christine 69%There’s nothing quite like the bond between a young man and his first car — especially when that car is a 1958 Plymouth Fury with a bloodthirsty evil spirit lurking under the hood. It’s kind of a silly premise, but it was explored effectively by Stephen King in his 1983 bestseller Christine — and, later the same year, by John Carpenter in the film adaptation, starring future Waking the Dead director (and noted cinematic nerd) Keith Gordon as Arnie Cunningham, a high school misfit who develops an unhealthy bond with the titular, murderous vehicle. But as much as Arnie loves Christine, the car loves him even more — which is why anyone who hassles him, including the pack of delinquents who vandalize her to teach him a lesson, soon tastes hot asphalt. “This is the kind of movie,” wrote an appreciative Roger Ebert, “where you walk out with a silly grin, get in your car, and lay rubber halfway down the Eisenhower.”Evilspeak 43%Starring the redoubtable Clint Howard as a military school outcast who copes with his torment by using his computer to translate the Satanic texts of a long-dead priest (played by Richard Moll!), Evilspeak is an early ’80s masterpiece of so-bad-it’s-good horror. What can you say to a movie that includes a pentagram-flashing computer, supernatural black boars, a gratuitous shower scene, Clint Howard wielding Satan’s sword, and a puppy named Fred? Only that it is, in the words of Movie Gazette’s Anton Bitel, “a satisfying blend of Revenge of the Nerds and satanism.”Final Destination 35%By the year 2000, teenagers had been getting chased around by serial killers in movies for decades, and it was hard to imagine a new film coming along and bringing anything new to the dark, vicarious thrill of watching young malcontents run for their lives. And then came along James Wong’s Final Destination — which, if it didn’t put an entirely new spin on the genre, at least added a deranged layer of intricate art to the mayhem. Here, the villain isn’t a psychotic murderer or impossible-to-kill boogeyman — it’s actually Death himself, annoyed because a group of teens cheated him out of his due by getting off a plane before it explodes. Their punishment? A series of hands-over-eyes-worthy Death traps, unleashed with Rube Goldbergian panache. “There’s some mind-numbing dialogue as teenagers spout philosophical soundbites about Life and Death,” admitted Jumana Farouky of the Boston Phoenix, “but it’s worth the wait just to see a guy’s head sliced in half by a sheet of steel.”Friday the 13th 64%Its name has become synonymous with low-grade teen slashers, but before Friday the 13th was a franchise based on a lumbering goon who roamed with woods with a limitless supply of lives and an axe (or machete, or meat hook, or anything else he could use as a weapon) to grind, it was a cautionary fable about teen bullying, promiscuity, and the importance of swimming lessons. As Film Threat’s David Grove put it, “Long before Jason, and the endless machinations of dumb sequels, Friday the 13th represented the purest form of terror.”Halloween 96%It’s been one of the more thoughtlessly curated franchises in the genre, but before all the cheap sequels and the Rob Zombie reboot, John Carpenter’s Halloween scared the heck out of audiences — and earned almost universal praise from critics — with its smart, minimalistic, and utterly brutal take on the tale of a boy who grows up to be a silent, remorseless serial killer simply because he’s evil. Starring Donald Pleasance as the doctor who pursues the escaped Michael Myers, Jamie Lee Curtis as Myers’ screaming teen quarry, and future Major Payne director Nick Castle as Myers himself, this 1978 classic inspired Roger Ebert to write, “Halloween is an absolutely merciless thriller, a movie so violent and scary that, yes, I would compare it to Psycho.”Idle Hands 15%Blending Cheech and Chong-inspired stoner humor with a soap opera’s casually impermanent approach to death, Idle Hands is one of the more decidedly strange entries in the genre, but it does have a certain kooky charm. The tale of a lazy teen (Devon Sawa) whose right hand becomes possessed and goes on a killing spree, Hands features a pair of undead slackers, bit parts for Fred Willard and Connie Ray, and a final act that includes a scene where the evil disembodied hand is felled via hotboxing. It was not, in other words, a hit with most critics — although Slasherpool’s Andreas Samuelson praised it as “stupid, silly fun with a decent amount of gore and heavy dose of teen humor.”I Know What You Did Last Summer 43%Adding a slick dollop of 1990s style to the “mysterious campaign of bloody revenge for accidental death cover-up” motif previously explored in Prom Night, Jim Gillespie’s I Know What You Did Last Summer united some of the decade’s freshest young faces (including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze, Jr.) against a hook-wielding maniac. Of course, the kids did sort of start it when they ran over a guy and dumped his body in the ocean, but that didn’t make the movie any less enjoyable for the Sacramento Bee’s Joe Baltake, who wrote, “Teasing and taut, I Know What You Did Last Summer is a teen horror flick with a different kind of kick to it.”The Lost Boys 76%Dead teenagers, undead teenagers… for the purposes of our list, one’s as good as the other, especially if it means we get to pay tribute to Joel Schumacher’s oh-so-1980s teen vampire classic, The Lost Boys. Featuring an assortment of the era’s hottest young stars (including Kiefer Sutherland, Jami Gertz, Jason Patric, and Coreys Feldman and Haim), Boys follows the adventures of a pair of brothers (Patric and Haim) who move to the fictional California paradise of Santa Carla, only to discover the darn place is infested with vampires. Fortunately, they meet the vampire-hunting Frog brothers (Feldman and Jamison Newlander), setting in motion a battle between good and evil that has carried over into a pair of sequels (and counting). “The Lost Boys is to horror movies what Late Night With David Letterman is to television,” wrote Caryn James of the New York Times. “It laughs at the form it embraces, adds a rock-and-roll soundtrack and, if you share its serious-satiric attitude, manages to be very funny.”A Nightmare on Elm Street 94%What’s freakier than a serial killer hunting down nubile teens and ripping them to shreds with the razor-tipped fingers of his gross homemade glove? Said serial killer doing it in their dreams. With its devilishly inventive premise, thrillingly gory kills, and a talented cast that included the up-and-coming Johnny Depp, Wes Craven’s original Nightmare on Elm Street proved that high school horror could be scary and smart. “There has never been a movie like it,” argued Cinemaphile’s David Keyes, “and there never will be.”Scream 79%Well, of course. Because if you’re going to send up the “dead teenagers” movie, who better to do it than the guy who directed one of its definitive classics? This Wes Craven-directed deconstruction of teen slasher flicks came along at a real low point for horror at the box office; fittingly, its sharp blend of bloody action and self-aware humor single-handedly revived the genre, spawning an ongoing franchise in the process. “Scream is a rarity,” wrote James Berardinelli for ReelViews, calling it “a horror movie spoof that succeeds almost as well at provoking scares as laughs.”Sleepaway Camp 77%Yeah, it’s a bloody teenage slasher flick that takes place at a summer camp and boasts a shocking twist ending, but Sleepaway Camp isn’t just a ripoff of 1980’s Friday the 13th — it’s actually got a certain sleazy charm of its own. And while its cheerfully low-budget legacy was besmirched somewhat by an increasingly jokey pair of sequels (starring Pamela Springsteen!), that doesn’t take away from the gory charm of what Antagony and Ecstasy’s Tim Brayton called “Not a particularly effective movie…but an exceptionally memorable one — one that lingers in the brain, disturbing and discomfiting.”The Slumber Party Massacre 39%Teen slashers tend to come with descriptive titles, and Slumber Party Massacre fits into that tradition perfectly — there is, indeed, a slumber party, as well as a massacre. But if its title sort of spoils the plot, this 1982 cult classic isn’t without its surprises — including the fact that it was written and directed as a feminist parody of a thoroughly male-dominated genre. Unsurprisingly, the efforts of screenwriter Rita Mae Brown and director Amy Holden Jones sailed over the heads of the studio executives, who marketed the movie by unsubtly flaunting the cast’s most obvious, ahem, assets. Still, the point wasn’t lost on critics like Slant’s Nick Schager, who called it “A gruesome, T&amp;A-filled feminist tract about female fears of mature male sexuality.”Strange Behavior 80%If for no other reason than the fact that it was originally titled Dead Kids, this pulp horror pastiche deserves a place on our list. Starring Michael Murphy as John Brady, an intrepid small-town policeman investigating the mysterious murders of several local teenage boys, Behavior admittedly ventures into some pretty silly sci-fi territory — and limps along under a plot that hinges on a few eyebrow-raising coincidences — but it’s stylishly creepy, and it gets bonus points for having Tangerine Dream on the soundtrack. While calling it “too frequently clumsy to be an unqualified success,” Janet Maslin of the New York Times praised Strange Behavior as “certainly a refreshing departure from the mass-produced Hollywood fare of the moment.”Suspiria 93%Long before the 1990s gave us a stylish coven of teenage witches in The Craft, Dario Argento mined the same territory — with bloodier and altogether more horrifying results — in 1977’s Suspiria. The disturbing tale of an American ballet student (Jessica Harper) who arrives in a prestigious German dance academy, only to discover that it’s under the control of an ancient sorceress named Helena Markos (played, according to Harper, by “a ninety-year-old ex-hooker Dario had found on the streets of Rome”), Suspiria kicked off Argento’s “Three Mothers” trilogy — and won praise from critics like the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr, who argued, “Argento works so hard for his effects — throwing around shock cuts, colored lights, and peculiar camera angles — that it would be impolite not to be a little frightened.”The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 89%Poor Sally and Franklin Hardesty. All they wanted to do was check on their grandfather’s gravestone to make sure nobody was vandalizing it — they even enlisted some of their friends to come along for their thoughtful errand — and what did they get for their trouble? Chased around rural Texas by a chainsaw-wielding maniac and his cannibalistic, inbred family. No, being responsible family members didn’t work out so well for the Hardesty kids, but it paid bloody dividends for filmgoers — and for critics like Eye for Film’s Anton Bitel, who praised what he saw as “some of the most prolonged scenes of sustained panic ever captured by cinema” and wrote, “Hooper infects characters and viewers alike with the thrill of a madness from which there can be no real escape.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But he’s never had his own Total Recall, so in honor of his supporting turn as the tight-seated Reverend Shaw Moore in Craig Brewer’s Footloose remake, we decided to take a look at some of the brightest highlights from the DQ filmography. Which of your favorites made the list? Read on to find out! 82%10. InnerspacePretty much the definition of a high-concept 1980s comedy, Joe Dante’s Innerspace stars Martin Short as a neurotic grocery store clerk who’s accidentally injected with a solution containing a miniaturized test pilot (played by Dennis Quaid) who’s being hunted by criminals (led by Fiona Shaw, Robert Picardo, and Dante favorite Kevin McCarthy) that want to steal the top-secret technology that shrunk him to microscopic size. Boasting laughs, romance, and high adventure, it was an inexplicable failure at the box office, but it was warmly received by critics like Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Here is an absurd, unwieldy, overplotted movie that nevertheless is entertaining — and some of the fun comes from the way the plot keeps laying it on.” 83%9. The Long RidersQuaid made a rare onscreen appearance alongside his big brother Randy — not to mention the Keach, Carradine, and Guest brothers — in this Walter Hill Western about the James-Younger gang. Casting four real-life sets of brothers as four real-life sets of brothers could have been a pretty cheap gimmick, but Hill (working from a script co-written by Stacy and James Keach) kept things appropriately gritty, aided by ace soundtrack work from Ry Cooder. “Hill is very much in the American grain,” observed TIME’s Richard Schickel, calling the director “the inheritor of the Ford-Hawks-Walsh tradition of artful, understated action film making.” 84%8. The RookieAh, the inspirational sports drama. Every film fan has seen enough of them that we can sense every beat in the storyline coming half an hour away, but if they’re done right, we still can’t resist welling up when our scrappy protagonist overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles in the final act — and Quaid, who learned a thing or two about the genre when he filmed Breaking Away, scored again with 2002’s The Rookie. Based on the undeniably film-worthy true story of pitcher Jim Morris, who broke into the big leagues at the thoroughly unlikely age of 35, this artfully assembled, family-friendly hit overcame most critics’ cynical misgivings. Admitted the New York Times’ Stephen Holden, “As averse as I usually am to feel-good, follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies, this one got to me.” 83%7. In Good CompanyWith a beautiful family, a nice house in the suburbs, and a healthy career, Dan Foreman (Quaid) is feeling pretty good about his life. And then it all goes topsy-turvy: his wife (Marg Helgenberger) announces she’s pregnant, the company he works for is bought out, and his much younger new boss (Topher Grace) starts dating his 18-year-old daughter (Scarlett Johansson) behind his back. Clearly, In Good Company‘s premise is fraught with soapy domestic melodrama, and according to some critics, that’s all it had to offer — but for most, the solid cast and sensitive work of director Paul Weitz made the film more than the sum of its parts. In fact, according to the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris, it was “not only the best American picture of 2004, but also the most grown-up movie to come from Hollywood in recent years.” 86%6. The Parent TrapPersonal issues temporarily derailed Quaid’s film career in the mid-to-late 1990s, leading to ill-advised choices like his part in the Jim Belushi/Tupac Shakur vehicle Gang Related, but just when it looked like he was headed off into the direct-to-DVD sunset, he rediscovered his knack for choosing solid scripts and started popping up as an older, wiser version of his raffish 1980s screen persona. Surprising case in point: Disney’s 1998 version of The Parent Trap, a remake that no one asked for, but which still managed to win over critics and audiences with its frothy blend of wholesome humor and charming performances (led by Lindsay Lohan, making her film debut). “Every once in a while,” wrote Scott Renshaw, “uncomplicated and inoffensive fun feels just right.” 87%5. Far From HeavenQuaid earned some of the finest accolades of his career — including a Golden Globe nomination — for his work in this Todd Haynes drama, which mimics the style of Douglas Sirk’s 1950s romances to tell the story of a suburban housewife (Julianne Moore) whose seemingly idyllic world is turned upside down when she walks in on her husband (Quaid) with another man. Although the role only fell to Quaid after passing through the hands of James Gandolfini, Russell Crowe, and Jeff Bridges, he made the most of it, plumbing the depths of his character’s anguish with what Premiere’s Glenn Kenny called a “multileveled, perfectly modulated, frankly amazing performance.” 84%4. Postcards from the EdgeDennis Quaid has played a lot of flawed heroes and lovable cads during his time in Hollywood, but it’s rare that you see him in the part of a character who’s a complete and utter heel. One notable exception: 1990’s Postcards from the Edge, adapted from Carrie Fisher’s semi-autobiographical novel about an actress with a substance abuse problem (Meryl Streep) and issues with her mother (Shirley MacLaine). As a sleazy producer who takes advantage of Streep without the slightest bit of remorse, Quaid took what was very much a supporting role — but then, in a movie starring Streep and MacLaine, pretty much everything else has to come second. “In this era of postverbal cinema,” wrote TIME’s Richard Corliss, “Postcards proves that movie dialogue can still carry the sting, heft and meaning of the finest old romantic comedy.” 95%3. Breaking AwayQuaid’s looks earned him a lot of attention early in his career, but he was always more than a pretty face — and he started proving it with his first film roles, particularly his layered turn in Peter Yates’ Breaking Away as Mike, a mouthy small-town teen with a chip on his shoulder. Like the film’s other characters, Mike could have been a lifeless archetype, but Quaid invested him with the kind of depth anyone could relate to — even if they’d never lived in Indiana and didn’t care about cycling. “There are a few moments when the picture’s easygoing pace turns into wobbliness,” admitted TIME’s Richard Schickel, “but these are insignificant compared with its many moments of shrewd insight into the lives of amusingly shaded but very recognizable human beings.” 89%2. The Big EasyAn early and enduring critical favorite, The Big Easy was a concerted move to the mainstream for director Jim McBride, who cut his teeth on stuff like the X-rated apocalyptic fantasy Glen and Randa. It captured Quaid at his Hollywood heartthrob peak, chucking him into the bayou with a never-sultrier Ellen Barkin for a sex-drenched neo-noir about police corruption (and, it must be noted, really good music). Easy wasn’t a huge hit — it grossed less than $18 million during its theatrical run — but its cult has grown over the years, affirming the words of critics like the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, who enthused, “This is one movie that lives up to its billing; it’s easy all right. Like falling off a log.” 96%1. The Right StuffIt’s based on one of America’s most inspiring true stories, it features an ace ensemble cast, and it earned rave reviews from critics — so why did audiences turn their backs on The Right Stuff during its 1983 theatrical run? The fact that it’s more than three hours long probably had something to do with it, but in writer/director Philip Kaufman’s defense, it’s hard to think of a better way to tell the story of NASA’s famed “Mercury Seven.” As astronaut Gordon Cooper, Quaid held his own against talented co-stars such as Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn, and Ed Harris; together, they helped create the four-time Oscar winner that Roger Ebert recommended by writing, “It joins a short list of recent American movies that might be called experimental epics: movies that have an ambitious reach through time and subject matter, that spend freely for locations or special effects, but that consider each scene as intently as an art film.”In case you were wondering, here are Quaid’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Right Stuff — 87%2. Breaking Away — 84%3. Soul Surfer — 80%4. Frequency — 78%5. Far From Heaven — 77%6. The Express — 73%7. Gang Related — 72%8. Any Given Sunday — 70%9. The Long Riders — 70%10.

And why not? Spies are suave, they lead lives of dashing high adventure, and they make their own rules. They’re also pretty easy to make fun of, judging from the number of screwball spy spoofs Hollywood has given us over the last few decades. From Woody Allen and Mike Myers to Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase, the secret agent parody has been a hallowed rite of passage for some of our finest funnymen. This week, with Rowan Atkinson returning to the genre in Johnny English Reborn (tagline: “One Man. One Mission. No Chance”), we decided now would be the perfect time to take a fond look back at some of our favorite clueless, bumbling, and/or completely accidental spies. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is Total Recall!Austin Powers – International Man of Mystery 72%With one of the most successful post-SNL careers out there, Mike Myers has given us a long line of memorable characters — slacker icon Wayne Campbell, lovable oaf Shrek, and the chunk-toothed international man of mystery, Austin Powers. Bringing the spy spoof genre out of dormancy in 1997 (just as GoldenEye did for the Bond series two years earlier), Myers gave us the often-randy misadventures of Powers, followed by two blockbuster, critically drubbed sequels. But “when you watch Mike Myers in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, you remember why he became a star on Saturday Night Live and in Wayne’s World,” wrote Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman.Carry on Spying 83%The cheeky Carry On geezers were the first to skewer their countryman James Bond — as well as Graham Greene, The Maltese Falcon, and others — in this 1964 romp, which is rife with the comedy troupe’s trademark ribald innuendo. With characters called naughty names like Agents Crump, Honeybutt and Bind — aka Agent 000, or Double O, Oh! — and doing battle with the evil criminal syndicate STENCH (the Society for the Total Extinction of Non-Conforming Humans), Carry On Spying is typically bawdy, but it also manages its share of clever spy satire. Indeed, as TV Guide declared, “it’s “One of the bright spots in the Carry On series.”Casino Royale 26%Ian Fleming’s first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, initially found its way to the big screen as a direct satire of the character in 1967, comprised of a series of sight gags, campy innuendo, and psychedelic mind trips that culminates in one big, chaotic orgy of lunacy. Cherry picking elements from the book, the film stars David Niven as the “original” 007, now retired, who’s asked to discover why international agents are turning up dead or missing. Unfortunately, the film was fraught with all kinds of problems off screen — Peter Sellers quit midway through the production due to beef with Orson Welles, and the movie burned through several directors and rewrites — and it shows in the final product. Nevertheless, a few critics defended the film, like the Northwest Herald’s Jeffrey Westhoff, who called it “so bizarre, so wrongheaded, and so overblown that it’s actually enjoyable.”Get Smart 51%Back in the 1960s, Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created a TV series called Get Smart specifically to poke fun at both James Bond and Inspector Clousseau. Contemporary audiences were reintroduced to Agent 86 in the form of Steve Carrell in 2006’s Get Smart, in which an inexperienced desk jockey (Carell) is promoted during a time of emergency and paired up with spy veteran Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway) to bring down the evil crime syndicate KAOS. Despite Carell’s natural charm and a solid supporting cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Alan Arkin, and Terence Stamp, critics largely considered Get Smart merely adequate as a spoof of the genre, but a few, like Rich Cline of Shadows on the Wall, found that “the film doesn’t have the sharp hysteria of the series, and it gets a bit over-serious at times, but it’s still a thoroughly entertaining film with terrific characters all its own.”Modesty Blaise 44%A high-water mark of 1960s movie camp, Modesty Blaise goes so far into surreal silliness that it may be the first spy spoof to parody itself — that is, if you can make much sense of the gonzo grooviness. Based on a tongue-in-cheek British comic strip featuring the titular Bondette, Blaise stars Italian actress Monica Vitti as a globetrotting, leather-jumpsuit-wearing heroine recruited by British intelligence to tangle with a diamond thief (Dirk Bogarde) and the era’s most garish pop art sets. Critics were largely baffled at the time, though the movie has since garnered a cult, even subversive reputation over the years — as Derek Adams of Time Out noted: “Under the non-stop stream of jokes lies a bitter edge of malice, directed not only against the genre itself but against a society which trusts its politicians and its generals.”OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies 77%French slapstick is famously known to have a hard time appealing abroad, with exception made to spy joints OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies and OSS 117: Lost in Rio, which riff on a range of targets, including James Bond and the OSS 117 series itself. Its origin lies in a series of French spy espionage books, and subsequent films based on those books. Resurrecting OSS 177 in 2006, director Michel Hazanavicius and comedian Juan Dujardin dress the character up in a satirical tux. “[The] movie travels familiar ground, with a nod to Airplane, Top Secret and that whole genre,” Roger Ebert writes, “Even compared to them, it pushes things just a little — not too far, but toward the loony.”Our Man Flint 77%Given the absurdities inherent in the James Bond movies, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that 007 parodies were everywhere in the mid-1960s. Our Man Flint succeeded better than most thanks to a suave performance from James Coburn as shagadelic super spy Derek Flint. The silliest aspects of the Bond films are skewered here: we’ve got the acronym-happy organizations, remarkably versatile gadgets (including a cigar lighter with 83 different uses), and armies of bikinied babes. In other words, Our Man Flint was doing the Austin Powers thing while Sean Connery was still playing Bond. “Coburn is plainly enjoying himself so much, and the trimmings are so stylish, that it’s impossible not to enjoy,” wrote Kim Newman of Empire Magazine.Spies Like Us 32%John Landis (Animal House, Coming to America) must have had a lot of fun back in the 1970s and 1980s, crafting legendary comedies with some of the best talent around. In 1985, the director paired up with Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase for this send-up of Cold War era international espionage, in which the two SNL vets play bumbling, wannabe agents who are dropped into Soviet territory as decoys but end up completing the mission themselves. Full of one-liners, visual gags, and explosions, Spies Like Us was a little too silly to be a true actioner but, in the eyes of most critics, also a little too thin on effective humor to make for a fully entertaining comedy. Still, the film is not without its fans, like Moviehole’s Clint Morris, who concedes that Spies Like Us “meddles uneasily between comedy and action-adventure, but Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd keep you watching right way through.”Top Secret! 75%How silly can you get? Well, when you’re in expert spoofmeisters Zucker-Abraham-Zucker’s world, the answer is, pretty silly. Top Secret! successfully lampoons both espionage flicks and Elvis Presley musicals with staggering levity — it’s pretty amazing how many stereotypes, pop culture references, and goofy sight gags are packed into this movie without it feeling too busy. Val Kilmer is Nick Rivers, a vapid American singer who rocks the Soviet bloc on a goodwill tour, but soon finds himself joining forces with a ragtag bunch of French Resistance fighters with names like Avant Garde and Chocolate Mousse. Few movies walk the divide between smart and stupid as deftly as Top Secret!; as Variety wrote, the movie “shares the same wonderful wacky attitude that allows just about any kind of gag to come flowing in and out of the picture at the strangest times.”Undercover Brother 78%The words “starring Eddie Griffin, Chris Kattan, and Denise Richards” aren’t generally a sign that you’re about to see a classic film, but this fast-paced spy spoof is loads better than anything titled Undercover Brother has any right to be. Satirizing James Bond and blaxploitation in one fell, impeccably Afroed swoop, it offers the best of both worlds: enough wacky humor to include Richards as a character named “White She-Devil,” and enough thought-provoking subtext to inspire Film Threat’s Marcus D. Russell to argue, “a strong case could be made to use this as the initial tool in our school systems to begin serious discussions about race and class.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

The mercury is rising, schools are closing their doors, wardrobes are shrinking, and folks all across this great nation are getting ready to go on — you guessed it — summer vacation! In honor of our collective yearning to clock out of work, buckle the family into the minivan, and head off for sunny adventures, we’ve decided to dedicate this week’s Total Recall to movies that revolve in some way around summer vacation. We picked a few classics, but we tried to include a few surprises, too — all in the name of giving you a well-rounded list with room for comedy, drama, dancing, and even a little sci-fi. Are you ready for the summer?Dirty Dancing (1987)  69%Dirty Dancing director Emile Ardolino didn’t use actual mountains of cheese to stand in for the Catskills, but he may as well have; this tale of a brooding dance instructor at a swanky resort (Patrick Swayze) who falls for a wealthy teenage guest (Jennifer Grey) during the summer of 1963 is filled to the brim with pungent dialogue and plot devices. But underneath the schmaltz beats an endearingly earnest heart — and some pretty good dance moves, as noted by Steve Rhodes, who wrote that “the film’s saving grace is that fully a third of the film has the actors dancing rather than talking.”Watch TrailerThe Endless Summer (1966)  100%For a lot of us, summer loses its promise of fun and freedom as we get older and assume responsibilities that can’t be set aside for three months at a time. What if you could not only recapture that youthful summer feeling, but keep it going all year long? That’s the question posed by Bruce Brown’s classic documentary, which follows a pair of surfers (Mike Hynson and Robert August) as they pursue the summer surfing season across the globe, from California to Africa, Australia, and beyond. The Endless Summer boasts a killer soundtrack and Brown’s style was groundbreaking for the genre at the time, but — and probably most importantly — it’s just a really entertaining film. As Christopher Null wrote for Filmcritic, “you can’t help but laugh and feel good while watching their lighthearted antics.”Watch TrailerLast Summer (1969)  78%For teenagers, the summer is often seen as a time of reinvention — an opportunity to try new experiences and adopt different behaviors away from the judgment of classmates who know who they “really” are. This kind of experimentation can produce unintended results, as demonstrated in Frank Perry’s Last Summer, which follows four deceptively worldly teens (played by Barbara Hershey, Bruce Davison, Richard Thomas, and Catherine Burns, who earned an Oscar nomination) through a Fire Island vacation that tests their darkest and most selfish impulses. The film’s explicit content originally cost it an X rating, but it was that brutal honesty that appealed to critics like Roger Ebert, who wrote, “There are good movies about other people’s lives, but rarely a movie that recalls, if only for a scene or two, the sense and flavor of life the way you remember it.”Meatballs (1979)  72%The summer camp comedy is pure formula, but it can be a winning one with the right ingredients. Case in point: Bill Murray and director Ivan Reitman, who kicked off their American film careers with this harmlessly raunchy look at a week in the life of Camp North Star, where lackadaisical counselor Tripper (Murray) helps a misfit camper (Chris Makepeace) come out of his shell just in time to give the rich kids over at Camp Mohawk a taste of their own medicine. “You don’t mind the lack of structure,” noted Filmcritic’s Pete Croatto, “especially since it’s delivered by a good-natured and good-humored young cast.”Watch TrailerMr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962)  80%Decades before Chevy Chase blundered his way across the country in National Lampoon’s Vacation, Jimmy Stewart suffered through his own surprisingly stressful family getaway. Surrounded by a mismatched brood that includes four children (two of whom are married with kids of their own) and a wife whose well-meaning vacation rental turns out to be a dilapidated house of horrors, Stewart’s Mr. Hobbs is forced to “relax” by warding off bats, fixing a water pump, and bribing a teenage boy (played by Fabian) to pay attention to his brace-faced daughter. Not exactly cutting-edge comedy, even in 1962, but as Reel’s James Plath pointed out, “Stewart’s performance alone makes this an entertaining film.”Watch TrailerNational Lampoon's Vacation (1983)  93%For everyone who ever suffered through a hellish forced march through “quality time” gone wrong with the family, National Lampoon’s Vacation is a soothing (and laugh-out-loud funny) reminder that you are not alone. Chevy Chase was never more squarely in his wheelhouse than when he played the arrogant, incompetent, but ultimately sweet-natured Clark Griswold, and many of his funniest moments (not to mention most quotable lines) come in the original Vacation. Even Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader had to laugh, noting, “Despite plenty of gross-out gags and dumb slapstick bits, the careful viewer can occasionally detect some acrid and original satire in this 1983 film.”Watch TrailerOne Crazy Summer (1986)  56%Savage Steve Holland followed up his classic Better Off Dead by reuniting with John Cusack for this equally madcap — albeit far more uneven — tale of an aspiring cartoonist who spends the summer after high school in Nantucket, where he gets mixed up with a singer (Demi Moore) and her quest to save her grandfather’s home from a wealthy local family. Sadly, One Crazy Summer failed to generate much heat at the box office, despite Holland’s flair for the absurd, a charming cast (which also included Curtis Armstrong as the unforgettably named Ack Ack Raymond), and reviews from critics like Gregory Weinkauf of the New Times, who asked, “Remember fun? This movie does.”Watch TrailerOn Golden Pond (1981)  93%In a marvelously successful example of art imitating life, Jane Fonda purchased the film rights to Ernest Thompson’s novel about a fractured family’s lakeside summer and used it to build an onscreen parallel to her relationship with her own father — and the film’s eventual star. On Golden Pond went on to gross over $100 million and earned 10 Academy Awards nominations, including Best Actor and Best Actress wins for Henry Fonda (in his final role) and Katharine Hepburn, and although its scenes of lovingly photographed wilderness and overdue familial bonding struck some critics as overly sentimental, most scribes couldn’t deny the power of its expertly assembled cast. Sighed Time’s Richard Schickel, “When it sometimes seems the whole society has spiritually decamped for Tinseltown, the movie offers the hope that people can come home again — at least for a visit.”Watch TrailerSpaceCamp (Space Camp) (1986)  45%A movie about kids spending their summer at a NASA space camp probably wouldn’t have been very exciting, so this family-friendly 1986 actioner (adapted from the book by Patrick Bailey and Larry B. Williams) threw in a sentient robot who hears a camper (played by Joaquin Phoenix) daydreaming about going into space and decides to make his wish come true. Hobbled by poor reviews and an ill-timed release four months after the Challenger explosion, SpaceCamp nonetheless entertained critics like Nina Darnton of the New York Times, who wasn’t looking for anything more than a “cheerful, optimistic space-age film” and “a wholesome and fun-filled summertime diversion.”Watch TrailerSummer of '42 (1971)  79%It’s a coming-of-age movie about sex-obsessed teenagers during a bygone era, but Summer of ’42 is no Porky’s; instead, this is a sweetly nostalgic look back at a few memorable months in the youth of screenwriter Herman Raucher, who learned some lifelong lessons about love and friendship as a 15-year-old boy on Nantucket Island. Boasting a $20 million return on its $1 million budget, Summer was one of the most profitable films of the 1970s — and a runaway success at the bookstore, where Raucher’s novelization of his screenplay helped generate interest in the movie before it had even reached theaters. “Summer of ’42 is a memory movie,” wrote Vincent Canby of the New York Times, calling it “written, directed and acted with such uncommon good humor that I don’t think you’ll be put off by its sweet soft-focus, at least until you start analyzing it afterwards.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;","section":"Total Recall","tags":"aliens, of, GoT, 2021, Unbreakable, Us, international, heist, Premium, cancelled, song, Channel, cartoon, Showtime","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Dirty-Dancing.jpg","slug":"total-recall-best-summer-vacation-movies"},{"id":"47508981198366","title":"Total Recall: Antonio Banderas’ Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Antonio Banderas' Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Puss in Boots star.by Jeff Giles | October 27, 2011 |  CommentsTo a lot of American filmgoers, Antonio Banderas is the suave Latin heartthrob who came out of nowhere in the 1990s to star in some hits (Desperado, Evita, The Mask of Zorro) and some big misses (Assassins, Never Talk to Strangers, Play It to the Bone). But as film buffs know, Banderas is more than just the guy who co-starred in the worst-reviewed movie of the aughts. He’s built up an admirably diverse filmography over the last 30 years, and with two movies — his reunion with Pedro Almodóvar, The Skin I Live In, and this weekend’s Shrek spinoff, Puss in Boots — now playing in theaters, we decided this would be the perfect time to revisit some of the many critical highlights from his career. ¡Es tiempo para la Retirada Total! 75%10. FridaFrida is absolutely Salma Hayek’s showcase, but for her Oscar-nominated turn in the central role of the Frida Kahlo biopic, director Julie Taymor surrounded Hayek with an impressive array of talented supporting players, including Alfred Molina, Edward Norton, Geoffrey Rush, Ashley Judd, and — as Kahlo’s fellow artist David Alfaro Siqueiros — Antonio Banderas. It all adds up to a film that is, in the words of Susan Stark of the Detroit News, “Passionate, provocative, hilarious, tragic and just dizzyingly beautiful to behold.” 80%9. PhiladelphiaA year after making his English-language debut in The Mambo Kings, Banderas took a supporting role in a much more high-profile film: Jonathan Demme’s Philadelphia, which used its gaudy pedigree and a marquee cast led by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington to break box-office taboos surrounding homosexuality, HIV, and AIDS. Hanks earned an Academy Award for his performance, one of two Oscars won by the film, and audiences turned out to the tune of more than $205 million in worldwide grosses. “It’s less like a film by Demme than the best of Frank Capra,” observed Rita Kempley for the Washington Post. “It is not just canny, corny and blatantly patriotic, but compassionate, compelling and emotionally devastating.” 81%8. The Mambo KingsWarner Bros. wanted Ray Liotta for the role — and even after director Arne Glimcher successfully fought to cast Banderas in his English-language debut, he had to learn his lines phonetically. But 1992’s The Mambo Kings ultimately proved to be the international breakthrough Banderas had been working toward for a decade, and for good reason — his character’s tragic tale underscores the film’s story of musical passion and brotherly love, and his performance more than held its own with co-star Armand Assante’s. “In some ways this story is as old as the movies,” admitted Roger Ebert, “but The Mambo Kings is so filled with energy, passion and heedless vitality that it seems new, anyway.” 83%7. The Mask of ZorroBy the 1990s, the masked bandit Zorro had appeared in countless books, serials, TV shows, and more than a dozen feature-length films — but it wasn’t until Antonio Banderas signed on for The Mask of Zorro that the character was actually portrayed by a Spanish actor. (And yes, even then, he took over for the original Zorro — played in the film by Anthony Hopkins.) Rebooting such a venerable (some would say “tired”) character might have seemed like a recipe for disaster, but Mask swashbuckled its way to a $250 million worldwide gross and reaped praise from critics like the BBC’s Almar Haflidason, who enthused, “There are no clever ground-breaking effects, just lashings of good clean fun with desperately devilish baddies, and good guys so fantastic, so clever and witty, that they make you want to weep with pleasure.” 90%6. Women on the Verge of a Nervous BreakdownBanderas and Pedro Almodóvar reunited for their fourth film in 1988, and the result proved an international breakthrough for both men. While it didn’t inspire quite as much critical adoration as their earlier outings, Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown still offered plenty of vintage Almodóvar, starting with a plot that revolves around tainted gazpacho, Shiite terrorists, and the all-consuming love between an actress (Carmen Maura) and her on-again, off-again boyfriend (Fernando Guillén). “Women on the Verge is even wackier than [Almodovar’s] other films,” observed Chris Hicks of the Deseret News. “It also just happens to be more universal.” 89%5. Shrek 2The law of diminishing returns tends to apply to sequels whether or not they’re successful, but when you’re talking about a critical and commercial winner as powerful as Shrek, the odds of turning in a second installment that exceeds the original are pretty slim. Shrek 2 beat the odds, due in part to a thoroughly enjoyable storyline that retained the humorous dynamic and fairytale mythology of the original while introducing terrific supporting characters — like, say, Puss in Boots (Banderas). “This fractured, very showbizzy deconstruction of fairy tales is in many ways the Godfather: Part II of animations,” wrote Joe Baltake of the Sacramento Bee, arguing that “it tops its successful predecessor.” 93%4. Spy KidsBy 2001, Banderas’ film career had cooled considerably from its mid-1990s peak, thanks to a series of duds such as Play It to the Bone and Two Much (although he met his eventual second wife, Melanie Griffith, on the set of the latter, so maybe we should call that one a draw). He started turning things around with his role in Robert Rodriguez’s family action-adventure hit Spy Kids, using his heroic flair as well as his comedic chops to support the antics of on-screen kids Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. The end result earned Banderas nominations from the ALMA and Kids’ Choice Awards — and they were, in the words of the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Carrie Rickey, “A delight for 7-year-olds, their parents, and James Bond diehards everywhere.” 92%3. MatadorPedro Almodóvar dismissed Matador as one of his weakest films, but the critics strongly disagreed: both he and Banderas earned raves for their work in this typically lurid tale of a junior matador whose yearning to prove his manhood to a washed-up colleague (Nacho Martinez) leads him to try and rape the older man’s girlfriend — and then confess to a series of murders he didn’t commit. “Matador baits every bull imaginable — murder, mutilation, suicide and rape being just a few of “Matador’s” popcorn-incompatible themes,” observed Desson Howe of the Washington Post. “But the Spanish director swirls his cape over these chargers so imaginatively, shamelessly and inventively, his flamboyance wins the day.” 91%2. Labyrinth of PassionWhat do you get when you cross the death of 40-year dictator Francisco Franco, the Spanish sexual revolution, and the singular gifts of writer/director Pedro Almodóvar? The effervescent, utterly cuckoo Labyrinth of Passion, which follows the adventures of a sex-addicted singer (Cecilia Roth), a gay Middle Eastern prince (Imanol Arias), and the young terrorist who loves him (Banderas). It all sounds a little like a 12:45 AM Fred Armisen sketch on Saturday Night Live, but it works — and according to critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, it “shows off the bright, gaudy visual style, the breezy manner and the exuberant energy that are Mr. Almodóvar’s particular virtues.” 100%1. Law of DesireHalf wrenching drama, half dizzying sexual whirlwind, Almodóvar’s Law of Desire rests on the love triangle sparked when a gay filmmaker (Eusebio Poncela) steps out on his long-term boyfriend with a young fan (Banderas) who becomes smitten after their one-night stand. Complicating matters further is Poncela’s relationship with his transsexual sister, who ultimately becomes an unwitting pawn in Banderas’ campaign to win him at any cost. As is Almodóvar’s wont, Desire hinges on larger-than-life characters and rather outlandish plot developments, but it also has a depth and empathy that led critics like Marjorie Baumgarten to hail it as a “spectacle of flamboyant melodrama, murder, and amnesia.”In case you were wondering, here are Banderas’ top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown — 88%2. Philadelphia — 87%3. Interview with the Vampire — 85%4. Frida — 83%5. Desperado — 79%6. Law of Desire — 79%7. Take the Lead — 78%8. Matador — 75%9.

Disney is celebrating with the appropriately titled Prom, in which the social event of the season affects the lives and relationships of an eclectic cast that includes Zach Braff, Jere Burns, and Aimee Teegarden, and it got us thinking about some of the more memorable proms in Hollywood history. From teen comedies to action, musicals, and horror, prom has been a popular theme over the years — so hit the dance floor with us for an especially well-dressed Total Recall!American Pie 61%If it’s senior year and you’re a horny quartet of high school virgins determined to lose your virginity (virginities?) before graduation, prom is probably going to be the most important night of the year for you — and so it is with 1999’s joyously profane American Pie, which follows the hapless, fumbling, and very funny exploits of four friends with one thing on their minds. True, it spun off a pair of unnecessary sequels before tumbling into a direct-to-video shame spiral, but this Pie was a $235 million smash for a reason — as Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide wrote, it’s “An often raunchy, sometimes hilarious and occasionally touching story of hormones gone mad.”Back to the Future 96%When you’re in high school, the prom can feel like the kind of crucial experience your life depends on — but for the time-traveling Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) in Back to the Future, it’s really true: if he doesn’t make sure his parents smooch at the big dance, they’ll never get married and have him, and he’ll never get to drive a DeLorean or audition his hard-rockin’ high school band for a sternly disapproving Huey Lewis. That’s pretty heavy, but Future never gets too tangled up in its metaphysical implications, opting instead for an irresistible blend of action, adventure, and comedy. “To put it bluntly,” wrote Empire’s Adam Smith, “if you don’t like Back to the Future, it’s difficult to believe that you like films at all.”Buffy the Vampire Slayer 36%It’s always a drag when someone crashes your prom, but what really (ahem) sucks is having to deal with an uninvited vampire king who’s determined to destroy your school’s resident hot blonde cheerleader/vampire slayer. Audiences seemed to agree in 1992, tuning out Buffy the Vampire Slayer at the box office — and critics shared their disdain, with Janet Maslin of the New York Times offering what passed for praise by calling it “a slight, good-humored film that’s a lot more painless than might have been expected” — but screenwriter Joss Whedon had the last laugh, turning Buffy into a long-running TV franchise that spun off another series, comics, and untold volumes of fan fiction.Carrie 93%The prom can certainly feel like a horror show, what with all the date- and dress-related stress, not to mention the weight of expectations that can go along with that whole “rite of passage” thing. But with 1976’s Carrie, director Brian De Palma — working from the Stephen King novel — turned prom into a full-on gonzo frightfest, complete with pig’s blood, screaming death, and property destruction. It’s the kind of thing that could easily descend into self-parody, but under all the mayhem, Carrie touches on timeless themes, and is grounded by nuanced performances from a cast led by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie. Roger Ebert called it “an absolutely spellbinding horror movie, with a shock at the end that’s the best thing along those lines since the shark leaped aboard in Jaws.”Footloose 52%What’s a big-city kid to do when he takes his artfully tousled hair and fancy moves to a small town, only to be told dancing and rock music aren’t allowed? Walkman-sporting folk hero Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) only had one choice: to organize an illegal prom and demonstrate the magic that happens when everybody cut, everybody cut Footloose. An $80 million hit in spite of general critical disapproval, Footloose has become something of a generational touchstone for filmgoers of a certain age, thanks in part to the exuberance and scruffy appeal recognized by the New York Times’ Janet Maslin, who wrote, “Like the rest of today’s video-happy teen-age entertainments, Footloose doesn’t expect to be watched closely or taken seriously. It wants to fill the screen with catchy music and pretty kids, and this it certainly accomplishes.”&nbsp;Grease 75%Filmmakers have used all sorts of methods to inflate the drama of prom, but only Grease added a nationally televised dance contest — complete with climactic on-camera mooning — and topped it off with the classic ballad “It’s Raining on Prom Night.” A wildly successful synthesis of manufactured 1950s nostalgia and surprisingly frank depictions of timeless teen ribaldry, Grease was a huge smash hit at the box office ($394 million and counting) — and also a favorite with critics like Vincent Canby of the New York Times, who saw through its anachronistic setting in his review: “Its sensibility is not tied to the past but to a free-wheeling, well informed, high-spirited present.”Never Been Kissed 55%Offering a tale of vicarious triumph (albeit of the rather contrived and highly unlikely variety) for anyone who never made it to their prom, Never Been Kissed tells the story of Chicago Sun-Times copy editor Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore), whose latest assignment involves doing undercover at a local high school to expose the truth about modern teenagers’ lives. Problem is, Josie’s high school years were a horror show that culminated with her being pelted with eggs by her supposed prom date — so not only does she need to get her story, she has to face down the lingering shame of her years as “Josie Grossie.” Will she finally be asked to the prom? Will it all end in an impassioned speech to the student body and a last-minute romantic confession? Never Been Kissed was an $84 million hit, but it wasn’t exactly original, as the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris admitted when he called it “The most exhilarating American movie I have seen this year — which isn’t saying much.”Pretty in Pink 73%It’s got a John Hughes script, Andrew McCarthy as a preppie doofus, Jon Cryer as a misfit, and Molly Ringwald as a teen princess-in-waiting; Pretty in Pink may not be the quintessential 1980s high school movie, but it’s definitely high on the list. And it definitely belongs on this list, thanks to an angst-packed climax involving a broken date, an impassioned shouting match on the dance floor, and Duckie tripping the light fantastic with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Film buffs have debated Pink‘s final act since Andie Walsh walked off into the sunset with Blane, but even if you think Hughes copped out with the ending, it’s easy to see where Filmcritic’s Christopher Null was coming from when he wrote, “It may not be the greatest love story ever told, but it might be the one with the most heart.”10 Things I Hate About You 69%With an assist from William Shakespeare, and a pair of breakout performances from Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles, Gil Junger’s 10 Things I Hate About You put a glossy late 1990s spin on The Taming of the Shrew by switching the location to a modern high school, where the Stratford sisters (Stiles and Larisa Oleynik) are the unwitting pawns in a prom date plot set in motion by a lovestruck young knucklehead (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his scheming classmate (Andrew Keegan). It’s pretty fluffy stuff, and as broad as a barn door, but its snappy pace and charming cast left some critics feeling charitable — Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it “as satirical as it is romantic” and “one teen film that is wise enough to span generations in its appeal.”Valley Girl 83%Other movies on this list have glitzier production values, more impressive dancing, and more freshly groomed kids. None of them, however, boast a soundtrack as cool as Valley Girl‘s — or the endearingly laconic talents of Nicolas Cage in his young, pre-Ghost Rider prime. Underneath its dated fashions and faddish dialogue, it’s made from ingredients that are either timeless or overused, depending on your point of view — the girl and the guy from different sides of the tracks; the obnoxious rich kids; the big finish at the prom — but what it lacks in originality, Valley Girl more than makes up in irreverent charm. “Director Martha Coolidge turned a short-lived fad into a genuine sleeper,” recalled Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader, calling it “an exploitation film that thoroughly transcends its origins to become a highly appealing romantic comedy.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But even if the scripts got worse, Hauer’s steely glare and commanding screen presence only improved with age — and he’s put them to use in a recent string of successful films, including Sin City and Batman Begins. With Rutger appearing alongside Anthony Hopkins in this weekend’s The Rite, we knew now was the perfect time to take a look back at his brightest critical highlights. It’s time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=10355[/tomatometer]10. LadyhawkeA marked departure for its young star Matthew Broderick, who was mostly known for playing the wisecracking protagonist of WarGames, Richard Donner’s Ladyhawke blended lush medieval fantasy with 1980s synth pop to tell the tale of an exiled knight (Hauer) and his betrothed (Michelle Pfeiffer), separated by the curse of a jealous bishop (John Wood) — and the escaped thief (Broderick) who becomes a crucial ally in their quest to reunite. Audiences didn’t quite know what to make of Laydhawke during its theatrical run, and mostly stayed away, but most critics enjoyed it — including Jeffrey Overstreet of Looking Closer, who enthused, “We need more fantasy like this: high adventure, brilliant swordplay, convincing magic, three-dimensional characters, arresting cinematography, and best of all, a good story.”[tomatometer]MovieID=405589450[/tomatometer]9. Simon MagusA period drama with a mystical bent, Simon Magus takes place in a 19th-century European village, where a poor young man (Stuart Townsend) and a wealthy, unscrupulous businessman (Sean McGinley) vie for the right to build a train station that will attract travelers on the nearby railroad, whose path has dried up tourism and brought economic hard times. As the eccentric landowner who cares more about poetry than material wealth, Hauer had a chance to prove he was capable of playing characters who aren’t warriors or villains — and to take part in a film that Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised by writing, “Poetic and ambiguous, it manages to be magical in both the beautiful and terrifying senses of the word.”[tomatometer]MovieID=16043[/tomatometer]8. NighthawksHauer’s first major role in an American production came courtesy of Nighthawks, a Sylvester Stallone/Billy Dee Williams buddy cop thriller whose script had been refashioned from the abandoned French Connection III. Despite those rather uninspired beginnings — and its disappointing performance at the box office — Nighthawks is one of the more fondly remembered entries in the genre, largely thanks to Hauer’s performance as the publicity-hungry terrorist known as Wulfgar. “All of it is standard stuff,” admitted Janet Maslin of the New York Times, while hastening to add, “and yet Nighthawks has been assembled with enough pep to make it feel fresh.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770783567[/tomatometer]7. SpettersOne of Hauer’s many collaborations with director Paul Verhoeven, 1980’s Spetters was the Dutch hit that really launched their careers in America. Nominally about the world of professional motocross racing, Spetters courted controversy with sexually graphic scenes, heaps of violence, and a script heavy with offensive portrayals of… well, pretty much everybody, including Christians and gays. Plenty of filmgoers failed to find much of value here, but as Verhoeven proved so often in his early career, there’s a difference between shocking simply to shock and doing it to prove a point, and Spetters leans far more heavily on the latter tactic. As Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress sighed wistfully after a later viewing, “Remember when Paul Verhoeven made good movies?”[tomatometer]MovieID=29[/tomatometer]6. Sin CityPart of a busy 2005 for Hauer that included roles in major films (including Batman Begins), a direct-to-video sequel (Dracula III), and a made-for-TV disaster epic (The Poseidon Adventure), Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller’s Sin City used modern filmmaking techniques to bring the distinctive visual thrills of Miller’s graphic novel series directly to the screen. A member of an impressive ensemble cast that included Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, and Benicio del Toro, Hauer appeared as the villainous Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark, whose murderous machinations set in motion a gory path of revenge for Marv (Rourke). Definitely not for the squeamish, Sin City earned the admiration of critics like Bruce Newman of the San Jose Mercury News, who called it “The most gorgeous digital movie ever made” and “a stunning leap forward in both the technology of digital cinema and the art of filmmaking.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13421[/tomatometer]5. Confessions of a Dangerous MindA film adaptation of the “unauthorized autobiography” of famed television producer (and winsomely smarmy game show host) Chuck Barris had been in and out of development since the 1980s, but it took George Clooney to finally make it happen. Clooney marked his directorial debut with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, starring Sam Rockwell as Barris and following his quite possibly fictional account of his years as a TV personality/CIA assassin. Hauer pops up here as a spy who aids Barris during a German mission, part of an eyebrow-raising supporting cast that also included Julia Roberts, Drew Barrymore, and Clooney himself. Offering praise for Clooney, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman, and the cast, the New York Observer’s Andrew Sarris wrote, “Mr. Clooney, Mr. Kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster.”[tomatometer]MovieID=377518800[/tomatometer]4. Flesh &amp; BloodHauer got his start on the late 1960s Dutch TV series Floris, along with the show’s creator, Paul Verhoeven — and once they’d both made a name for themselves in Hollywood, they reunited for this big-screen extension of the show’s 16th-century European mythology. Hauer stars as Martin, a spurned mercenary who embarks on a muddy quest for revenge against the commander who betrayed him. Also starring a young Jennifer Jason Leigh, Flesh &amp; Blood wasn’t a huge box office hit, but it offered an unusually realistic take on the era (TV Guide wrote that “a more appalling view of the turmoil and misery of the late Middle Ages may never be seen”) and helped set up Verhoeven’s RoboCop success with an adventure that eFilmCritic’s Scott Weinberg deemed “Brutally ugly and irresistibly entertaining.”[tomatometer]MovieID=1122[/tomatometer]3. Batman BeginsNobody exudes an air of chilly, impeccably groomed menace quite like Rutger Hauer — a talent that served him well in his small but pivotal role as Wayne Enterprises CEO William Earle in Batman Begins. After Thomas Wayne’s murder, and the departure of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) for years of soul-searching, Earle remade the company in his own image — which included turning it into a publicly traded weapons manufacturer. Though he was a foe far more easily vanquished than, say, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy) or Ra’s al Ghul (Liam Neeson), Earle was plenty nefarious in his own way, and his presence helped add subtext to a film that reinvigorated the superhero genre and moved Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune to write, “If comic books must be a staple of our movie diet, please let them be as thought-provoking and thrilling as this.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12886[/tomatometer]2. Blade RunnerRutger Hauer has been part of a few cult classics in his day, but none have been cultier — or classic-er — than Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner. An adaptation of Philip K. Dick’s short story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner starred Harrison Ford as the replicant-hunting Rick Deckard, and Hauer as his chief target, the replicant known as Roy Batty. It was a flop during its theatrical run in 1982, but we all know what happened next: Runner is almost universally regarded as a sci-fi classic, as well as a longtime favorite of critics like Roger Ebert, who called it “a seminal film, building on older classics like Metropolis or Things to Come, but establishing a pervasive view of the future that has influenced science fiction films ever since.”[tomatometer]MovieID=15102[/tomatometer]1. Soldier of OrangeWe tend not to hear much about the Dutch film industry, but it’s produced its share of great films and major talents — and with 1978’s Soldier of Orange, it gave us a combination of the two, by introducing Hollywood to director/co-writer Paul Verhoeven. Hauer had already worked with Verhoeven on multiple occasions, but none made the kind of international splash enjoyed by this drama about Dutch college students during World War II — it earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film, not to mention the praise of critics like the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, who wrote, “Soldier of Orange may not be great art but it’s a good yarn. And the combined effects of Mr. Verhoeven’s comfortingly old-fashioned storytelling and Mr. Hauer’s unexpectedly brittle performance keep it moving at a fast clip.”In case you were wondering, here are Hauer’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Batman Begins — 90%2. Blade Runner — 89%3. Soldier of Orange — 87%4. Turkish Delight — 78%5. Sin City — 75%6. The Hitcher — 73%7. Ladyhawke — 72%8. The Blood of Heroes — 72%9. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind — 71%10. Simon Magus — 65%Take a look through Hauer’s complete filmography, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.

We decided to celebrate this nod to tradition by compiling a list of some other noteworthy examples from the genre, from 75-year-old classics to more recent (and more big-budget) blockbusters. Sharpen that nail file, keep an eye out for the warden, and get ready to bust out of the slammer Total Recall style!Brute Force 94%If you only know Hume Cronyn from his late-period “kindly old man” roles in movies like *batteries not included or the Cocoon series, it’ll come as something of a shock to see him in 1947’s Brute Force, where he plays a manipulative, sadistic warden whose pressure-cooker tactics produce violence so hellacious it served as an inspiration for Oliver Stone’s prison break sequence in Natural Born Killers. Noteworthy at the time for its progressive stance on prisoner treatment, it survives today as the movie MSN’s Sean Axmaker called “one of the most brutal films about caged men ever made.”Chicken Run 97%Blending the distinctive Aardman Animations style with a smart, funny, and exciting jailbreak story about anthropomorphic stop-motion chickens whose only hope for avoiding slaughter rests on a cocky rooster (voiced by Mel Gibson), 2000’s Chicken Run affectionately parodied the conventions of the genre while demonstrating why they’ve proven so durable. No matter the context, any filmgoer can understand the basic human need for freedom — even if it’s being expressed by cartoon fowl. “What really makes it special,” argued Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “more than the impressive animation, is the endearing characters and involving plot.”Cool Hand Luke 100%This 1967 classic has it all: Paul Newman in his early prime, toplining a stellar cast that included George Kennedy and Jo Van Fleet, as well as Dennis Hopper, Joe Don Baker, and Harry Dean Stanton in supporting roles; one of the most quotable lines in movie history; and not one, not two, but three prison breaks. All of them were unsuccessful, of course, but that was never the point — Cool Hand Luke is about refusing to lay down and quit, no matter how painful the consequences, and whether you take it as a cautionary tale or an ode to the nonconformist, nobody ever looked cooler than Newman in a prison uniform. This is, as Empire’s Kim Newman wrote, “One of those movies you remember Great Moments from.”Con Air 56%Okay, so it isn’t the highest-rated movie on the list. But even if it didn’t win the Palme d’Or, Con Air combined a popcorn-gobbling premise and a top-shelf cast with almost irresistible exuberance, adding up to a loud, action-packed, marvelously over-the-top $224 million smash hit. Who needs high art when you have Nicolas Cage as a drawling ex-Army Ranger whose path to freedom is blocked by a maniacal villain played by John Malkovich? Certainly not the Arizona Daily Star’s Phil Villarreal, who said that Con Air “pulls off the impossible task of having the film make constant fun of itself and its viewers while keeping the storyline grounded enough for emotional payoffs.”Escape from Alcatraz 96%See that guy in the poster? He’s so flinty, he could probably chip his way out of prison with his bare hands — but Alcatraz was no ordinary hoosegow, and this isn’t your average prison break movie. A swan song for Clint Eastwood’s prolific five-film partnership with director Don Siegel, Escape from Alcatraz dramatizes the unknown fates of the three men who, in 1962, freed themselves from the island prison, never to be seen or heard from again. It’s an undeniably irresistible setup for a film, and Siegel does right by it, capturing the action in typically terse, economical fashion, aided by a cast that included Fred Ward and Patrick McGoohan. “What Mr. Siegel has made is fiction,” explained Vincent Canby of the New York Times, hastening to praise it as “a first-rate action movie that is about the need and the decision to take action, as well as the action itself.”Escape from New York 86%Breaking out of your average maximum security prison is hard enough. But what if it took up an entire city — that just happened to be surrounded by a 50-foot wall and dozens of explosives? Obviously, no ordinary man could free himself — but then, Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is far from ordinary, and that’s why he’s the one the government turns to when the President (Donald Pleasence) is kidnapped by a flock of finger-stealing inmates. Of course, Plissken is an inmate himself, and a bit of a bastard in the bargain, but in the post-Watergate era, a good anti-hero was about the best we could hope for — as well as what the Q Network’s James Kendrick called “an intriguing window into the fears and anxieties of the early Reagan years, and a film-lover’s cavalcade of genre mash-up.”The Grand Illusion 97%It was the first foreign language film ever nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, and for good reason: this 1937 classic is arguably Jean Renoir’s finest effort, a tenderly humanistic plea for peace and tolerance in an era when both of those things were in perilously short supply. Even then, Illusion‘s surface plot — about French POWs plotting their escape from a World War I German prison camp — wasn’t exactly new; what’s remarkable about the film is how deftly Renoir ties that backdrop into his startlingly forward-thinking messages about race and class. “Its story is so perfectly (and economically) told, its characters are so rich, human and civilized, and its dialogue so intelligent and revealing,” observed William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, “that the film wraps a spell around you that’s hard to describe but impossible to forget.”The Great Escape 94%This might be the definitive prison break movie, despite the fact that it takes the accomplishments and dogged determination of a largely British group of World War II POWs and replaces them with American soldiers. But it’s only fair, really — even if the Brits were the driving force in the real-life Great Escape, we were the ones who had Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn, and if combining their prodigious cool into one classic escape film meant a little historical fudging, well, the ends justify the means. And when it’s all said and done, The Great Escape is, as Marjorie Baumgarten wrote for the Austin Chronicle, “One of the all-time great action movies.”Midnight Express 93%Unlike most of the movies on this list, Alan Parker’s Midnight Express doesn’t try to find a lot of entertainment value in its story — its screenplay, adapted by Oliver Stone from Billy Hayes’ memoir, plunges the viewer into the hellish nightmare of an American tourist (Brad Davis) who is sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison after being caught with hashish. Grim, violent, and frequently hard to watch, Express provoked the ire of those who felt it painted Turkish people in an unfair light, but it won three Academy Awards and earned praise from most critics — and if nothing else, it serves as a painful warning. As Shannon J. Harvey wrote for the Sunday Times, “Anyone thinking of smuggling drugs into a foreign country should watch this first.”Papillon 79%A decade after helping set the standard for movies about busting out of the slammer with The Great Escape, Steve McQueen teamed up with Dustin Hoffman for another classic: Papillon, adapted from the novel by real-life ex-con Henri Charrière. McQueen starred as the Hollywood version of Charrière, sent to the infamous Devil’s Island prison for murdering a pimp, where he teams up with fellow inmate Louis Dega (Hoffman) and spends a decade trying to reclaim his freedom. Ultimately, the version of events presented in Charrière’s book may not jibe with the true story of his years in confinement, but they sure did make for exciting cinema — 150 full minutes of what the Denver Post’s Michael Booth called “A rousing drama of endurance, opportunism and friendship under fire.”Rescue Dawn 90%The prison break story so nice that Werner Herzog had to tell it twice, Rescue Dawn finds the director dramatizing the tale of Vietnam War POW Dieter Dengler, whose real-life (and truly horrific) ordeal he first recounted in Herzog’s 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly. What brought about this rare backward glance from one of our most restless filmmakers? Dengler’s inspiring refusal to give up no matter how incredible the odds — whether facing a plane crash, imprisonment and torture by Laotian communists, or the weeks he spent staggering through the jungle after his final escape. It’s an incredible story done justice by Herzog’s ever-inimitable lens, not to mention gripping performances from Christian Bale (who played Dengler) and Steve Zahn. Wrote Stephen Whitty for the Newark Star-Ledger, “In its study of an American pilot, surviving only because of his single-minded obsession with staying alive, Rescue Dawn is compelling and dramatic and emotional.”The Shawshank Redemption 91%An artful blend of gut-clenching tragedy, horrific violence, and heartwarming drama, The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the greatest modern prison break movie — which is a little ironic, considering that it didn’t do much at the box office when it was originally released. And it’s true that the movie is a bit of a tough sell, classic status notwithstanding; unlike a lot of prison break films, it isn’t about busting out of the joint so much as it is about learning to cope with life’s injustices, refusing to give up on hope, and — at long last — taking redemption even when it isn’t offered. Is Shawshank overlong and shamelessly sentimental? Perhaps. But it’s also, in the words of Variety’s Leonard Klady, “A testament to the human spirit.”Stalag 17 97%William Holden famously turned down his role in Stalag 17, believing the character was too unlikable to play — but the studio wouldn’t let him say no, and it’s a good thing they didn’t, because he eventually won a Best Actor Oscar for his work as Sefton, the cynical World War II POW whose chummy relationships with the camp’s guards make him the target of vicious rumors from the other inmates.

This weekend, Morse will appear as Nicolas Cage’s shotgun-toting buddy in Drive Angry, which naturally got us thinking about the many highlights in one of Hollywood’s preeminent “that guy” filmographies. From supporting roles to starring turns, here’s the best of David Morse! 69%10. DisturbiaOffering a modern spin on Rear Window, D.J. Caruso’s Disturbia traces the fallout after a high school student with a chip on his shoulder (Shia LaBeouf) attacks one of his teachers, is sentenced to house arrest — and develops a suspicion that his creepy neighbor is secretly a serial killer. More than capable of playing sympathetic characters, but just as comfortable exuding an air of effortless menace, Morse was the perfect guy to play the darkly ambiguous Robert Turner — and Disturbia made for a perfectly entertaining spring thriller according to critics like Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote, “Caruso, a very visual director, serves up some surprises and scares, and he’s paced his movie briskly. You’re out of this disturbing suburbia before you know it, shaken and even stirred.” 70%9. The Long Kiss GoodnightRenny Harlin movies aren’t exactly known for their character development, and 1996’s Shane Black-scripted The Long Kiss Goodnight is no different — in a movie this obsessed with rapid-fire quips, explosions, and piled-up corpses, you root for the good guys and cheer for the disposal of cartoon villains. Case in point: David Morse’s Luke, a.k.a. Daedalus, an arms-dealing heavy who makes things difficult for the amnesiac CIA assassin played by Geena Davis — first he’s nasty, then he’s dead. But if Goodnight isn’t exactly thoughtful, or even particularly memorable, plenty of critics thought it was good, dumb fun — like Michael Dequina of The Movie Report, who asked, “Who can resist the sight of Davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car… while ice skating?” 74%8. The Indian RunnerSean Penn marked his directorial debut with this 1991 drama, which he was inspired to write by Bruce Springsteen’s “Highway Patrolman.” Like the song — and the album it’s from, 1982’s Nebraska — it tells a tale of hard times and hard choices, strained family obligations and fraternal betrayal, and the seemingly arbitrary way life can erode even the noblest hearts and best intentions. At its center is the conflict between an upstanding deputy sheriff (David Morse) and his ne’er-do-well brother (Viggo Mortensen), recently returned to town to wreak havoc on the lives of his loved ones. It’s familiar stuff, to be sure, and some critics felt Penn’s undisciplined approach prevented The Indian Runner from achieving its full potential — but Roger Ebert was among the majority when he wrote, “It’s impressive, how thoughtfully Penn handles this material. The good brother isn’t a straight arrow, and the bad brother isn’t romanticized as a rebel without a cause, and there are no easy solutions or neat little happy endings for this story. It’s as intractable as life itself.” 74%7. The Slaughter RuleWhenever you see David Morse on the screen, you know you’re in good hands, but he’d probably be among the first to admit that a lot of his film roles haven’t given him a chance to display much of his range. It was all the more gratifying, then, to see Morse in The Slaughter Rule, a Sundance-approved drama about a troubled high school football player (Ryan Gosling) whose friendship with a semi-pro coach (Morse) forces both men to deal with suppressed emotions — not to mention the whispers of small-town life. “The film’s powerful meditation on masculinity gets much of its credibility and punch from the two leads,” wrote the AV Club’s Scott Tobias, adding “especially Morse, a reliable character actor who sinks his teeth into a role with heavy physical and psychological demands.” 75%6. The Crossing GuardWritten and directed by Sean Penn, The Crossing Guard gave Morse one of his meatier film roles: John Booth, a drunk driver who comes home from prison to find that even though he’s done his time, he still has to face the grief-consumed Freddy Gale (Jack Nicholson), whose daughter he killed behind the wheel. Unsurprisingly, Freddy wants to murder John; what lends Crossing unexpected poignancy is the fact that John wants him to. It’s obviously a very dark, sad film, and a number of critics felt that Penn didn’t bring enough sensitivity to the material — but most critics’ thoughts echoed those of Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who admitted it was a “self-conscious anthem to macho despair” while praising Penn’s handling of the cast: “He coaxes a soul-torn grief out of Nicholson that’s shocking to behold, and Morse, who suggests a burlier version of Jon Voight, has a gentle-giant melancholy that borders on grace.” 74%5. The NegotiatorThe cop thriller The Negotiator is primarily a showcase for the dramatic chops of Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, but give director F. Gary Gray credit for refusing to skimp on the supporting cast — he surrounded his leads with talent, including J.T. Walsh, Paul Giamatti, John Spencer, and (of course) David Morse. Starring Jackson as a police negotiator framed for embezzlement, and Spacey as the other negotiator who gets called in when Jackson’s character takes hostages in a desperate bid to clear his name, this wasn’t one of the year’s bigger hits at the box office — but it did impress critics like Ron Wells of Film Threat, who chuckled, “I’m glad Warner Bros. has gone back to making movies instead of theme park rides.” 78%4. The Green MileLike the Stephen King story that inspired it, Frank Darabont’s The Green Mile is a resolutely tender film. It’s underscored with an appropriate level of tension and dread, given its death row setting, not to mention the presence of nefarious characters like the psychotic prison guard Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) — but to a large extent, it’s a story about finding grace where you least expect it, and this is partly exemplified through David Morse’s character, the guard Brutus “Brutal” Howell, whose violent nickname and imposing physical size belie his compassion and intelligence. The Green Mile is pretty big, too, and its 188-minute length scared off a few viewers, but most critics felt it was worth the time — including Joe Baltake of the Sacramento Bee, who wrote, “Superior craft is something we’ve come to expect from modern movies, but not soul. It’s the soul of this movie that’s so heartening.” 78%3. Mother and ChildWriter-director Rodrigo Garcia Barcha followed his Sixth Sense-ish thriller Passengers with this quiet character study, which traces the impact of adoption through the stories of three women (played by Annette Bening, Naomi Watts, and Kerry Washington) and their families. In a supporting role, Morse joined an ensemble cast that included Jimmy Smits, Amy Brenneman, and Samuel L. Jackson — a tremendously talented group whose subtle work helped critics look past Mother and Child‘s occasionally bumpy script. “The film reminds us that character, not plot, is what binds us to a story,” observed Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “Cutting between scenes of each in her unique environment, the movie tantalizes us.” 89%2. 12 MonkeysEven in a filmography dotted with supporting roles, Morse’s appearance in 12 Monkeys isn’t one of his bigger parts; in fact, ReelViews’ James Berardinelli dismissed it as “hardly worth mentioning.” In terms of sheer screen time, James has a point — but it’s also worth noting that Morse’s character, Dr. Peters, is responsible for setting in motion the events that drive the entire storyline. Either way, 12 Monkeys was director Terry Gilliam’s biggest box office hit — and a critical high point to boot. Janet Maslin of the New York Times, for one, thought it contained some of his best work: “There’s always overripe method to his madness,” observed Maslin, “but in the new 12 Monkeys Mr. Gilliam’s methods are uncommonly wrenching and strong.” 97%1. The Hurt LockerThe Hurt Locker is essentially Jeremy Renner’s show, but scattered throughout his cinematic coming-out party are brief appearances by a number of familiar faces, including Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, and — as Colonel Reed, a fellow soldier who can’t help but be impressed by Renner’s bravado during a confrontation with an IED-planting sniper — the one and only David Morse. Commercially speaking, Locker suffered roughly the same dismal fate as pretty much every movie about the ongoing war in Iraq, but what it lacked in box office receipts, it made up in acclaim — including six Academy Awards (among them Best Picture and a history-making Best Director for Kathryn Bigelow) and raves from critics like Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who observed, “Like all the best war movies — no matter what war, what era — The Hurt Locker goes to the core of human nature.”In case you were wondering, here are Morse’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Green Mile — 93%2. Dancer in the Dark — 90%3. The Rock — 85%4. 12 Monkeys — 84%5. The Hurt Locker — 83%6. The Indian Runner — 78%7. Mother and Child — 77%8. The Negotiator — 76%9.

Nobody produces a hit like Bruckheimer — and although his successes have often come over the disbelieving protests of scornful critics, his filmography also includes plenty of well-reviewed releases. What better time to count down the top 10? 67%10. The RockAfter they made a mint together with 1995’s Bad Boys, Bruckheimer and Michael Bay got right back to work, teaming up for this $335 million hit about a neurotic scientist (Nicolas Cage) who’s duped by the Pentagon into helping a disgraced MI6 agent (Sean Connery) bust into Alcatraz in order to foil a lunatic Marine (Ed Harris) who’s threatening to fire poison gas rockets into San Francisco. Sound ridiculous? It is — but it flies off the rails with intoxicating panache. “The Rock is the Guy Movie to end all Guy Movies,” applauded Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, calling it “a ridiculously overblown summer testosterone blowout right down to the Wagnerian strains of the soundtrack and its stunningly high body count. It’s also a hell of a lot of fun.” 72%9. Enemy of the StateDepending on your ideological leanings, Enemy of the State‘s pre-9/11 warnings of an encroaching government surveillance state are either quaint or chillingly prescient — but either way, this techno-thriller, which united Bruckheimer with director Tony Scott for their fifth film, is a solidly built piece of big-budget entertainment. Starring Will Smith as a lawyer targeted by the NSA, Gene Hackman as the retired spook who helps him evade capture, and Jon Voight as the creepy bureaucrat who will stop at nothing to ensure the passage of a key piece of legislation, State blended good old-fashioned man-on-the-run action with state-of-the-art technology, and scared up a healthy $250 million along the way — as well as praise from critics such as Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, who called it “a thriller straight through to its sleek, millennial-fever heart, an onrushing, giddily paranoiac roller-coaster ride with bad brakes, clever dialogue, and a reach that only occasionally exceeds its grasp.” 73%8. Remember the TitansThe inspiring real-life story of high school football coach Herman Boone, who overcame seemingly impossible odds — and generations of deeply ingrained racial prejudice — to lead a newly integrated team to the 1971 Virginia state championship. Of course, the Hollywood version of Boone’s tale was a little smoother than the real thing, but with Denzel Washington starring and Bruckheimer steering production, Remember the Titans racked up $136 million at the box office, proving yet again that people love a well-crafted inspirational sports drama. “Taken on its own terms, it’s an agreeable entertainment,” wrote Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir, calling it “solidly crafted, wonderfully acted and often genuinely moving.” 76%7. Black Hawk DownThe Bruckheimer name is most commonly associated with mindless blockbuster action thrillers, but 2001’s Black Hawk Down proves he can deliver a meaningful message while the bullets fly. This adaptation of Mark Bowden’s book about the real-life Battle of Mogadishu, directed with gritty precision by Ridley Scott, used an eclectic ensemble cast (including Ewan McGregor, Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, and Jeremy Piven) to take audiences into the trenches with soldiers fighting to kill or capture a Somali warlord. A $172 million hit, Black Hawk Down also earned the admiration of critics such as Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, who called it “A first-rate war movie that presents its subject so horrifyingly well that it doesn’t need to probe or preach.” 72%6. The RefIt doesn’t have much in the way of action or explosions, and there’s really only one gun to speak of in the whole movie, but what it lacks in ammo-derived fireworks, The Ref makes up with Denis Leary’s sheer full-volume intensity. Starring as an inept, flustered burglar who takes a married couple (Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis) hostage, only to find himself an unwilling participant in their constant bickering, Leary proved he could carry a film after scoring supporting roles in movies like Demolition Man and Judgment Night. At a mere $20 million, it wasn’t one of Bruckheimer and Simpson’s biggest hits, but it eventually became something of a cult hit — and it earned high marks from critics like Chris Hicks of the Deseret News, who noted, “As a starmaking vehicle for Leary, The Ref may do the trick. He’s a prowling, muttering bundle of nervous energy, which is essentially a variation his MTV character. And he’s very funny.” 79%5. Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black PearlThe world scoffed when word got out that Disney was planning to make a movie inspired by the popular Disneyland ride Pirates of the Caribbean, but then they went and lined up some serious talent, both behind the cameras (producer Bruckheimer, director Gore Verbinski) and in front (Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley). Over $650 million later, no one was laughing anymore — and when the surprisingly positive reviews that greeted Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl were followed by five Academy Award nominations, we knew the studio had a bona fide franchise on its hands. “Swashbuckling adventures are few and far between these days,” observed James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “so it’s a pleasant surprise to see one that is competently made.” 73%4. Farewell, My LovelyNo, this isn’t a misprint. Hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe returned to the screen — with added cynicism and extra helpings of grit, grime, and sex — in this 1975 adaptation of the 1940 Raymond Chandler novel, which was Bruckheimer’s first major big-screen production. The film finds Marlowe (played here by Robert Mitchum) embroiled in several intertwining cases, involving everything from a missing moll to a stolen necklace, not to mention an affair with a married seductress (Charlotte Rampling). By the mid- 1970s, Marlowe was a man out of time, but critics appreciated this ever-so-slightly revisionist take on the old gumshoe; as Time Out wrote, “The film’s triumph is Mitchum’s definitive Marlowe, which captures perfectly the character’s down-at-heel integrity and erratic emotional involvement with his cases.” 83%3. Beverly Hills CopThe 1980s were very good to Jerry Bruckheimer, and 1984’s Beverly Hills Cop is a prime example: this box office smash, co-produced with Bruckheimer’s partner Don Simpson, was the hugely successful middle act between their 1983 hit Flashdance and 1986’s Top Gun (which, sadly, doesn’t have a high enough Tomatometer to make this list). Functioning as both the coming-out party for Eddie Murphy as a leading man and the prototype for the sort of fast-paced, quip-filled, impeccably soundtracked action thriller that Bruckheimer excels at, Cop earned praise from the likes of UK Critic’s Ian Waldron-Mantgani, who called it “One of the great popular entertainments of our time, a film that still has a place on the top 40 list of American box-office champs, and continues to look slick and full of energy almost twenty years after opening.” 88%2. Crimson TideBetween 1983 and 1996, Bruckheimer and his longtime co-producer Don Simpson helped create a slew of massive hits, including Flashdance, Top Gun, and Bad Boys — and although most of their films weren’t exactly critical favorites, there were a few notable exceptions. Most notable: 1995’s Crimson Tide, in which a grizzled submarine captain (Gene Hackman) locks horns with his new lieutenant commander (Denzel Washington) over whether to launch nuclear warheads at a renegade Russian sub. With a pair of superstar leading men and a Tarantino-assisted script bolstering typically stylish work from director Tony Scott, Tide earned over $150 million at the box office — and praise from critics like Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who wrote, “If ever a picture crackled, Crimson Tide fits the description.” 94%1. ThiefThief is a film full of firsts — Michael Mann’s directorial debut, the film debut for Jim Belushi, Dennis Farina, and others — but at its core, it’s pretty stock stuff: the thieving protagonist (James Caan) is pressured into pulling off one last heist by a shady crime boss (Robert Prosky) who isn’t above a good old-fashioned double-cross. A number of Thief‘s larger plot points will be familiar to anyone who’s seen Mann’s 1995 opus Heat, but this is a film that stands on its own; as Christopher Null wrote for Filmcritic, “Good guys and bad guys have never been harder to peg, which is why Thief is so much fun, filled with nuance and subtlety not often found among caper flicks.”In case you were wondering, here are Bruckheimer’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Remember the Titans — 91%2. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl — 86%3. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest — 86%4. The Rock — 85%5. Black Hawk Down — 85%6. Top Gun — 82%7.

Arriving this weekend at theater near you (and on suitably massive IMAX 3D screens), Kenneth Branagh’s action epic blends timeless mythology with cutting-edge special effects and a marquee-ready cast — and in the process, it continues Hollywood’s long love affair with all things Viking-related. Naturally, we decided to get in the spirit of things by smoking some cod, pouring a big cup of mead, and looking back at some of the more noteworthy examples of the genre. Hop into our longship, won’t you?Beowulf 71%Historically speaking, Beowulf doesn’t really belong on this list, because, well, Beowulf wasn’t a Viking. For Hollywood’s purposes, though, any tale taking place in ancient Scandinavia — and containing characters with names like Hrothgar and Unferth — can swim in the same goblet of mead as the rest of our list. Coating the Old English classic poem in a layer of shiny new mo-cap gloss (courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis), the 2007 edition of Beowulf follows the titular warrior (Ray Winstone) as he destroys the dreaded Grendel (Crispin Glover) and goes up against the monster’s mother (Angelina Jolie). It took plenty of liberties with the source material, but most critics didn’t mind; as Richard Corliss observed for TIME, “You want to read Beowulf? Get the book, I’m not stopping you. You want bloody adventure with a brain, see the movie.”Erik the Viking 47%This 1989 comedy began life as a children’s book that director Terry Jones wrote for his son — and according to most critics, it should have stayed on the printed page. A critical flop and box office disaster, Erik the Viking reunited Jones with his fellow Monty Python vet John Cleese for the tale of an earnest young warrior (Tim Robbins) whose reluctance to rape and/or pillage leads him on a mystical quest to Asgard, with plenty of Norse mythology — and historical references — along the way. Sadly, it lacked enough Python-style laughs to earn a place alongside Holy Grail and Life of Brian, although it did earn praise from the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley, who called it “a Wagnerian slapstick fantasy” and said it “has the feel of a grown-up bedtime comedy, a gross, sillier Princess Bride.”How to Train Your Dragon 99%Blending the Hollywood tradition of cartoons about finding the strength to be true to your heart with the timeless legends of mighty Norsemen fighting mythical beasts, this $494 million DreamWorks Animation hit follows the adventures of a young Viking named Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) who discovers that the long-standing war his people have waged against dragons might not be everything it’s cracked up to be. And okay, so How to Train Your Dragon isn’t really about Vikings — it takes place in another world — but they’re close enough to count for the purposes of our list; and anyway, with a 98 percent Tomatometer rating under its horned helmet, this is one of the best entries in the genre. As an appreciative A.O. Scott wrote for the New York Times, “Tenderness, beauty and exhilaration are the movie’s great strengths.”The Long Ships 50%The same year he won an Academy Award for his work in Lilies of the Field, Sidney Poitier toiled his way through this loose adaptation of the Frans G. Bengtsson novel The Long Ships, which pits a greedy Moorish king (Poitier) against an intrepid Norseman (Richard Widmark) in a quest to obtain a giant golden bell nicknamed the Mother of Voices. As far as quite a few critics were concerned, these Ships weren’t exactly seaworthy — Time Out’s Trevor Johnston dismissed it as “awful” and Variety derided its “hodge-podge of a storyline” — but others placed it squarely in the “so bad it’s good” camp, including Film4’s reviewer, who chuckled, “This is pure rubbish, but thoroughly enjoyable rubbish.”Outlander 38%Here’s one you can just hear coming together in the pitch meeting: “Vikings are awesome. Aliens are awesome. If we mix ’em together…double awesome!” Sadly, things didn’t quite turn out that way for Outlander, which stars James Caviezel as an interstellar soldier who crash-lands in eighth-century Norway — and is taken prisoner by King Rothgar (John Hurt), thus allowing his deadly alien cargo to scuttle off and start slaying Vikings. With a premise that daffy, this should have been a lot of fun, but most critics were let down — with the notable exception of a few scribes like Richard Edwards of SFX, who called it “about as subtle as being punched in the face by an angry Norwegian,” and said, “It delivers everything you could possibly want from a movie about Vikings and alien monsters.”&nbsp;Pathfinder 10%Most historians agree that Norse explorer Leif Ericson was the first European to lead an expedition to America. But what if another group of Vikings beat them to it by 500 years, only to be slaughtered, leaving a pale blond orphan to be raised among the Wampanoag — and ultimately fight for them against a new wave of Viking invaders? That’s the interesting question raised by director Marcus Nispel’s 2007 would-be epic — unfortunately, the answers the movie came up with were often of the unintentionally humorous variety. (As Xan Brooks of the Guardian put it, “Imagine a heavy metal album cover come suddenly to life and you pretty much have the measure of Pathfinder.”) Still, among all the critical wreckage, there were a few voices of praise, including Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, who wrote, “Pathfinder makes sure its carnage is bloody, awful and pointless. But pretty.”The 13th Warrior 33%You’ve got to give author Michael Crichton credit for tenacity — he wanted to see this adaptation of his novel Eaters of the Dead brought to the screen so badly that he hung on through years of bumpy production and ultimately took over for director John McTiernan — but considering The 13th Warrior‘s anemic $61 million gross and 33 percent Tomatometer rating, all that effort might have been better spent on another novel. Though the novel drew its inspiration from the fascinating tales of 10th-century Arab traveler Ahmad ibn Fadlan (played by Antonio Banderas) — and took them one step further, imagining a Viking adventure between Fadlan and Beowulf — the movie failed to measure up to those classic texts. Still, even if it missed the mark, Warrior found supporters in critics like Gary Dauphin of the Village Voice, who called it “a well-marbled, albeit derivative, slab of action-movie man meat.”Valhalla Rising 73%The films of Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have always demonstrated an affinity for — and a deep-rooted fascination with — violence, and those qualities were distilled into pure bloody mayhem for 2009’s Valhalla Rising. Slow and lumbering, with a mute, murderous protagonist known only as One-Eye (played by Mads Mikkelsen), Valhalla dispenses with niceties like exposition, hope, or even much in the way of dialogue, and trades them all for a brutally violent, beautifully filmed trip to the Holy Land for our mute Viking hero and a group of Christian Crusaders. Its grinding pace and copious amounts of mud and blood obviously aren’t for everyone, but as Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum noted, “When it comes to crazy, violent, semidelirious, testosterone-laden, proto-Viking tales about a mute visionary one-eyed warrior who breaks skulls, Valhalla Rising is pretty great.”The Vikings 76%We couldn’t very well publish a list of Viking movies without including The Vikings, could we? This 1958 epic, which ended up being the final collaboration between director Richard Fleischer and star/producer Kirk Douglas, is overblown in the very best sense of the word, from its stentorian narration (provided by Orson Welles) to its larger-than-life Technicolor vistas and eyebrow-raising, mostly bushy-bearded cast (including Tony Curtis, Ernest Borgnine, and a clean-shaven Janet Leigh). Some critics chortled at its soapy blend of melodrama and castle-storming action, but most found it too spectacular to resist, including Time Out’s Nigel Floyd, who described it as “Plenty of pillaging, axe-throwing, hearty quaffing of ale, storming of castles, heroic jumping into wolf pits, and manly talk about the glories of entering Valhalla with sword in hand.”The War LordAn admirable mid-1960s attempt to de-romanticize feudal life — while still retaining all the Hollywood sweep and grandeur audiences demanded — The War Lord stars Charlton Heston as Chrysagon de la Cruex, a lusty Norman knight whose efforts to defend his village against the invading Viking hordes are complicated when he decides to poach the bride of one of his subjects. More of a romantic drama than most of the films on this list, it earned praise from most critics; even the New York Times’ Bosley Crowther, who good-naturedly mocked “that histrionic hair shirt that Charlton Heston dons when he plays any role,” applauded its plentiful “bow-and-arrow shooting and throwing spears and pouring boiling oil and battering-ramming the great oak doorway and assaulting the fortress with a scaling-tower.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

This has been a recurring theme at the box office lately, and we certainly haven’t seen the last of it — so we decided to dedicate this week’s feature to a random sampling of cinematic alien invasions of the past. We narrowed the list by focusing on movies featuring groups of intergalactic visitors (sorry Starman, E.T., and Predator), but still only scratched the surface of a time-honored Hollywood tradition. Which of your favorites made (or missed) the cut?The Arrival 65%Fifteen years before he dedicated himself to full-time winning, Charlie Sheen starred in this eco-suspense-sci-fi-thriller from writer/director David Twohy (The Fugitive), about a scientist (Sheen) who goes hunting for the source of a mysterious signal from outer space and learns that a secret cabal of aliens is intentionally speeding up global warming so they can take over the planet. It’s better than it sounds — and certainly better than the poster, which a bug-eyed Sheen had to share with an alien, made it look. The franchise would descend into outright silliness with 1998’s wonderfully titled The Arrival II: The Second Arrival, but the original is, in the words of the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick La Salle, “a strong, lean piece of writing that moves quickly. Nothing is wasted, and nothing happens the way you’d expect.”Close Encounters of the Third Kind 94%By the late 1970s, Hollywood had cranked out so many alien invasion movies that filmgoers had started taking it for granted that flying saucers in the sky meant we were all in a lot of trouble. Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind took this notion, turned it on its head, and gave us one of our most enduring all-time sci-fi classics. In Spielberg’s vision, our extraterrestrial guests meant us no harm; they were merely curious, and their presence, rather than being a harbinger of doom, signaled our collective evolution and hinted at our limitless possibilities. (And okay, they had to land here to return all the people they’d abducted over the years, but what’s a few kidnappings between friends?) It all might seem a little quaint and soft-hearted now, but during the Cold War, there was something revolutionary about an alien movie that ended with a smile — and it remains, in the words of Roger Ebert, “One of the great moviegoing experiences.”District 9 92%We human beings tend to be pretty attached to our planet, and most of our sci-fi invasion stories reflect those feelings, imagining Earth as a prize to be fought for when the rapacious alien hordes try to steal it from us. But what if they arrived here accidentally — and we ended up turning them into a persecuted, disadvantaged minority? This is the rather brilliant idea behind Neill Blompkamp’s District 9, which imagines a ship full of aliens that breaks down over Johannesburg. The visitors (derisively referred to as “prawns”) find safe harbor, of a sort, in a segregated area of the city (the District 9 of the title) — along with discriminatory laws and rank poverty. Extending science fiction’s long tradition of exploring sociological themes by placing them in far-fetched contexts — and, of course, adding in some nifty special effects and plenty of nail-biting action — District 9 took its small budget and star-free cast and turned them into one of the year’s biggest critical and commercial hits. The New Yorker’s Anthony Lane, no pushover, added to the chorus of approval with his review, writing “You don’t feel bamboozled, fooled, or patronized by District 9, as you did by most of the summer blockbusters. You feel winded, shaken, and shamed.”Earth Girls Are Easy 69%The textbook definition of a movie that’s better than it has any right to be, Julien Temple’s Earth Girls Are Easy used a 1984 Julie Brown novelty song as the inspiration for a thoroughly goofy, thoroughly 1980s romp about a lonely hairdresser (Geena Davis) who finds love after a trio of furry, brightly colored aliens (Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey, and Damon Wayans) crash-land in her pool. All things considered, it’s probably more of a dating comedy than a real alien invasion movie, but with Charles Rocket in classic cad mode, Hall and Oates covering “Love Train” on the soundtrack, and an Angelyne cameo, how could we resist? It is, as Hal Hinson observed for the Washington Post, “The movie equivalent of cheap champagne — even though it’s lousy, it still gives you tickles up the nose.”Independence Day 67%More often than not, Hollywood has imagined alien invasions as covert affairs, or the kind of thing that happens in small towns while no one is watching — but not Roland Emmerich, who dreamed up a full-scale intergalactic apocalypse for 1996’s Independence Day, complete with gigantic spaceships, horrific destruction, and alien bad guys who were every bit as nasty as they looked. Blending old-school B-movie tropes (including a cast stuffed with character actors like Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, and Judd Hirsch) and state-of-the-art special effects, Independence Day ruled the 1996 box office, reinvigorated the moribund alien invasion genre, and was, in the words of Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum, “the first futuristic disaster movie that’s as cute as a button. Which, when all the special effects blow over, is what we Americans like in a monster hit.”Invasion of the Body Snatchers 92%Its themes have resonated throughout pop culture since they were originally published in the 1950s — particularly on the big screen, where they’ve served as the source material for four films — but for pure Tomatometer power, the edge goes to 1956’s original Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Adapted from Jack Finney’s 1955 novel The Body Snatchers, this eerie sci-fi classic takes viewers to fictional Santa Mira, California, where sentient pods from outer space have set up shop and started churning out dead-eyed replicas of the townfolk. Snatchers‘ supposed political allegories have been debated for years, but you don’t have to believe it’s a metaphor to enjoy it; as James Rocchi wrote for Netflix, “At the time, the film could have been seen as a metaphor for the Red Menace, or McCarthyism, or whatever; the fact remains it’s a creepy little film.”Killer Klowns from Outer Space 75%We love classic cinema as much as the next film website, but there’s something to be said for a movie that cheerfully takes an insane premise to its thoroughly illogical conclusion. Case in point: 1988’s Killer Klowns from Outer Space, which delivers on the oddball promise of its title by sending a murderous brigade of clownish (sorry, klownish) aliens to a small town, where they immediately set about harvesting the unsuspecting residents by wrapping them in a cotton candy-like substance and turning their bodies into goo. It’s exactly the sort of thing late-night cable was made for — but unlike most 2 AM Cinemax offerings from the late 1980s, Killer Klowns is actually pretty entertaining. As eFilmCritic’s Brian McKay astutely observed, “IT’S GOT CLOWNS! FROM OUTER SPACE! AND THEY’RE KILLING PEOPLE! What’s not to like?”Mars Attacks! 54%The same year Roland Emmerich gave us invading aliens on a massive scale with Independence Day, Tim Burton took a decidedly more tongue-in-cheek approach to the genre with Mars Attacks!. Inspired by a short-lived series of trading cards from the early 1960s, this all-star spoof of cheesy alien B movies like Invaders from Mars and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers satirized contemporary American culture while treating audiences to the sight of zapgun-toting Martians vaporizing celebrities like Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, and Jack Black. One of Burton’s less successful efforts, Attacks! was a box office disappointment and missed the mark with most critics — but a number of scribes defended it, including TIME’s Richard Schickel, who wrote, “Perhaps they don’t create quite enough deeply funny earthlings to go around, but a thoroughly meanspirited big-budget movie is always a treasurable rarity.”Plan 9 from Outer Space 68%There was no way we were leaving this one out. Arguably the quintessential Ed Wood movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space will never win any technical awards — in fact, its most notable accolade came from author Michael Medved, who dubbed it the worst film (and Wood the worst director) of all time. But in spite of its many goofed-up shots, continuity errors, and awkward attempts to cover up for the death of its “star,” Béla Lugosi, Plan 9 has become not only a cult classic, but something of a critical favorite, enjoying a robust 65 percent on the Tomatometer and praise from critics like Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, who concluded, “It’s really rather glorious, in its own way.” (And perhaps most importantly, if aliens ever decide to prevent World War III by reanimating our dead, we’ll know exactly how to defeat them. Bonus!)Signs 74%It takes a lot of guts — and just as much panache — to pull off a movie that uses an alien invasion as the backdrop for an examination of religious faith, but that’s just what M. Night Shyamalan did with 2002’s Signs. Starring Mel Gibson as an ex-priest who rejected God after his wife was killed, Joaquin Phoenix as his younger brother, and some rather unfriendly green creatures who announce their arrival by leaving crop circles all over the place, Signs has plenty of silly moments and plot holes, but it’s also a suspenseful, well-acted film that isn’t afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve. Critics were definitely starting to see past Shyamalan’s bag of tricks at this point, but most of them were able to forgive Signs‘ flaws, including Eric Harrison of the Houston Chronicle, who called it “A heartfelt movie that deals more nakedly with [Shyamalan’s] core concerns than any of his other Hollywood films, and it doubtlessly will deeply touch many people as well as frighten them.”They Live 85%The 1980s were a rather uneven decade for John Carpenter, but he closed them out on a high note with They Live, which combines smart social commentary with pure, unadulterated B-movie thrills. Shot for a paltry $3 million, the film puts humanity’s hope in the hands of a drifter (Roddy Piper) who stumbles across a box of sunglasses that reveals the freaky-looking aliens among us. Immediately resolving to kick ass (and chew bubblegum), he does just that, waging war against the invaders until the iconic final shot. While it wasn’t a huge hit at the box office, They Live has grown into cult classic status, partly on the strength of the killer fight sequence between Piper and Keith David — and partly thanks to the praise of writers like Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, who called it “Carpenter’s best film — I don’t care what you say.”Transformers 58%There have been more culturally relevant films — and certainly more critically respected ones — but when Michael Bay settled into the director’s chair for Transformers, it represented arguably the most perfect union of filmmaker and subject matter in the history of cinema. Say what you want about Bay’s movies, but the man was simply born to direct a movie about giant alien robots waging war on Earth — and audiences agreed to the tune of more than $700 million at the box office, affirming Paramount’s hopes for a franchise (the third and allegedly final installment, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, will arrive on 3D screens this year). Most critics were less impressed, but that’s because they were foolishly fixated on things like plot and character development, rather than giant robots waging war on Earth. Among the appreciative minority, Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel wrote, “We knew it would be dumb. But we had no idea it would be so much dumb fun.”War of the Worlds 88%One of the greatest alien invasion stories of all time, H.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds has inspired countless adaptations and homages, including multiple films — but it’s Byron Haskin’s 1953 film that critics felt most closely captured the spirit of the book. Steven Spielberg’s 2005 adaptation may have boasted Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and some amazing special effects, but in spite of its technical limitations, the 1953 War made full use of Wells’ timeless themes while incorporating Cold War commentary. Looking back on it, the Hollywood Reporter’s Douglas Pratt wrote, “A half-century after its creation, the film’s best moments are still so enjoyably unnerving that they easily carry a viewer through the necessary but inevitably dated exposition.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Jackson joins Martin as his equally frock-friendly stepson, Trent “Charmaine Daisy” Pierce. All these fellas running around in wigs and dresses got us thinking about some of the many other films that required their male stars to put on a little makeup, flash a little leg, and bat a few eyelashes. From comedies to dramas, Oscar winners to cult classics, this week’s Total Recall is a total drag!The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert 96%A road trip movie with a decidedly flamboyant twist, The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert follows the trail of three drag queens (played by Guy Pearce, Hugo Weaving, and Terence Stamp) on their journey across the Australian Outback in an unreliable tour bus. Containing drama, comedy, and a fair amount of social commentary, Priscilla was an arthouse favorite during its theatrical run, spun off a pair of musical stage adaptations, won an Oscar (for Best Costume Design, natch), and earned raves from critics like Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures, who asked, “Where else are you going to see General Zod, Agent Smith and the guy from Memento as drag queens stranded in the Australian Outback?”Dressed to Kill 80%His work is heavily indebted to Hitchcock, so it was only fitting that, with 1980’s Dressed to Kill, Brian De Palma should add his own splashy twist to the cross-dressing slasher genre. Offering copious amounts of nudity, kinky sex, and bloody violence, Dressed to Kill became a late-night cable favorite among softcore aficionados and incensed some gay and transgender groups who didn’t appreciate being included in the film’s lurid parade of perversion, but most critics saw it as something more than cheap thrills — like Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, who applauded the way it “Inflates paperback pulp psychology into something like a plot, all the better to demonstrate that filmmaking is an inherently visual storytelling.”Ed Wood 92%Discrimination and/or violence against transvestites is a common thread in many of the films on this list, and its real-life effects are reflected in Tim Burton’s Ed Wood. Wood’s films were often unintentionally humorous, but he took them very seriously — arguably none more so than Glen or Glenda, the semi-autobiographical docudrama about the personal struggles faced by cross-dressers (such as Wood himself) and people uncomfortable in their birth gender. Wood’s earnest message may have been buried in Glenda‘s sensationalistic promotion, but Burton took a more sensitive approach to his subject; even the sight of Johnny Depp in a dress couldn’t keep Film.com’s John Hartl from seeing something more meaningful as he wrote, “In his finest, funniest, most poignant film to date, Tim Burton plays cinematic alchemist, turning drive-in schlock into movie gold.”Flawless 40%Hollywood usually plays men in drag for laughs, either by throwing men into situations where they’re forced to dress as women or by using cross-dressing characters for sassy comic relief. For 1999’s Flawless, writer/director Joel Schumacher went another direction, casting Philip Seymour Hoffman as a drag queen who helps his gruff, socially conservative neighbor (Robert De Niro) fight through the effects of a stroke. There’s a fine drama in that setup; unfortunately, Schumacher couldn’t resist raising the stakes with what many critics felt was a needlessly violent and splashy subplot — not to mention a succession of unbelievable supporting characters. Still, even if it didn’t really live up to its title, it entertained Jo Berry of Empire Magazine, who called it “A film that should be seen for the acting talent on board rather than its originality (or lack thereof).”Hairspray 91%When John Waters filmed the original Hairspray in 1988, he reserved the role of Tracy Turnblad’s mother, Edna, for his frequent muse, the cross-dressing showbiz phenomenon known as Divine. Sadly, Divine passed away shortly after Hairspray‘s release, but the film lived on — first as a home video cult classic, then a Tony-winning Broadway musical, and then through the 2007 film remake. By the time Adam Shankman directed the 2007 Hairspray, it had become a tradition for a man in drag to play Edna (including Harvey Fierstein, who knows a thing or two about wearing women’s clothing), and Shankman continued the tradition brilliantly by casting a heavily padded John Travolta in the role. They’re decidedly different films, but critics loved them both — including Brian Webster of the Apollo Guide, who wrote of the remake, “You may want to ponder whether or not John Waters’ ‘transgressive’ art is entirely lost in the homogenization of his original, or you can just sit back and enjoy the fun.”Hedwig and the Angry Inch 92%Starring John Cameron Mitchell, who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a dramatic musical tour de force about a man who undergoes a botched sex change (producing the “angry inch” of the title) in order to marry his lover and leave Communist Germany — only to watch the Berlin Wall crumble, along with the marriage. And that’s just the opening act: Hedwig’s adventures are full of bad timing, bad faith, and all-around bad luck, none of which are enough to quell her unshakable determination. There are a million movies about never giving up on your dreams, but few of them lay it on the line with this much bravado; it is, as Claudia Puig wrote for USA Today, “Wildly witty, but also inventive, audacious and poignant.”La Cage aux Folles 95%A movie so entertaining it broke box office records for foreign films in the U.S. and spun off a pair of sequels, a hit stage musical, and a successful remake (1996’s The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane), 1978’s La Cage aux Folles follows the comic culture clash that erupts when a young man brings his conservative future in-laws home to meet his gay dads — who respectively own and perform in a drag nightclub. It’s broad and silly and looks more than a little dated today, but La Cage became a pop culture phenomenon for a reason; as Roger Ebert wrote, “This is basically the first sitcom in drag, and the comic turns in the plot are achieved with such clockwork timing that sometimes we’re laughing at what’s funny and sometimes we’re just laughing at the movie’s sheer comic invention. This is a great time at the movies.”Madea Goes to Jail 29%Critics don’t think much of his movies — 2009’s I Can Do Bad All by Myself is the freshest of the bunch, at a bare 60 percent on the Tomatometer — but if it’s cross-dressing comedy you seek, Tyler Perry is a one-man industry, with roughly a billion movies, plays, TV shows, and books featuring his profane, shotgun-toting, wisdom-spouting character, Madea. It’s a character Perry’s fans clearly respond to, and he has plenty of them: his eight films have grossed more than $450 million, with the ninth, Madea’s Big Happy Family, due to add to that total in April. As Melissa Anderson put it for the Village Voice in her review of Madea Goes to Jail, “As ridiculous as his films frequently are, Perry, a shrewd yet benevolent showman, knows and loves his audience.”Mrs. Doubtfire 71%The tender family comedy that gave a lonely pre-Bond Pierce Brosnan something to do and introduced the phrase “drive-by fruiting” into the lexicon, Mrs. Doubtfire cemented Robin Williams’ status as one of the biggest box office draws of the early 1990s — and proved he made a fairly convincing elderly woman — while extending director Chris Columbus’ hot streak. Part unapologetic showcase for Williams’ madcap talents, part sentimental family drama about a struggling actor who disguises himself as a housekeeper to be close to his kids, Doubtfire struck many critics as an uneven blend (Robert Faires of the Austin Chronicle called it “raw, uncoated stupidity that sticks in your throat”), but audiences loved it — and it even wore down Newsweek’s David Ansen, who admitted, “I’ve rarely laughed so much at a movie I generally disliked.”Norbit 9%Yes, its miserable eight percent Tomatometer rating perfectly matches the number of Razzie nominations it earned, but there’s one thing you can’t deny about Eddie Murphy’s Norbit: It stars Murphy as the meek title character and as his enormous, overbearing, adulterous wife, Rasputia. As a comedy, it may not be much more than a succession of ethnic stereotypes and fat jokes, each one broader than Rasputia’s voluminous backside — but Norbit‘s $159 million box office tally proves that as a culture, we tend to enjoy this kind of thing. And besides, Armond White of the New York Press enjoyed it: “If Murphy hadn’t already perfected doing multi-character turns in his Nutty Professor movies,” he argued, “Norbit would be enough to confirm his status as the most brilliant comic actor in America.”Nuns on the Run 45%For most of us without painful childhood memories of rulers across the knuckles, nuns are inherently funny to begin with, so putting a pair of funny guys in nuns’ habits is a surefire recipe for comedy gold — at least, that seems to have been the idea behind Nuns on the Run, starring Eric Idle and Robbie Coltrane as a pair of crooks who don wimples to disguise themselves from the mobsters who want them dead. Alas, the filmmakers’ prayers went unanswered: Nuns played to empty pews at the box office, where it collected just under $11 million, and most critics found it an unholy mess — although Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman was one of the few to sing its praises, calling it “a cleverly directed caper comedy about two crooks on the lam, and it has its fair share of chuckles.”Psycho 96%We suppose this is something of a spoiler, but given that we’re talking about a key plot point in a 51-year-old movie at a site geared toward film lovers, it’s probably safe to come right out and say that the murderer in Psycho is really Norman Bates, dressed up like his dead mother. If it didn’t do much for the public perception of men in women’s clothing (all of Ed Wood’s hard work on Glen or Glenda, gone to waste!), it made for a pretty terrific twist in what would go down as a Hitchcock classic and a deeply influential piece of filmmaking. It is, as Scott Weinberg wrote for eFilmCritic, “One of the Greek Gods of the horror genre.”The Rocky Horror Picture Show 79%There have been plenty of movies starring men dressed in women’s clothing, and this feature won’t come anywhere near covering all of them — but only one boasts the singular presence of Tim Curry as Doctor Frank-N-Furter, the “sweet transvestite from transsexual Transylvania.” One of the oddest — and most successful — releases ever to make its way out of a major studio, Rocky Horror Picture Show is perhaps the definitive cult classic; it has enjoyed an unbroken theatrical run dating back to its original 1975 release, and has essentially defined midnight cinema along the way. As a solo viewing experience, it may be sort of a letdown (Roger Ebert shrugged it off as “kind of sweet, and forgettable”), but Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress deemed it “A very good film in its own right” and “a triumph of clever filmmaking by Jim Sharman, who should have gone on to bigger things.”Some Like It Hot 95%Jack Lemmon may not have made the world’s prettiest woman, but he did score a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this Billy Wilder classic — named the best comedy of all time by the AFI — about a pair of struggling musicians (played by Lemmon and Tony Curtis) who go on the lam in drag after witnessing a Mafia-orchestrated bloodbath. As part of their disguise, they join an all girls’ band — and immediately fall head over heels for the comely Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe), thus establishing the basic framework for countless comedies of error to come. As Marjorie Baumgarten wrote for the Austin Chronicle, “If Billy Wilder achieved nothing else in his entire career, he would still rank as one of the great masters of cinema for pulling off this comic tour de force.”Tootsie 90%Put Dustin Hoffman in a dress and you’ve got yourself a recipe for absurdity — but while 1982’s Tootsie does contain its share of silly humor and Three’s Company-style confusion, it’s also a surprisingly intelligent examination of sexual politics and gender roles in early 1980s America, and in a lot of ways, it remains unfortunately timely. It’s also impeccably made — director Sydney Pollack was at the top of his game, the screenplay is sharp, and Hoffman’s co-stars (which included Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, and Pollack himself) were impeccably cast. “It is not just the best comedy of the year,” declared Richard Schickel for TIME, “it is popular art on the way to becoming cultural artifact.”Torch Song Trilogy 74%A dramatic showcase for Harvey Fierstein, who starred and adapted the screenplay from his own Tony-winning play, Torch Song Trilogy follows the turbulent life of female impersonator Arnold Beckoff, who battles heartbreak, tragedy, and family disapproval over the course of a decade, presented in three chronological installments. It wasn’t a major hit with audiences or critics, but Trilogy earned Fierstein an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead, as well as the admiration of critics like the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley, who noted, “The themes are universal, and Arnold is an Everyperson who wants to be loved not for what others want him to be, but for what he really is — ‘a person, a valuable person.'”To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar 39%A year after the similarly themed Priscilla, Queen of the Desert earned raves — and the same year that global cross-dressing sensation RuPaul went mainstream enough to score a guest-starring gig on All My Children — Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo got tarted up for the gleefully campy road trip comedy To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. By putting that unlikely trio in makeup and couture, director Beeban Kidron already had pretty much everything he needed for a movie — which is good, because according to most critics, its fabulous stars were just about all Wong Foo had going for it (as Janet Maslin observed for the New York Times, “Kidron’s direction stays flat even when the actors are funny”). Still, it earned a number of positive reviews, including one from Christine James of Boxoffice Magazine, who wrote, “Carried on the strong shoulders of its protagonists, scene-stealers all, the film succeeds in being fun and even touching, though the story itself is somewhat thin and cliched.”White Chicks 15%Appearing in a toxic cloud of long-delayed karmic payback for C. Thomas Howell’s Soul Man, 2004’s White Chicks treated viewers to the sight of Shawn and Marlon Wayans as bumbling FBI agents forced to go undercover as, well, white chicks. It’s arguably the only film to rely this heavily on cross-dressing and whiteface — and definitely the only soundtrack to feature contributions from Cypress Hill, Jessica Simpson, and Elvis Presley — as well as a $113 million hit. Critics were unimpressed — in his reluctantly positive review, the Las Vegas Mercury’s Anthony Del Valle called it “stupid, crude, inept, illogical, and, alas, very funny” — but their withering scorn was not enough to prevent a sequel, currently in the works.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Stiller’s films have grossed more than $2.1 billion, a total that includes the more than $800 million racked up by Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers — and with the third installment in the franchise, Little Fockers, arriving in theaters this weekend, we decided now would be the perfect time to take a look back at his critical highlights. (Spoiler alert: Envy will not be covered.) It’s time for another round of Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=14635[/tomatometer]10. Zero EffectWho’s the private dick that drinks Tab and avoids people if at all possible? Why, Daryl Zero, of course — the neuroses-riddled P.I. played by Bill Pullman in Jake Kasdan’s 1998 cult favorite Zero Effect. With Stiller co-starring as his conflicted assistant, and an eclectic supporting cast that included Ryan O’Neal, Zero Effect was a little too quirky for mainstream success, and quite a few critics didn’t know what to make of it — but the majority appreciated Kasdan’s offbeat style, including Roger Ebert, who wrote, “This is one of those movies that creeps up on you, insidiously gathering power. By the end, I was surprised how much I was involved.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10687[/tomatometer]9. Keeping the FaithEdward Norton made his directorial debut with this dramedy, whose misguided, run-of-the-mill love triangle marketing campaign disguised its unusually thoughtful religious themes. Stiller played Jacob, a rabbi whose lifelong friendship with a priest (Norton) is complicated when a woman from their past (Jenna Elfman) resurfaces, unwittingly sparking a rivalry between the two — and raising tough questions about how to deal with conflicts between one’s faith and one’s love life. A modest hit with audiences and critics, Keeping the Faith earned the admiration of scribes such as Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat of Sprituality and Practice, who applauded it as “The first film in years to present two servants of God as ardent, idealistic, hard-working, and interesting people.”[tomatometer]MovieID=16981[/tomatometer]8. Dodgeball: A True Underdog StoryPart of a very busy year for Stiller that saw him starring in five movies (including Meet the Fockers, Envy, Along Came Polly, and Starsky &amp; Hutch) and turning in a memorable cameo in Anchorman, this ensemble sports comedy pitted Stiller against Vince Vaughn in another round of the classic battle between the haves and the have-nots…only this time, with dodgeballs. Comedies this broad don’t usually resonate with critics, and this one arrived during a glut of ribald, sports-themed comedies, but Dodgeball hit the sweet spot between critical and commercial success because, in the words of Rolling Stone’s Peter Travers, “This masterpiece of modern cinema depends upon a single truism: A guy getting hit in the nuts a hundred times in a row is funny a hundred times.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770805910[/tomatometer]7. GreenbergWriter/director Noah Baumbach excels at making movies about essentially unlikable people, and Ben Stiller is fearless when it comes to playing them, so it was no surprise that their collaboration for 2010’s Greenberg yielded largely positive reviews — as well as plenty of wrinkled noses from filmgoers who couldn’t stomach the self-absorbed, off-putting behavior unfolding onscreen. “There’s a lot not to like about Greenberg, the character and the film,” cautioned David Stratton of Australia’s At the Movies, “and yet, by the end, I found it very touching, and the final scene is so imbued with delicacy and humanity that any stumbles along the way can be forgiven.”[tomatometer]MovieID=15892[/tomatometer]6. Your Friends and NeighborsNeil LaBute’s 1998 ensemble dramedy Your Friends &amp; Neighbors united a stellar cast — including Stiller, Catherine Keener, Jason Patric, and Aaron Eckhart — to tell the frequently bleak tale of the sexual entanglements between three unhappy couples. Grim, unflinching, and thoroughly uncomfortable, this is vintage LaBute — which is to say it was only ever destined to be a hit with critics such as Netflix’s James Rocchi, who cautioned, “You will not like Your Friends and Neighbors; it’s intense, unflinching and uncomfortable. You won’t look away from it, though, and you won’t forget the people it showed you for a long time.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12907[/tomatometer]5. The Royal TenenbaumsStiller followed the broad, mainstream-friendly Meet the Parents with a pair of excursions into the oddball end of the comedy spectrum: the cult favorite Zoolander, which he also wrote and directed, and Wes Anderson’s The Royal Tenenbaums. Amidst an eyebrow-raising ensemble cast that also included Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, and Andrew, Luke, and Owen Wilson, Stiller was at his quirkiest and most neurotic — in other words, at his best. While it wasn’t a huge hit at the box office, Tenenbaums fared well with most critics, including Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star, who called it “An eloquent, eccentric and surprisingly touching tribute to the comic dignity of failure.”[tomatometer]MovieID=17462[/tomatometer]4. There’s Something About MaryBen Stiller had made plenty of films before he hit the big time with There’s Something About Mary — in fact, it came out alongside three more of his movies in 1998 — but this gleefully tasteless comedy from the Farrelly brothers took him from That Guy status and put him on the path to superstardom. While it may not have broken a lot of new ground, it pushed the boundaries of acceptable topics for comedy, cemented the Farrellys’ bankability, and acted as a forebear for the new golden era of R-rated laffers waiting just around the corner. “When it’s not mean spirited, tastelessness can be riotously funny,” observed Jeanne Aufmuth of the Palo Alto Weekly, adding, “and this is a gag-a-thon of hugely funny proportions.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770681826[/tomatometer]3. Tropic ThunderStiller’s experiences as a bit player on Empire of the Sun inspired him to write this barbed Hollywood satire about a group of pampered actors (led by Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey, Jr. in blackface) whose entitled behavior leads their exasperated director to try using a little cinema verite on their war movie, with decidedly unintended results. Loaded with inside jokes, a marvelously insane Tom Cruise cameo, and thinly veiled insults directed at other actors, Thunder earned a healthy critical buzz to go with its $188 million box office draw. Calling it “Stiller’s Hellzapoppin’ Apocalypse Now,” Entertainment Weekly’s Lisa Schwarzbaum praised it as “a smart and agile dissection of art, fame, and the chutzpah of big-budget productions.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10945[/tomatometer]2. Meet the ParentsStiller is one of the kings of uncomfortable comedy, and few films have taken advantage of his gift for squirm-inducing laughs as brilliantly as Meet the Parents. This smash hit Jay Roach comedy about male nurse Gaylord “Greg” Focker (Stiller) and his painfully awkward (and/or just plain painful) attempts to make a good first impression on his girlfriend’s parents. Featuring plenty of guffaw-worthy physical comedy and splendidly antagonistic chemistry between Stiller and Robert De Niro, Parents grossed over $500 million, spawning a franchise and earning the applause of critics like Time’s Richard Schickel, who chuckled, “Alas, poor Focker. He can’t help himself. And we can’t help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.”[tomatometer]MovieID=15654[/tomatometer]1. Flirting with DisasterDavid O. Russell followed up his critically lauded debut, 1994’s Spanking the Monkey, with this road trip comedy about a new father (Stiller) who sets out in search of his biological parents with his wife (Patricia Arquette), a ditzy adoption agency employee (Tea Leoni), and an ever-expanding crowd of eccentric characters. Audiences didn’t really respond to Flirting with Disaster‘s blend of observational humor and broad slapstick, but it resonated with critics, who appreciated Russell’s deceptively thoughtful script and a sharp cast that included Mary Tyler Moore, Alan Alda, Lily Tomlin, and George Segal. “If Russell is erratic with plot and the slightest bit smug in attitude,” wrote Nick Davis of Nick’s Flick Picks, “he makes up for these flaws by drawing fun, inspired performances from his ace cast.”In case you were wondering, here are Stiller’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1.

But as we soon learned, his time with N.W.A. was only the beginning: Cube quickly went on to start an acclaimed solo career, and with 1991’s Boyz N the Hood, established himself as a force to be reckoned with on the big screen. Since then, he’s amassed an eclectic filmography — one with room for action, dramas, comedies, and family-friendly fare, and plenty of critical highs and lows to match. With his latest release, Lottery Ticket, appearing in theaters this weekend, we decided to take a look back at the critical highlights of Cube’s film oeuvre. It’s time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=11782[/tomatometer]10. AnacondaSay what you will about Ice Cube’s script choices in general — or about 1997’s Anaconda in particular — but when Luis Llosa was casting this B-movie spectacular and looking for someone to play Danny Rich, the baddest documentary cameraman on the Amazon, there was really only one man for the part. Who besides Ice Cube can look equally at home wielding a lens and chopping a giant anaconda to death with an axe? And sure, this is a silly flick — but at least it embraces the silliness. As Lisa Schwarzbaum put it in her review for Entertainment Weekly, “Anaconda, directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770771598[/tomatometer]9. The LongshotsIce Cube hasn’t always had the best luck with family films (Are We There Yet? and Are We Done Yet? being prime examples), and when word got out that he’d be starring in an inspirational sports drama directed by Fred Durst, it seemed safe to assume that The Longshots would be more of the same. While far from successful either critically or financially, this fact-based movie — about the obstacles overcome by Jasmine Plummer (Keke Palmer) to play in the Pop Warner Super Bowl — proved a pleasant surprise for some, including Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times, who mused, “The Longshots is a likable enough Cinderella story, one whose heart is clearly in the right place, even if it winds up on its sleeve once too often.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13586[/tomatometer]8. Higher LearningCube reunited with Boyz N the Hood director John Singleton for 1995’s Higher Learning, an ensemble drama about racial and sexual tensions in mid ‘90s America, as seen and embodied through a diverse group of college students. As a black nationalist nicknamed Fudge, Cube gave voice to much of the movie’s political subtext, and provided a counterpoint to the unfocused rage of white supremacist Remy (Michael Rapaport). Learning‘s thorny themes gave Singleton a lot to move through in a two-hour movie, and as far as most critics were concerned, he didn’t go deep enough — but others were simply happy to see a film with a message. As Todd McCarthy wrote for Variety, “Higher Learning has a great many things on its mind, which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12588[/tomatometer]7. The Glass ShieldAs he had with Boyz N the Hood — and would go on to do with Higher Learning — Ice Cube helped tackle racially charged topics in The Glass Shield, a police drama from director Charles Burnett about a rookie cop (Michael Boatman) who becomes the first black cop at an all-white station just in time to become involved in the wrongful prosecution of a murder suspect (Cube). Grossing a little over $3 million during its limited release, Shield slid under the radar, despite a cast that also included Lori Petty — but for a number of critics, it represented another solid entry in Burnett’s filmography. As Marjori Baumgarten summed it up for the Austin Chronicle, “Though The Glass Shield gets bogged down in some of its narrative byways, the journey, nonetheless, is rich and rewarding.”[tomatometer]MovieID=16233[/tomatometer]6. TrespassAfter the bloated misfire of 1990’s Another 48 Hrs., director Walter Hill needed a project that would get him back to basics, and he found it in Trespass, an urban update on The Treasure of the Sierra Madre that pitted two firefighters (Bill Paxton and William Sadler) against a gangster (Ice-T) and his bloodthirsty lieutenant (Ice Cube). Unapologetically nihilistic and gleefully violent, Trespass presaged future Hill vehicles like Last Man Standing (right down to the Ry Cooder soundtrack), with the added advantage of a cast filled with comically gifted character actors. Calling it “Claustrophobic, taut and efficient,” Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote, “like a streamlined car designed to simply get you there, Trespass wastes no time in setting up its premise — and then just barrels along with an in-your-face attitude and plenty of tightly wound tension.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10839[/tomatometer]5. Barbershop 2: Back in BusinessTwo years after the original Barbershop delivered a healthy return on its budget, Ice Cube and crew returned for the sequel, 2004’s Barbershop 2: Back in Business. While it wasn’t quite as critically or commercially successful as the original, Barbershop 2 expanded on its predecessor’s themes, offering commentary on African-American history — including the turbulent ’60s — while leaving plenty of room for laughs (and just enough screen time from Queen Latifah to set up her Beauty Shop spinoff). Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress was one of the critics who saw something special here, calling it “Still funny and warm, and blessed with wonderful characters, bright lines and far more perception of the human condition than you generally find in modern-American comedies.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13097[/tomatometer]4. FridayHow many laughs can you get out of a premise that basically revolves around a pair of unemployed twentysomethings sitting on the front porch? Ask anyone who’s seen Friday. Co-written by Cube and DJ Pooh, this low-budget cult classic follows the adventures of Craig (Cube) and Smokey (Chris Tucker) as they spend a Friday scrambling to come up with $200 to pay off Big Worm, the local dealer/ice cream man. A surprise (albeit minor) hit, Friday spawned a film and TV franchise — all of them unfortunately without Tucker, whose frenetic screen presence and easy comic chemistry with Cube helped jump-start his film career. Puffing new life into the moribund stoner comedy genre, it also earned the approval of scribes like eFilmCritic’s Scott Weinberg, who called it “an energetic and genuinely funny low-budget flick” and wrote, “This is why we wade through all the really bad ones; to find the unexpected pieces of comedy gold.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11030[/tomatometer]3. BarbershopIce Cube anchored an ensemble cast of character actors (like Keith David) and comedians (like Anthony Anderson) for this seriocomic look at a day in the life of disgruntled barbershop owner Calvin Palmer (Cube), who’s happy to sell his failing business to a local loan shark (David) — until he realizes what its disappearance will mean to his employees and the community at large. Like a number of Cube’s other efforts, Barbershop deals frankly with racial taboos, but it leavens its message with plenty of sharp laughs; it proved a potent combination at the box office, where the movie’s $77 million gross sparked a sequel, a spinoff, and a television series. It was popular with critics, too, among them Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, who called it “a broad, very funny, unexpectedly graceful comedy of character and community.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13042[/tomatometer]2. Three KingsCombining dark political satire with a good old-fashioned heist flick, David O. Russell’s Three Kings starred George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and (of course) Ice Cube as disillusioned Gulf War soldiers who plan to abscond with Kuwaiti gold in what seems like the perfect heist. Things don’t quite turn out that way, of course, but as the plan unfolds, Kings unloads some unflinching commentary on the war’s motivations and aftermath. For Ice Cube, it was a chance to prove his mettle with a solid cast, talented director, and terrific script; for critics, it offered a rare opportunity to see a gripping action movie with something to say. As Roger Ebert put it, “It has the freedom and recklessness of Oliver Stone or Robert Altman in their mad-dog days, and a visual style that hungers for impact.”&lt;[tomatometer]MovieID=13976[/tomatometer]1. Boyz n the HoodHe wrote the song from which the movie takes its name, so it’s only appropriate that Ice Cube’s film debut should come as part of John Singleton’s 1991 breakthrough, Boyz N the Hood. What no one could have guessed, though, was just how effective Cube would be as Darrin “Doughboy” Baker, the Crip-affiliated ex-con who chooses to remain in his violent lifestyle, no matter how profound the consequences might be. An auspicious debut for Singleton — who earned an Oscar nomination — Boyz promised great things for Cube’s acting career, and earned the respect of critics like Netflix’s James Rocchi, who called it “remarkable — a film full of political discussion and thought that also manages to involve us in the real, human lives of its characters.”In case you were wondering, here are Ice Cube’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Friday — 89%2. Boyz n the Hood — 88%3. The Players Club — 82%4. Next Friday — 77%5. Higher Learning — 77%6. All About the Benjamins — 77%7. Friday After Next — 76%8. Three Kings — 70%9.

Of course, our concept of the computer (and our knowledge of what it can actually do) has changed quite a bit since 1982, but Tron actually got a lot of things right — and to put it all in perspective, we thought it would be fun to spend this week’s feature taking a look back at some other computer-driven films. Which ones came closest to reality? Which ones got things most hilariously wrong? And which ones gave us glimpses at a future we’re still waiting for? It’s time to boot up another edition of Total Recall![tomatometer]MovieID=10689[/tomatometer]Colossus: The Forbin ProjectIn the midst of our Cold War paranoia, this techno-thriller (starring future Young &amp; the Restless mainstay Eric Braeden) gave audiences a pair of supercomputers — one American, one Soviet — that followed their defense programming to its logical conclusion: war is dumb, humans make war, and therefore humans must be controlled. Though the upcoming remake, with Will Smith attached to star, will doubtless put a more optimistic spin on Colossus‘ chilling ending, it won’t change the original’s cult status with sci-fi fans and critics like SFX’s Ian Berriman, who called it “A crisp, well-crafted movie that achieves its effects by calmly stating the facts, with the bare minimum of histrionics.”[tomatometer]MovieID=9601[/tomatometer]The Computer Wore Tennis ShoesThe first movie to use the word “computer” in its title — and the first installment in a trilogy that would later see Kurt Russell gain invisibility and superhuman strength — 1969’s The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes takes place in a world where a power surge somehow triggers a mind meld between a college student (Russell) and, well, a computer. As irredeemably silly as any of Disney’s other live-action offerings from the era, Tennis Shoes didn’t win many critical converts (Variety, in one of the few positive reviews, referred to it as “above average family entertainment”), but it’s become something of a cult classic — as evidenced by the 1995 TV remake, starring Kirk Cameron.[tomatometer]MovieID=12684[/tomatometer]Electric DreamsHow little did we know about computers in 1984? Little enough that this goofy little sci-fi/comedy/romance/thriller hybrid could program its way into theaters without being immediately laughed onto home video. Starring a young Virginia Madsen, Electric Dreams revolves around the travails of an inventor (Lenny Von Dohlen) who purchases a home computer (voiced by Bud Cort) that achieves sentience after he spills champagne on it. As if that weren’t silly enough, the computer (which calls itself Edgar) also develops something of a crush on the next-door neighbor (Madsen) — and after its overtures are spurned, writes a Giorgio Moroder song as a synthy farewell. Most critics were quick to find the flaws in Dreams‘ rather disjointed screenplay, but Roger Ebert was one of its defenders, noting, “It’s not often that a modern movie has the courage to give us a hero who doesn’t seem to be a cross between a disco god and an aerobics instructor, but the Von Dohlen character is a nice change.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10572[/tomatometer]HackersBoasting the tagline “Boot up or shut up! On line this fall,” posters for 1995’s Hackers promised slick, futuristic action — and, as is so dreadfully often the case, delivered a muddled assortment of computer culture cliches and plot points whose wild implausibility indicated a complete misunderstanding of the way technology works. However unlikely the events of the storyline, some critics enjoyed this tale of teen computer whizzes (led by Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie) and their battle against a swindling security expert (Fisher Stevens) — including Christopher Null of Filmcritic, who chuckled, “The real draw to Hackers is that it is so unexpectedly funny. Really funny. The comic scenes with the kids (and there are lots of them) are totally hilarious. The ‘serious’ scenes are too, because they are often so ridiculous.”[tomatometer]MovieID=14427[/tomatometer]The Lawnmower ManA sort of Flowers for Algernon with CGI and ill-advised sex, The Lawnmower Man takes the tiniest sliver of a Stephen King story and turns it into a whacked-out sci-fi thriller about a scientist (Pierce Brosnan) whose experiments on a disabled gardener (Jeff Fahey) turn him into a super-powered sociopath with a thirst for revenge on those who wronged him — and a daffy plan to enter virtual reality and become pure energy. King sued repeatedly to remove his name from the movie, but it attracted enough of an audience to inspire a direct-to-video sequel — and it earned limited admiration from critics like Mark Leeper, who wrote, “If the plot is overly predictable — and believe me, it is — the computer graphics are spectacular.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12897[/tomatometer]The MatrixWe’ve seen a lot of movies about computers taking over the world, and most of them (such as The Terminator) imagine an apocalyptic future in which hopelessly outgunned human freedom fighters wage an endless war against their binary overlords. All those ingredients are present in The Matrix, but with a nifty twist: most of the human race is being kept in pods, duped into experiencing a false reality while they unwittingly provide energy for the machines. It was a story big enough for a trilogy — not to mention assorted comic books, video games, and anime shorts — and whether the Wachowski brothers really ever managed to tie all of its ideas together is debatable. But for one shining moment in 1999, The Matrix blended thought-provoking philosophical questions with eye-popping special effects, and made us want to believe in a world where Keanu Reeves could be our only hope. “A wild ride, and worth the ticket price if only for the first-rate special effects,” wrote Jeffrey Overstreet of Looking Closer, adding, “There’s enough visionary work here to hold your attention for all 130 minutes.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12771[/tomatometer]The NetA year after Sandra Bullock thrilled audiences with Keanu Reeves in Speed, she suckered $110 million worth of them into seeing The Net, a frightfully silly thriller about a shut-in telecommuter (Sandra Bullock) whose lack of real-world relationships is exploited by a devious software engineer (Jeremy Northam) who needs only three days to steal her car, put her house on the market, and give her job to a doppelganger. Also in the mix? A group of nefarious hackers whose membership includes a fellow calling himself “Cyberbob.” No, the Internet never really worked this way — but in 1995, it all still seemed possible to plenty of people, including Caryn James of the New York Times, who approvingly wrote, “The Net is never quite as sleek and chilling as it might have been, but it gives the old story of a wrongly accused innocent a nerve-wracking ’90s twist.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12367[/tomatometer]Short CircuitOne of a handful of movies about computers gaining sentience through questionable means, Short Circuit follows the misadventures of a military robot who, after being struck by lightning, grows a personality — and powers strong enough to help El DeBarge score a Top 5 hit with one of the goofiest songs of the 1980s. Starring Ally Sheedy, Steve Guttenberg, and Fisher Stevens (with one of the decade’s silliest accents), this was another far-fetched computer tale for WarGames director John Badham — and a hit with critics like Derek Adams of Time Out, who called the anti-military-industrial complex comedy “a message film to please all ages.”[tomatometer]MovieID=9917[/tomatometer]2001: A Space Odyssey/2010: The Year We Make ContactOther computers may have done cooler stuff, with more impressive special effects, but only HAL 9000 can boast the accomplishment of having walked off with all the coolest lines in 2001: A Space Odyssey — and it isn’t like there was a whole lot of dialogue to go around. Voiced by Douglas Rain in the film (as well as its 1984 sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact), HAL was responsible for some pretty heinous stuff, including the deaths of most of the crew on board the Discovery. Later, of course, it was discovered that HAL’s actions were the result of faulty programming, but whether or not the all-seeing red orb was a willing antagonist, it was an important part of what the Chicago Tribune’s Michael Wilmington called “an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10278[/tomatometer]WarGamesUtter the phrase “How about a nice game of chess?” to any child of the 1980s, and you’ll get an instant education in the enduring appeal of WarGames, an admittedly far-fetched thriller about a budding hacker (Matthew Broderick) who uses a home-brewed modem setup to tunnel into a NORAD program and accidentally send the world to the brink of World War III. Featuring vintage John Badham direction, a perfectly electronic score, and a quintessentially ’80s cast rounded out by Ally Sheedy, Dabney Coleman, and Barry Corbin, WarGames gave arcade-busting nerds all over the world something to aspire to — and was, in the words of About.com’s Fred Topel, “a classic techno-thriller.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

The jury is still out on Mr. Peli’s career, but with Paranormal Activity 2 opening this week, we got to thinking about some of the other directors who got their start in horror, and it’s a pretty impressive list. Though it isn’t the most critically respected genre on the block, horror has often acted as a breeding ground for scary levels of Hollywood talent, and the seven directors profiled in this week’s Total Recall are proof![tomatometer]MovieID=726942605[/tomatometer]John SaylesBloody Beginnings: Like a couple of other directors on this list, Sayles got an early break from Roger Corman, who used Sayles’ screenwriting skills for 1978’s Piranha. This started a pretty good horror run for Sayles, who also wrote Alligator (1980) and The Howling (1981) to pay the bills for more contemplative fare, like 1980’s The Return of the Secaucus 7. It’s a pattern he’s followed throughout his career, alternating between thoughtful (and often critically lauded) dramas and paycheck gigs like his script rewrites for The Fugitive and Apollo 13.Non-Horror Highlights: There are plenty to choose from — both 1987’s Matewan and 1992’s Passion Fish boast 100 percent Tomatometers, and The Secret of Roan Innish (1994, 100 percent), City of Hope (1991, 93 percent), and Baby It’s You (1983, 93 percent) aren’t far behind. For a real sense of Sayles’ breadth as an artist, schedule a triple bill of any of the above, Piranha, and the delightfully strange Brother from Another Planet (1984, 92 percent).What’s Next: It’s anyone’s guess as to when (or if) it’ll finally reach theaters, but Sayles has reportedly been commissioned to write the script for the fourth Jurassic Park.[tomatometer]MovieID=16969[/tomatometer]Sam RaimiBloody Beginnings: While other kids were collecting action figures and secret decoder rings, Raimi was making movies with his dad’s Super 8 camera — and his pal Bruce Campbell. They proved it was more than just a hobby with 1978’s Within the Woods, a 30-minute short with a minuscule budget ($1,400) and a storyline that would form the basis for The Evil Dead in 1981. More than $1.2 billion in worldwide grosses (and two Evil Dead sequels) later, Campbell’s one of the most beloved cult actors currently working, and Raimi is one of the few directors who can move between genre fare (Drag Me to Hell) and blockbusters (Spider-Man).Non-Horror Highlights: The 1999 Kevin Costner baseball drama For Love of the Game (64 percent); 1990’s pulpy cult classic Darkman (78 percent); 1998’s subtly creepy thriller A Simple Plan (90 percent); and, of course, the first two Spider-Man movies, which weigh in at 89 and 93 percent, respectively.What’s Next: He’s been rumored to direct a Warcraft movie and a new Shadow picture, but it looks like Raimi’s next project will be Oz, the Great and Powerful, a Wizard of Oz prequel starring Robert Downey, Jr.[tomatometer]MovieID=746821350[/tomatometer]Oliver StoneBloody Beginnings: Before he was the award-winning iconoclast behind films such as Platoon and JFK, Oliver Stone cut his filmmaking teeth on a pair of horror flicks: 1974’s Seizure, starring Herve “Tattoo” Villechaize and Troy Donohue, and 1981’s The Hand, starring Michael Caine as a cartoonist whose severed hand takes on a murderous life of its own. A far cry from the Oscar-approved stuff Stone would direct in the 1980s and 1990s, in other words — but also arguably a lot more fun than 2008’s Bush biopic W..Non-Horror Highlights: It’s become fashionable to deride his efforts, but Stone’s career is filled with highlights, from his screenwriting credits (including Scarface and Midnight Express) to his work behind the camera, which has earned nine Oscars and counting. The cream of the crop: 1986’s Salvador (91 percent) and Platoon (86 percent), 1989’s Born on the Fourth of July (89 percent), 1991’s JFK (83 percent), and 1988’s somewhat underrated Talk Radio (80 percent).What’s Next: Now that Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps is out of the way, Stone will reportedly turn his full focus to a documentary series titled Oliver Stone’s Secret History of America.[tomatometer]MovieID=17781[/tomatometer]Peter JacksonBloody Beginnings: His films have earned a combined $1.3 billion and 20 Oscars — not bad for a guy who got his start with the aptly named low-budget alien invasion picture Bad Taste, the violent puppet cult classic Meet the Feebles, and the gory zombie comedy Dead Alive. It wasn’t until 1994’s Heavenly Creatures that Jackson was able to turn his penchant for dark fantasy into something a little more, shall we say, serious — and pick up the first of his many Academy Award nominations in the process.Non-Horror Highlights: Though criticized for its length, Jackson’s King Kong remake (2005, 83 percent) stands on its own — albeit not as tall as Heavenly Creatures (1994, 95 percent) or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, whose installments weigh in at 92, 96, and 94 percent on the Tomatometer.What’s Next: Perhaps you’ve heard that Jackson will be directing a small independent feature titled The Hobbit — or the sequel to the upcoming Adventures of Tintin, which he’s co-producing with Steven Spielberg.[tomatometer]MovieID=18029[/tomatometer]Francis Ford CoppolaBloody Beginnings: His name is synonymous with classics like The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, but film buffs know that Francis Ford Coppola got his start as a member of the Roger Corman stable of filmmakers, where he co-directed the Boris Karloff feature The Terror and made his solo directorial debut with 1963’s Dementia 13. When Coppola helmed Bram Stoker’s Dracula in 1992, he wasn’t just bringing the world’s most famous vampire back to life at the box office, he was returning to his roots.Non-Horror Highlights: Like you need us to tell you, but take a look at these critical winners: The Godfather (1972, 100 percent), The Conversation (1974, 98 percent), The Godfather, Part II (1974, 98 percent), Apocalypse Now (1979, 98 percent), Peggy Sue Got Married (1986, 88 percent), and the list goes on. In fact, following Coppola’s directorial output in descending Tomatometer order, you’d have to go through a full ten films before reaching Rotten territory — with Dementia 13 (59 percent).What’s Next: Coppola’s currently out making the promotional rounds for the new Apocalypse Now Blu-ray set (read his Rotten Tomatoes interview here!) and serving as executive producer for On the Road, starring Viggo Mortensen, Amy Adams, and Kristen Stewart.[tomatometer]MovieID=770673391[/tomatometer]James CameronBloody Beginnings: A graduate of the Roger Corman film factory, Cameron was handling the special effects for Piranha II when the original director left, giving Cameron an unexpected promotion — and a golden opportunity to kick off his own directorial career. He never looked back, striking paydirt with 1984’s The Terminator and 1986’s Aliens — and writing an early version of the screenplay for Rambo: First Blood Part II in between. These days, Cameron’s the king of the filmmaking world, with a pair of the highest-grossing movies of all time (Titanic and Avatar) to his credit, as well as an assortment of technological filmmaking advances spurred by his restless vision.Non-Horror Highlights: Even if you count Aliens as a horror movie, Cameron hasn’t dabbled in the genre for quite some time; the vast majority of his filmography is non-horror — and critically approved, too, from 1994’s True Lies (69 percent) to the first two Terminator movies (100 and 98 percent, respectively). And let’s not forget The Abyss (1989, 88 percent) and the massive blockbusters Avatar (2009, 83 percent) and Titanic (1997, 82 percent). He doesn’t make movies often, but when he does, he makes them count.What’s Next: There’s a long list of prospective projects, from the 3-D Cleopatra movie starring Angelina Jolie to an Avatar sequel, an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel, a segment from the upcoming Heavy Metal movie, and a 3-D project involving the Black Eyed Peas. And that doesn’t even take into account the films Cameron is producing, including Guillermo del Toro’s long-awaited adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft’s At the Mountains of Madness.[tomatometer]MovieID=10431[/tomatometer]Steven SpielbergBloody Beginnings: Spielberg got his start on TV, directing episodes of shows like The Name of the Game and Marcus Welby, M.D. — and showing enough flair to get the attention of Universal, where he signed the four-picture deal that led to Duel (1972, 86 percent) and Jaws (1975, 100 percent). These days, Spielberg is more likely to give us films like Saving Private Ryan and Munich, but with four Oscars and more than $3.7 billion in box office receipts under his belt, it seems safe to say no one’s complaining.Non-Horror Highlights: Spielberg’s biggest critical hits read like a roll call for some of the most successful films of the last 30-plus years, including E.T. (1982, 98 percent), Schindler’s List (1993, 97 percent), Catch Me If You Can (2002, 96 percent), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977, 95 percent), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, 94 percent). If you love movies, it’s hard not to have at least one Spielberg film in your personal top 10.What’s Next: Spielberg has a pair of directorial efforts in the pipeline: The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn and War Horse, both scheduled for release in 2011.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

If you’re wondering how much further Jigsaw’s legacy can possibly go, you’re not alone — but this time around, the addition of 3-D introduces a new visual component, as well as adding yet another chapter to the long Hollywood saga of using gimmicks to sell movies. It got us thinking about some of the other would-be innovations introduced over the years — and we figured if Smell-O-Vision, SignScope, and Sensurround were good enough for the studios that backed them, it’s about time they got some recognition. So step right up, ladies and gents, for the most sensational, amazingly lifelike, thrillingly spellbinding Total Recall you’ve ever seen…or your money back![tomatometer]MovieID=771076335[/tomatometer]Smell-O-VisionThe brainchild of Mike Todd, Jr., the son of Around the World in 80 Days producer Mike Todd, Smell-O-Vision was used only once — for 1960’s Scent of Mystery, an alleged thriller starring Peter Lorre and Elizabeth Taylor (who was married to the senior Todd when he perished in a 1958 plane crash).Using signals from the film’s soundtrack, Smell-O-Vision delivered scents via tubes leading to audience members’ seats. It was a fairly advanced system, which is probably why it didn’t work very well; if people weren’t complaining about the tubes hissing, they were complaining that the scents arrived too late or weren’t strong enough. Todd rushed to make improvements, but it was too late — both for Smell-O-Vision and the movie, which was re-released in odorless form as Holiday in Spain, only to fail a second time. (Decades later, MTV aired Scent as part of an appropriately kitschy promotion involving scratch and sniff cards; let us be thankful they haven’t tried something similar with Jersey Shore.)[tomatometer]MovieID=771136289[/tomatometer]AromaRamaLike Smell-O-Vision, AromaRama was developed by a businessman with a “junior” appended to his name: theater chain owner Walter Reade, Jr., who rushed his competing odor delivery system to market in what Variety trumpeted as “the war of the smellies.” As it turned out, Reade’s AromaRama actually made its debut a few weeks before Smell-O-Vision, but it suffered an identical fate.The one and only AromaRama film, Behind the Great Wall, took viewers on a trip through China — something that would have seemed exotic to most filmgoers in 1959, with or without the addition of more than 100 scents. (The list included grass, firecrackers, and…horse.) Unfortunately, AromaRama’s delivery system wasn’t quite as sophisticated as Smell-O-Vision’s: scents were merely pumped in through the air conditioning vents, one after another, and the cumulative effect left filmgoers wishing they could build a great wall of their own.[tomatometer]MovieID=17119[/tomatometer]Percepto!Pioneered by human gimmick maestro William Castle, who had dreamed up stuff like audience “fright insurance” (for 1958’s Macabre) and sent a plastic skeleton flying across the theater during House on Haunted Hill, Percepto! was an admittedly nifty — and typically low-budget — innovation that helped Castle’s The Tingler live up to its name.Starring Vincent Price as a doctor who discovers that the physical jolt of fear is actually a spinal parasite that can only be killed by screaming, the movie used a sequence depicting the Tingler’s invasion of a movie theater to deliver a well-timed jolt to select audience members via buzzers installed under randomly chosen seats. Coupled with Castle’s pre-film warning that “a scream at the right time may save your life” — and phony nurses wheeling staged victims into a fake ambulance outside the theater — Percepto! was a perfectly cheesy B-movie gimmick that brought palpitations to more credulous filmgoers. It’s surely only a matter of time before James Cameron perfects the technology.[tomatometer]MovieID=17223[/tomatometer]Illusion-OAnother of William Castle’s gimmicks, Illusion-O helped sell 1960’s 13 Ghosts, an otherwise rather unremarkable thriller about a family lifted out of poverty when they inherit a mansion (complete with buried treasure) from a relative — only to discover it’s already home to a passel of ornery spirits. (Bonus points for guessing how many!)Castle filmed the ghosts using a process he named Illusion-O, which basically consisted of tinting them blue; filmgoers tested their bravery by choosing to watch the movie with red glasses (thus “revealing” the ghosts) or blue ones (supposedly hiding them). The whole thing was basically moot — as anyone who’s ever watched 13 Ghosts on cable or DVD knows, the ghosts were visible without glasses — but as an example of Castle’s low-budget genius, it’s perfect.[tomatometer]MovieID=9921[/tomatometer]CineramaUnderstandably a little freaked out about the dawn of the television era, the major studios desperately looked for ways to remind audiences that there’s nothing like going to the movies — and for a short time, it looked like Cinerama might be an answer.During a time when even the biggest television looked hopelessly dorky next to a theater screen, Cinerama took film’s size advantage and blew it up to ridiculous proportions with a system so big it required three interlocked projectors and a special screen to show it. When it worked, it was admittedly spectacular — even the New York Times’ noted crank Bosley Crowther was impressed, describing it as “‘sensational,’ in the literal sense of that word” — but it had plenty of drawbacks, including visible seams between the films and constant parallax distortion. Cinerama was mainly used for documentaries, and its three-camera system was too expensive to continue using for more than a decade, but it sparked the development of new formats like Ultra Panavision 70 (not to mention IMAX), and with the restoration of a handful of Cinerama theaters in recent years, it’s undergone something of a revival.[tomatometer]MovieID=770796396[/tomatometer]Split ScreenThese days, it’s used mainly to evoke a cheesy 1960s vibe, but once upon a time, split-screen cinema was a cutting edge technique, used effectively in films as varied as Woodstock and Carrie. It reached its illogical conclusion with 1973’s Wicked, Wicked, which slapped a new nickname on it (“Duo-Vision”) and used it to tell two stories, simultaneously, for the length of the movie.Promising “Twice the tension! Twice the terror!” but succeeding mainly in delivering twice the risk of film-related migraines, Wicked, Wicked was the work of producer/director/writer Richard L. Bare, who decided that if people could pay attention to both sides of the road while driving, they could do the same thing with both sides of the screen. Amazingly, Bare was able to sell his concept to MGM; filmgoers proved a little harder to convince, and Wicked, Wicked — along with Duo-Vision — quickly fell into obscurity.[tomatometer]MovieID=11561[/tomatometer]SensurroundShould you ever doubt Hollywood’s cheerful shamelessness when it comes to outrageously inflated promotion, just pause and reflect on Sensurround, the 1970s gimmick that claimed to make movies more viscerally immersive than ever. How, you ask? Simple: by adding a bunch of subwoofers to the theater’s speaker system.Developed, appropriately enough, for 1974’s Earthquake, Sensurround was initially a success, and helped further the “event movie” fad with Midway (1976) and Rollercoaster (1977). Cineplex owners quickly realized, however, that all that extra booming and rumbling had a tendency to spill over into adjacent theaters, prompting complaints from other patrons — and since the Sensurround system allowed for fewer seats anyway, its long-term prospects were pretty dim. Rival technologies like Sound 360 and Megasound persisted into the early ’80s, but the advent of ever-fancier digital audio ultimately made them irrelevant.[tomatometer]MovieID=771062261[/tomatometer]SignScopeWe’ve seen countless adaptations of Bram Stoker’s Dracula over the years, and all manner of vampires have graced the screen — but only one of them knew American Sign Language. We’re talking, of course, about the star of 1975’s Deafula, the first and last movie filmed in SignScope.Everything about that opening paragraph is easy to mock, but there’s something pure and noble about a movie made completely with sign language; if only the first one hadn’t been such a rambling, unintentionally hilarious mess, more filmmakers might have been inspired to follow suit. Toss in the stunningly literal voice track, which adds another surreal layer to a movie that was already plenty bizarre on its own, and you’re left with one of the more thorough — and thoroughly admirable — failures in film history. These days, closed captioning is commonplace, making it exceedingly unlikely that we’ll ever see the likes of SignScope again. Alas.[tomatometer]MovieID=13768[/tomatometer]OdoramaUnlike a lot of gimmicks that were sold to theater patrons as the next great wave of cinema, Odorama was developed as an intentionally chintzy stunt — which is unsurprising, considering that it sprung from the mind of director John Waters, who used it to promote 1982’s Polyester.A subversive homage to the films of Douglas Sirk, Polyester followed the bizarre adventures of Baltimore housewife Francine Fishpaw (Divine), whose keen sense of smell led filmgoers on an olfactory journey that included flowers, pizza, grass, and, in true Waters style, poop. This was accomplished with a scratch and sniff card containing ten numbered spots; when a number flashed on the screen, viewers duly inhaled the corresponding aroma. Ironically, Odorama was better received than the more expensive Smell-O-Vision or AromaRama — and at 88 percent on the Tomatometer, Polyester didn’t stink.[tomatometer]MovieID=10048[/tomatometer]Multiple EndingsChildren of the 1980s will remember this gimmick well, thanks to Jonathan Lynn’s Clue — a comedic murder mystery, inspired by the classic Hasbro board game, that came to theaters with three endings.It went down as one of the more ignominious flops of the decade, but not for lack of buzz; unlike a lot of the other gimmicks on this list, Clue‘s different endings really were sort of revolutionary, and if the critical reaction and word of mouth hadn’t been so lukewarm, people might have been inspired to see them all. In the end, though, most people didn’t see Clue at all, let alone bother to figure out which versions were playing at their local theaters. Needless to say, multiple endings never caught on, but now that DVDs have made alternate endings common — and with a Clue remake on the horizon — maybe it’s an idea whose time has come.[tomatometer]MovieID=9488[/tomatometer]IMAXFor the first few decades of its existence, IMAX was, for most film fans, little more than an afterthought — the expense involved in building a theater, coupled with the length limitations of the film format, meant that most IMAX features were documentaries and nature films, shown in museums, planetariums, and amusement parks. It wasn’t until Disney gave Fantasia 2000 an exclusive IMAX release that the industry woke up to its wider commercial potential.These days, of course, a film isn’t truly a major release unless it lands on the big screen and the really big screen — and although filming mainstream releases in IMAX is still too expensive for all but the Christopher Nolans and Michael Bays of the industry, it seems safe to assume that the super-sized sequences in The Dark Knight and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen have only scratched the surface of what this particular gimmick can do for the moviegoing experience.[tomatometer]MovieID=770685393[/tomatometer]D-BOXThe dirtiest-sounding gimmick on our list is also the youngest: The first theatrical release to incorporate D-BOX technology was 2009’s Fast and Furious, which used special seats containing electromagnetic pistons to simulate motion effects. They were only installed in a handful of theaters, but it was a big step forward for the company, and another attention-getting innovation for an industry desperate to lure audiences back from home theaters.Interestingly, the premium home theater market is where D-BOX has mostly focused its efforts, via a series of pacts with studios that have led to an ever-expanding list of video titles shipping with built-in motion encoding. At this point, you’re far more likely to see the D-BOX logo on the packaging for a new action Blu-ray, or a video game, than in an ad for a film — but who knows? The day of the 3-D IMAX D-BOX feature may not be far away.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

It’s a long, rich tradition that stretches back to the silent era, so when we saw that Tony Scott and Denzel Washington’s latest collaboration, Unstoppable, was an action thriller about a killer runaway train loaded with nuclear explosives… well, naturally, we decided to dedicate this week’s Total Recall to some of the most noteworthy entries in the long list of railroad movies. At a mere dozen entries, this chronologically-arranged list is obviously far from complete, but we think you’ll find some of your favorites (and at least one unnecessary sequel). Which movies would you add? Let us know in the comments![tomatometer]MovieID=770674257[/tomatometer]The Great Train RobberyThough it’s probably the shortest film ever to get the Total Recall treatment, the 12-minute The Great Train Robbery may also be the most influential: not only did it establish a new benchmark for narrative filmmaking, but it also utilized a number of new techniques, including cross-cutting, double exposure, and shooting on location. Accomplishing in just a few minutes what many films fail to do in two hours, Robbery established our lengthy cinematic love affair with the railroad; it was, as Dennis Schwartz of Ozus’ World Movie Reviews wrote, “The most widely viewed picture of its time.”[tomatometer]MovieID=534309484[/tomatometer]The General1927’s The General found Buster Keaton taking his peerless physical comedy to a more ambitious level, dramatizing a legendary Civil War raid with some of the most dangerous, complicated, and expensive stunts of the silent film era. An unmitigated critical and commercial disaster at the time of its release, The General was one of Keaton’s biggest disappointments, but it was really just a movie ahead of its time; in the years since, it’s made numerous top critics’ Best Movies lists, made the top 20 in the AFI’s “100 Years…100 Laughs,” and been enshrined in the National Film Registry. It is, in the words of the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr, “An almost perfect entertainment.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10699[/tomatometer]Strangers on a TrainTrains were a recurring theme in Alfred Hitchcock’s work, popping up as plot devices (The 39 Steps and North by Northwest) or even almost characters unto themselves (The Lady Vanishes). For the purposes of this list, however, we’re climbing aboard 1951’s Strangers on a Train, Hitch’s troubled adaptation of the Patricia Highsmith novel. From the script’s tortured birth to the director’s battles with Warner Bros. over casting, nothing seemed to come easily during Strangers‘ production, and early reviews were lukewarm — but almost 50 years later, it’s regarded as one of the master’s finest works, both as a smart adaptation of the book and as a rich, subtext-heavy thriller. “Two men, a problem, and a crime is an old theme,” wrote Mark Athitakis for Filmcritic.com, “but the list of works that exploit it perfectly is a short one. Strangers on a Train belongs on it.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10324[/tomatometer]Murder on the Orient ExpressSidney Lumet lined up an all-star cast for this adaptation of the 1934 Agatha Christie novel, and although Christie famously felt Albert Finney lacked a splendid enough mustache to play Hercule Poirot, 1974’s Murder on the Orient Express still steamed its way to six Academy Award nominations (including a Best Supporting Actress win for Ingrid Bergman) and heaps of critical acclaim. Packed with old-fashioned intrigue and bolstered by the talents of Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, and Vanessa Redgrave — not to mention Finney and Bergman — Express earned the admiration of the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, who appreciated the way it “recalls that innocent, pre-Amtrak time when the Orient was still mysterious and railroad travel was full of exotic possibilities.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13579[/tomatometer]The Taking of Pelham One Two ThreeThe 2009 remake offers serviceable, slick action thrills, but for the grittiest, sweatiest train movie of them all, you’ve got to go back to the original Taking of Pelham One Two Three. Released in 1974, it’s the story of a grizzled New York Transit Authority cop (Walter Matthau) forced to defuse a hostage crisis when a gang of criminals (led by Robert Shaw) commandeers a subway train and gives the authorities one hour to deliver a $1 million ransom. (Hey, it was a long time ago.) Taut, smartly written, and adroitly balanced between sharp dialogue and nifty set pieces, Pelham has come to be regarded as a somewhat overlooked classic of the era; it is, as William Thomas wrote for Empire Magazine, “The kind of gritty, relentless thriller that could only come from the ’70s.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10331[/tomatometer]Silver StreakThe first of four collaborations between Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, 1976’s Silver Streak stars Wilder as George Caldwell, a shy book editor whose plans for a boring L.A.-Chicago train ride go awry when he finds himself embroiled in a complicated (and rather deadly) plot to cover up the truth about a pair of forged Rembrandts. Just when poor George thinks he’s lucked into some railway nookie with a fellow passenger (Jill Clayburgh), he ends up the unwitting target of a gangster (Ray Walston) who has him tossed off the train — twice! — and he needs the help of an impeccably mustachioed crook (Pryor) to save the day (and the lady). It’s very silly, and just as uneven, but Silver Streak has more than enough inspired moments to make up for the bumpy spots; as David Nusair observed for Reel Film Reviews, “the entire film might just be worth a look for the sequence in which Pryor teaches Wilder how to be black.”[tomatometer]MovieID=14197[/tomatometer]Runaway TrainWhat do you get when you take a train in the Alaskan wilderness, put an insane Jon Voight on it, give him Eric Roberts for a sidekick, and throw in a little Danny Trejo for good measure? The answer lies in this ‘80s action classic about a violent lunatic (Voight) who escapes from prison with the help of a dimwitted convict (Roberts) and ends up stowing away on a train that just happens to be on a collision course…with DEATH! Ahem. The cast and the premise suggest cheesy B-movie thrills, but Runaway Train boasts a surprisingly impressive pedigree — the script was based on a Kurosawa screenplay, and director Andrei Konchalovsky was still years away from succumbing to the nonsense of Tango &amp; Cash. As Geoff Andrew wrote for Time Out, “Somehow one leaves aside the blatant implausibilities, the coincidences, even Eric Roberts, and takes great pleasure in a breakneck ride to the end of the line.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11858[/tomatometer]Throw Momma from the TrainIn 1987, Strangers on a Train received a darkly comedic update in the form of Throw Momma from the Train, a Danny DeVito directorial effort about a struggling writer (Billy Crystal) whose plagiarist ex-wife (Kate Mulgrew) is living large on the success of a book she stole from him, and the browbeaten middle-aged college student (DeVito) who cooks up a plan to get rid of her — as well as his own battle axe of a mother (Anne Ramsey). While far from a universal success with critics (the Washington Post’s Rita Kempley suggested filmgoers “throw the whole thing in front of a subway and hope it gets dragged for a couple of miles”), Throw Momma‘s blend of mordant humor and well-cast comic foils earned admiration from writers like Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress, who called it “A rather sweet little comedy masquerading as a black comedy.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13970[/tomatometer]Under Siege 2: Dark TerritoryIt’s irredeemably silly — and it’s considered a disappointment even in the often painful context of the Steven Seagal filmography — but we’d be remiss if we didn’t tip our conductor’s cap to Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, the train-bound sequel to Seagal’s 1992 hit about Casey Ryback, a NAVY Seal-turned-chef with a John McClane-like propensity for crossing paths with maniacal villains. Having saved the world from a boat in Under Siege, Ryback hit the rails here, riding with his niece (Katherine Heigl) on a journey to visit the grave of her father; before they can get there, though, their train is hijacked by Travis Dane (a scenery-gobbling Eric Bogosian), who intends to earn a billion-dollar payday by using a space laser to blow up the East Coast. It’s no wonder there was never an Under Siege 3 — not yet, anyway — but this is the only movie on this (or any) list whose climax features the bad guy having his fingers cut off by a helicopter door. As the Arizona Daily Star’s Phil Villarreal shrugged in his begrudgingly positive review, “Run-of-the-mill Seagal. Could be better, could be worse.”[tomatometer]MovieID=9372[/tomatometer]The Polar ExpressYeah, yeah, we know — Robert Zemeckis probably needs to step away from the mo-cap machine and give us a movie that doesn’t star dead-eyed animatrons. But in this cynical age, isn’t it worth something to have a film that believes so clearly in wonder — and goes to such great lengths to share that wonder with its audience? It may not be worth a great deal of critical goodwill, as evidenced by The Polar Express‘ underwhelming 56 percent on the Tomatometer, but between its $300 million theatrical gross, the Polar Express amusement park ride, and the general lack of modern Christmas movies for kids that aren’t thoroughly crass, it’s easy to understand why so many people agree with Tony Toscano of Talking Pictures, who praised it as “A warm fuzzy for the holidays.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770670652[/tomatometer]The Darjeeling LimitedPeople in the movies just don’t travel by train as much as they used to — unless, that is, they’re the sort of lovable eccentrics that populate Wes Anderson movies. For example: 2007’s The Darjeeling Limited, named for the train booked by Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) to take himself and his brothers Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Peter (Adrien Brody) on a trip across India. They haven’t seen each other since the death of their father a year previous, and their squabbling quickly makes it apparent why; in fact, it gets them kicked off the train, adding another surreal component to a journey that already had plenty of them. “Brothers and other strangers ride The Darjeeling Limited,” exhorted Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer, calling it “Wes Anderson’s captivating road movie that views life as a Great Train of Being.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770679862[/tomatometer]TranssiberianAn ensemble cast, a slowly unraveling mystery, and a railway journey where little is as it seems — Brad Anderson’s Transsiberian was released in 2008, but it’s stocked with timeless cinematic ingredients. And it makes smart use of them, too; the smartly twisted script, co-written by Anderson and Will Conroy, recalls themes that will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s seen a Hitchcock film (such as Strangers on a Train, perhaps?), but it isn’t slavishly derivative — and it’s solidly cast, with Woody Harrelson, Kate Mara, Emily Mortimer, Ben Kingsley, and Eduardo Noriega turning in superlative work. As Roger Ebert appreciatively noted, “Transsiberian starts in neutral, taking the time to introduce its characters, and then goes from second into high like greased lightning. I was a little surprised to notice how thoroughly it wound me up. This is a good one.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

With that kind of track record, folks will bend the rules for you once in awhile, and in that spirit, we’ve decided to dedicate this week’s feature to Mr. Fincher’s filmography, presented in chronological order. He may not have enough movies to his credit to round out a Top Ten, but many of the ones he has made are among the most compelling of the last 20 years. But don’t take our word for it — let’s see what the critics have to say, Total Recall style![tomatometer]MovieID=14276[/tomatometer]Alien 3After making a splash as a director of music videos and commercials — including the legendary commercial clip that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette — Fincher got his big feature break with the highly anticipated third installment of the Alien franchise. Unfortunately, all that anticipation turned to scorn once Alien 3 arrived in theaters, but it wasn’t all Fincher’s fault; as a rookie 30-year-old director, he never had a chance against the studio confusion and constant script doctoring that plagued the project. Not many people understood that in 1992, though, and it didn’t soothe Fincher’s frustration, which was significant enough to send him temporarily back to videos and commercials. Still, even if Alien 3 is widely regarded as the weak link in the original quadrilogy, it has its admirers — including Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman, who called it “a grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on.”[tomatometer]MovieID=22538[/tomatometer]SevenChagrined by his experiences with Alien 3, Fincher swore off feature films for a year and a half — and then he read Andrew Kevin Walker’s script for Seven. An unrelentingly grim portrait of a society in its hellish death throes, the grisly drama followed a pair of police detectives (Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman) in pursuit of a serial killer whose ingeniously executed murder victims serve as human embodiments of the seven deadly sins. Fincher, who’d become painfully well acquainted with studio interference while making Alien 3, was forced to defend his bleak vision for the film, which New Line nearly sent to theaters with a different, less brutally shocking ending — but Pitt refused to promote the altered cut, and the result was one of the biggest hits of the year, as well as a nightmare-inducing favorite for critics like Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle, who wrote, “Positively dripping with a soggy, oppressive atmosphere, the film is blanketed with a miasma of madness.”[tomatometer]MovieID=15651[/tomatometer]The GameFlush with the success of Seven, Fincher returned his focus to a project he’d begun earlier: The Game, a twisty psychological thriller starring Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton, an investment banker whose wealth and success mask a personal life bereft of meaningful connections. On his birthday, Nicholas receives a darkly intriguing gift from his brother (Sean Penn): admission to a mysterious “game” with apparently life-changing results. And Nicholas’ life is indeed quickly changed — turned upside down, in fact, as he realizes that playing the game has profound, and perhaps even fatal, consequences. Though many critics were quick to point out the implausibilities in The Game‘s head-spinning plot, the majority were too wrapped up in its stylish thrill ride to care. “The picture provides Douglas with one of his best roles,” wrote Mick LaSalle for the San Francisco Chronicle. “If he doesn’t quite reach the bizarre heights he achieved in Falling Down, The Game makes its own demands.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13153[/tomatometer]Fight ClubYes, we are going to talk about Fight Club. Initially rejected by critics and ignored by audiences, Fincher’s fourth feature steadily built a cult following on DVD; these days, it’s widely regarded as one of the best films of the 1990s, which not only helped reaffirm Fincher as a director of stylishly thoughtful fare, but established the Hollywood bona fides of author Chuck Palahniuk, from whose novel the movie was adapted. The plot follows the eager descent of a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) into the anti-establishment crusade of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who organizes the underground brawling network known as Fight Club, but on a deeper level, the story functions as a bloody, black-humored indictment of consumer culture. And more importantly, in the words of ReelView’s James Berardinelli, “Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture — a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer.”[tomatometer]MovieID=13778[/tomatometer]Panic RoomA claustrophobic thriller with the heart of a B movie, Panic Room found Fincher taking another stellar cast (including Jodie Foster, Forest Whitaker, and a young Kristen Stewart) and dropping them in the middle of a tightly wound, tension-filled storyline. Panic sets in almost immediately, with single parent Meg Altman (Foster) and her daughter Sarah (Stewart) spending their first night in the huge Manhattan brownstone Meg has just purchased; what Meg and Sarah don’t know is that their new home contains some very valuable hidden treasure — as well as a trio of very bad men (including the skin-crawling Dwight Yoakam and a mysteriously cornrowed Jared Leto) who will stop at nothing to steal it. Where most Fincher films explore thoughtful themes and carry larger messages, Panic Room is mostly just a nail-biter — but one directed with uncommon flair. As Joe Baltake for the Sacramento Bee put it, “The star of this movie is Fincher, who has filmed it in a grand style that manages to avoid showy excesses.”[tomatometer]MovieID=358188521[/tomatometer]ZodiacIt’s a movie about one of the most famous serial killers in American history, and it was helmed by the director responsible for Seven — but 2007’s Zodiac is surprisingly light on gore. In fact, while he looms over every minute of the film, it’s really not about the Zodiac Killer at all; rather than focusing on the death toll left in the wake of his murderous spree, it examines the price paid by those who dedicated their lives to solving the case — specifically San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist-turned-sleuth Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his colleague, crime reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.). Zodiac is just as dark and visually arresting as you’d expect, given the story and who directed it, but its pensive approach surprised critics — not to mention Paramount, where the marketing campaign played up the story’s grisly element and misleadingly drew ties to Seven. It all added up to a box office disaster, and the source of some of the best reviews of Fincher’s career. Imagining that Fincher was “aching for a return to smart suspense films from the likes of Sidney Lumet and Alan J. Pakula,” Mark Bourne of Film.com lauded the way Zodiac “pulls us by the collar into the frame and cranks the sense of menace taut without cheap tricks or cop-out gimmicks.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770669386[/tomatometer]1. The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonTurning an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story into a $150 million, 166-minute epic, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button reunited Fincher with Brad Pitt — who played the backwards-aging Benjamin — and found him delivering his most mainstream-friendly film since 2002’s Panic Room. It featured a marquee-friendly cast (including Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, and Julia Ormond), revolved around the high drama of a man forced to live his life in reverse, and was stacked high with sweeping cinematography and a Forrest Gump-style survey of 20th century American history, making it the perfect Christmas Day release and an odds-on Academy Awards favorite. It ended up earning 13 Oscar nominations, but won only three (Art Direction, Makeup, and Visual Effects), reflecting the vague sense of disappointment that shadowed Button‘s eventual $333 million worldwide gross. Though it may not have been an unqualified smash, it still found plenty of critical allies — including Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, who wrote, “The film quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one-of-a-kind meditation on mortality, time’s inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love.”In case you were wondering, here are Fincher’s top 10 movies according RT users’ scores:1. Fight Club — 95%2. Seven — 94%3. The Game — 82%4. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button — 81%5. Zodiac — 73%6. Panic Roon — 61%7.

Once we rubbed our eyes and blinked a few times to make sure we weren’t reading those names wrong, we got to thinking about other unexpected choices made by Academy-approved actors, and before we knew it, we had a whole Total Recall full of them. From box office hits to ignoble flops, from critics’ favorites to the lowest depths of the Tomatometer, it’s time to celebrate weird post-Oscar roles. Add your favorites in the comments![tomatometer]MovieID=9737[/tomatometer]Roberto Benigni, PinocchioLike plenty of other Oscar-winning actors, Roberto Benigni used the clout he earned with his awards (Best Actor and Best Foreign Film for Life Is Beautiful) to help get his passion project made. And it had plenty of potential, too — Carlo Callodi’s The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic book, but the character has become more closely identified with its somewhat bowdlerized Disney counterpart, and Benigni could have channeled his love for the book into a more faithful film. Alas, he chose instead to create one of the strangest (and vaguely creepiest) family movies of the 21st century, starring Benigni himself (who also directed and co-wrote the script) as the impish wooden boy. In fairness, it should be pointed out that the international version of Pinocchio did fairly well, but in the States, the English overdubs only compounded the overall weirdness of what unfolded on the screen. As an incredulous Edward Guthmann asked for the San Francisco Chronicle: “What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log?”[tomatometer]MovieID=17260[/tomatometer]Marlon Brando, The Island of Dr. MoreauArguably the oddest entry on this list (or in the history of modern mainstream film), the 1996 version of H.G. Wells’ classic story The Island of Dr. Moreau features a number of oddball performances and enough behind-the-scenes drama to fill a book. For sheer strangeness, though, nothing beats two-time Best Actor winner (for On the Waterfront and The Godfather) Marlon Brando’s epic turn as the titular lunatic scientist — it’s the crowning achievement of the decades he spent trying to distance himself from his brilliant earlier work, a series of ineffably inscrutable choices whose most memorable moments include the sight of the most talented actor of his generation lathered in pancake makeup and swaddled in a muumuu. “It’s one thing to offer us bristling, salivating hyenas, boars, and tigers with unsettlingly human faces and musculature,” argued Ken Tucker for Entertainment Weekly. “It’s another thing entirely to offer us a Marlon Brando coated in white powder, as if he’d just been dipped in egg and rolled around in flour.”[tomatometer]MovieID=770783617[/tomatometer]Nicolas Cage, Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New OrleansBest Actor Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas notwithstanding, Nicolas Cage’s career has been a study in cinematic lunacy from the start, to the point that we could single out his relatively sedate performances in The Family Man and The Weather Man as candidates for this list. But there is a point when an actor’s performance circles all the way from “strange” back around to “brilliant,” and that point is Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. A cracked follow-up to Abel Ferrara’s 1992 original, Port of Call stars Cage as a New Orleans police officer whose back injury opens a gateway to drug addiction — as well as a colorful netherworld of movie insanity where Cage rules triumphant as the king of spellbinding, unfettered acting. Calling it “Cage’s best film in years,” Chris Prince of Sky Movies joined the chorus of critical praise for Port of Call, applauding it as “an anarchic gumbo of subverted cop thriller clichés and surreal set-pieces that’s destined to become a cult classic.”[tomatometer]MovieID=10806[/tomatometer]Kevin Costner, WaterworldKevin Costner won early acclaim (and his Academy Awards for 1990’s Dances with Wolves) for playing squinty, salt-of-the-earth types who didn’t say much, but managed to get things done when the chips were down. For the legendarily costly Waterworld, a post-apocalyptic adventure drama about a future in which Earth’s continents have been submerged by melted polar ice caps, he retained many of those character traits — with the notable exception that his unnamed protagonist was also a gill-sporting man-fish who refines and drinks his own urine. Plagued by delays, budget overruns, behind-the-scenes drama, and horrible buzz, and trumpeted as a career-killing flop before it even reached theaters, Waterworld ultimately didn’t fare too badly at the box office, grossing just under $265 million. The critics were a slightly different story, however; while most of them admitted Waterworld wasn’t the epic bomb it was made out to be, even the positive reviews read like half-hearted endorsements — like the one written by Desson Thompson of the Washington Post, who shrugged, “If the story seems a little waterlogged, it’s still big, loud, and fun to watch.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11397[/tomatometer]Matt Damon, Stuck on YouA committed actor with a sharp eye for scripts, Matt Damon has compiled an admirably high batting average over the course of his film career, particularly since collecting his Oscar for Good Will Hunting. In fact, even Damon’s oddest movie — a Farrelly brothers comedy about a pair of conjoined twins whose relationship is complicated when one of them decides to pursue an acting career — earned 60 percent on the Tomatometer. Pretty impressive when you consider that Damon spends the whole movie stuck to Greg Kinnear — but it’s the stars that make its singularly unusual premise work, according to James Verniere of the Boston Herald, who wrote, “None of this would have worked without the camaraderie and genuine affection Damon and Kinnear bring to their roles, amazing considering the uncomfortably close quarters they shared making this film.”[tomatometer]MovieID=11991[/tomatometer]Robert De Niro, The Adventures of Rocky &amp; BullwinkleDe Niro’s movies have made enough money, and earned enough awards (including his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Godfather Part II and his Best Actor trophy for Raging Bull), that he doesn’t need to answer to anyone, and he’s earned the right to take a paycheck gig every now and then — most of which have been standard action thrillers or Fockers sequels. But then there’s 2000’s The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle, the bizarre, De Niro-produced attempt to bring the classic ‘60s cartoon to the screen as a live-action/animated hybrid blending clever meta humor and eyebrow-raising cameos with knuckleheaded slapstick led by Jason Alexander as Boris, Rene Russo as Natasha, and a monocle-sporting De Niro as Fearless Leader. It had all the makings of a spectacular train wreck, but as its surprisingly robust 42 percent Tomatometer demonstrates, Rocky and Bullwinkle had its fans; still, most critics agreed with the Charlotte Observer’s Lawrence Toppman, who accurately predicted, “Kids, who have no interest in these animated characters, will find it slow, arcane and stupid. Adults over 35, who presumably might have loyalty to the old TV show, will find it slow, unfunny and stupid.”[tomatometer]MovieID=17171[/tomatometer]Cuba Gooding Jr., Boat TripGooding’s career since winning Best Supporting Actor for Jerry Maguire has been a case study in weirdness, from stunningly misconceived dramas (Radio) to clunky action (Chill Factor) and a long, long line of direct-to-video titles. Perhaps strangest of all, however, is Gooding’s fondness for cartoonishly broad comedies such as Snow Dogs, Daddy Day Camp, and the amazing-for-all-the-wrong-reasons Boat Trip. Starring Gooding and Horatio Sanz as two friends tricked into going on a (gasp!) gay cruise, Boat Trip leaves no spit take unsprayed, no hoary stereotype forgotten, and no career undamaged; it is, as David Noh observed for Film Journal International, “one of those movies you experience with dropped jaw, wondering what the hell the filmmakers thought they were doing and how desperate could the actors have been to agree to be in it.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12614[/tomatometer]Lee Marvin, Paint Your WagonPeople went to see Lee Marvin movies for pretty much one reason: to watch one of Hollywood’s toughest sons of guns in hard-boiled action. He earned points (and his Best Actor Oscar) for stretching with the 1965 comedy western musical Cat Ballou, but Marvin shouldn’t have pressed his luck with this three-hour, Paddy Chayefsky-adapted musical about polygamist miners — a deeply surreal experience co-starring Clint Eastwood, who, along with Marvin, did his own singing. It’s the sort of thing that needs to be seen to really be believed, although The Simpsons did a fine job of parodying its cheerful lunacy in the classic “All Singing, All Dancing” episode, which is many times more entertaining than the movie Filmcritic’s Christopher Null derided as “About as fun as painting a wagon.”[tomatometer]MovieID=12755[/tomatometer]Meryl Streep, Death Becomes HerMeryl Streep rose to prominence with a series of excellent, award-winning dramas that included Kramer vs. Kramer and Sophie’s Choice (both of which earned her Oscars), making her name synonymous with Kleenex-dampening quality. During the early 1990s, however, she grew restless, taking on a number of projects that fell outside her established image, including She-Devil, The River Wild, and Defending Your Life. Oddest of them all? 1992’s Death Becomes Her, a special effects-laden screwball farce about a pair of women (Streep and Goldie Hawn) whose squabble over a mild-mannered plastic surgeon (Bruce Willis) reaches supernatural levels. Loaded with talent onscreen and off (the supporting cast included Isabella Rossellini, and it was directed by Robert Zemeckis), Death was an almost $150 million hit, despite reviews that ranged from lukewarm to outright hostile (Ken Hanke of the Asheville Mountain Xpress labeled it “Further evidence that Zemeckis is the Anti-Christ”). Because where else are you going to see Meryl Streep gawping around with her head on backwards?[tomatometer]MovieID=9578[/tomatometer]Christopher Walken, The Country BearsBefore The Pirates of the Caribbean proved that it’s possible to spin an entire film franchise out of a Disneyland attraction, 2002’s The Country Bears served as a mangy reminder of why turning to theme park rides for cinematic inspiration is almost always a very bad idea. But to its everlasting credit, Bears wasn’t content to settle for boring badness; alongside the usual punny gags, including a lead character named Beary and a soundtrack including songs like “We’re Only in It for the Honey,” it includes an astounding, Razzie-nominated turn by the man who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Deer Hunter as a villain named Reed Thimple. A costly flop, Bears found supporters in a handful of critics — including David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews, who pronounced that it “just might be worth a rental if only for the sight of watching Christopher Walken belt out a musical number using only his hand and his armpit.”Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

But to really improve his odds of victory, he’ll need something more — like the imposing menace of Ron Perlman, occasional Hellboy and character actor supreme. Whether he’s appeared au naturel or under makeup, worked live action or voiced animated characters, Perlman’s distinctive talent has been entertaining audiences for 30 years, and he’s assembled an eclectic filmography along the way. It’s about time Ron Perlman received the Total Recall treatment, wouldn’t you say?&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;The Last Supper (1996)  63%Witty equal-opportunity political humor has become something of a lost art on the big screen over the last decade or so, but things weren’t always this way. For proof, simply look to 1995’s The Last Supper, an ensemble indie comedy about a group of young liberals (including Cameron Diaz, Ron Eldard, and Annabeth Gish) who begin poisoning conservative dinner guests as part of a misguided campaign to save the world. While the murder victims aren’t terribly sympathetic, their murderers aren’t especially likable either — so by the time they cross paths with a Limbaugh-esque conservative pundit (played by Perlman), loyalties to either ideological extreme have been tested. “In today’s divisive political climate, where compromise is a dirty word,” observed Leslie Rigoulot of Film Scouts, “The Last Supper raises not only timely questions but moral dilemmas as well.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;9.&nbsp;I Sell the Dead (2008)  72%Perlman and his Last Winter director, Larry Fessenden, re-teamed for this 2008 black comedy — only this time, they were both on the same side of the camera. Helmed by Glenn McQuaid (who also worked behind the scenes on The Last Winter), I Sell the Dead recounts the story of a pair of Irish grave robbers (played by Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan), as told to a jailhouse priest (Perlman). A bizarre mashup of 19th-century period thriller and zombie/alien comic gore,Dead had a blink-and-you-missed-it theatrical run, playing on only two screens, but even some of the critics who couldn’t recommend it found the film impossible to dislike — such as Ty Burr of the Boston Globe, who mused, “If it’s not actually a good movie, on some level you have to admire the chutzpah of a film set in 1850s Ireland but shot on Staten Island.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;8.&nbsp;The Last Winter (2007)  76%A sort of cross between An Inconvenient Truth and The Thing, this wintry thriller found writer/director Larry Fessenden returning to the themes of isolation he explored in Wendigo, while adding an ecologically conscious twist: at a remote ANWR drilling base, a team of workers (led by Perlman) starts dying off, casualties of “sour gas” released as a side effect of global warming — or are they under attack from vengeful spirits of the Earth? Though it screened in extremely limited release, The Last Winter received more than a few positive reviews from critics, including Aaron Hillis of Premiere Magazine, who called it “A richly drawn, ambitious character piece both socially relevant and genuinely suspenseful” before concluding, “This is filmmaking both gorgeous and deeply unsettling.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Hellboy (2004)  81%No stranger to prosthetics, Perlman went back under the makeup — and reunited with his Cronos and Blade II director, Guillermo del Toro — for 2004’s Hellboy, an adaptation of the popular Dark Horse Comics title. Grossing under $60 million in the U.S., it was something of a disappointment at the box office, but Perlman and Del Toro were a natural fit for the franchise, as Hellboy‘s steadily growing cult audience would come to realize — and as appreciative critics were quick to recognize, including Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic, who noted, “Perlman, at age 53, strides in like a hungry young actor itching to prove something, only with 22 years of experience lending him charisma and confidence.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;6.&nbsp;The City of Lost Children (La Cité des Enfants Perdus) (1995)  79%Perlman’s work with Guillermo del Toro has placed him within some pretty remarkable cinematic worlds, but his sojourn into Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro’s City of Lost Children might be the most visually striking of them all: a dense, whirring dystopia where an evil scientist (Daniel Emilfork) steals the dreams of kidnapped children. Their only hope is One (Perlman), a circus strongman whose younger brother is among the lost — and for whom he’ll set out on an arduous journey to rescue. Rife with sights that will haunt the viewer long after the credits roll, City won praise from critics like Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle, who recommended it as “a dark phantasmagoria so visually amazing and provocative — yet dense and confusing — that viewers may need to see it more than once to take it all in.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Happy, Texas (1999)  81%A goofy Steve Zahn comedy with a minuscule budget and a box office tally that wasn’t much bigger, Happy, Texas gave Perlman the opportunity to steal scenes in another supporting role: Marshal Nalhober, a straight-shooting cop in hot pursuit of three escaped prisoners (Zahn, Jeremy Northam, and M.C. Gainey) posing as the organizers of a local beauty pageant. Eminently quotable and buoyed by a smart, rootsy soundtrack, Happy provoked appreciative guffaws from critics like Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, who called it “a hoot, a hilarious comedy that’s smart and caring, yet sexy and ingenious enough that it just might stir up some of that elusive Full Monty-style box-office appeal.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Quest for Fire (1981)  86%A latex-covered Perlman got his big break in this award-winning adaptation of the 1911 novel, about a Neanderthal war for fire — and the dangerous quest undertaken by a small band of tribesmen who are forced to find another source after their clan’s fire is stolen by a rival tribe. An hour and 40 minutes of grunted dialogue and dirty caveman sex obviously isn’t what most filmgoers have in mind when they head out for a night at the cineplex, but Quest for Fire managed to perform relatively well at the box office, and became something of an early ’80s cult favorite — as well as a hit with critics like Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who said it was “more than just a hugely enterprising science lesson, although it certainly is that. It’s also a touching, funny and suspenseful drama about prehumans.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Hellboy 2) (2008)  86%Four years after the first Hellboy, Perlman teamed up again with Guillermo del Toro for another round of supernatural fun — and while the original Hellboy earned mostly positive reviews, the sequel was an even bigger critical winner. A gleeful blend of popcorn thrills and uniquely del Toro visual splendor, Hellboy II: The Golden Army reunited the original cast for an epic battle between the forces of good and an irate elven king (Luke Goss) who wants to reignite the long-dormant war between elves and humans. While it was overshadowed at the box office by The Dark Knight and Iron Man, it still earned over $160 million — and earned the admiration of critics like Colin Covert of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, who called it “the biggest, richest, most imaginative superhero movie of the summer.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Cronos (1994)  91%Perlman started his continuing association with Guillermo del Toro in this 1993 horror movie, about the gruesome series of events that unfolds after an old man (Federico Luppi) discovers an ancient scarab that injects him with a mysterious substance — one which restores his youthful vitality, but leaves him with a thirst for blood. Perlman stars in a supporting role as the ironically named Angel de la Guardia, a hoodlum sent on a quest by his elderly uncle, who craves the scarab’s restorative powers; the path of violence he carves in pursuit of his goal sets in motion some of Cronos‘ most memorably horrific sequences. It barely registered a blip on the U.S. box office, but Cronos was an instant hit with critics; as an appreciative Ken Hanke wrote for the Asheville Mountain Xpress, it is “one of the most intelligent — and strangely moving — horror films ever made.”Watch Trailer&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Tangled (2010)  89%We always see a little bit of an outcry when animated efforts make the cut in Total Recall — and there’s even more consternation when a ‘toon tops the list. But for a guy like Ron Perlman, who’s spent so much of his career under heavy makeup, it makes a certain kind of sense that Disney’s Tangled would be a top-rated effort; while it’s true that he could only use his voice to bring the malicious twin Stabbington Brothers to life in this film, those constraints really weren’t so very different from some of his previous live-action roles — or, for that matter, Perlman’s long list of voice credits. In the end, it’s hard to argue with Tangled‘s overwhelmingly positive reviews, summed up concisely by Tom Long of the Detroit News, who wrote, “Tangled is the best animated film from Disney in the past 15 years.”Watch TrailerFinally, here’s Perlman (in character) pitching DirecTV:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Guide, Marvel, TV, movies, Ovation, serial, Quiz, Summer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Hellboy-600.jpg","slug":"total-recall-ron-perlmans-best-movies"},{"id":"47508989011552","title":"Total Recall: Leonardo DiCaprio’s Best Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Leonardo DiCaprio's Best MoviesWe count down the best-reviewed work of the Shutter Island star.by Jeff Giles | February 17, 2010 |  CommentsBusting out of the cheapie horror sequel and/or TV sitcom ghetto can be done — just ask George Clooney, who has a Killer Tomatoes sequel and a pile of Facts of Life episodes on his resume — but it isn’t easy; when Leonardo DiCaprio surfaced in Critters 3 and the rapidly aging Growing Pains in 1991, it seemed safe to assume he was destined for a brief, direct-to-video career. Nineteen years, multiple Academy Award nominations, and over a billion dollars in box office grosses later, he’s one of the biggest names in the business. In honor of his achievements — and his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island, arriving in theaters this week — we decided now would be the perfect time to take a look back at Mr. DiCaprio’s best-reviewed films.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190978[/tomatometer]10. Revolutionary RoadAlmost from the moment it was published in 1961, Richard Yates’ novel Revolutionary Road attracted Hollywood; a succession of filmmakers, from John Frankenheimer to Samuel Goldwyn Jr. to actor Patrick O’Neal, tried to bring it to the screen, only to find their hopes dashed against the book’s grim, unsettling themes. It took the combined mojo of Titanic co-stars DiCaprio and Kate Winslet — not to mention director Sam Mendes — to get things moving, and it’s a testament to Yates’ book that even though Revolutionary Road didn’t reach theaters until late 2008, its themes still transcended its 1950s suburban setting. Of course, by the 21st century, indictments of suburban conformity weren’t exactly rare, and although Road was promoted as Winslet and DiCaprio’s long-awaited reunion, it wasn’t exactly the sweeping romance Titanic fans were may have been looking for. Dismissed by some critics as didactic Oscar bait, Road still impressed most scribes; in the words of Oscar Guy’s Wesley Lovell, “Suburban malaise has seldom been better looking or better acted.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1073352[/tomatometer]9. William Shakespeare’s Romeo &amp; JulietTaking Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers and turning their classic tale into a loud, brightly colored gang battle featuring guns and iambic pentameter is the kind of move that takes chutzpah. Enter Baz Luhrmann, the spectacle-hungry director and co-adapter of William Shakespeare’s Romeo + Juliet — the movie that turned a pair of 16th-century teens into MTV-friendly heartthrobs. $147 million later, DiCaprio was a matinee idol with a solid stack of critical winners under his belt, and this unlikely hit was one of them. Referring to DiCaprio and Clare Danes, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, “Luhrmann and his two bright angels have shaken up a 400-year-old play without losing its touching, poetic innocence.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1110067[/tomatometer]8. Gangs of New YorkFor a few years after Titanic, DiCaprio seemed slightly adrift. In 1998, he starred in the disappointing The Man in the Iron Mask and made a supporting appearance in Woody Allen’s Celebrity; after that, he didn’t resurface until 2000’s widely panned The Beach. From the outside, it wasn’t hard to imagine that DiCaprio simply didn’t know what to do with his career — but as it turned out, he was simply waiting for the right projects. Gangs of New York, the massive historical epic that kicked off DiCaprio’s enduring relationship with Martin Scorsese, was actually supposed to come out in 2001, but studio nervousness over how the film might be received in the wake of the September 11 attacks kept it on the shelf until late 2002. It was ultimately regarded as something of a disappointment, but mainly because of the heightened expectations attached — Gangs told a huge story that Scorsese had been trying to film for decades, and the cast included major names like Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam Neeson, and Cameron Diaz. Though certainly flawed, Gangs gave audiences a glimpse at an often forgotten period in New York City’s history, scored ten Academy Award nominations, and impressed many critics with what Rob Nelson of the Minneapolis/St. Paul City Pages called “Scorsese’s impassioned, elegiac portrait of a time when blows were delivered with fists, bats, and blades rather than airplanes, anthrax, or keyboard strokes; it’s his look back at a lost world, his urban western.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1042690[/tomatometer]7. This Boy’s LifeJust two years after making his film debut in Critters 3 — and joining the cast of ABC’s Growing Pains — DiCaprio scored the plum role of Toby Wolff in This Boy’s Life. An adaptation of Tobias Wolff’s harrowing memoir, Life gave DiCaprio his first chance to really flex his dramatic muscle on screen — and do it in the company of Robert De Niro and Ellen Barkin, to boot. It wasn’t a big hit, grossing only a little over $4 million during its limited theatrical run, but it proved DiCaprio’s talent was too formidable to keep locked in the sitcom ghetto. Blake Davis of KFOR Channel 4 News was just one of the many critics who applauded the film, writing, “Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first major role, stole this movie right out from under Robert DeNiro’s feet. A great coming-of-age tale based on a very good book.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1074319[/tomatometer]6. Marvin’s RoomOnly 22 when Marvin’s Room was released, DiCaprio had already shared the screen with an impressive collection of silver screen pros that included Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, and Johnny Depp. He added to the list — and reunited with De Niro — for this drama about a pair of sisters (Meryl Streep and Diane Keaton) whose bad blood is stirred anew when Keaton’s character, who has been caring for their bed-ridden father (Hume Cronyn), learns she has leukemia. Of course, Streep’s character has problems of her own — including her institutionalized firebug of a son (DiCaprio). Boasting the kind of dysfunctional family dynamics that would shortly become synonymous with the indie films of the decade, this adaptation of the Scott McPherson play rises above the pack partly because of its impeccable cast; as Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, “Any movie with Meryl Streep is an occasion, but when you add Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hume Cronyn and Gwen Verdon, you’ve got an embarrassment of riches.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1082487[/tomatometer]5. TitanicOverpowering success has a way of turning the things we once loved into parodies of themselves, and Titanic is no different: Despite more than $1.8 billion in worldwide grosses, 11 Academy Awards, and an astounding 10-month theatrical run, you wouldn’t have to go much further than the cubicle next to you to find someone who says Titanic is a goopy mess and they never liked it. But don’t believe the backlash — James Cameron’s watery epic, which smartly combined historical drama with the doomed love story of Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), was a cultural phenomenon for the simplest of reasons: People loved it. And they loved its stars, too; both Winslet and DiCaprio found themselves suddenly flush with the kind of fame that can (ahem) capsize a career if a star isn’t careful. Things turned out fine for both of them, obviously — but before Leo-Mania and “My Heart Will Go On,” they were just a couple of perfectly cast young lovebirds in the three-hour mashup of cutting-edge spectacle and good old-fashioned romance that the Boston Globe’s Jay Carr called “the best disaster movie money can buy.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1048717[/tomatometer]4. What’s Eating Gilbert GrapeThe same year he broke out with This Boy’s Life, DiCaprio scored a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as a mentally handicapped small-town youth in Lasse Hallsrom’s What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. Roles like Arnie Grape are tricky — in all but the most capable hands, it’s easy for them to descend into unintentional parody — but DiCaprio displayed surprising depth and sensitivity, lending added weight to what might have been just another 1990s drama about eccentric characters. Calling it “expertly handled, well-written material,” James Kendrick of the Q Network Film Desk applauded a film “that knows and understands its many different characters. There are moments in this film that cover the entire emotional spectrum, and not a second is wasted on insincere emotion, making it a real winner.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1139306[/tomatometer]3. The AviatorIt’s an oft-told joke that if an actor desires awards and critical acclaim, all he has to do is star in a movie about a person with some sort of mental illness; an overstatement, surely, but one with a grain of truth, as proven by actors from Cliff Robertson to Russell Crowe — and, on more than one occasion, Leonardo DiCaprio. Reuniting with Gangs of New York director Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio starred in The Aviator as the legendarily reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, recounting his journey from young CEO and film director to the starlet-hungry captain of industry who slowly vanished into seclusion and madness. The Aviator‘s $212 million gross, five Academy Awards against 11 nominations, and 88 percent Tomatometer may not have been enough for the insatiable Hughes, but the movie pleased critics like Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, who called it “Sumptuously exciting, glowing with expertise, seething with life, gorgeously designed and thrillingly articulated.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1159016[/tomatometer]2. The DepartedLine up a collection of talent as impressive as Martin Scorsese, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Ray Winstone, and Vera Farmiga, and you can do pretty much whatever you want — even if it’s remaking a movie as successful as the 2002 Hong Kong blockbuster Infernal Affairs. Transplanting the action to Boston, The Departed retained the original film’s twisty premise: An undercover cop (DiCaprio) struggles to infiltrate a gang, while one of its members (Damon) works his way up the police ranks. Flooded with tension and loaded up with bullets, bodies, and double crosses, The Departed is vintage Scorsese, and finally earned him a Best Director Oscar after six nominations (because, he joked, “this is the first movie I’ve done with a plot”). Whether it meets or exceeds Infernal Affairs remains up for debate, but clearly, most critics enjoyed the movie; as the Houston Chronicle’s Amy Biancolli wrote, “For all its bloodletting, The Departed is an intoxicating film. It’s a film that’ll have your hands over your face with one eye peeking: The violence sickens, but the movie seduces.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1046892[/tomatometer]1. Catch Me If You CanHe was an Academy Award nominee before he turned 20, so Leonardo DiCaprio knows a thing or two about making things happen when you’re young. He was, in other words, uniquely suited to play real-life legendary con man Frank Abagnale, who led the FBI on a wild goose chase during the ’60s while posing as everything from an airline pilot to a doctor, and stealing millions of dollars along the way. Though it was criticized for its 141-minute length, Catch Me if You Can had a lot going for it right off the bat, including a fascinating, stranger-than-fiction storyline, directorial work from Steven Spielberg at his breeziest, and DiCaprio pitting his naturally rakish charm against Tom Hanks’ driven yet empathetic FBI agent. Yeah, it’s just a caper movie — and a curiously slight one, given its length — but it’s also, in the words of the Denver Rocky Mountain News’ Robert Denerstein, “Precisely what a mainstream movie should be: fleet, savvy and, like a good con, executed as if it were the easiest thing in the world.”In case you were wondering, here are DiCaprio’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Departed — 95%2. Catch Me If You Can — 94%3. What’s Eating Gilbert Grape — 92%4. Blood Diamond — 91%5. This Boy’s Life — 90%6. The Aviator — 89%7. Gangs of New York — 86%8. Titanic — 82%9.

Today? He’s getting ready to step into a high-tech suit of armor and do summer blockbuster battle as James “Rhodey” Rhodes in Iron Man 2. Along the way, Cheadle has filmed a number of critically acclaimed roles, produced successful films, campaigned for human rights, and even co-authored a book, all while moving between comedy, drama, and action. This week, we celebrate all this success by spinning the dials on the Tomatometer and looking back at Don Cheadle’s ten best-reviewed films. It’s time for Total Recall!\n\n\n\n\n10. Talk to Me (2007)  83%\nThough he’s often appeared as part of ensemble casts, Cheadle has occasionally had the opportunity to take the spotlight for himself — as with 2007’s Talk to Me, which dramatized the life of radio host and Emmy-winning television personality Petey Greene. Though his fame was mostly restricted to the Washington, D.C. area, Greene was an influential figure for many years, using his gift of gab and inspirational journey from prison to the airwaves as the building blocks for a career that earned him acclaim, a visit to the White House (where he famously joked he stole a spoon), and the admiration of followers such as Howard Stern. It wasn’t a huge hit, and members of Greene’s family criticized its historical inaccuracies, but as far as most critics were concerned, Talk to Me was well worth watching. As Neil Smith wrote for Total Film, “If the picture doesn’t ultimately live up to the raw vitality of Cheadle’s performance, it remains an uplifting snapshot that broadcasts its message with zero distortion. Tune in and you won’t be turned off.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9. Ocean's Eleven (2001)  83%\nCheadle teamed up with director Steven Soderbergh for the third time with 2001’s Ocean’s Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack heist classic that united some of Hollywood’s biggest actors for no purpose greater than the simple thrill of watching impossibly good-looking people steal from other good-looking people in an unbelievably glamorous setting. It sounds shallow, and it is — but it’s also a heck of a lot of fun, as evidenced by the $450 million it grossed amidst generally bemused reviews from critics who couldn’t help but appreciate a well-made, tuxedo-clad caper flick. For Eleven — as well as its two sequels — the Kansas City-born Cheadle got to strap on a Cockney accent for the role of explosives expert Basher Tarr, a part that made up in funny lines (and earth-shaking stunts) what it lacked in screen time. Summing up its appeal in his review for Bullz-Eye, David Medsker wrote, “We’re not talking about reinventing the genre here. This is just a Big Mac and fries of a movie, and those movies, like the food, can hit the spot sometimes, especially when you’re hung over.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Colors (1988)  80%\nIt wasn’t his first role in a major film, but Cheadle’s appearance in 1988’s Colors — as Rocket, the ill-fated Crips leader who crosses paths with LAPD Detectives Bob Hodges (Robert Duvall) and Danny McGavin (Sean Penn) — was definitely an early breakthrough. (That gig he scored on Richard Grieco’s Booker in 1989? Totally wouldn’t have gotten it without Colors.) Its tale of warring gangs in 1980s Los Angeles might seem a little tired now, but in its day, this Dennis Hopper-directed drama was actually sort of groundbreaking — and it boasted a terrific soundtrack, too, including the hit title track, performed by Ice-T. (Yes, kids, before his Law &amp; Order days, he was a rapper.) The film earned widespread praise from critics such as Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Colors is a special movie — not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Rosewood (1997)  87%\nDirector John Singleton snapped a critical dry spell with 1997’s Rosewood, a harrowing dramatization of 1923’s shameful Rosewood massacre, during which the residents of a primarily black Florida town were attacked by whites from a neighboring city, setting off days of horrific racial violence that culminated in Rosewood’s total abandonment. It’s the kind of episode any country would rather forget — and forget it most Americans did, for decades. Rosewood capped a 15-year period when the tragedy was rediscovered, first by journalists, then finally by the politicians who authorized reparations for its survivors. As Sylvester Carrier, a piano teacher who watches helplessly as the violence engulfs his home, Cheadle brings a nuanced performance full of palpable sorrow and defiance to a film that occasionally strays into — pardon the phrase — black and white. Unfortunately, most filmgoers weren’t interested in reliving this dark chapter in our history, and Rosewood left theaters a commercial failure — though not for want of positive reviews from critics like Jose Martinez of Boxoffice Magazine, who wrote, “Comparisons to today’s society can’t help but be made while watching Rosewood; although moviegoers might wish to leave the theatre thinking we are living in a better time, they might not be able to.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Devil in a Blue Dress (1995)  88%\nIn a career dotted with scene-stealing turns, Cheadle’s performance as the violent Mouse Alexander in Devil in a Blue Dress borders on the larcenous — which is saying quite a bit, given how comfortably the film’s star, Denzel Washington, fit into his starring role as detective Easy Rawlins. Matter of fact, director Carl Franklin’s adaptation of the Walter Mosley novel was strong all around, as attested by its healthy 90 percent Tomatometer rating; this slice of immaculately fedora-ed neo-noir may not have caught on with filmgoers, but for critics like the Washington Post’s Hal Hinson, it was nothing short of “First-rate American pulp — fast, absorbing and substantive.” Amidst all the critical praise for Devil in a Blue Dress, Cheadle earned an impressive number of nods all his own, including Best Supporting Actor awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the National Society of Film Critics. As Todd McCarthy wrote in his review for Variety, “Entering the main flow of the story relatively late, Don Cheadle steals all his scenes as a live-wire, trigger-happy old buddy of Easy’s from Texas.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Traffic (2000)  92%\nCheadle reunited with his Out of Sight director, Steven Soderbergh, for this sprawling two hour-plus drama about the drug trade, adapted from the BBC series Traffik. Part of a huge ensemble cast that included Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Benicio del Toro, Cheadle played a DEA agent who locks horns with a San Diego drug dealer (Steven Bauer) and his boss (Benjamin Bratt). Cheadle’s segment, one of three interweaving stories, underscored the sadness and loss at the heart of the War on Drugs with solid acting and some sharp visual style from Soderbergh. Traffic was rewarded with a healthy $207 million worldwide gross and four Academy Awards — including Best Director for Soderbergh and Best Supporting Actor for Del Toro — along with a wave of positive reviews from critics like Netflix’s James Rocchi, who declared, “Simply put: This is the best American film since The Godfather.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Hotel Rwanda (2004)  91%\nAn outspoken humanitarian, Cheadle took the opportunity to bring his convictions to the big screen with director Terry George’s Hotel Rwanda, which told the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotelier who used his position to save the lives of over 1,200 refugees during 1994’s Rwandan genocide. It’s an incredible tale, full of gripping drama — and for American filmgoers who tuned out during news coverage of the slayings, it was a horrifying glimpse of persecution in a much more unstable corner of the globe. During its limited run, Hotel Rwanda earned some of the year’s best reviews, as well as Oscar nominations for Cheadle, his co-star Sophie Okonedo, and screenwriters Terry George and Keir Pearson; more importantly, it helped raise money for the International Fund for Rwanda. “Despite the shocking realities,” wrote Charlotte Weekly’s Sean O’Connell, “you’ll leave Rwanda discussing one positive above all the negatives, and that’s Cheadle’s tremendous performance.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Boogie Nights (1997)  93%\nHow do you take a movie about a porn star with a famous appendage and turn it into Oscar bait? You write a knockout script, of course — and then you cast your film with a crowd of stellar character actors, including Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and, of course, Don Cheadle. As the part-time porn actor and hi-fi enthusiast Buck Swope, Cheadle helped leaven some of Boogie Nights‘ darker moments, and his character’s ultimate fate in the final act gave audiences a crucial reminder that sometimes, all that stands between you and your dreams is a well-timed purchase at the neighborhood donut store. Though far from Cheadle’s biggest role, it was certainly a part of the reason that critics like Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly declared that “Boogie Nights, an epic tale of porn, pleasure, and excess, offers a purer hit of exhilaration than any movie this year.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Out of Sight (1998)  93%\nWhat you most likely remember about Out of Sight is the steamy interplay that develops between escaped convict Jack Foley (George Clooney) and U.S. Marshal Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) as Foley tries to swindle a stash of diamonds out of a former associate. But it isn’t just trying to keep ahead of Sisco that keeps Foley moving — he’s also racing against the menacing Maurice “Snoopy” Miller (Cheadle), an ex-con whose cartoonish nickname belies his propensity for decidedly unfunny violence. In a movie peppered with bad guys you love to root for, Cheadle is the one you actually have to root against — but he’s so much fun, you almost wish things were different. As part of a supporting ensemble that included Ving Rhames, Steve Zahn, and Albert Brooks, Cheadle was an important part of the reason Roger Ebert called Out of Sight “Steven Soderbergh’s best film since Sex, Lies and Videotape a decade ago.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Hamburger Hill (1987)  100%\nFresh out of college, Don Cheadle headed for Hollywood to take his shot at the big time, with $500 from his parents to help him get his start. It’s a common story, and one that’s usually followed by a whole lot of struggle and disillusionment. For Cheadle, however, the next step was John Irvin’s Hamburger Hill, a 1987 Vietnam War drama that gave audiences an unblinking, soldier’s-eye view of the conflict. Part of a cast of young future stars that included Steven Weber, Dylan McDermott, Courtney B. Vance, and Michael Boatman, Cheadle took the role of Private Johnny Washburn, a new recruit who comes in after his regiment’s point man is killed in action. Though Cheadle’s part isn’t as large as you might expect if you purchase one of the later editions of the film — the 20th anniversary edition DVD actually puts his name above the title — it’s a terrific early example of his talent in action, and an inspiration to young actors dreaming of that one big break. Plus, it’s a pretty terrific war movie: As Noel Murray wrote in his review for the AV Club, “Hamburger Hill stands out from the pack as one of the best of the Vietnam movies.”\n\n\n\n\nIn case you were wondering, here are Cheadle’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:\n1. Hotel Rwanda — 95%\n2. Ocean’s Eleven — 94%\n3. Boogie Nights — 94%\n4. Traffic — 91%\n5. Rosewood — 88%\n6. Reign Over Me — 86%\n7. Colors — 86%\n8. Crash — 85%\n9. Talk to Me — 83%\n10.

Through deaths, ratings scares, and constant creative turnover, SNL has persevered — and along the way, it’s taken some of its most popular characters and turned them into feature films. Of course, just like the show’s ratings, its big-screen success has been through some ups and downs — and with SNL premiering its impressive 40th season this weekend, we thought now would be the perfect time to take a look back at every movie that got its start as a sketch. Live from Rotten Tomatoes… it’s Total Recall!\n\n\n\n 0%\n\n\n12. It’s Pat… The Movie\nJulia Sweeney was in countless skits during her SNL run, and got plenty of laughs along the way, but the character she was most closely identified with was the androgynous Pat, whose indeterminate sex was the focus of a long-running series of sketches that attracted such guest stars as Linda Hamilton and Harvey Keitel. Still, not even Sweeney thought a full-length movie was a good idea; it took studio sweet-talking (and cash) to get the project rolling. Of course, once the original studio bailed on It’s Pat, everyone involved should have known they were headed for disaster — and when Touchstone finally stepped in to release the movie and gave it a three-city release, the critical knives were out. At zero percent on the Tomatometer, It’s Pat is not only the worst SNL movie, it’s one of the worst movies of all time — “Patently atrocious in every conceivable way,” in the words of eFilmcritic’s Scott Weinberg. About the only positive thing that can be said for It’s Pat (aside from “it’s only 77 minutes long”) is that it featured a Ween cameo and the underrated Charles Rocket in a supporting role as Kyle Jacobsen, the neighbor obsessed with deducing Pat’s sexual identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11%\n\n\n11. A Night at the Roxbury\nBefore Will Ferrell could make a name for himself as one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood, he had to suffer through A Night at the Roxbury, the feature-length version of the SNL sketch about a pair of obnoxious club patrons who can’t help bobbing their heads in unison whenever they hear Haddaway’s “What Is Love?” It’s a thin premise, even held alongside some of the other entries on this list, and even during their best moments, the Roxbury characters were more absurd than truly funny — but when Hollywood comes calling, you have to open the door, even if the project in question includes the fateful five words “starring Richard Grieco as himself.” Written by Ferrell and co-star Chris Kattan, A Night at the Roxbury invented a suitably outlandish backstory for the head-bobbing Butabi brothers, making them the sons of a fake plant store owner (Dan Hedaya) who wants Ferrell’s character to marry the daughter (Molly Shannon) of the lamp store owner next door so he can…well, it really doesn’t matter much. Suffice it to say “What Is Love?” is involved, Richard Grieco is suitably convincing as himself, and the critics wanted nothing to do with any of it. In the words of Cinemaphile’s David Keyes, “those who manage to sit through all 81 minutes of it deserve a medal of bravery.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 11%\n\n\n10. The Ladies Man\nIn 2000, the same year Tim Meadows concluded his long run on SNL, his most famous character finally got his cinematic due: The Ladies Man, an 84-minute look at the exploits of Leon Phelps, the Afro-wielding, cognac-sipping talk radio host and sex therapy expert. As SNL characters go, Phelps might have had a fair amount of cinematic potential, but The Ladies Man arrived three years after the sketch’s debut, after its star had already left the cast, and burdened by a script (co-written by Meadows) that produced little in the way of laughs. Still, its 11 percent Tomatometer is ever so slightly deceiving; even a number of the critics who panned the movie found it relatively harmless, and by blending ribald humor with a wonderfully wacky cast that included Billy Dee Williams and Julianne Moore, it earned the begrudging admiration of writers like Mike Miliard of the Boston Phoenix, who wrote, “The Ladies Man is pointless and should never have been made. But check your brain at the door and it almost stacks up to a snifter of Courvoisier and a handful of butt.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 30%\n\n\n9. Stuart Saves His Family\nOne of the most popular SNL characters of the early 1990s, the blissfully ignorant self-help guru and cable access host Stuart Smalley was a rite of passage for many of the show’s guests — including Michael Jordan, who was famously unable to keep a straight face during his segment. Audiences, alas, found resisting laughter far easier — the few who saw it, that is. Released in 1995, Stuart Saves His Family was an unmitigated disaster for everyone involved — Paramount Pictures, which grossed a mere $911,000 during its brief theatrical run; director Harold Ramis, whose previous releases included Caddyshack, Ghostbusters, and Groundhog Day; and star Al Franken, who bore the brunt of the film’s failure and was more or less forced to retire the character from the show. It’s hard to feel too badly, though, for the group that took a perfectly silly skit and puffed it up into an uneasily sentimental feature about such unfunny topics as property law, estate settlements, and 12-step programs. If there had ever been a way to bring Stuart Smalley to the movies, this feature wasn’t it. As Joe Leyden wrote for Variety, “It isn’t good enough, it isn’t smart enough, and, doggone it, most people won’t like Stuart Saves His Family.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 32%\n\n\n8. Superstar\nArguably the unsexiest schoolgirl in pop culture history, Mary Katherine Gallagher gave Molly Shannon’s hyperventilating, armpit-sniffing dark side hilarious free rein during a series of skits that found her clashing with nuns, schoolmates, and, in one notable episode, Whitney Houston. Still, despite her popularity, Mary Katherine was sort of a one-note character, which meant that for her 1999 theatrical debut, she needed a fairly outlandish backstory (courtesy of screenwriter Steve Koren, who also had a hand in A Night at the Roxbury). Turns out Mary’s a special ed student, as well as an orphan whose parents were trampled to death at a Riverdance-style competition, and…well, at one point, Will Ferrell shows up as an exasperated Jesus Christ (one of two roles Ferrell played, along with the dance-inventing Sky Corrigan). Does it sound like a bit of a mess? Critics thought so — and although many of them appreciated Shannon’s immense likability and total commitment to the role, most echoed the sentiments of Roger Ebert, who wrote, “Here is a portrait of a character so sad and hapless, so hard to like, so impossible to empathize with, that watching it feels like an act of unkindness.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 35%\n\n\n7. Coneheads\nMore than 25 years after they first appeared on SNL, Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin’s pointy-domed clan of Remulakians finally made their way to the big screen. On paper, Coneheads sort of looked like a slam dunk — the characters were fondly remembered from their original run on the show, and this was the era when not only Wayne’s World was proving SNL sketches could make good movies, but old shows like The Brady Bunch and The Addams Family were pulling in big bucks in theaters. Unfortunately, despite all that — and a cast stuffed with series vets like Adam Sandler, Phil Hartman, and David Spade — Coneheads failed to catch on with audiences or critics, with both groups pointing out that the characters just weren’t strong enough to support a movie of their own. Wrote Chris Hicks of the Deseret News, “The film itself is like the cinematic equivalent of a clothesline, with a steady stream of skits and gags hung out to dry.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 46%\n\n\n6. Blues Brothers 2000\nIn 1980, The Blues Brothers helped shine the spotlight on some marvelously talented (and sadly out of fashion) blues, soul, and R&amp;B musicians, all while treating audiences to a terrific wisecracking action movie. Eighteen years later, Blues Brothers 2000 was released, and…well, the music was still pretty solid, anyway. This might seem like damning with faint praise, but really, when you consider that nearly two decades had passed since the original — and that one-half of the Blues Brothers, John Belushi, died in 1982 — getting even the music right seems like a pretty big deal. Remaining original Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd earns points for trying — he reunited original director John Landis, many of the musicians who appeared in the first picture, added a few fresh faces on the blues scene, and recruited John Goodman to try and fill the void left by Belushi — but ultimately, no matter how many songs they fit on the soundtrack or how many cars piled up in the climactic chase scene (it was 60, setting a new world’s record), Blues Brothers 2000 couldn’t come close to its classic predecessor. Still, Jeff Vice of the Deseret News was one of a number of critics who appreciated the effort, writing, “While the comedic scenes are hopelessly inept, Landis again shows a deft hand with the staging of the musical numbers, which should provide fans with a good enough reason to see the movie.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 48%\n\n\n5. MacGruber\nSNL movies have been spun out of some awfully thin premises before, but perhaps none that seemed as ludicrously non-cinematic as MacGruber. Inspired by a belligerently over-the-top recurring parody of the long-running ABC series MacGyver, in which Richard Dean Anderson starred as the titular handyman/hero who could save the day armed with little more than household goods, the movie attempted to bring the film-length funny with Will Forte as MacGruber, a hollering moron whose SNL appearances always ended in disaster. The MacGruber movie wasn’t a total dud; although it failed to find much of an audience at the box office, it featured enough gonzo comedy (including a supporting turn from Val Kilmer as the evil Dieter Von Cunth) to earn something of a cult following among absurd humor enthusiasts. Betsy Sherman of the Boston Phoenix numbered herself among them, writing, “From one of Saturday Night Live‘s lamest recurring sketches comes one of its funniest spinoffs.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 60%\n\n\n4. Wayne’s World 2\nA year after Wayne’s World grossed almost $200 million worldwide, Mike Myers and Dana Carvey returned for more party time at the box office — and while the results weren’t quite as excellent, Wayne’s World 2 still proved a respectable follow-up, especially given that it added another 95 minutes to the legacy of two characters who originally seemed like they’d have a hard time filling up a half-hour sitcom. This time around, Wayne and Garth seek to build on their budding media empire with a concert festival (naturally dubbed “Waynestock”) inspired by instructions handed down from the ghost of Jim Morrison in an Aerosmith-fueled dream. It’s even sillier than the first movie, in other words, with a goofball factor enhanced by the sort of expanded budget that allows for cameo appearances from the likes of Aerosmith, Charlton Heston, and Rip Taylor. Although audience indifference dashed any hopes of a Wayne’s World 3, the sequel was surprisingly well received by critics like the New York Times’ Janet Maslin, who wrote, “This film is sometimes too familiar, especially in early scenes that deliberately repeat the first film’s gags. But the formula isn’t tired yet.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 78%\n\n\n3. Wayne’s World\nIf you’re going to make a movie about the type of suburban youth that spent a lot of time hanging out at rock shows in the late 1980s and early 1990s, you could hardly pick a better director than Penelope Spheeris, the filmmaker who gave us the Decline of Western Civilization series — and for Saturday Night Live, the cable access mullet enthusiasts known as Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) and Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) were the perfect characters to end the show’s long cinematic drought. Probably the most popular complaint leveled against SNL movies is that you can’t stretch a five-minute sketch out to film length, and really, there’s no reason anyone should have been able to build a decent script around a pair of catchphrase-spouting doofuses who hang out in a basement, rocking out and talking about babes. Wayne’s World solved this problem by embracing the absurdity of its very existence, sending the movie way over the top and into a land where anything could happen: the fourth wall could be broken, Tia Carrere could star in a hit film, and Queen could score a Top Five hit with a 20-year-old song. There’s a plot buried under Wayne’s World‘s trucker cap, but it isn’t really important; the only thing the movie is really concerned with is making you laugh — early, often, and usually in spite of yourself. As Time Magazine’s Richard Corliss put it in his review, “Hollywood surely accepts the movie’s message: laughter is the least expensive therapy. And audiences may happily parrot another Wayneism to Myers: ‘He shoots! He scores!'”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 73%\n\n\n2. The Blues Brothers\nThey may have gotten their start performing in killer bee outfits, but the Blues Brothers were never entirely a joke — Dan “Elwood Blues” Aykroyd was a lifelong disciple of the music, and John “Jake Blues” Belushi developed a fascination with it through his friendship with Aykroyd. Though they were often derided as dilettantes in a genre whose lifeblood is authenticity, Aykroyd and Belushi actually played an important part in restoring some of the blues’ commercial potency; when they made their 1976 debut on SNL, disco was king, and their band (which released its first album, Briefcase Full of Blues, in 1978) employed some great blues and soul musicians when they really needed the work. This respect for the music extended to the Blues Brothers’ 1980 feature, which placed legends such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, Cab Calloway, and Ray Charles in the middle of the action — and made sure audiences were introduced to relatively unsung heroes like Steve Cropper and Donald “Duck” Dunn in the bargain. The script might have meant that whole “mission from God” thing as a joke, in other words, but for some music fans, they weren’t far from the truth — and like the music the titular duo took their name from, The Blues Brothers has aged gracefully. A cable and home video favorite, it also enjoys praise from critics including the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw, who wrote, “The mere spectacle of Elwood and Jake in their shades isn’t quite as giggle-inducing as it presumably was back in 1980, but the stunts are still awe-inspiring, and there’s plenty of laughs. They really were thinking big.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 95%\n\n\n1. Bob Roberts\nSurprise! Yeah, we know most people don’t identify this 1992 political mockumentary with Saturday Night Live, but writer/director Tim Robbins debuted the character in a short film for the show in 1986, which makes Bob Roberts a branch on the same family tree as It’s Pat. Fortunately, that’s just about all they have in common. Robbins’ lefty politics received their first cinematic airing with this sharp satire, which he starred in as the titular presidential candidate, who uses dirty politics and disingenuous folk songs to campaign against the Democratic incumbent (played by Gore Vidal). As a broadside against the rise of identity politics, Bob Roberts is as unfortunately prescient as it is ruefully funny; as a musical mockumentary, it’s one of the few This Is Spinal Tap-inspired features that truly stands on its own. Of course, Robbins has become such a polarizing figure that it can be difficult to see his films clearly, especially when they carry such an obvious political agenda — but if you can set all that aside, you may find yourself agreeing with Time Out’s Geoff Andrew, who wrote, “Bob Roberts is not merely a satirical fictional biopic, but a wry exploration of the relationship between political reality and manufactured image.”\n\n\n\n\nIn case you were wondering, here are the top SNL movies according RT users’ scores:\n1.

To celebrate the release of his latest big-screen comedy, Neil LaBute’s Death at a Funeral remake, we decided to take a look through Rock’s filmography and find its ten freshest entries. It’s time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MuzeID=1171875[/tomatometer]10. Bee MovieIt had the benefit of almost 10 years’ worth of Seinfeld nostalgia, a huge promotional campaign, and a series of teasers featuring its stars dressed up in funny giant bug costumes. It had a voice cast that included Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, and Chris Rock as a mosquito named Mooseblood. So why did Bee Movie end up looking like a disappointment despite its $366 million gross? In all likelihood, Seinfeld would have had a hard time meeting expectations with anything he did after so much time away, but Bee‘s hyperactive plot and punny, kid-targeted gags struck a sour note with fans of his stand-up act and long-running sitcom. Still, some critics were able to appreciate the film for what it was — like Christian Toto of the Washington Times, who wrote, “Bee Movie is a light, moderately entertaining romp. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083482[/tomatometer]9. Lethal Weapon 4Rock added “action hero” to his resume with his appearance in the fourth Lethal Weapon, which gave him the role of Lee Butters, the police detective who secretly marries the daughter of Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Though Lethal Weapon 4‘s script didn’t give Rock many opportunities to exercise his famously acerbic wit, it let him do something almost as funny — namely, spend two hours quaking in fear of Glover — and put him on the screen for one of the year’s biggest box office successes. By this point in the series, many critics felt Lethal Weapon was empty, but for some, the addition of Rock and Jet Li to the time-tested chemistry of Glover and Mel Gibson was enough to keep things entertaining. None were more surprised than Janet Maslin of the New York Times, who wrote, “Pardon me for having groaned in anticipation of what, in the full perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, turns out to be one of the nicer blow-’em-ups around.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1109255[/tomatometer]8. Osmosis JonesThe Farrelly brothers, Bill Murray, and Chris Rock, together in one picture — it’s gotta be great, right? Well, yes and no. Osmosis Jones was the Farrellys’ bid for family-friendly fare, starring Murray as a slovenly widower whose disgusting habits leave his body vulnerable to the dastardly virus Thrax (voiced by Laurence Fishburne), and trigger the heroic efforts of the titular white blood cell (voiced by Chris Rock). It was a nifty premise, one made all the more intriguing thanks to its split between live action scenes (starring Murray, Molly Shannon, and Chris Elliott) and animated sequences (featuring the voices of Rock, Fishburne, and William Shatner); unfortunately, audiences delivered it the same disastrous fate suffered by Warner Bros. Animation’s previous release, The Iron Giant. Fortunately, critics were a bit kinder — though some were turned off by the Farrellys’ ever-scatalogical humor, a number of writers praised Osmosis‘ borderline educational storyline, as well as its likable cast. “I’d advise attendees of this film to go on an empty stomach,” wrote John R. McEwen of Film Quips Online, “but if you’re willing to endure the Farrellys’ warped sense of humor and Murray’s scratching, squirting, gas-passing antics, Osmosis Jones offers some lighthearted fun.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1146129[/tomatometer]7. MadagascarRock returned to animation with this DreamWorks Animation hit, which found him voicing Marty, a zebra whose quest to escape the Central Park Zoo leads to him being forcibly deported to Kenya with his friends Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer), and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), along with a trio of penguins. Of course, the trip doesn’t go as planned — the movie’s called Madagascar, after all — but the whole thing worked like a charm for DreamWorks, where the $532 million gross guaranteed sequels and spinoffs galore. (The third Madagascar is scheduled to arrive in theaters in 2012.) Critics were generally indifferent to its charms, but for some, the movie’s journey was one worth taking; as Tasha Robinson of the AV Club observed, “The tenor can be shrill, but there’s no time to get bored. And on top of that, most of the gags actually work.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1042521[/tomatometer]6. CB4It’s been described as a sort of hip-hop take on This Is Spinal Tap, but CB4 probably has more in common with absurdist pop music comedies like Airheads and Wayne’s World. Rock, who co-wrote the script, stars as a wannabe rapper named Albert, whose desperate quest for rap stardom leads him to co-opt the identity of a recently imprisoned local gangster (Charlie Murphy) and use his street cred to score hardcore hits like the immortal “Straight Outta Locash.” Given the satire-ready subject matter, Rock’s heightened visibility during his early ’90s Saturday Night Live run, and a cast that included Phil Hartman and Chris Elliott, CB4 should have been the start of something big for Rock; instead, its middling box office and lukewarm reviews kicked off a string of bit roles in films like Sgt. Bilko. It’s survived as something of a cult classic on home video, though, bearing out the predictions of critics like the Washington Post’s Desson Thomson, who wrote, “If your mood is loose and profane, if you speak hip-hop (or you just like hearing it) and if you think Rock is funny (he is), you’ll be glad you checked this out.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1190976[/tomatometer]5. Madagascar: Escape 2 AfricaAfter Madagascar raked in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office (and proved to be an eminently merchandisable cash magnet for DreamWorks), a follow-up was inevitable — but unlike most sequels, 2008’s Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa was a bigger box office hit and enjoyed significantly better reviews than its predecessor. Here, Rock and his co-stars send their voices to Africa, where their animal characters meet up with a pride of lions (including Alec Baldwin and Sherri Shepherd) and one suave hippo (voiced by the Black Eyed Peas’ will.i.am, who contributed heavily to the soundtrack). Even as it hurled pop culture gags at the screen, sold countless tie-ins, and set up yet another sequel, Escape 2 Africa added new layers of depth and humor to the original, much to the surprise of critics like the Toronto Star’s Peter Howell, who wrote, “It has everything Madagascar had three years ago, but also two things the original was woefully lacking: a good yarn and genuine yuks.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1093571[/tomatometer]4. DogmaHe’s in a bit of a fallow period now, but it wasn’t so long ago that Kevin Smith had an imagination so fearless it could dream up the kind of movie that would inspire public condemnation — not to mention death threats — from people who hadn’t even seen it. We’re talking about Dogma, the 1999 comedy in which Smith pits a pair of exiled angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) against a ragtag group that includes a Greek muse turned stripper (Salma Hayek), the heretofore unknown 13th apostle (Chris Rock), Jesus Christ’s last surviving relative (Linda Fiorentino), and a pair of unwitting prophets (Jason Mewes and Smith as, of course, Jay and Silent Bob) — all while God (played by Alanis Morissette, natch) lies trapped in the comatose body of a homeless man (s)He was using to play skee ball. Not for the easily offended, obviously — but despite what Dogma‘s detractors may have thought, Smith didn’t go for cheap gags, instead using humor to leaven a thoughtful look at what we believe, and why. “Make no mistake,” cautioned TV Guide’s Maitland McDonagh, “Kevin Smith’s talky, farcical comedy of cosmic errors is clever. But it’s clever in a deeply juvenile way.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1033097[/tomatometer]3. New Jack CityRock earned his first real screen time in Mario Van Peebles’ 1991 drug drama, playing the ill-fated police informant Benny “Pookie” Robinson, who tries to help NYPD detectives Scotty Appleton (Ice-T) and Nick Peretti (Judd Nelson) infiltrate the crack-spewing CMB gang, led by the vicious Nino Brown (Wesley Snipes). Pookie is unsuccessful in his efforts, to put it mildly, but New Jack City was a huge hit, racking up almost $50 million in domestic grosses, earning widespread critical praise, and spun off a soundtrack that became one of the top-selling albums of the year, thanks in part to a huge hit single from the other CMB (aka Color Me Badd). Roger Ebert was one of the many critics who enjoyed Peebles’ City, writing, “The movie was advertised (no doubt wisely) as a slam-bang action adventure, but in fact it’s a serious, smart film with an impact that lingers after the lights go up.”(Warning: NSFW — language.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1099793[/tomatometer]2. Nurse BettyChris Rock has taken his fair share of lumps for appearing in middle-of-the-road comedies like I Think I Love My Wife and Head of State, but occasionally, he reminds us that he has a sharper eye for scripts than you might suspect. Case in point: Nurse Betty, a wickedly dark, Neil LaBute-directed comedy about a slightly addled waitress (Renee Zellweger) who comes unglued from reality when she witnesses her husband (Aaron Eckhart) being murdered by a pair of hit men (Rock and Morgan Freeman). A strange blend of The Wizard of Oz-style fantasy and bloody, Tarantino-esque violence, Nurse Betty baffled audiences, but the black humor of John C. Richards’ script, coupled with uniformly strong performances from a cast that also included Greg Kinnear and Allison Janney, made it one of the year’s better-reviewed films. Wrote Jules Brenner of Cinema Signals, “Carried by Renee Zellweger whose particular forte is unquestioned honesty, directness and guilelessness, supported by no less than Morgan Freeman in a semi-comedic turn and Chris Rock in a semi-serious turn, it’s a rare entertainment.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1216066[/tomatometer]1. Good HairShaken after his five-year-old daughter asked him why she didn’t have “good hair,” Rock spearheaded this thoughtful, yet lighthearted, look at the complicated emotions — and the huge industry — surrounding the issue of hair in the black community. Following weaves to their (ahem) roots in India, examining just what goes into chemical hair relaxers, and interviewing a host of celebrities (including Ice-T, Paul Mooney, Maya Angelou, and Al Sharpton), Rock was able to take the gifts for social commentary and comedy that made him so appealing on record and HBO, and bring them — arguably for the first time — to the big screen. Though a few critics felt Good Hair didn’t take its subject seriously enough, the vast majority appreciated the even-handed way Rock chose to address a complex, largely taboo subject. “If you arrive at Good Hair never having thought about the complexities of black hair, bring a notebook,” warned Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe. “If you are a black woman wearing a weave, bring a tissue.”In case you were wondering, here are Rock’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Good Hair — 84%2. Dogma — 83%3. New Jack City — 78%4. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa — 76%5. Nurse Betty — 69%6. Lethal Weapon 4 — 68%7. Madagascar — 66%8. CB4 — 62%9. Bee Movie — 58%10.

After all, the slide from peak Disney Renaissance had only just begun (their releases that year were Pocahontas and A Goofy Movie) and Pixar&nbsp;was up to that point&nbsp;a studio that only made commercials and shorts; a feature-length 3D animated movie was a miracle in of itself, and they were not equipped to churn out quality yearly releases like Walt Disney Animation.Pixar’s follow-up took three years to hit theaters, and though A Bug’s Life is looked back on in the canon as a minor Pixar effort, everyone in 1998 rushed out to see it, and it again ended up grossing more than Disney’s then recent works like Hercules and Mulan. 1999’s Toy Story 2 was a cultural event, and established Pixar as the one to take animation to the highest heights in the new century.

For all the movies based in New York, Chicago, and L.A., we’ve had precious few take place in the wintry tundra at the bottom of the globe — but director Dominic Sena is doing his part to help bring some Antarctic love to a theater near you with Whiteout, the Kate Beckinsale-led thriller opening this weekend. Seeing it on the release schedule got us to thinking about other movies based in Earth’s southernmost continent — and naturally, we decided to turn it into a Total Recall, one in which we give you a taste of what you can expect on a trip to the South Pole (short answer: penguins and aliens).[tomatometer]MuzeID=1134655[/tomatometer]Alien vs. PredatorAt this point, human beings have figured out how to colonize pretty much any place on Earth — which means that the few places that remain uninhabited should probably stay that way. Places such as Bouvet Island, the glacier-coated Norwegian territory that lies a thousand miles north of Antarctica. Bouvetøya, as the Norwegians call it, is so inhospitable that it doesn’t contain much more than a research station, some moss, and a few penguins — oh, and a centuries-old subterranean pyramid that serves as a battleground for the endless war between the extraterrestrial races we refer to as Aliens and Predators. That conflict was unwittingly re-opened by a team of unfortunate research scientists in 2004’s Alien vs. Predator, a Paul W.S. Anderson project that adapted the long-running franchise mashup that had been entertaining comic readers and game fans for years. You would think common sense would keep people from poking around on the remotest island on the planet — or climbing down a shaft in an abandoned whaling station — but just in case you find yourself tempted, remember the words of the San Francisco Chronicle’s Mick LaSalle, who warned, “take a wretched premise. Imagine the worst picture that could be made from it. Then imagine something even worse.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1156078[/tomatometer]Eight BelowPoor Cuba Gooding Jr. Just a few years after he shivered his way through the critical turkey Snow Dogs, Paul Walker came along with another wintry canine adventure — also produced by Disney — and melted the hearts of critics and audiences alike. Very loosely based on the true story of a 1958 Japanese expedition to Antarctica, Eight Below taught us four things: One, that Martian meteors can sometimes land in very inconvenient places; two, that there’s nobility in repaying a debt, even if that debt is to the pack of sled dogs that saved you from certain death; three, that dogs can steal a film from Paul Walker; and four, that an inspirational, fact-based drama always trumps a broad comedy featuring a Michael Bolton cameo. It is, in the words of Premiere’s Ethan Alter, “An example of a formula picture executed with the right mixture of professionalism and heart.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1148471[/tomatometer]9 SongsIf you were a lonely researcher suffering through another brutally cold week in Antarctica, your mind would probably start to wander — and when it did, thoughts of past relationships might not be far behind. Such is the case with Matt (Kieran O’Brien), the British climatologist whose icy exile sparks the series of memories that form the core of Michael Winterbottom’s 2004 release 9 Songs. Again and again, Matt’s thoughts return to his doomed relationship with Lisa (Margo Stilley), the American exchange student whose shared love of indie rock helped cement the couple’s bond (and gives the movie its title), but ultimately wasn’t enough to keep the romance alive after her return to the United States. Unfortunately, Matt and Lisa’s love story wasn’t enough to keep most critics entertained — even with the unsimulated naughty bits that caused controversy in the film’s native England and led to an unrated release here. Still, 9 Songs‘ lack of, ahem, moving parts is oddly fitting, in a way, as it left some critics feeling a lot like Matt. In the words of the Oregonian’s Shawn Levy, “seventy minutes of pneumatic sex without the trappings of characterization, plot or even attempted meaning can be a profoundly long time.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1011841[/tomatometer]The Land that Time ForgotWorld War I was pretty terrible, what with the trench warfare and the mustard gas and the screaming death — but for the unlucky survivors of a sunken British merchant ship who were taken captive by a German U-boat, the war ended up seeming like a vacation. For these poor folks, whose adventures were immortalized in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ 1918 novel and adapted for the screen in Kevin Connor’s 1975 The Land That Time Forgot, becoming prisoners of war was just the beginning of a journey that ended up taking them all the way to Antarctica — where they discovered a menagerie of supposedly extinct creatures, including dinosaurs and Neanderthal humans. Of course, the dinosaurs looked a heck of a lot like puppets — and the boat, for that matter, looked an awful lot like a model — but unless you’ve been to Antarctica yourself, who are you to judge? Audiences were only too happy to make the journey to this Land, making it one of the year’s surprise hits, and though most critics rolled their eyes at its low-budget effects and hammy performances, others appreciated its throwback matinee vibe. Time’s Jay Cocks, for one, promised that “instant second childhood is guaranteed in less than 90 minutes.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1194818[/tomatometer]Encounters at the End of the WorldMost of the movies on our list explore the strange creatures and often paranormal happenings of the coldest place on Earth — but Werner Herzog, ever the iconoclast, took a different approach for his 2007 documentary. Declaring himself disinterested in “fluffy penguins,” Herzog instead assembled an acerbic, thoughtful nature documentary focused less on the Antarctic landscape than the people who live there. In his inimitably unsentimental style, Herzog surveys the icy continent while probing the psychological makeup of residents like iceberg geologist Douglas MacAyeal, zoologist Jan Pawlowski, and Henry Kaiser, the guitarist/research diver whose underwater footage drew Herzog to the project in the first place. Anyone can read about Antarctica and deduce that it would take a special kind of person to want to spend an extended period of time there, but it took a filmmaker as brilliantly perverse as Herzog to use them to create what is, in the words of ViewLondon’s Matthew Turner, an “engaging, beautifully shot and genuinely fascinating documentary that will stay with you for weeks afterwards.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083247[/tomatometer]X-Files: Fight the FutureFor years, agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) warned us that the truth was out there — and in their 1998 feature film debut, they proved their willingness to find it by venturing all the way to Antarctica, where they discovered…well, it’s a little hard to say what they found, exactly. It’s clear that someone buried a giant lab out there, and used it to store what seemed to be alien bodies in a state of suspended animation — and there may have been an alien vessel under that. But as for what it all meant, and how swarms of bees and buckets of black slime fit into it all? We’re still not sure we have any idea, which is probably just fine with X-Files creator Chris Carter. And it didn’t bother most critics much, either: the Washington Post’s Michael O’Sullivan spoke for more than a few of his peers when he shrugged off Fight the Future‘s more inscrutable moments and pronounced it “stylish, scary, sardonically funny and at times just plain gross.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1155362[/tomatometer]Happy FeetFrom the outside, penguins seem like fairly docile, agreeable creatures, which is part of why they’re so popular at zoos and movie theaters. But what we never knew before George Miller’s 2006 hit Happy Feet was that they can also be a cliquish, superstitious bunch, not above exiling an oddball member of the flock for doing something as innocent as cutting a rug on the ice. That’s what happens to Mumble, the star of the film, after he runs afoul of his tribe’s elders by ignoring the age-old tradition of finding a mate by singing a “heartsong,” opting instead to tap out the rhythm to “Boogie Wonderland.” (Having spent their lives exposed to the elements, most penguins are apparently not fans of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.) After a few mildly perilous diversions, including a few months spent locked up in a Sea World clone, Mumble eventually manages to work his way back into his flock’s good graces — and, with a climactic dance number, help bring about the end of Antarctic overfishing. Over the top? Perhaps. But it was also a huge hit (a sequel’s on the way) and a winner with critics like the Wall Street Journal’s Joe Morgenstern, who pronounced it “the kind of musical comedy that might have swept the world if MGM had been based in Antarctica instead of Culver City.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1147611[/tomatometer]March of the PenguinsWith the possible exception of Werner Herzog, everyone thinks penguins are cute — but it took this 2005 documentary to teach us that they’re also some of the most faithful mates and devoted parents on the planet. Following the annual mating ritual of the Emperor penguin, director Luc Jacquet and his team showed viewers the incredibly arduous journey the birds endure every year, which includes going up to four months without food, hundreds of miles of lonely waddling, and — given that the males of the species huddle together for warmth during the long weeks when their mates are away — more bromance than an all-day Starsky &amp; Hutch marathon. The French original was dubbed with dialogue that featured the penguins “talking” to each other; thankfully, the American version gave us the dulcet tones of Morgan Freeman, which certainly didn’t hurt March of the Penguins‘ chances during awards season, when it took home a trophy case full of honors (including a coveted Golden Tomato Award) to go along with rapturous praise from critics like the New Yorker’s David Denby, who pronounced it “a perfect family movie, a perfect date movie, and one of the most eye-ravishing documentaries ever made.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021244[/tomatometer]The ThingCold and unforgiving, Antarctica can seem like a pretty foreboding place — especially when your camp has been infiltrated by a hostile, shape-shifting alien being who was foolishly dug up and thawed out by the Norwegian scientists at a neighboring research station. Such is the plight befallen the men of John Carpenter’s The Thing, a 1982 adaptation of John W. Campbell Jr.’s 1938 novella Who Goes There? (and loose remake of Howard Hawks’ 1951 The Thing from Another World). Billed as “the ultimate in alien terror,” The Thing lived up to the hype, thanks to some truly grotesque special effects and one of the bleakest final acts in mainstream sci-fi — and was quickly eclipsed at the box office by the far cuddlier E.T. Though it may not have sold as many tickets as its home-phoning cousin, The Thing has persisted as a cult classic on home video — and in any case, it’s probably the more instructive of the two, teaching us the folly of digging up spaceships in the ice, warming up their frozen occupants, and leaving Wilford Brimley alone for any extended period of time. It contains, in the words of eFilmCritic’s Rob Gonsalves, “everything you could want to know about horror filmmaking.”Take a look through the reviews for Whiteout, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.Finally, we leave you with — yes — more penguin footage:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Moore, DC, sag, period, book, halloween, child's, comics, Thanksgiving, hist, best, streaming, 2015, show","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Chill-Out-With-These-Antarctica-Movies"},{"id":"47508990121580","title":"Our Favorite Rock ‘n’ Roll Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Our Favorite Rock 'n' Roll MoviesRT staffers share our favorite movies that rock.by RT Staff | October 26, 2009 |  CommentsRock music has been a big part of the movies since Blackboard Jungle made Bill Haley a legend in 1955, and although the marriage of the two mediums hasn’t always been a happy one (see: Elvis Presley in Harum Scarum and Paul McCartney’s Give My Regards to Broad Street — or better yet, don’t), it’s also produced some cinematic classics. With Pirate Radio hitting theaters, we thought it would be a good time to share our staff’s favorite rock ‘n’ roll movies — flicks that will get your toes tapping and your hands strumming the old air guitar. Hey, RT users, what are your faves?Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979)  81%They don’t get much more Rock and Roll than this: unrulyrock-obsessed students take over a high school, invite theseminal punk band The Ramones in, and let’s just say that by thetime Joey and the boys are done, school’s out permanently. Andof the Ramone’s own brand of blistering punk rock isn’t enoughfor you, the soundtrack is augmented with tracks by Chuck Berry,Alice Cooper, and Todd Rundgren. Although the movie was made in1978, I didn’t get to see until a few years later on VHS. Butthe film’s message was still relevant for me: school sucks,let’s rock! (Come to think of it, that message is stillrelevant.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey (1991)  57%In 1991, Bill S. Prestion, and “Ted” Theodore Logan returnedto the big screen (after the surprising success of their firstExcellent Adventure in 1989). This time around, instead ofbouncing through time, our goofy heroes must conquer Deathhimself (it turns out Death is no expert at Battleship, Clue,Twister, or electric football), just so that they can play inthe Fourth Annual San Dimas Battle of the Bands. It’s hinted inthe first film that Bill &amp; Ted’s band, Wyld Stallyns, changedthe world with Rock and Roll, but we don’t really see that startto happen until Bogus Journey, when they play Argent’s God GaveRock and Roll to You. Personally, I think a big part of how WyldStallyns changes the world has to do with the fact that they’vegot the Martian Station on board, and more importantly, Deathhimself. I could go off on a long tangent about thephilosophical and metaphysical implications of having Death playbass in your rock band, but suffice to say that if the GrimReaper himself is touring with you, you probably really couldchange the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim Ryan, Senior EditorWoodstock: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music (1970)  100%This summer marked the 40th anniversary of the WoodstockMusic &amp; Art Fair, and with it came a flurry of mediaretrospectives. However, whether the mother of all rock festswas a cultural milestone or an overhyped, muddy bummer is besidethe point at this late date, thanks to Michael Wadleigh’s vivid,immersive documentary Woodstock. With its three-panelsplit screens and its four-hour runtime, no film has evercaptured the multiple facets of a rock concert with as mushstylistic aplomb and tactile panache. The obvious draw here arethe musical performances, many of which have become legendary(Carlos Santana’s mind-bending guitar work on “Soul Sacrifice,”the Who’s thunderous run through Tommy, and of course,Jimi Hendrix’s explosive, oddly reverent take on “The StarSpangled Banner”). However, what makes Woodstock agreat film is that it gives equal weight to the crowd — 400,000strong and each one convinced that the world is changing for thebetter. Though the overall tone is communal and celebratory, acertain sadness seeps in: given the immediacy of the film, itcomes as a poignant realization to know that the concertgoers,who wouldn’t look out of place at a Fleet Foxes or DevendraBanhart show are now only a few years shy of receiving socialsecurity benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dig! (2004)  89%You might not think you need to see a documentary about theDandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre, but you do. OndiTimoner’s Dig! is a lively, ironic chronicle of twobands that go from friends to rivals, but what makes the wholething perversely compelling is the presence of the BJM’s AntonNewcombe, an unhinged, self-sabotaging antihero for the ages.While the Dandys chart a respectable career path, the BJMcontinuously implode from Newcombe’s ranting, raging, andonstage dustups with audiences and bandmates. Though it exertsthe train-wreck fascination of a real life Spian Tap, Dig!also has something to say about the nature of success; it’sfurther proof (if any were needed) that talent is often lessimportant than professionalism in the music biz.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Vo, EditorHigh Fidelity (2000)  91%The universe of the music snob is an odd one, and HighFidelity shows it all with easy-cool swagger, romanticizingits heroes just as often as it exposes them for the absorbed,self-aggrandizing jerks they really are. But beneath theconvoluted musical discussions and John Cusack’s honorablepursuit of the ultimate mixtape lies an insanely sweet romanticcomedy, about one’s age old quest to recapture lost love (Cusacknails this role, his droopy, sad-sack eyes perfectly capturing aman crushed by life and an obscene vinyl collection). And whileit’s hip to dismiss co-star Jack Black as loud and overexposed,in 2000 he was still an unknown force of nature. In one of myall-time favorite movie moments, he flips the crowd on its headwith a surprise, golden-throated rendition of Marvin Gaye’s“Let’s Get it On.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Stop Making Sense (1984)  100%Each year in Talking Heads’ existence seemed to find them ina radically different place; theirs was one long evolution fromtweaked metropolitan rock to New Wave pleasure pop. StopMaking Sense captured them in their most excitingincarnation, when the four-piece expanded to a crowded stageensemble, complete with a polyrhythmic rhythm section and a bigAfrobeat sound. The Heads hired an equally exciting director inJonathan Demme, and the result is a scorching experience thatgives the concert film a full cinematic treatment. Tightediting, beautiful cinematography and even more beautiful music,and one really big suit makes for a rare 1980s gem that’s neverlost its polish. (And you’re in luck: it just got re-released onBlu-Ray!)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryan Fujitani, Community ManagerWayne's World (1992)  78%Say what you will about the goofy, sometimes inane antics ofbasement cable access stars Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar, butthey know a thing or two about rock music. What started as apopular recurring sketch on Saturday Night Live finallymade the jump to the big screen in 1992, and the duo (played bySNL veterans Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) proved they could bejust as funny (if not funnier) in movies as they were on TV. airthis with the fact that they’re diehard fans of quality music,not to mention the film is directed by Penelope Spheeris (TheDecline of Western Civilization), and I think it’s fairlyobvious why I’d consider this one of my favorite rock and rollmovies. From the hilarious Alice Cooper cameo to the “NoStairway to Heaven” rule to Garth’s lustful freakout set to thetune of “Foxy Lady,” the fingerprints of rock fandom can befound all over Wayne’s World. And let’s be honest: whoamong us doesn’t picture the gang headbanging in Wayne’s AMCPacer every time they hear Bohemian Rhapsody now?&nbsp;&nbsp;Once (2007)  97%In 2007, a small Irish film came out of nowhere to grab theworld’s attention, earning high praise from critics and going onto win Best Original Song at the 2008 Academy Awards. Writtenand directed by John Carney, former bassist of the Irish bandthe Frames, the film stars the band’s lead vocalist andguitarist, Glen Hansard, as a busker who forms a bond with agirl (Marketa Irglova, also a musician, from the Czech Republic)who sells flowers and happens to play the piano. The film isnotable for its striking musical performances (all originalpieces) and its powerful emotional core, but it also succeeds inportraying the struggles of an aspiring musician and thecircumstances that shape his work. Once was one of myfavorite films of that year, and featured a stunning soundtrackwith performances by Hansard and Irglova that mirrored theironscreen chemistry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff Giles, ContributorThe Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years (1988)  90%It’s still a little hard for me to believe, but PenelopeSpheeris, the woman who directed Wayne’s World and BlackSheep was also responsible for two of the most importantrockumentaries of the ’80s: 1981’s punk doc The Decline ofWestern Civilization and its 1988 sequel, which forsookcritically respected acts like Circle Jerks and Black Flag for alook at the hard rock scene in late ’80s L.A. Emphasizing thehair metal of the era, The Decline of Western CivilizationPart II includes classic interviews with stars of the genre(such as Paul Stanley, Steven Tyler, and Ozzy) as well as lesspopular acts like London, Odin, and Seduce.

Some love it becauseof its insane climactic car chase. Some just love the sight ofyoung Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. Me? I count The BluesBrothers among my favorite rock ‘n’ roll flicks because ofthe soundtrack — and because of the incredible lineup of soulsurvivors Paul Shaffer recruited for the Brothers’ backing band,including Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, Matt “Guitar” Murphy, WillieHall, and…well, you get the idea. Humorless purists criticizedthe Blues Brothers for trivializing the work of the genre’s realartists, but that’s nonsense; Aykroyd and Belushi’s lovinghomage to Stax soul and Chicago blues helped usher in a revival— and, more importantly, helped keep more than a few unjustlyforgotten performers fed. They may not have been on a realmission from God, but they came close enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara Schieron, ContributorQuadrophenia (1979)  100%Franc Roddam’s mod opus Quadrophenia would havebeen a light through the clouds to me — if I’d seen it when Iwas 15. But I saw it late: years after my Doc Martens had beensent unceremoniously out to the trash, years after my lastdefense of Morrissey as a god-head whose name is not Mos andmoons since I’d listened to The Jam. But then Roddam and the Whomade it kind of late. Based on their 1973 rock opera, the filmversion (released in 1979) saw delays in exhibition afterbandmember Keith Moon passed away. Perhaps as a result, the filmhas a sense of mourning to it that feeds into its tragicnostalgia for the era passed. It’s a messily specific valentineto the era: an anti-coming of age story about kids as detachedfrom their realities as they are itching to get a glimpse at aplace darker and truer than their working class worlds. Sure,the Mod we think of today is the 1980s resurrection of theidentity, but that stuff started somewhere, and knowing thehistory can sure give the maudlin skies a little more clarity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Linda Linda Linda (2005)  82%Nobuhiro Yamashita’s Linda, Linda, Linda treats theprocess of starting a high school band like a team-buildingexercise — and why not? Music doesn’t have to be allidentity-obsessed like High Fidelity, or drug-ladenlike Sid and Nancy. This super-cute, Japanese concertfilm is wholesome. That’s right, I said wholesome. About afoursome of teens gearing up for a bandslam, Linda, Linda,Linda follows three Japanese schoolgirls and their SouthKorean exchange student singer as each of them learns somethingmajor: how to play drums, how to speak Japanese, and how toreject a boy — all while they keep their grades up. The titlesong, which the girls cover and play for their Battle of theBands, is a revival of a catchy little post-punk number by theBlue Hearts, and its just the thing to unleash all the energythese girls pack so tightly into their properly regimentedscholastic endeavors. This performance is like their opportunityto break out — in all kinds of memorable ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gabi Jacobs, Creative DirectorHedwig and the Angry Inch (2001)  92%This is the most sophisticated, edgy and unique musical I’veever seen. It tells the story of a boy who escapes a domineeringmother and East Germany in search of stardom and love, embarkingon a journey that finds him, or her, living in a Kansas trailerpark and performing his music in strip-malls after a botched sexchange…hence the name of her band, The Angry Inch.

Why, in 2002, Pierce Brosnan was still James Bond, Nia Vardalos was a budding film mogul, and Ryan Reynolds was still just that guy from National Lampoon’s Van Wilder. It was also the year Mel Gibson starred in M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs, an eventual $400 million hit — and the beginning of an unexpectedly long absence for one of the biggest movie stars in the world. Aside from an appearance in The Singing Detective the following year, Gibson has been uncharacteristically camera-shy for almost a decade now, but all that ends this week, with his starring turn in Martin Campbell’s Edge of Darkness. Seeing Mel return to his action roots has us in a celebratory mood — and what better way to celebrate than a look back at his best-reviewed films? Yes, folks, it’s Total Recall time![tomatometer]MuzeID=1065684[/tomatometer]10. BraveheartOkay, so maybe there’s still grumbling in the critical community about it taking the Best Picure Oscar. And it may very well have deserved its high ranking in the London Times’ list of the most historically inaccurate movies of all time. Whatever its flaws, though, it takes a special kind of historical epic to hold an audience in thrall for nearly three hours, and that’s exactly what Braveheart did — to the tune of a $210 million worldwide gross and five Academy Awards against a rather incredible 10 nominations. Making his directorial follow-up to 1993’s The Man Without a Face, Gibson initially resisted casting himself as Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace, but once he took the role, he made it his own, infusing what might have been a fusty period piece with plenty of timeless, vein-bulging action. Forgive Braveheart its arguably bloated length, as well as the many smirking cries of “Freedom!” it triggered; applaud it instead, because, in the words of Film Scouts’ Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, “At the heart of Mel Gibson’s tumultuously entertaining epic is the almost-quaint notion that movie heroics should mean something more than a play for the much-coveted 18-25 box office demographic.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002947[/tomatometer]9. The BountyThe oft-told tale of Captain Bligh and his unwieldy crew got the revisionist treatment in this watery Roger Donaldson-directed epic, which gave a young Gibson (as the mutinous Fletcher Christian) the chance to lock big-screen horns with Anthony Hopkins (as the tyrannical, or perhaps merely beleaguered, Bligh) for the fate of the HMS Bounty. Of course, we all know how things turned out for Bligh and his men — so it’s to Gibson and Hopkins’ immense credit, as well as a testament to a stellar supporting cast that included Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Liam Neeson, that The Bounty was such a critical success. Though some critics took issue with the script’s historical errors, as well as an overall absence of the type of fireworks one might expect from a cast of this caliber, the majority had kind words for the film — including Roger Ebert, who wrote, “this Bounty is not only a wonderful movie, high-spirited and intelligent, but something of a production triumph as well.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012978[/tomatometer]8. Mad Max Beyond ThunderdomeThe first two films in the trilogy are widely acknowledged action classics, leaving 1985’s Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the runt of the litter. Of course, an 81 percent Tomatometer rating is nothing to sneeze at, particularly when we’re talking about the third installment in a series, but Thunderdome is easily the most hotly contested of the franchise, with fans and critics either hating it (“Definitely the worst movie in the Mad Max series,” wrote James O’Ehley of the Sci-Fi Movie Page) or preferring it to its predecessors (Roger Ebert called it “more visionary and more entertaining than the first two”). No matter how you feel about Thunderdome, though, one thing’s for sure: Between George Miller halfway bailing on the project after the death of his friend Byron Kennedy, and the stunt casting of Tina Turner as the power-hungry Aunty Entity, things probably should have turned out a lot worse than they did. In fact, Thunderdome has some of the most memorable moments and quotable lines in the series — and boasts, according to Time Out’s Derek Adams, “Enough imagination, wit and ingenuity to put recent Spielberg to shame.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012262[/tomatometer]7. Lethal Weapon 2After the immense success of 1987’s Lethal Weapon, and the enduring popularity of the buddy cop genre it helped define, it came as no surprise to anyone when a sequel surfaced two years later. What was shocking, however, was just how much fun Lethal Weapon 2 turned out to be. Boasting further opportunities for Gibson to test the limits of action-hero funny business as nutty LAPD sergeant Martin Riggs, some of the nastiest bad guys in any late ’80s action thriller, and rapid-fire comic relief in the form of Joe Pesci, the second Weapon flew in the face of conventional wisdom by scoring with filmgoers and critics alike. In fact, some preferred it to the original — including scribes like Brian Orndorf, who called it “One of the finest examples of the genre, and, in my humble estimation, one of the greatest sequels put to film. Perhaps deranged hyperbole, but rarely does a follow-up outgun the original film as swiftly as Lethal 2 does.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1008074[/tomatometer]6. GallipoliA number of films have tried to send a message about the futility and waste of war, but few have done it with the plain and heartbreaking precision of Peter Weir’s Gallipoli, which recounts the terrible saga of the Australian soldiers who perished in a poorly planned attempt to break a stalemate on the Turkish peninsula during World War I. By focusing less on the action-heavy aspect of the war and more on the doomed friendship of two soldiers named Archy Hamilton (Mark Lee) and Frank Dunne (Gibson), Gallipoli underlined the human cost of the campaign, culminating in a harrowing final sequence that painfully illustrates the human cost of battle. “Weir’s work has a delicacy, gentleness, even wispiness that would seem not well suited to the subject,” observed Janet Maslin of the New York Times, “and yet his film has an uncommon beauty, warmth, and immediacy, and a touch of the mysterious, too.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1024230[/tomatometer]5. The Year of Living DangerouslyLater in his career, Gibson acquired a rep for gravitating toward films that depicted grievous bodily harm, but anyone who’d been paying attention knew his taste for cinematic pain wasn’t a recent development. Take, for instance, 1983’s The Year of Living Dangerously, in which Gibson plays a journalist whose hunger for a big story leads him into the heart of an Indonesian coup — and earns him a busted eye in the process. Gibson’s second film with director Peter Weir, Dangerously benefited from its star’s heightened post-Mad Max profile, although it was his co-star, Linda Hunt, who walked away with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (and for good reason: She played a half-Chinese dwarf named Billy Kwan). “The Year of Living Dangerously is a flawed film,” wrote Dan Jardine of the Apollo Guide, “but it is richly textured and imbued with enough emotional and intellectual subtlety to make it a rewarding experience.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012261[/tomatometer]4. Lethal WeaponMovies had been making cash out of the male buddy dynamic for decades before Lethal Weapon came along, so it would be a mistake to call it groundbreaking, but it was still one of the more influential (and successful) action flicks of the late ’80s. Of course, that influence was partially felt through turkeys like Tango &amp; Cash — not to mention Weapon‘s three uneven sequels — but let us focus here on the positive: Gibson and Glover have the easy chemistry of two old friends, Richard Donner’s direction is at its sleekest, Shane Black’s script combines laughs and thrills in equal measure, and Gibson’s mullet was never more exquisite. The role of mentally unstable cop Martin Riggs wasn’t really anything new for Gibson (Time’s Richard Schickel cracked that the movie was “Mad Max meets The Cosby Show“), but it put him squarely in his wheelhouse, and introduced filmgoers to one of the more interesting and complex characters in the genre. “From a distance, Lethal Weapon might appear generic,” wrote James Berardinelli of ReelViews, “but a closer look reveals something special.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012976[/tomatometer]3. Mad MaxPop quiz: Before Paranormal Activity came along last year, what was the biggest cost-to-profit success in movie history? That’s right, it was 1979’s Mad Max, George Miller’s dystopian shoot-’em-up about an emotionally frayed cop (Gibson) driven over the edge after a gang of lunatics murders his wife and daughter. Gibson’s unthrottled performance as Max Rockatansky channeled the unfocused anger that led the fledgling actor into bar fights, launching a hugely successful film career in the process — and Miller’s brilliant way with an adrenalized set piece helped change global perceptions of the Australian film industry. Not bad for a movie with a shoestring budget, peppered with accents and slang its American distributors insisted on overdubbing, and little more on its mind than 95 minutes of very gruesome violence. The next time you’re caught in the grip of a filmmaker’s nightmarish vision of the future, thank Mad Max — the movie that, in the words of eFilmCritic’s Brian McKay, “launched not only [Mel Gibson’s] career, but the whole post-apocalyptic genre of the ’80s and beyond.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1098064[/tomatometer]2. Chicken RunDisagreements during its production ultimately led to a parting of the ways for Aardman Animations and DreamWorks Animation, but as far as critics and filmgoers were concerned, Chicken Run was nothing but a winner. The stop-motion animated adventure, which finds Gibson lending his voice to a suave rooster named Rocky, offered American audiences their first opportunity to get an extended look at the distinctive style of Nick Park and his cohorts — and it gave Gibson the chance to add another kid-friendly entry to a rather dark filmography. (Gibson’s previous foray into animation, 1995’s Pocahontas, left critics lukewarm at 55 percent on the Tomatometer.) Whatever led to the Aardman/DreamWorks divorce didn’t show up on screen; Chicken Run‘s feathery blend of comedy and adventure produced nearly $225 million in worldwide grosses and applause from critics like Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle, who called it “the most consistently entertaining animated film in years.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1017665[/tomatometer]1. The Road WarriorIf you’re going to make a sequel, it helps if the first installment leaves you enough room to grow — and a storyline open-ended enough to give the characters something truly interesting to do. George Miller was lucky enough to have both with 1979’s Mad Max, as well as a huge worldwide gross; two years later, he put them all to use for The Road Warrior, which placed Gibson, returning as Mad Max, at the center of a battle for one of the last working oil refineries in the world. But bigger battles and improved special effects weren’t all that The Road Warrior brought to the table — where the first film found Max tearing loose from the bonds of society after losing his family, the sequel gave him a few reminders of his own humanity. “The Road Warrior isn’t Citizen Kane,” wrote James Rocchi of Netflix, “but it has a lot of things — power, speed, brains and energy — in massive quantities and at a high degree of quality that many films can only dream of.”In case you were wondering, here are Gibson’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Braveheart — 93%2. Lethal Weapon — 93%3. The Road Warrior — 92%4. Gallipoli — 92%5. Lethal Weapon 2 — 88%6. Mad Max — 86%7. Maverick — 85%8. The Year of Living Dangerously — 85%9.

Heck, he even popped up on Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood during the 1980s, appearing as Keith the Southwood Carpenter. You’ve heard of “that guy” status for actors? That’s Keith David in a nutshell — and since you’ll be hearing his voice in The Princess and the Frog this weekend, we thought now would be the perfect time to give this ubiquitous thespian the Total Recall treatment![tomatometer]MuzeID=1095092[/tomatometer]10. Pitch BlackPitch Black was Vin Diesel’s coming out party, the perfect vehicle for a hulking bruiser with a menacing glower. But Richard B. Riddick’s resolute refusal to put faith in anything wouldn’t have meant half as much if the movie hadn’t contrasted his nihilism with the unshakable religious beliefs of Abu al-Walid, the imam played by Keith David. The character — usually referred to simply as “Imam” — wages a philosophical battle against Riddick as their plucky band of space-marooned travelers fights for survival against a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures, lending a smidgen of subtext to a movie that, as far as most filmgoers were concerned, was in theaters simply to add a couple hours of solid action fare to the bleak February release schedule. And okay, so it’s kind of a stretch to imagine anyone saw Pitch Black for its script — but David’s character had enough mojo to return for the sequel, and the interstellar thrills were sufficient to win the approval of critics such as Hollywood.com’s Ted Murphy, who wrote, “Some hard-core science-fiction fans might nitpick over details in Pitch Black, but for the average moviegoer looking to be entertained, this roller-coaster of a film should not be missed.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1059629[/tomatometer]9. The Quick and the DeadSam Raimi doing a Western sounds like a can’t-miss proposition, especially when the cast of the Western in question includes Gary Sinise, Lance Henriksen, Pat Hingle, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe, and Gene Hackman. Unfortunately, 1994’s The Quick and the Dead missed in a big way, only earning back about half of its $35 million budget and going down as one of the biggest commercial whiffs of the year, thanks in part to a promotional campaign that focused on Sharon Stone’s character instead of the ensemble surrounding her. Based on its dismal grosses, you’d think Quick and the Dead was a mess, but most of the critics who saw it found favor with Raimi’s half-cracked take on the well-worn genre, as well as Simon Moore’s script, which pits a crew of would-be gunslingers against Hackman’s John Herod in a rootin’ tootin’ tourney with a $123,000 cash prize. As competitor Sergeant Clay Cantrell, Keith David doesn’t get a lot of screen time, but he does score a scene that manages to sum up a large chunk of his appeal:Cantrell: Sergeant Cantrell.Shemp: How do you spell that?Cantrell: Correctly.“Raimi’s movie borrows heavily from classic spaghetti westerns,” admitted Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid, “but Raimi has a style of his own, and plenty of it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1065870[/tomatometer]8. ClockersEven for an actor as prolific as Keith David, 1995 was a big year, giving him screen time in the Hughes brothers’ Dead Presidents, Sam Raimi’s The Quick and the Dead, and Paul Aster and Wayne Wang’s Blue in the Face — along with Spike Lee’s Clockers, which cast David as a take-no-prisoners housing authority cop nicknamed Andre the Giant. When your police partner is Harvey Keitel and you’re still the most menacing member of the duo, the bad guys had better be careful — a lesson painfully learned by “Strike” Dunham (Mekhi Phifer) in one of the film’s most memorable sequences, a three-minute clinic in unfiltered rage led by David as he makes it clear to Phifer that he doesn’t approve of Phifer’s illegal activities. Overlooked at the box office, Clockers nonetheless earned the praise of critics such as Boxoffice Magazine’s Shlomo Schwartzberg, who wrote, “Spike Lee’s adaptation of Richard Price’s powerful novel about a drug dealer and a cop pursuing him for a crime captures the story’s essence, evoking a melancholy world in which the chances of surviving and staying on the straight and narrow are small.”Warning: NSFW — language and violence.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002441[/tomatometer]7. BirdClint Eastwood’s tribute to Charlie Parker, Bird is mostly a showcase for Parker’s music and Forest Whitaker’s outstanding performance as the legendary saxophonist, but Eastwood is smart enough not to skimp on the supporting players — and when you care enough to send the very best, you get Keith David, who shows up here as Parker’s (fictional) mentor, Buster Franklin. While not a major element of the film, Franklin certainly had a significant influence on Parker’s career, and that’s reflected here in sequences that illustrate the ways both men struggled to remain true to their respective muses. Eastwood was criticized for dwelling on the more sensationalistic aspects of Parker’s life and times, but the glimpses we’re afforded of Franklin — as well as the way David carries the character during his limited screen time — illustrate that fading away can be just as painful as burning out. Roger Ebert was one of the many critics impressed with Bird, writing, “Whitaker occupies this world as a large, friendly, sometimes taciturn man who tries to harm nobody and who cannot understand why the world would not let him play his music. Neither can we.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021244[/tomatometer]6. The ThingA bleak, horrifying sci-fi thriller as cold and dark as the Antarctic climate in which it takes place, John Carpenter’s The Thing represented Keith David’s first big break — not only was it the first major role for an actor whose biggest part to that point was an uncredited role in 1979’s Disco Godfather, but it also openly flouted the unspoken rule that the black dude is always the first one to get whacked in a horror movie. In fact, David and Kurt Russell are the last men standing in The Thing — and if Carpenter ever gets his way, their frostbitten faces will someday be seen in a sequel. That doesn’t seem terribly likely at this point, but even if it never comes to pass, David will always have the distinction of starring in the movie that eFilmCritic’s Rob Gonsalves says “contains everything you could want to know about horror filmmaking.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1100652[/tomatometer]5. Requiem for a DreamLike the Hubert Selby, Jr. novel from which it’s adapted, Darren Aronofsky’s Requiem for a Dream is certainly not for everyone. An unflinching look at the misery of addiction, Requiem follows the hellish descents of a widow named Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and Harry’s friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). After 102 minutes, all four characters have been pretty well run through the wringer; Burstyn winds up institutionalized, Leto loses an arm, Wayans has to go cold turkey in a jail cell — and Connelly crosses paths with Big Tim, played with thoroughly skeevy elan by Keith David. Good taste prevents us from getting into the exact nature of their relationship; suffice it to say that Connelly’s character arc demonstrates that some people will do just about anything to get their fix, and David’s performance reminds us that other people will stoop at nothing to take advantage of an addict. “Never have we been taken this close to the edge, and never have the characters teetering over it elicited so much sympathy,” wrote Eugene Novikov of Film Blather. “Requiem is difficult to watch, but it richly rewards those who stay with it.”/div&gt;[tomatometer]MuzeID=1083936[/tomatometer]4. There’s Something About MaryHe isn’t often asked to do comedy, but Keith David can be very funny in the right situation — like, for instance, when he’s scaring the wits out of an unfortunately tuxedoed Ben Stiller in the opening scenes of 1998’s There’s Something About Mary. David’s role as the stepfather of Mary (Cameron Diaz) was one of his smaller parts, but it’s no less memorable for its brevity; after all, how many cinematic father figures are called upon to help an anguished teen coax his mangled frank and beans out of a zipper? Only Keith David, ladies and gentlemen, and his looks of disgusted incredulity in that scene helped turn Mary into the movie that USA Today’s Susan Wloszczyna called “A gut-busting blast of tasteless tomfoolery.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016405[/tomatometer]3. PlatoonCharlie Sheen and Willem Dafoe took the lion’s share of the spotlight for Platoon — and not without reason — but Oliver Stone’s harrowing look back at the Vietnam War is really an ensemble feature, and it wouldn’t have attracted half of the critical acclaim it enjoyed without strong across-the-board performances from a large, impressive cast that included Tom Berenger, John C. McGinley, Johnny Depp, Forest Whitaker, and (of course) Keith David. As a soldier known as King, David acts as a gateway for the wide-eyed Private Chris Taylor (Sheen) into the world of the “heads,” a group of soldiers who blow off steam in an illicit underground clubhouse. It isn’t a leading role, but it’s a crucial one, as Taylor’s descent into the brotherhood of the heads helps foreshadow his transformation from wide-eyed idealist to haunted shell of a man. “Platoon is like the Wall,” wrote Rita Kempley of the Washington Post, “a dark and unforgettable memorial to the dead of Vietnam and an awesome requiem to the eternity of war.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021216[/tomatometer]2. They LiveBubblegum, anyone? John Carpenter liked David’s work on The Thing so much that when he was writing the screenplay for 1988’s They Live, he penned the role of construction worker Frank Armitage specifically for him — and in the process, gave David a major part in one of the most quotable cult classics of the 1980s, not to mention one of the 20 greatest fight scenes ever. Carpenter’s sci-fi actioner, in which a homeless man (Roddy Piper) discovers the human race has been infiltrated — and is being subliminally directed by — freaky-looking aliens, was initially regarded as something of a dud (the Washington Post’s Richard Harrington accused Carpenter of “trying to dig deep with a toy shovel” and said “it makes V look like Masterpiece Theatre“), but like the director’s Big Trouble in Little China, its legend has grown over the years. Frank Armitage is one of David’s bigger roles, and it helped establish him as a go-to actor for the sort of no-nonsense tough guys he’d go on to play in everything from Men at Work to Crash. The movie’s a lot of fun, too: in the words of Filmcritic’s Christopher Null, “They Live [is] Carpenter’s best film — I don’t care what you say.”Warning: NSFW — language and violence.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1189949[/tomatometer]1. CoralineHe’s best known for playing cops and military men, but David has also parlayed his distinctive voice into a career behind the scenes of cartoons and video games; you may not know it, but you’ve heard his voice in games such as Fallout and Saint’s Row, as well as the opening moments of albums (including Ice Cube’s Raw Footage), and the narration of multiple Ken Burns documentaries (including Jazz and The War). In Henry Selick’s stop-motion animated feature Coraline, David gave voice to The Cat, a stray feline who acts as Coraline’s guide through the dark, wacked-out world of The Beldam (Teri Hatcher), an insectile witch with a thing for replacing children’s eyes with buttons. “The results are simply astonishing,” wrote Anton Bitel of Little White Lies, adding, “Selick has created a richly detailed, beautifully realised set of parallel worlds and allows us to become as lost as Coraline herself in and between their exquisite textures.”In case you were wondering, here are David’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. The Thing — 95%2. Platoon — 95%3. Requiem for a Dream — 93%4. Coraline — 91%5. They Live — 85%6. There’s Something About Mary — 83%7. Pitch Black — 82%8. Bird — 82%9.

Not all of the Coens’ films have been critical darlings (alas, poor Ladykillers), but with lifetime Tomatometers above 80 percent, the brothers are easily two (or is that one?) of the most respected directors in the business. Their latest effort, Hail, Caesar!, hit theaters this week, and to celebrate, we’ve collected their most definitive directorial efforts, Total Recall style!Blood Simple (1984)  94%Combining the shocks of a slasher film with the moral ambiguity and twisty plotting of film noir, the Coens’ debut, Blood Simple, shook American independent cinema to its core. Creepy and deliriously malevolent, it’s the story of a bar owner who hires a sketchy private eye to kill his cheating wife (Frances McDormand); double and triple crosses and bloody mayhem ensues. With their first film, the Coens showed an aptitude for the stylistic quirks that would become their trademark — namely, a love of the ghoulish balanced with a loopy sense of humor. The Palo Alto Weekly’s Jeanne Aufmuth identified what would become recurring themes in their work when she wrote, “The Coens’ complicated sense of the surreal is consistently entertaining, down to the fleeting, oddball cameos and distinctly weird scripting.”Watch TrailerRaising Arizona (1987)  91%The first Coen brothers film to display their knack for quirky comedy,&nbsp;Raising Arizona helped seal the filmmakers’ reputation and cement their loyal following.

Though not their biggest hit, it’s infinitely quotable (“Edwina’s insides were a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase”), and the original score by Carter Burwell is not to be ignored. As the New Times’ Luke Y. Thompson ruefully sighed, “Nic Cage may never be better.”Watch TrailerMiller's Crossing (1990)  92%As an homage to classic gangster movies, Miller’s Crossing is hypercharged; the language is harsher, the violence more brutal, the plotting more labyrinthine. Albert Finney and Gabriel Byrne star as Irish mobsters, threatened externally by the Italian mob and internally by their shared love of a woman (Marcia Gay Harden). This intriguing tale of loyalty features impeccable 1920s decor and a streak of dark humor; it’s arguably the Coens’ most straightforward work. Combustible Celluloid’s Jeffrey M. Anderson concluded, “it’s one of their best, most cohesive films and it holds up to repeated viewings.”Watch TrailerBarton Fink (1991)  90%Legend has it the Coens had such a bad case of writers’ block while writing Miller’s Crossing that they took three weeks off to script Barton Fink, a 1930s-set black comedy about — what else? — a Hollywood scribe with writer’s block. A fledgling New York playwright who sells out (at the cost of… his soul!) and moves to the City of Angels, Barton Fink (played marvelously by Coen regular John Turturro) holes up in the seamy Hotel Earle, where exquisitely dismal wallpaper peels off the walls as a heat wave sweats the city. The mercury rises further when Barton’s gregarious neighbor (John Goodman) is around; almost hellishly so, you might say. But as every smart filmmaker is wont to do, the Coens offer no overt explanations of what’s really going on — just a well-told tale with visual imagery aplenty, and an ode to the sometimes infernal nature of the creative process. Describing it as “gnomic, claustrophobic, hallucinatory, just plain weird,” Time’s Richard Schickel lauded Barton Fink as “the kind of movie critics can soak up thousands of words analyzing and cinephiles can soak up at least three espressos arguing their way through.”Watch TrailerFargo (1996)  94%Prior to No Country For Old Men, the macabre, pitch-black comedy&nbsp;Fargo was the Coens’ most decorated film, with seven Oscar nominations and two wins: Best Actress (Frances McDormand) and Best Original Screenplay. Fargo details a ransom kidnap scheme gone wrong, with very pregnant cop McDormand investigating the crime as the bumbling perpetrators attempt to cover their tracks. The Coens’ bleak humor and taste for blood and violence never mixed as well as it did in Minnesota, so the people over at FX decided to create an offshoot television series — with the Coens on board as executvie producers — and it’s gone on to win some awards of its own. According to Kevin N. Laforest of the Montreal Film Journal, “This is truly a brilliant film, the kind you don’t see often. Intelligent, raw, funny, daring and unique, pure cinematic delight from start to end.”Watch TrailerThe Big Lebowski (1998)  83%Though many of the Coens’ films can be labeled cult classics, perhaps none embody the term more than The Big Lebowski. Jeff Bridges stars as pot-smoking slacker hero Jeffrey “The Dude” Lebowski, who seeks restitution for his rug, urinated on by a pair of gangsters who mistook him for a different Lebowski — namely, the “big” one (played by David Huddleston). Along with his bowling buddies, The Dude embarks on a wild chase that’s as funny, depraved, and plain unpredictable as Los Angeles always feels like it should be. Not all critics were willing to join The Dude’s steadily growing cult — Todd McCarthy of Variety sniffed that the movie “Adds up to considerably less than the sum of its often scintillating parts” — but in the end, as Chuck O’Leary of FulvueDrive-in.com wrote, “It’s pretty much impossible not to love The Dude.”Watch TrailerO Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)  78%With O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers took their thriller tropes (ill-fated criminal plans, ironic stereotypes, and a detached tone) and magically applied it towards an Odyssey-inspired farce. Starring George Clooney as the beleaguered but resourceful Odysseus, O Brother is a sepia-toned fantasia of throwaway jokes, slapstick, and killer bluegrass. In fact, the music proved popular enough to spawn a virtual cottage industry with multiple soundtracks, a documentary, and even a national tour. “The surprise is how much fruitful digression such plotlessness makes possible,” quipped Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star. “With no particular place to go, this hobo of a movie is free to roam the damnedest places.”Watch TrailerNo Country for Old Men (2007)  93%Though the Coens have long been revered for their intermittently manic and macabre storylines, they’ve never made Oscar bait. It’s perhaps logical, then, that the massive Academy sweep they enjoyed with No Country for Old Men seemed like overdue praise. In No Country, based on the stoic anti-western novel by Cormack McCarthy, Josh Brolin’s protagonist sees a way out of his trailer in a bag of bloodied bills. Chance and destiny are invoked in the most resonant, least pretentious way in the sinister form of Anton Chigurh (Best Supporting Actor Javier Bardem), the hit man who coldly and relentlessly hunts Brolin’s Llewelyn. No Country is impeccable: the cinematography is breathtaking, the dialogue efficient, and the direction assured. Yet instead of the terse comic punch we’ve come to expect from the Coens, No Country takes a more dangerous tack with its morbid themes. With all the cards (and coins) falling tidily into place, this film presented the brothers as a truly mature filmmaking team, possibly at the peak of their careers — a sentiment echoed by Peter Keough of the Boston Phoenix, who proclaimed, “No Country for Old Men is the brothers at their most polished, austere, and humorless.”Watch TrailerTrue Grit (2010)  95%It takes some major stones to step into John Wayne’s boots for a remake of one of the Duke’s classic pictures, so even if the Coen brothers’ True Grit&nbsp;had well and truly stunk, we’d have to give their version credit for having something extra in its saddlebag — namely Jeff Bridges, who took the role of the cantankerous Rooster Cogburn and made it his own. Of course, it didn’t hurt that Bridges (in vintage late-period marble-mouthed form) was surrounded by an ace supporting cast that included Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld, or that the Coens went back to Charles Portis’ original novel for inspiration; in the end, the result was a career-launching hit for Steinfeld, a mainstream hit for the Coens, and another critically acclaimed outing for Bridges — all of whom earned Oscar nominations for their work. As Claudia Puig observed for USA Today, “Joel and Ethan Coen have pulled off an impressive feat: repurposing a classic film with their idiosyncratic blend of dark, deadpan humor and palpable suspense, while remaining ultra-faithful to the novel.”Watch TrailerInside Llewyn Davis (2013)  92%A brilliantly cast ensemble period drama shot through with pitch-black, borderline misanthropic humor and topped off with a killer soundtrack, Inside Llewyn Davis&nbsp;checks off any number of the boxes filmgoers have learned to associate with the Coen brothers, so it’s very much to the film’s credit that it somehow manages to feel fresh anyway. This is due in no small part to the work of Oscar Isaac, who plays the titular struggling folk musician with an utter lack of vanity while infusing the character with enough essential humanity to temper his overall lack of likability — and to the Coens’ screenplay, which serves as a savagely honest, yet ultimately affectionate, look at the self-delusional struggle for artistic purity as a means to its own end. “It may be the Coen Brothers playing well inside their comfort zone,” wrote Scott Mendelson for Forbes, “but what a fine and thoughtful comfort zone it is.”Watch Trailer","section":"Total Recall","tags":"on, Book","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"definitive-coen-brothers-movies"},{"id":"47508989022821","title":"Total Recall: James Cameron Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: James Cameron MoviesWe take a look at the career of the visionary director of Avatar.by Jeff Giles | December 16, 2009 |  CommentsHe got his start as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios, and promptly went on to establish himself as one of the biggest directors in Hollywood — both in terms of his staggering box office grosses ($3.5 billion worldwide and counting) and his seemingly limitless appetite for epic storytelling. Like a lot of filmmakers, James Cameron‘s imagination has often outpaced the available technology — but unlike most of his peers, when confronted with those limits, he simply spurs the invention of new technology to get around them. Cameron’s latest effort, Avatar, required the development of a whole new 3-D camera, and rode the bleeding edge of CGI’s outer limits. After years of buildup, Avatar is finally here — but before we witness what’s being hyped as the future of filmmaking, why don’t we look back at James Cameron’s past?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1019549[/tomatometer]9. Piranha II: The SpawningSay what you will about low-budget horror movies, but they’ve proven themselves to be a strangely fertile breeding ground for future stars — from Jennifer Aniston in Leprechaun to Kevin Bacon in Friday the 13th and Johnny Depp in A Nightmare on Elm Street, countless young Hollywood professionals have paid their rent by toughing it out in a low-budget slasher. Few success stories have had humbler beginnings than James Cameron’s, however — the Roger Corman graduate was promoted from special effects on Piranha II after the original director took a hike. To Cameron’s chagrin, the promotion was largely ceremonial; he ultimately wasn’t even allowed to see his own footage, and according to legend, he broke into the studio’s editing facility to try and create his own cut of the film. Though it’s tempting to wonder what a Piranha II director’s cut would look like, it’s hard to imagine any amount of editing making an appreciable difference in the overwhelmingly negative critical reaction; Empire’s Kim Newman offered one of the kindest reviews, gently dismissing it after the fact as “for curious completists only.” To his credit, Cameron has shown a sense of humor about the whole thing, referring to Piranha II as “the finest flying killer fish horror/comedy ever made.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1053568[/tomatometer]8. True LiesCameron closed out a decade as one of America’s preeminent action directors with True Lies, a reunion with Arnold Schwarzenegger (who starred as double life-leading secret agent Harry Tasker) and Brad Fiedel (who provided the score, as he had for the Terminator films). The death knell had sounded for the big, dumb 1980s action movie with 1992’s prophetically titled The Last Action Hero — which, fittingly, also starred Schwarzenegger — but Cameron helped revitalize the genre with a light, funny, fast-moving thrill ride that boasted likable performances from not only its well-muscled star, but a crackerjack supporting cast that included Jamie Lee Curtis, Bill Paxton, and Tom Arnold at his funniest. (Yeah, yeah, we know — insert your favorite Tom Arnold insult here.) Though it was heavily criticized for being misogynist and racist, True Lies combined with Speed to make the summer of 1994 feel a little like the 1980s never ended, and took Cameron’s reign as a Hollywood action king to its logical conclusion. Three years later, he’d resurface with the ultimate chick flick of the decade — but in the meantime, he was still earning the begrudging praise of critics like the Globe and Mail’s Rick Groen, who wrote, “However high your ranking on the culture scale, I defy you to watch this and leave the theatre without a whistled ‘Wow’ followed by a grudging ‘That’s entertainment.'”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1121658[/tomatometer]7. Ghosts of the AbyssWhat originally drew James Cameron to Titanic wasn’t the chance to tell the story of the most famous shipwreck in American history — it was the opportunity to take a diving tour of the real-life wreckage. And since Cameron never does anything small, the end result was not just another movie, but a 3-D documentary — Disney’s first! — filmed with specially created cameras and beefed up with nifty CGI that let the audience see what the ship might have looked like during its seafaring days. Presented in IMAX 3-D, Ghosts of the Abyss functioned as a sort of delayed footnote to Titanic, albeit one with plenty of the sort of gee-whiz special effects Cameron would eventually use to create Avatar — and for some critics, that footnote was even more compelling than the main article. As Jeff Vice of Salt Lake City’s Deseret News wrote, “When James Cameron got a second chance to make a Titanic movie, he actually managed to make a better one.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1082487[/tomatometer]6. TitanicYes, it’s over three hours long, and yes, royalties from its soundtrack will keep future generations of Celine Dion’s family comfortably ensconced in gated communities for centuries to come — but don’t believe the post-backlash conventional wisdom that says James Cameron’s Titanic is a watery, overlong mess that only sentimental saps ever really liked. That’s just the backlash talking, and for proof, just look at the staggering $1.8 billion it grossed — Titanic was one of the last truly unifying pop culture phenomena, the Thriller of 1990s films. (Which sort of makes Billy Zane the filmic equivalent of “The Girl Is Mine,” but we digress.) Such great rewards didn’t come without equally impressive risks; at the time, Titanic was the most expensive movie ever made, and its astronomical $200 million budget, coupled with post-production delays that bumped the film’s release date back by almost six months, had many people predicting a Heaven’s Gate-style disaster. The rest, as they say, was history; commercial kudos aside, Titanic won 11 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and made Cameron enough money to keep him from working another day in his life. It was so unavoidably huge that it’s easy to understand why it became hip to dismiss the (first) movie that gave us Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio as young lovers on the brink of certain doom, but its 82 percent Tomatometer doesn’t lie — and neither did Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile when he wrote, “You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1141713[/tomatometer]5. Aliens of the DeepTwo years after taking audiences on a deep sea expedition with Ghosts of the Abyss, Cameron dove even further for Aliens of the Deep. As with Ghosts, he used 3-D technology to take audiences on his journey — but this time, instead of exploring a sunken ship, he ventured to the hydrothermal vents of the Mid-Ocean Range, where an otherworldly ecosystem (hence the film’s title) supports a variety of unusual organisms. Part of a three-dimensional holding pattern between madly hyped tentpole features? Perhaps. But as David Hiltbrand of the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, “The experience is so immediate and immersive that you actually feel as if you are swimming with the krill.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000211[/tomatometer]4. The AbyssCameron had to spearhead the invention of a new type of 3-D camera before he could get Avatar off the ground, but he was no stranger to breaking the limits of technology to bring his vision to life: 1989’s underwater epic The Abyss required the construction of the world’s biggest tank of filtered fresh water, as well as newly designed watertight cameras and bleeding-edge special effects work from Industrial Light &amp; Magic. It also required a lot of patience on the part of its cast (including Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Ed Harris, both of whom suffered emotional breakdowns during the grueling six-month shoot) and crew (including Cameron himself, who spent hours at a time under 50 feet of water) — and the studio had its own cross to bear, enduring millions of dollars in cost overruns and weeks of delays. In the end, The Abyss wasn’t as profitable as Cameron’s other epics, only bringing in around $90 million against a $70 million budget, but critics were generally kind, particularly to the longer version that eventually surfaced on home video (Widgett Walls of Needcoffee.com called the theatrical release “an abomination” and wrote, “For God’s sake, make sure you have the director’s cut”). And perhaps more importantly, all that mucking around with wet stuff helped prepare Cameron for a certain movie about an ocean liner hitting an iceberg.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1035641[/tomatometer]3. Terminator 2: Judgment DayMore often than not, if it takes seven years to put together the sequel to a hit movie, disappointment is just around the corner. In the case of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, however, the prolonged delay worked to everyone’s advantage: James Cameron, a relative newcomer when The Terminator was filmed, had spent the intervening years turning himself into one of Hollywood’s biggest directors, and one of the few filmmakers with enough clout to secure the $102 million budget necessary to pay for both Arnold Schwarzenegger and the super-cool special effects that turned Robert Patrick into a puddle of molten metal. It was money well spent, as T2‘s eventual $519 million worldwide gross proved; in fact, despite its slightly lower Tomatometer rating, many fans believe the second Terminator is superior to the original. If you enjoy movies and shows like ABC’s Lost, in which white-knuckle action and impossibly trippy sci-fi storylines somehow manage to coexist, thank James Cameron for Terminator 2, because this is one of the best examples of how to do it right. In the words of Newsweek’s David Ansen, “For all its state-of-the-art pyrotechnics and breathtaking thrills, this bruisingly exciting movie never loses sight of its humanity. That’s its point, and its pride.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021061[/tomatometer]2. The TerminatorTalk about your abrupt turnarounds: just a few years after suffering through Piranha II, Cameron convinced Orion Pictures to take a chance on his idea for a sci-fi action film about a time-traveling cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) on a mission to kill the mother (Linda Hamilton) of a 21st century freedom fighter before she can get it on with her predestined baby daddy (Michael Biehn). Unlike its ever-expanding pack of sequels and spinoffs, 1984’s The Terminator was a low-budget affair, going from set to screen for a paltry $6.5 million — and it promptly turned around and grossed more than $75 million, launching a franchise that has gone on to outlast Cameron’s involvement (much to the chagrin of many fans). Even though The Terminator‘s budgetary constraints occasionally show up onscreen, it’s still easy to see why it was so successful — not only is it one of the most purely entertaining popcorn flicks of the decade, this was the role Schwarzenegger was born to play. “I remain perpetually amazed by how magnificently Cameron keeps the tension up,” wrote Antagony &amp; Ecstasy’s Tim Brayton, adding, “there is not a single moment that isn’t operating at 100 percent.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000617[/tomatometer]1. AliensMore than a decade before he stood in front of an international audience and proclaimed himself the king of the world, James Cameron demonstrated his healthy reserves of chutzpah by approaching Fox about taking the reins on a sequel to Ridley Scott’s Alien. Unlike Piranha II, Cameron’s proposed Aliens would be following up a certified classic — and one that many viewers would have been happy to leave sequel-free. Fox wasn’t particularly eager to revisit Alien either, at least initially; first, the studio expressed doubt as to whether there was really an audience for another installment, and then a pay dispute with Sigourney Weaver threatened to derail the whole thing. Even when Aliens started to roll, the obstacles kept coming — Cameron’s difficulties with his uncooperative crew are the stuff of legend — but by the time the sequel reached audiences and returned more than $130 million on the studio’s $18.5 million investment, not to mention seven Academy Award nominations, it was pretty clear Cameron had known what he was doing all along. At 100 percent on the Tomatometer, Aliens has earned plenty of praise from top critics like Walter Goodman of the New York Times, who called it “A flaming, flashing, crashing, crackling blow-’em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics.”In case you were wondering, here are Cameron’s top ten movies according RT users’ scores:1. Terminator 2: Judgment Day — 96%2. Aliens — 96%3. The Terminator — 95%4. The Abyss — 90%5. True Lies — 85%6. Titanic — 81%7. Ghosts of the Abyss — 72%8. Aliens of the Deep — 60%9.

But some of Hollywood’s most memorable tots have also done the darndest things, and by “darndest” we mean “illegal, immoral, and downright terrifying.” This week’s Orphan — starring the undoubtedly sweet-in-real-life Isabelle Fuhrman as an adoptee lacking in the sugar, spice, and/or everything nice department — adds to the rich cinematic legacy of kids behaving badly, so we thought now would be an excellent time to take a look back at 15 of the creepiest youngsters in film.With such a deep pool of junior misanthropists to draw from, we’ve undoubtedly left some of your favorites off the list — such as the pants-wettingly menacing twins from The Shining, whose awful, awful chorus of “come play with us forever” would have been enough to vault them near the head of the class if they hadn’t been, you know, dead when they uttered it. But even sticking solely with the realm of the living, we’ve been able to assemble quite the rogue’s gallery for you, encompassing tiny terrors both well-remembered (Samara from The Ring) and not (the bloodthirsty infant immortalized in Larry Cohen’s It’s Alive). They come from films with wildly divergent Tomatometers, but they all have one thing in common: You wouldn’t want to babysit them. Time for Total Recall![tomatometer]MuzeID=1192404[/tomatometer]15. Ronnie Shields (Role Models)Compared to a lot of other kids on this list, Role Models‘ Ronnie Shields (Bobb’e J. Thompson) is relatively benign — rather than a genuine troublemaker, he’s really just a kid who desperately needs a father figure, and who has the misfortune of being saddled with an unrepentant skirt-chaser like Anson Wheeler (Seann William Scott) instead. Still, Ronnie deserves inclusion here, if for no other reason than the times he hauls off and slaps Wheeler in his smug face. Every actor worth his salt has a unique specialty, and Scott’s is playing characters who really need to get what’s coming to them; Thompson’s on the other hand, is apparently playing pint-sized, foul-mouthed terrors who are only too happy to deliver said comeuppances. Let’s dance, Ben Affleck![tomatometer]MuzeID=1021802[/tomatometer]14. Eric Bates (The Toy)Spoiling a child, while it may make you feel like a better parent in the short term, rarely produces desirable results in the long run. Case in point: “Master” Eric Bates, the unbelievably obnoxious young heir of multi-mega magnate U.S. Bates (Jackie Gleason). Played memorably by cinematic 1980s wonder brat Scott Schwartz, little Eric is so accustomed to getting everything he wants from his father that he actually demands to have — and gets — ownership of a person (played by a perfectly incredulous Richard Pryor). Of course, his plans for his new toy aren’t completely benign; he plays a series of pranks on his poor houseguest (including tricking him into getting nibbled by piranhas) before recruiting him to help expose the elder Bates’ unsavory business practices. See, parents? Give your kids whatever they want, and eventually they might just end up coming after you.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1023730[/tomatometer]13. Veruca Salt (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory/ Charlie and the Chocolate Factory )A girl whose bad behavior was so legendary that her name was taken by a female-fronted, punk-pop-playing alternative rock band in the 1990s, Veruca Salt has made her way to the big screen twice — and both times, her epic selfishness and greed have sent her plummeting to her apparent doom at the bottom of a garbage incinerator, although not before she wreaked havoc on the lives of everyone in her immediate vicinity. She may not have had the homicidal urges indulged by many of her peers on this list, but with virtually unlimited wealth and astonishingly indulgent parents on her side, there’s no telling how Veruca might have ended up had she not made the mistake of angering a room full of Oompa Loompas.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1040544[/tomatometer]12. Bébé’s Kids (Bébé’s Kids)Any baby who speaks with Tone-Loc’s voice has got to be trouble, and Pee-Wee — the diaper-wearing youngest of Bébé’s Kids — is no exception. In fact, the closing moments of this animated cult classic capture the incorrigible toddler as he sends the entire city of Las Vegas plummeting into a blackout. (It’s sort of the city’s fault, relying on a single plug for all of its power, but still — naughty Pee-Wee.) The two elder Kids aren’t any better; in fact, over the course of the film, the clan manages to essentially destroy an entire amusement park as they repeatedly foil the efforts of their unwilling temporary guardian (a character inspired, like the rest, by the late comedian Robin Harris) to find someone who doesn’t scream “Run! It’s Bébé’s Kids!” when they come into view.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1029776[/tomatometer]11. Junior (Problem Child)Adopting a child is inarguably one of the most noble things a person can do, and there are never enough prospective parents to match the number of kids who need a loving home — which is why 1990’s Problem Child was doubtless greeted with gasps of horror and revulsion at orphanages all over the world when it arrived in theaters. Despite giving the appearance of an innocent redheaded boy with an adorably grown-up fashion sense, little Junior (Michael Oliver) quickly revealed himself to be a pint-sized psychopath whose penchant for bowties is actually a sartorial tribute to a notorious serial killer. In the end, the movie’s biggest lesson may have been that you should never hire an adoption agent who sounds like Gilbert Gottfried — or it might simply have been that audiences like watching parents suffer on the big screen, because Problem Child did well enough to justify a pair of sequels. (Bonus fun fact: Oliver’s mom-slash-manager was sued by Universal after Problem Child 2 wrapped, in a lawsuit — which the studio eventually won — alleging she extorted a raise for her son. Life imitates art!)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1003127[/tomatometer]10. The Brood (The Brood)Distrust the psychiatric profession? You’ll get a bloody kick out of David Cronenberg’s The Brood, in which a nutball psychotherapist (played to the hilt by Oliver Reed) invents a technique, called “psychoplasmics,” which allows patients to turn their negative emotions into fun stuff like bruises, cancer, or — in the case of one particularly troubled young woman — a pack of fast-growing, bloodthirsty mutants with a bizarre psychic connection to their mother. It may not have been quite the “film so terrifying it will devastate you totally” that the filmmakers advertised, but as with any Cronenberg joint worth its salt, it still contains plenty of hands-over-eyes moments (or, in the case of the infamous afterbirth scene, hand-over-mouth). Released 30 years ago, The Brood had an ending that would have led beautifully into a sequel. Perhaps it’s time, Mr. Cronenberg?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1045995[/tomatometer]9. Henry Evans (The Good Son)If, at any point in the late 1980s or early 1990s, you ever looked at Macaulay Culkin and thought, “That kid seriously weirds me out,” then 1993’s The Good Son was pretty much made for you. Culkin stars here as Henry, the innocent-seeming 12-year-old who helps his cousin Mark (Elijah Wood) cope with the grief of his mother’s death by introducing him to a wide variety of sociopathic activities, including using a crossbow to murder the neighbor’s dog and tossing a dummy over a freeway overpass to cause a huge accident. Though the adults in their lives initially dismiss Mark’s panicked warnings as delusional, the creepy depths of Henry’s personality are eventually discovered by Henry’s mom — who narrowly avoids taking a son-assisted plunge off a cliff for her trouble. If you’ve been under the mistaken impression that The Nutcracker was the most messed-up thing Culkin had done onscreen, you need to see him in action here.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016183[/tomatometer]8. Gage Creed (Pet Sematary)Like most parents, Stephen King has suffered moments when he thought his children’s lives were in danger; unlike most of them, however, he used that fear as the inspiration for Pet Sematary, the story of an Indian burial ground with the power to resurrect dead loved ones…sort of, anyway. Being brought back to life has a tendency to disagree with people, as grieving father Louis Creed discovers after he digs up the corpse of his young son Gage and moves it to the burial ground: Gage comes back with a nasty sense of humor and a thirst for blood that forces Louis to employ some rather strict disciplinary measures. Not that the kid didn’t have it coming, given that he’d just murdered his mother and the kindly old next-door neighbor. Toddlers are adorable, even when they’re getting into trouble…but undead toddlers who reek of dirt, practice matricide, and mutilate the elderly? They’re just plain scary.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1010793[/tomatometer]7. The Davis’ Baby (It’s Alive)Thinking of taking fertility drugs, ladies? You might want to check in with producer/director/writer Larry Cohen first. Cohen, the mastermind behind the 1974 cult classic It’s Alive, wondered what might happen if a mother went from taking the pill to using baby-makin’ medicine — and the result was the seemingly indestructible little maniac that inspired the tagline “There’s only one thing wrong with the Davis baby…IT’S ALIVE.” Though initially a flop, Cohen’s tale of a shrieking, sewer-crawling infant that kicks off its killing spree immediately after being born became a surprise hit three years later. Cohen, no dummy, went on to release a pair of sequels: 1978’s It Lives Again (“The It’s Alive baby is back…only now there are three of them”) and 1987’s too-good-to-be-true It’s Alive III: Island of the Alive (“They do something worse than kill. They multiply”). Sadly, the new Bijou Phillips-led remake is bypassing theaters and going directly to video, but that can’t take away from the original’s delightfully cheesy legacy.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1022823[/tomatometer]6. The Children of Midwich (Village of the Damned)Of all the things that have ever led human cultures to freak out about outsiders, “They’re after our women” is at or near the top of the list — a fear adroitly exploited by 1960’s Village of the Damned, in which every post-pubescent woman in the quaint British burg of Midwich is mysteriously impregnated by an unseen alien force. That’s freaky enough, but to make matters worse, the immaculately conceived progeny turn out to be a bunch of glowing-eyed freaks whose slightly bulbous heads house brains capable of reading minds, bending wills, and — according to the film’s haunting final shot — surviving an explosion strong enough to demolish a building. So great was the children’s power that they were able to force John Carpenter to direct a remake in 1995 that, despite the combined star power of Christopher Reeve, Kirstie Alley, and Mark Hammill, was unable to gross more than $9.5 million during its brief theatrical run. Terrifying![tomatometer]MuzeID=1001572[/tomatometer]5. Rhoda Penmark (The Bad Seed)One of cinema’s original junior sociopaths, little Rhoda Penmark delivered a resounding, pigtailed blow against the “nurture” side of the nature vs. nurture debate by using her peaceful, well-adjusted home life as a cover for cheerfully offing anyone unfortunate enough to get in her way — whether it’s the classmate who won the penmanship medal Rhoda wanted or the janitor who threatens to rat her out, no one was safe from her adorable blonde wrath. Eventually revealed as the granddaughter of a serial killer, Rhoda was allowed to survive in William March’s 1954 novel — an ending that wouldn’t have flown in the Hollywood of 1956, where the Hays Code convinced filmmakers it would be more appropriate to electrocute her with a lightning strike (and then haul her out for a spanking over the closing credits). Eli Roth briefly toyed with the idea of helming a Bad Seed remake, which surely would have dispensed with such prudish morality; alas, that idea seems to have gone the way of Rhoda’s poor victims.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1012710[/tomatometer]4. The Kids from Lord of the Flies (Lord of the Flies)We’ve all heard the expression “kids are animals” countless times, but few children have had the opportunity to prove it as spectacularly as the gang of plane crash survivors who turn from civilized British schoolboys (or, in the case of the 1990 remake, American military school students) into murderous, pig-decapitating goons who reward kindness with violence, prey on the weak, and basically pull off every rotten stunt you tried to get away with while the yard duty was distracted during recess in grade school. Though they aren’t as much fun as some of their counterparts on this list — swapping out sensationalistic violence for sociological subtext is such a buzzkill — they’re arguably the most important, as their id-feeding actions have reverberated in countless books, films, and television series.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1004047[/tomatometer]3. The Children of Gatlin (Children of the Corn)With all the movies his books have inspired, it’s somewhat surprising that the Stephen King story that’s spawned the most sequels (so far, anyway) is Children of the Corn. Culled from a 1978 short story, this 1984 feature, starring Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton, was critically derided and only a modest box office success — and yet it’s gone on to launch no fewer than six sequels, with a reboot reportedly on the way. Why, you ask? Simple: Few things in life are more horrifying than a town whose residents are all 18 or younger, especially if they happen to fancy using scythes and pray to a hulking demonic entity known only as He Who Walks Behind the Rows. It’s almost enough to make you want to check yourself into a retirement community, isn’t it?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1116705[/tomatometer]2. Samara Morgan (The Ring)So evil she started driving her mother insane while she was still in the womb, The Ring‘s Samara Morgan (or Sadako Yamamura, if you prefer the original Japanese films) makes up for her generally quiet demeanor with a battery of supernatural gifts that include the ability to murder via VHS, the ability to embark on a murderous rampage despite being entombed in a well, and the power to scare the bejeesus out of scores of American filmgoers simply by covering her face with her hair, lurching out of said well, and whispering “everyone will suffer.” Though apparently locked in her watery tomb for good at the end of 2005’s The Ring Two, Samara is set to reappear in The Ring Three in 2011. Throw out your VCRs![tomatometer]MuzeID=1015517[/tomatometer]1. Damien (The Omen)We have a lot of rotten kids on this list, but The Omen‘s Damien Thorn takes the cake, for two reasons: First, his cinematic reign of terror extended through two sequels and a 2006 remake; Second — and here’s the kicker — he’s the Antichrist. It bears mentioning that little Damien wasn’t really aware of his dark destiny as a child; many of the grisly deaths that befell his enemies in the first two installments of the trilogy were carried out on his behalf, either by unseen means (such as the nanny who rapturously hangs herself on Damien’s fifth birthday) or through various proxies (steel spikes, plates of glass, foul-tempered crows, et cetera). In fact, it isn’t until he’s 13 that Damien discovers he’s been branded by the Mark of the Beast — at which point, following a little soul-searching, he cheerfully assumes his birthright and grows up into Sam Neill (which sort of explains 1997’s Event Horizon). The franchise took an unfortunate detour into made-for-TV territory after its third chapter, but the remake’s $100 million-plus worldwide gross would seem to indicate that young Mr. Thorn may yet have a few filmic prophecies left to fulfill.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

For his 10th and latest movie, Ponyo (the story of an ocean goldfish and her quest to become human), Disney will be granting it a more confident, nationwide release this Friday. Frankly, the more opportunity America gets to see a Miyazaki movie, the better: they expertly breach multiple genres and fulfill the visual promise of hand-drawn animation. But they also feel deeply personal. Always directing from his own scripts, Miyazaki can take any story and mold it to his likeness, creating across 10 films a thematically consistent, rich and rewarding universe. This week’s Total Recall explores the career of Hayao Miyazaki, animation’s grand auteur.Howl's Moving Castle (2005)  87%The film begins with a meek hat girl falling in love with a charming wizard and then being transformed into an old woman by a jealous witch. This is Miyazaki’s lowest-rated movie (still insanely high at 86 percent), but let’s not think for a second he’s slipping in his late period. Howl’s Moving Castle is his most challenging work, a patient movie with a purposefully diffused narrative. Even if you’re confused by the plot (and it gets pretty weird in spots), it can be enjoyed for its stunningly baroque artwork and playful sense of mystery and wonder. Richard Nilsen of the Arizona Republic was bewitched: “The world it gives us to live in, for a couple of hours, is pure magic. It is one of those places we might wish never to leave.”Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro (Rupan sansei: Kariosutoro no shiro) (1979)  95%The first film in Miyazaki’s three-decade career, The Castle of Cagliostro is essentially a genre movie, an action/noir set in the canon of the long-running manga and anime series, Lupin the III. Miyazaki recreates the hero as a more humane, sympathetic thief than previous incarnations, while retrofitting the film with his more tactile interests: European architecture and creative flying vehicles. And like most genre flicks, production time was extremely limited (only four months!); it uses rough-edged animation that makes the action feel raw and kinetic, with a plot that breathlessly bounds forward. As Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central puts it, Cagliostro is “a light, irreverent slapstick exercise with a healthy share of nifty gadgets and derring-do.”My Neighbor Totoro (1988)  94%Two young girls are transported to the countryside to be closer to their sick, hospitalized mother, and while there they meet several fantastical woodland spirits. And that’s about it. In My Neighbor Totoro, Miyazaki frees himself from the heavy plotting presumed necessary to hold children’s attention. Instead, he enthralls viewers young and old animating the smaller moments of everyday life, hoping the audience shares his (and his two protagonists’) curiosity in exploring their world. Most movies don’t treat adults with this much respect; seeing it in a movie designed for kids is simply remarkable. Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures calls it “a warm and friendly story that just made me feel good after watching it.”Castle in the Sky (1989)  96%Castle in the Sky is set on an alternative version of Earth where all of mankind’s cities once were skybound and have long since crashed to Earth. Save for one: Laputa. Its existence has entered into legend but a young boy continues to believe and his encounters a girl with a mysterious crystal sends them both onto an adventure towards its location. Light in theme and symbolism compared to Miyazaki’s other movies, Castle in the Sky is his most accessible effort: a nimble, entertaining piece of work pieced together with the manic energy of a Saturday morning serial. Channel 4 agrees: “Miyazaki’s flying contraptions are a sight to behold, rivaled only by the film’s epic sweep and nonstop parade of action set-pieces.”Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) (1999)  93%A cursed warrior-prince falls in love with a girl raised by wolves who has vowed to protect her forest (and the spirits within) from a local mining colony. After a long string of lighter fare in the mid 1980s and early 1990s, Miyazaki comes roaring back with Princess Mononoke: a startlingly violent, angry treatise on Miyazaki’s strongest obsession (man’s effect on natural ecology), with a finale that borders on pessimistic. If Terrence Malick and John Woo combined forces to make a cartoon, you’d get something like this. “It’s big and breathtaking, and it knows how to use music and silence in enthralling ways that make the characters in our animated films seem like empty-headed chatterboxes,” states Peter Brunette of Film.com.Spirited Away (2002)  97%Having explored virtually every timeless aspect of youth across his long career, for Oscar-winning Spirited Away, Miyazaki tackles a contemporary dilemma: early disillusionment and cynicism. A spoiled ten-year old girl is transported out of modern Japan, into a bathhouse that hosts a revolving number of spirits and monsters where she must pass several tests in order to return home. Every moment in the bathhouse teems with detail and characters, representing stunning visual maturation for Miyazaki that he would carry over into Howl’s Moving Castle. Spirited Away “is a trip, in the literal, metaphorical and indeed lysergic senses of that word” states Salon’s Andrew O’Hehir.Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Kaze no tani no Naushika) (1985)  89%Upon release, Miyazaki’s second film was infamously chopped up, dubbed, and renamed Warriors of the Wind. It’s become widely available within the past few years and now we can see it for what it was meant to be: a big, imaginative epic, and an early catch-all for Miyazaki’s primary concerns (pacifism, nature, sweeping action, and deeply-characterized female heroes). It’s remarkable that he was able to pin down his general M.O. by the time of his sophomore effort, with the 1980s aesthetic (parts look like Yes album covers) giving the film a stark, ominous presence. Nausicaa “is in some ways a grim and serious film, but it mixes a sweet optimism into its horror-filled lessons,” wrote Tasha Robinson of the A.V. Club.Porco Rosso (Kurenai no buta) (1992)  95%Miyazaki’s most romantic movie stars his most decidedly unromantic hero: an Italian Air Force pilot transformed into a cynical anthropomorphic pig. Porco Rosso hangs out inside a remote island in the Adriatic Sea, scuffles with local pirates, and discusses life and love with his would-be romantic interest, a lounge singer named Gina. Set during the years after World War I, Porco Rosso is Miyazaki’s soaring tribute to that period’s adventurous spirit: aerial battles, submarine shootouts, honor-saving duels and fistfights. And it’s his funniest movie to boot. “Animator/fabulist Hayao Miyazaki pays homage to Hollywood’s wartime adventure films in this masterwork built around the adventures of a high-flying pig,” writes Robert Pardi over at TV Guide.Kiki's Delivery Service (1989)  98%In the world of Miyazaki’s fifth film, witches are real and, at age 13, they ceremoniously leave home to find a town unoccupied by another witch. Teenage witch Kiki, cheery if insecure, settles seaside in a city called Koriko and begins an air courier service. The film is beloved for its warm characters and metaphors on growing up (adolescence drains Kiki of her powers, and it’s a test of courage and faith to get them back), but extra praise should be lavished on its design. Koriko is a lively, bustling amalgamation of several European locations, effectively creating a city as a secondary character. James O’ Ehley, one of the Movie Gurus, muses, “With so much nasty and unpleasant stuff floating around in contemporary culture, something as good-natured as this comes as a surprise.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"comic, winner, SundanceTV, Cartoon, TruTV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-hayao-miyazakis-best-movies"},{"id":"47508990136948","title":"Total Recall: Brad Pitt’s Best Movies","content":"(Photo by Sony Pictures/Everett Collection)All&nbsp;Brad Pitt Movies RankedEveryone knows about an early Brad Pitt appearance as the stoner roommate in True Romance, and you might think he spent his formative Hollywood years building a resume of such goofy, secondary parts. But that movie came out in 1993. By 1991 (the same year he played the hitchhiker in Thelma &amp; Louise), he was already the title lead in Johnny Suede. Guess you just couldn’t keep those looks off-camera;&nbsp;True Romance just showed Pitt could deliver laughs to go with them.The year after, it was truly off the races, with the 1994 double-whammy of Interview with the Vampire and Legends of the Fall. And 1995 saw him in classics of their respective genre: 12 Monkeys and Seven. Then&nbsp;Pitt closed out the decade by re-teaming with Seven director David Fincher for Fight Club, and all of a sudden a lot more dudes were putting posters of him up on their walls.Obviously, Pitt knows a good friendship when he sees one, as some of his best work since has been in the hands of people’s he’s worked with before. He gotten together with Fincher another time for Curious Case of Benjamin Button; with Steven Soderbergh, he’s made three Ocean’s movies.Recently, he’s drawn high critical marks for Ad Astra and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. He currently has projects in the works with directors Damien Chazelle and David Leitch, but those films are still years off.

That got us at RT thinking about movie robots, and specifically, what would be the best robot to actually own? So we’ve put together a pretty big list of the best robots in movie history.A quick note on our methodology; for the most part, we’re sticking to movie robots, so TV stars like Twiki that never made the jump to the big screen are left in the scrap pile. And we’ve ranked this list by a very subjective measurement we call “awesomeness,” which is combination of fame, utility, physical appearance, and how great it would be to have one of these ‘bots in your possession. So without further ado, let’s get mechanical!50. BoxAppears in: Logan’s RunBox is pretty handy; running a fish farm means he can supply a whole city with food, but he still finds time to dispose of pesky teenagers.49. DavidAppears in: A.I. Artificial IntelligenceSome robots are shiny, some are fearsome, some have wheels, and some, like David, are basically teddy bears. David’s whole purpose is to actually feel love for an owner, which is both groundbreaking and extremely creepy.48. HectorAppears in: Saturn 3Part of the Demi-God series, Hector has the potential to render a space station crew obsolete. Although it’s unfortunate that his reprogramming results in Hector deciding that “obsolete” equals “needs to die.”47. D.A.R.Y.L. (Data-Analysing Robot Youth Lifeform)Appears in: D.A.R.Y.L.Another example of the “boy robot,” D.A.R.Y.L. beats David from A.I. by being able to drive a car and fly a plane, important skills he learned from playing video games.46. Huey, Dewey, and LouieAppears in: Silent RunningThese agrobots were excellent gardners, and (more importantly) served as the primary visual influence on the legendary R2-D2. Think of them as R2’s long-lost uncles.45. U.S. Robotics model NS-5 “Sonny”Appears in: I, RobotThe NS-5s are pretty advanced, and they look very slick (not unlike what you might see in a Bjork video). Sadly, the entire model line loses points because of an unfortunate tendency to kill humans as part of an effort to “protect” us from ourselves. They also lose points for being in a Rotten adaptation of one of sci-fi master Isaac Asimov’s seminal works.44. NDR-113 “Andrew”Appears in: Bicentennial ManAndrew is another Asimov creation, a household servant android that develops a personality and eventually desires to become human. The Pinocchio trope (the desire to become a “real” person) is something that comes up a lot in robot stories, and Asmiov’s original material won a Hugo award. But like Sonny, Andrew loses points for being in a Rotten adaptation, although we won’t penalize him for deciding to look like Robin Williams.43. Stepford WivesAppears in: The Stepford Wives (1975), The Stepford Wives (2004)This is what happens when scientists and technicians decide that they want perfect, traditional wives, free of all that pesky Women’s Lib nonsense. Fembots might seem like a good idea, but they’re no replacement for a real, adult relationship.42. Johnny CabAppears in: Total RecallA self-driving car! With a snappy personality! How awesome is that? Johnny’s got a lot of potential, but ultimately falls short of greatness; he’s installed in a pretty weak car, he’s not much of a getaway driver, and leaving without paying means he’ll explode.41. Cylon CenturionsAppears in: Battlestar GalacticaYes, they’re basically Stormtrooper knockoffs. Yes, they were on TV. But there was a theatrical release of Battlestar Galactica. And even though they’re basically cannon fodder, slick chrome armor and cool voices (the pinnacle of ’70s audio technology) definitely earn a place on this list.40. JinxAppears in: Space CampJinx was something that NASA developed for exploration, but never seemed to work right. That is, until his friend Max wants to go to space — Jinx simply hacks into the NASA system, resulting in a Space Shuttle launch. Take that, Mitnick!39. Tik TokAppears in: Return to OzTik Tok is one of Dorothy’s faithful companions in the magical land of Oz. He’s not electronic per se, but he is entirely mechanical (unlike that Tin Man poser).38. AMEEAppears in: Red PlanetAMEE would be very handy to have on a Mars exploration mission, but loses points for her original military programming that turns her into a deathbot.37. SID 6.7Appears in: VirtuositySID is orginally a computer program used to study the minds of serial killers. So of course he’s going to get an electronic body. SID gets points for being a snappy dresser and looking like Russell Crowe, but loses points for being a psychotic killer.36. Police RobotsAppears in: THX 1138The cops in THX 1138 are faceless drones, reflective of the general paranoia towards authority in the ’70s. But they have nifty chrome faceplates, so that counts for something, right? We’ll see this idea come up again for George Lucas with the creation of the Imperial Stormtroopers in Star Wars.35. Johnny 5Appears in: Short Circuit, Short Circuit 2Originally a military prototype, Johnny 5 was struck by lightning, rendering him self-aware. Ultimately, he’s pretty silly (and downright annoying at times), but he earns points for a good design and surprising utility; how many robots can make miniature versions of themselves?34. ED-209Appears in: RobocopED-209 was the original future of law enforcement. He’s extremely intimidating, with a deep, commanding voice and dual machine guns on each arm. Unfortunately, he loses points for a regrettable tendency to kill executives and not being able to walk down stairs.33. AshAppears in: AlienFooling all of his crewmates into thinking he’s human until his head is knocked off earns Ash a decent spot on this list. But letting those same crewmates serve as bait for a bloodthirsty alien definitely costs him points on the “must own” scale.32. FembotsAppears in: Austin Powers: International Man of MysteryBlonde hair and baby-doll lingerie? Robots don’t get much sexier than this. Those breast-mounted machine guns are bit of a buzzkill though…31. CallAppears in: Alien: ResurrectionOne of the late-generation androids in the Alien universe, Call is another ‘bot that successfully fools her crewmates into thinking she’s a real human. Call also gets bonus points for looking like Winona Ryder.30. Ro-ManAppears in: Robot MonsterIt’s a guy in a gorilla suit with a robot head! That’s 10 kinds of awesome!29. GortAppears in: The Day the Earth Stood StillOne of the most iconic robots in classic sci-fi movies, Gort is the original gangster destructo-bot. He’s totally indestructible, and his laser eye is unstoppable. When little Terminators and Battle Droids are asked what they want to be when they grow up, the answer is always the same: Gort.28. Robby the RobotAppears in: Forbidden PlanetRobby is another icon of classic sci-fi. After his debut in Forbidden Planet, Robby went on to star in dozens of movies and TV shows. He’s also the older brother of sorts to the robot on Lost in Space27. MaximillianAppears in: The Black HoleMaximillian is one of the coolest-looking robots ever to menace humans in the movies. From his blood red paint job to his fearsome red optical sensor, Maximillian looks like a demon wrapped in electronics and metal. He loses points for going to Hell at the end of the movie, though.26. V.I.N.CentAppears in: The Black HoleV.I.N.Cent isn’t as intimidating as Maximillian, and that schoolteacher tone is a little irritating (paging C-3PO). But he gets major points for being able to fly, he’s a really good shot, and he’s the only telepathic robot on this list.25. DataAppears in: Star Trek: Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, Star Trek: NemesisSitting right in the center of this list is the one-of-a-kind android named Data. Ok, so he’s actually one of at least 3, but still, he’s pretty awesome in seven season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. But when he gets to the big screen, he’s just not as cool. Frankly, we liked him better without the emotion chip.24. T-XAppears in: Terminator 3: Rise of the MachinesThe T-X is one of the most advanced Terminator models; she can mimic other people like the T-1000, and she’s got some pretty impressive on-board weaponry. Plus, she looks like Kristanna Loken, which is always a plus. But the T-X gets docked major points for being taken out by an older, obsolete model 850 Terminator.23. Casella “Cash” ReeseAppears in: Cyborg 2We could talk about Cash being a super tough combat cyborg, but that’s beside the point. She makes the list for looking like Angelina Jolie.22. Evil Bill &amp; TedAppears in: Bill &amp; Ted’s Bogus JourneyEvil Bill &amp; Ted are evil, to be sure, but they’re still pretty funny in a Bill &amp; Ted doofus kind of way. And bonus points for killing the real Bill &amp; Ted at Vasquez Rocks, where Captain Kirk fought with a Gorn.21. Dot MatrixAppears in: SpaceballsDot is a satire of C-3PO, but don’t hold that against her. Voiced by Joan Rivers, Dot has some pretty standard shtick, but since this is Spaceballs, we’ll let it slide.20. C-3POAppears in: Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Clone WarsHe’s fluent in over 6 million forms of communication, but honestly, he’s really irritating. Although 3PO serves as a bit of comic relief in the Star Wars saga, and is actually useful at times, in reality, his incessant whining would get old pretty quickly. Bonus points for being an icon, but major penalties for being so annoying.19. The Iron GiantAppears in: The Iron GiantWhat do you do when a 50 foot robot crashes near your house? Make friends with it of course! The Iron Giant has a cool retro-future look, and a deep, gravelly voice (thanks to Vin Diesel), and he’s probably the single most powerful robot on this list.18. Marvin, the Paranoid AndroidAppears in: The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the GalaxyMarvin is likely the most intelligent robot on this list, and he won’t hesitate to tell you that. He’d probably then tell you why everything about this list is pointless, and then he’d wonder why he’s even bothering to tell you in the first place.17. The GunslingerAppears in: WestworldBefore Arnold Schwarzenegger played an unstoppable robot out for blood, there was Yul Brenner in Westworld. Brenner’s gunslinger is supposed to be a fun part of a futuristic robot theme park, but something goes wrong (as it always does), and this gunslinger decides he’s tired of letting the guests win the duels, and he’s packing live ammo to boot.16. BishopAppears in: Aliens, AliensEllen Ripley hates androids, and rightly so: an android betrayed her and her crew, making Ripley the only survivor of an alien attack. Bishop, on the other hand, is loyal, trustworthy, and capable, and can save lives even after being ripped in half.15. BuboAppears in: Clash of the TitansIn Clash of the Titans, Athena doesn’t want to give her pet owl to the hero Perseus, and so she asks Hephaestus to create this mechanical replacement. In reality, Bubo was created by legendary stop-motion animator Ray Harryhausen, making for an extremely impressive pedigree both on- and off-screen.14. MechagodzillaAppears in: Godzilla vs. MechagodzillaHow do you fight Godzilla? With a giant robot version! Being a robot version of the King of Monsters earns very high marks, and guarantees a pretty high spot on this list.13. MariaAppears in: MetropolisFirst! Maria is the first robot in the movies. She’s also a major influence on the look of C-3PO. Granted, she gets burned at the stake, but nobody’s perfect, right?12. Major KusanagiAppears in: Ghost in the ShellIn our opinion, Trinity from The Matrix owes more than a little bit to Major Kusanagi. They both wear tight clothes and they both are willing to jump through the windows of office towers.11. Tom Servo &amp; Crow T. RobotAppears in: Mystery Science Theater 3000: The MovieAnother couple of robots that are mostly known for their TV work, Tom and Crow did make one jump to the big screen. In terms of utility, they may not be that great, but these guys are two of the wittiest robots ever to appear in movies.10. EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator)Appears in: WALL-EEVE is a state of the art robot; she can fly at supersonic speeds, she’s packing some serious onboard weaponry, and she learns that there’s more to existence than just fulfilling her programming.9. Roy Batty (Nexus 6 Replicant)Appears in: Blade RunnerRoy is the pinnacle of the Nexus 6 line. Built for combat, he’s faster, stronger, and smarter. And although that ability comes with a hefty price (a very short life span), Roy learns to cherish all life at the end of his own.8. T-1000Appears in: Terminator 2: Judgment DayAfter the destruction of the original T-800 in the first Terminator film, James Cameron obviously felt that he needed to up the ante. Enter the T-1000. Made up of “liquid metal,” the T-1000 can perfectly mimic the size or shape of just about anything (or anyone) it touches. It’s mostly unstoppable, and one of the coolest robots on the list, but ultimately loses a few points for being taken down by an older model Terminator.7. HAL 9000Appears in: 2001: A Space OdysseyTechnically, HAL is a computer, and not a robot, but we’re willing to bend the rules for an icon like this. HAL is extremely intelligent, but has a bit of a breakdown, causing him to commit murder. Not Terminator-style mayhem mind you, but quiet, insidious murder, more suited to his calm, cool demeanor.6. RobocopAppears in: Robocop, Robocop 2, Robocop 3Robocop was built by Omni Consumer Products as the ultimate in law enforcement. Admittedly, he’s still partly human (a “creamy center” if you will), but he’s just entirely too awesome to leave off of this list.5. WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class)Appears in: WALL-EAs the last functioning garbage ‘bot on an abandoned Earth, WALL-E diligently continues his work, even though he’s evolved a personality. With personality comes loneliness, but also bravery and cleverness, and WALL-E ultimately proves that he’s much more than the sum of his programming. Bonus points for being really cute.4. Optimus PrimeAppears in: Transformers: The Movie (1986), Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the FallenIn an entire race made up of really impressive robots, Optimus Prime really stands out. He’s an icon of bravery, loyalty, and honor, and he’s a magnificent warrior. To be honest, Optimus had a shot at the top spot on the list, but giving him robot lips in the live-action films is just too much. Seriously Prime, you should have put your foot down there.3. Bender Bending RodriguezAppears in: Futurama: Bender’s Big Score, Futurama: Bender’s Game, Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs, Futurama: Into the Wild Green YonderHe drinks! He smokes! He’ll tell you to bite his shiny metal ass. He’s also hilarious, and arguably the best character on Futurama. While it was primarily a TV show, there are a few direct-to-DVD Futurama movies out there, and if we can’t bend the rules for Bender, what’s the world coming to? Besides, he threatened to pound us if we didn’t include him.2. T-800 (Model 101)Appears in: The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment DayThe T-800 is a legendary machine. Wrapped in an impressive Austrian bodybuilder physique, this robot absolutely will not stop until it either achieves its objective or is destroyed. Either way, expect blood and mayhem in pursuit of its goal. Bonus points for being able to learn, and use snappy phrases like “Hasta la vista, baby.”1. R2-D2Appears in: Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Clone WarsWe think R2-D2 is the greatest movie robot of all time for a few reasons. First of all, he’s as famous as any robot on this list; ask your grandmother who R2-D2 is, and she’ll know who you’re talking about. Secondly, when it comes to utility, it doesn’t get any better than this: if this little guy can repair starships, then he can do maintenance on your car in his sleep. Not only does he save just about everyone’s life at one point or another in the Star Wars movies, according to at least one person, he’s also one of the leaders of the rebel Alliance. He’s brave, clever, resourceful, and the best friend a young farm boy from Tatooine could ask for.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"criterion, dogs, golden, Sabrina, Arts, Polls, Endgame","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Best-Movie-Robots"},{"id":"47508990146169","title":"Total Recall: Best Movie Wizards","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Best Movie WizardsWith a new Harry Potter flick hitting theaters, we run down the best practitioners of cinematic sorcery.by RT Staff | July 16, 2009 |  CommentsClass is back in session at Hogwarts, with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince hitting screens this week. Since the academy is a place where young witches and wizards practice their craft, we at Rotten Tomatoes thought it would be a good time to count down some of the most spellbinding mystics who’ve ever graced the big screen. The entrants on our list of memorable movie wizards share many of the same attributes: musty spell books, magic wands, and unkempt beards, as well as prickly people skills and the ability to rouse the dead. However, they’ve also provided many a fantasy film with magical moments. Read on for a compendium of cinema’s finest sorcerers! (And don’t forget to check out all the reviews for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1004637[/tomatometer]10. Akiro (Conan the Barbarian)When we meet Akiro (Mako) in Conan the Barbarian, he’s not exactly on an upward trend, living a hermit-like existence and tending to an ancient cemetery. But when Conan happens by, the two of them become tight, which comes in handy later when Akiro is called upon to revive his muscle-bound pal from the dead. It’s a good career move; by the end of Conan the Destroyer, Akiro has a new gig as the chief wizard of Shadizar. In addition to sorcery, Akiro is a master in the mystical art of voiceover work, providing the narration for both Conan movies.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1014174[/tomatometer]9. Tim the Enchanter (Monty Python and the Holy Grail)Tim the Enchanter (John Cleese) may not be the kindliest of wizards, but he has several qualities that set him apart from the ranks of cinematic sorcerers. He has the ability to blow stuff up, which he utilizes liberally (he even has a flame-throwing staff!). He speaks theatrically and portentously in a thick Scottish brogue (“Death awaits you all… with nasty, big, pointy teeth!” goes a typical oratorical flourish). And he wears an awesome hat with rams’ horns on it. He also helps guide King Arthur and his men to the Cave of Caerbannog, dispensing fireballs along in all directions with little discipline, but Arthur and his men fail to heed Tim’s dire warnings about the cave’s seemingly innocuous defender — with tragic results. A word of advice, kids: when a wizard — no matter how gruff and ill-tempered — offers insider knowledge, you should probably listen up.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002365[/tomatometer]8. Lo-Pan (Big Trouble in Little China)Wizened and wheelchair-bound one minute, 10 feet tall and shooting laser beams out of his eyes the next, the ancient Chinese warlord Lo-Pan (James Hong) — a.k.a. David Lo-Pan, CEO of the Wing Kong Import-Export Trading Company — overcame a somewhat conflicted relationship with the mortal plane to wield a stack of fearsome powers that included a trio of weather-themed martial artists, championship-level hologram thumb-wrestling skills, and the ability to send people to the Hell of Upside-Down Sinners. He is also, so far as we know, the only wizard ever to utter the immortal words, “Now this really p—es me off to no end.” But the best thing about Lo-Pan has to be his raison d’être: For all his insults, kidnapping, and murdering, all he really wanted was a wife. Sure, he was a little picky — she had to have green eyes, a rather uncommon attribute in Chinese girls — but he kept trying for centuries, and who among us can’t respect that kind of tenacity?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1023728[/tomatometer]7. High Aldwin (Willow)Most of the wizards on our list either hold exalted positions on their local royal courts or act as magical free agents, but Willow‘s High Aldwin — played memorably by Hollywood legend Billy Barty — is a different breed of warlock, acting as a sort of mayor for the diminutive Nelwyns. Between his position as a beleaguered bureaucrat, his less-than-imposing stature, and the fact that his wizardry has more to do with an impressive gift for flimflam than anything truly magical, you might be tempted to dismiss the High Aldwin as an unworthy interloper on this list, but we ask you: Have you ever turned an apple into a bird, bossed an Ewok around, or determined which finger holds the power to control the universe? Didn’t think so.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1016744[/tomatometer]6. Miracle Max (The Princess Bride)Fast-talking Miracle Max (Billy Crystal) makes only a brief appearance in The Princess Bride when Fezzik and Inigo Montoya deposit an expired Westley at his doorstep. When we first meet him, it’s apparent Max is a slightly shifty old character with a prince-sized chip on his shoulder. He quickly informs Fezzik and Inigo that Westley is merely “mostly dead” and, before he agrees to revive him, proceeds to ask the hopeful duo how much money they have and whether or not their desire to revive Westley is based on the fact that he owes them a gambling debt. Max is clearly a curmudgeon and a cynic, and he only agrees to help Westley when Inigo informs him that doing so will mean pain and humiliation for the prince who fired him, but he ultimately proves he’s worthy of the “Miracle” in his name when he succeeds in bringing Westley back to life. Well, sort of… Westley remains partially paralyzed for pretty much the rest of the film.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1092277[/tomatometer]5. The Wizard of Oz (The Wizard of Oz)OK, so the titular character in The Wizard of Oz (played by Frank Morgan) lacks the magic powers of virtually everyone else on this list. “My dear, I’m a very good man; I’m just a very bad wizard,” he tells Dorothy. However, most magicians have limits to their abilities, and at least the ruler of Oz has a knack for P.R. and a carnival barker’s penchant for spectacle. Just because the Wizard has cultivated an undeserved cult of personality doesn’t mean he’s lacking in wisdom; without him, the Scarecrow wouldn’t have earned his PhD in Thinkology from Emerald City State, and Dorothy would probably be stuck earning minimum wage at the Munchkinland IHOP and pining for Kansas on her lunch breaks. In other words, it’s worth paying at least some attention to the man behind the curtain.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1006266[/tomatometer]4. Ulrich (Dragonslayer)For any consummate professional, there comes a time when you’ve gotten so good at what you do that boredom sets in, and it’s sometimes more fun to just sit back and watch someone else try to pinch-hit for you than it is to actually, you know, do your job. Such is the case with Dragonslayer‘s Ulrich of Craggenmoor (Sir Ralph Richardson), who decides he’d rather let one of the king’s bouncers get stabby with him than go to the trouble of leading a bothersome quest against the county dragon (the awesomely named Vermithrax Pejorative). Ulrich’s employees, an apprentice named Galen (Peter MacNicol) and an aged servant named Hodge (Sydney Bromley), are understandably upset about Ulrich’s demise, but what they don’t know — and what Galen ultimately discovers after risking his neck for about an hour and a half — is that Ulrich’s soul has burrowed into an amulet, allowing him to surreptitiously hitch a ride and, ultimately, save the day. We imagine Galen must have been a little annoyed, but hey — it’s Peter MacNicol. What’s he gonna do?[tomatometer]MuzeID=1006848[/tomatometer]3. Merlin (Excalibur)Some of the other wizards on this list may have wielded their power with a little more glitz and/or state-of-the-art special effects, but few could claim the sort of crucial connection to the Earth boasted by Excalibur‘s Merlin (Nicol Williamson) — he was tragically poked in the gut when Arthur, in a fit of rage, stabbed his enchanted sword into the ground — and, even more importantly, Merlin rocked what was indisputably the shiniest skullcap in all of the Dark Ages. And who else would be crafty enough to outwit an inveterate horndog like Uther Pendragon, keep a dragon on call, and cast a spell as wicked cool as the Charm of Making? No one, that’s who. Mess with Merlin, and — as the treacherous Morgana discovered, much to her chagrin — you’re liable to end up on the wrong end of a stranglin’. Whoa! Like lightning![tomatometer]MuzeID=1109764[/tomatometer]2. Dumbledore (the Harry Potter series)What does it take to lead a secret organization dedicated to the protection of the good, run a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for children, and help guide and prepare one gifted student for his lot in life? We couldn’t tell you, but the aged yet formidable headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore, probably could. Throughout all of young Harry Potter’s tutelage, Dumbledore (played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon) remains his faithful mentor and protector, and while his powers are never in question, his unwavering stance against evil might be his greatest strength. Not only must he ensure the school itself runs smoothly, but he also must battle adversaries who rise up within its ranks and secure the safety of its most important student. Sure, there are moments when he flexes his magical prowess, and they are spectacular moments, but when the chips are down and Hogwarts finds itself in disarray time and again, it’s the strength of Dumbledore’s character that shines brighter than any thunderbolt or fireball he might rain down upon his foes. In short, without Dumbledore’s guidance, Harry might have met his end rather early, and we’d be looking at a two-book/film series where the bad guys win.[tomatometer]MuzeID=1108476[/tomatometer]1. Gandalf (the Lord of the Rings trilogy)Unlike some of the other entries on this list, Gandalf is a full-fledged, bona fide, staff-wielding, pointy-hat wearing wizard in the most traditional sense of the word. If you were raised on fantasy storybooks, there’s a good chance the first depictions of wizards you encountered were strikingly similar to Ian McKellen’s portrayal of the character from the Lord of the Rings epic. But Gandalf embodies more than just the prototypical wizard aesthetic; he also behaves very much in the way that one might expect a wizard to behave. In Peter Jackson’s screen version of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic series, Gandalf regularly dispenses wisdom to his loved ones, engages in magical battles with a fire-breathing demon and a rival wizard, travels on the backs of giant eagles and lightning-fast horses, and leads a comeback charge against an army of fiends, among other things, and he performs these great feats with equal measures of menacing ferocity and grandfatherly charm. Oh, and did we mention he essentially returns from the depths of oblivion as a brighter, more awesome version of himself? Yeah, Gandalf pretty much rules.Take a look through the rest of our Total Recall archives.

It would be perhaps excessively polite to say that his critical track record over the last 20 years has been spotty, but in spite of the Meet Dave‘s and Vampire in Brooklyn‘s dotting his resume, Murphy has helped pull in over $3 billion in box office receipts — and since his latest effort, Imagine That, is reaching theaters this Friday, we thought now would be the perfect time to devote a Total Recall to his 10 best-reviewed movies.As with many of our Total Recall subjects, there are certain films that you just know will be on the list (hello, Beverly Hills Cop) and ones that obviously won’t (The Adventures of Pluto Nash did not make the cut). But portions of the list may still surprise you; if there’s one thing we’ve come to expect from this series, it’s a healthy level of disagreement over what got bumped, what didn’t, and how the rankings broke down. So let’s start the countdown — and when we’re done, head over to Murphy’s complete filmography for a more in-depth look at where he’s been![tomatometer]MuzeID=1004564[/tomatometer]10. Coming to AmericaHe’d missed the mark a couple of times — 1986’s The Golden Child didn’t live up to expectations, and 1984’s Best Defense was described by the New York Times’ Vincent Canby as “mind-bendingly bad” — but on the whole, Eddie Murphy’s film career seemed pretty much unstoppable by 1988; the idea that his hot streak was about to end would have seemed ludicrous. As we all know, Coming to America was followed by a back-to-back pair of infamous duds in Harlem Nights and Another 48 Hrs., making the prince-out-of-water comedy the unofficial end of Murphy’s early rise at the box office — but if it had to end, at least he ended it in style, turning in the first of what would become many prosthetics-assisted multi-role performances in a hit reunion with his Trading Places director, John Landis. In the words of critic Mark R. Leeper, Coming to America is “to date the high-water mark for Landis’s directorial career, and it is the best film Eddie Murphy has ever been in.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1071708[/tomatometer]9. The Nutty ProfessorBy 1996, Eddie Murphy hadn’t had a box office hit since Boomerang in 1992 — and had tumbled through a string of duds stretching back to 1989, one which included Another 48 Hrs., The Distinguished Gentleman, Beverly Hills Cop III, and Vampire in Brooklyn. It was a good time for a comeback, in other words — and Murphy found just the right vehicle in the Tom Shadyac-directed remake of Jerry Lewis’ 1963 comedy about a schlub whose miracle serum transforms him into a fast-talking cretin named Buddy Love. Blending family-friendly (albeit heavily scatological) humor with a script that allowed Murphy to don a dizzying series of prosthetics and display his impressive range, The Nutty Professor gobbled up over $125 million in worldwide receipts and earned a healthy number of positive reviews from critics like Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader, who wrote that “Murphy outdoes himself by bringing pathos as well as sweetness to the character, arguably making him a viable update of Lewis’s bucktoothed Julius Kelp.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1159324[/tomatometer]8. DreamgirlsA decade after sparking a comeback with The Nutty Professor, Murphy found his career back in the doldrums again; his voiceover work in the Shrek films notwithstanding, Murphy’s post-Professor years were a wasteland of critical and commercial duds like Metro, Showtime, and the infamous The Adventures of Pluto Nash, with brief breaks for the mildly successful Bowfinger and a Doctor Dolittle remake that duplicated the PG humor (and box office success) of The Nutty Professor. Not much to suggest that Murphy was still interested in actual acting, in other words — which is one reason critics were so pleasantly surprised by his Academy Award-nominated turn as James “Thunder” Early in Tom Condon’s adaptation of the hit Broadway musical Dreamgirls. Though Murphy wasn’t the star of the show — and his castmate Jennifer Hudson matched his Golden Globe with one of her own, plus an Oscar — it proved he still had the talent that made him famous. (He then turned right around and made Norbit, of course, but that’s another story.)[tomatometer]MuzeID=1088000[/tomatometer]7. BowfingerIf it had come together a decade sooner, 1999’s Eddie Murphy/Steve Martin summit Bowfinger might have been a collaboration of epic proportions; as it was, neither Martin nor Murphy were exactly flush with cinematic goodwill in ’99, with memories of would-be comedies like Sgt. Bilko and Holy Man still fresh in filmgoers’ minds. Which is sort of a shame, because the Martin-penned Bowfinger ended up being one of the sharper and more entertaining Hollywood satires to reach theaters in years, sending up the town, the studio system, and — though Martin has denied it — the church of Scientology. Acting in dual roles as the world-famous, insanely paranoid Kit Ramsey and his milquetoast, talent-deficient twin brother Jiff, Murphy was able to poke fun at his own insulated image while flexing more of the multiple-role muscle audiences enjoyed with The Nutty Professor — minus the mounds of latex, of course. Bowfinger turned a solid profit at the box office, and at 79 percent on the Tomatometer, it was Murphy’s highest-rated live-action effort in years — something noticed by USA Today’s Mike Clark, who wrote, “aside from The Nutty Professor, this is the funniest Eddie Murphy comedy since the Reagan administration.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1006467[/tomatometer]6. Eddie Murphy – RawMurphy’s first stand-up concert film, 1983’s Delirious, is an acknowledged comedy classic — but it was also a low-budget affair, filmed for the nascent HBO during the early years of Murphy’s career. Four years later, money was no longer a problem for any Eddie Murphy production, and he returned to the concert arena, with director Robert Townsend in tow, for 1987’s Raw. Mixing riffs on his life as one of Hollywood’s biggest stars (including a famous bit about Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, a Coke, and a smile) with typically profane observations on race relations and marriage. Few critics tried to argue that Raw was as funny as Delirious — and Murphy himself seemed to know he was standing in its shadow, as he referenced a number of the earlier film’s bits in his Raw routine — but he was still near the top of his game. As Richard Harrington of the Washington Post wrote, “[Murphy’s] material, which trades on racial and sexual stereotypes even as it skewers them, may be offensive to some, but for others he remains a hell of a good yuck.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1002239[/tomatometer]5. Beverly Hills CopIt kicked off a $735 million film franchise, made Harold Faltermeyer a synth god, and taught aspiring police officers the importance of not falling for a banana in the tailpipe — but in 1984, all that mattered to Eddie Murphy was that Beverly Hills Cop helped erase memories of Best Defense, the roundly panned alleged comedy he’d made with Dudley Moore earlier in the year. Though its legacy would eventually be tainted by a pair of progressively more inessential sequels, Cop arguably represents the acme of the ’80s action comedy, offering thrills, laughs, a familiar character actor in the villain’s role, and a small army of synthesizers on the score — not bad for a script that Mickey Rourke and Sylvester Stallone both passed on (the latter reportedly took his vision for Cop and used it as the basis for Cobra). Of course, it’s impossible now to imagine anyone but Murphy as the wisecracking Axel Foley; the funny script, and Martin Brest’s ad-lib-friendly direction, were a perfect fit for what Time’s Richard Schickel called “the kind of cheeky, cocky charm that has been missing from the screen since Cagney was a pup, snarling his way out of the ghetto.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1132597[/tomatometer]4. Shrek 2After Shrek barrelled through theaters in 2001, it was pretty much a given that DreamWorks Animation would produce a sequel — and given that Eddie Murphy had already made Beverly Hills Cop III, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, and Dr. Dolittle 2, it seemed a pretty safe bet that if the script was written in anything resembling English, he’d be back for another round as Donkey. Murphy didn’t disappoint — and neither did Shrek 2, racking up an admirable 89 percent on the Tomatometer to match its predecessor’s, thanks to a script loaded with laughs, an expanded voice cast that included Antonio Banderas, John Cleese, and Julie Andrews, and typically gorgeous CG animation. Murphy’s character even got a family of his own (and introduced audiences to something called a “dronkey” in the process). Entertainment Weekly’s Owen Gleiberman echoed the sentiments of many of his peers when he wrote, “it’s not quite as emotionally rounded as Shrek was, but it’s got heart and delirium in equal doses, as well as a firecracker rhythm all its own.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1107906[/tomatometer]3. ShrekHe made his animated debut as the voice of Mushu the dragon in 1998’s Mulan, but Eddie Murphy really hit the cartoon jackpot with 2001’s Shrek, a DreamWorks Animation adaptation of the bestselling William Steig children’s book about the adventures of a big green ogre (voiced here by Mike Myers). Providing the voice of Shrek’s chatterbox companion Donkey, Murphy invited plenty of backhanded compliments (Time’s Richard Shickel wrote that “no one has ever made a funnier jackass of himself than Eddie Murphy”) — and pretty much ran away with the movie in the process, channeling a G-rated version of the boundless charisma and comic energy that audiences had been missing for far too long. And for viewers who had found Murphy’s earlier, edgier humor a little difficult to take, Shrek was a long-overdue change; for USA Today’s Susan Wloszczyna, for example, one of the best parts of the movie was “an exuberant Eddie Murphy [giving] the comic performance of his career.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1021818[/tomatometer]2. Trading PlacesFor his cinematic debut, 1982’s 48 Hrs., Murphy took advantage of having Nick Nolte as a straight man; for his second effort, 1983’s Trading Places, he went mano a mano with fellow funnyman (and SNL vet) Dan Aykroyd. Of course, Aykroyd ended up leaving most of the laughs to Murphy — it’s possible that even Don Ameche had more funny lines — but Places still proved that Murphy could hold his own against one of Hollywood’s most popular comedians. Unlike most early Murphy vehicles, it also surrounded him with a ton of A-list talent, including Aykroyd, Ameche, Ralph Bellamy, and Jamie Lee Curtis, which — along with Timothy Harris and Hershel Weingrod’s rather pointed script — enabled director John Landis to create an uncommonly sturdy framework around Murphy’s rapid-fire riffing. The result was a film that entertains whether you’re watching it for some light commentary on the “nature vs. nurture” debate or simply to see Murphy pretend to be a blind, legless veteran. As Film Threat’s Brad Laidman noted, “because Eddie doesn’t have to carry the whole movie, he is free to make every word that comes out of his mouth infinitely appealing.”[tomatometer]MuzeID=1000133[/tomatometer]1. 48 Hrs.The movie that launched Eddie Murphy’s film career, the box office reign of producer Joel Silver, and arguably the entire “buddy cop” genre, Walter Hill’s 48 Hrs. overcame a stint in turnaround and countless rewrites to become one of 1982’s biggest hits and — surprise! — Murphy’s best-reviewed film (so far, anyway). And why not? A number of Murphy’s most memorable silver screen bits are here, including his impassioned rendition of the Police’s “Roxanne” and the classic scene where he stuns a bar full of rhinestone cowboys into submission; in fact, you could argue that the template for his entire early film career — and the “classic” Murphy whose disappearance we bemoan so frequently — was molded from the impression left by the wisecracking Reggie Hammond. It’s temping to wonder what might have been if 48 Hrs. had been made as the Clint Eastwood/Richard Pryor vehicle it started out as, but as Roger Ebert noted, this is a film that transcends its rather limited origins because of its stars: “The movie’s story is nothing to write home about. It’s pretty routine. What makes the movie special is how it’s made. Nolte and Murphy are good, and their dialogue is good, too — quirky and funny.”Take a look through Murphy’s complete filmography, as well as the rest of our Total Recall archives.

Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

It’s a music-driven period piece about the great Chess Records label which recorded some of the finest blues and R&amp;B ever captured on vinyl in the 1950s and 1960s. Hip-hop musician and actor Mos Def plays legendary rock ‘n roller Chuck Berry, which inspired us to take a look at other rappers who have successfully made the leap to the big screen.\nPop stars in the movies are nothing new; for a long time, it came with the territory. However, since the early 1990s, a number of hip hop artists have seamlessly made the transition from wax to celluloid, often delivering more compelling performances than their classically-trained co-stars. Without further ado, we run down some of the finest thespians in the hip hop game.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nCommon \nSome of us remember back when Common was still calling himself Common Sense and beefing with west coast rappers, but Chi-town’s finest (eat your heart out, Kanye) has come a long way since then. Common, otherwise known as Lonnie Rashid Lynn, Jr., worked his way up from the underground where he maintained a loyal following, eventually got himself a major label record deal, and ultimately landed in the mainstream consciousness with 2005’s “Be.” Next thing we knew, he was dancing his way through Gap commercials and appearing on Chappelle’s Show. Though his acting credits up to that point had only included a few TV show episodes and appearances as “himself,” he took the next major step by accepting a role in 2006’s Smokin’ Aces, a critical bomb that nevertheless featured a slew of big Hollywood names (Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck, Jeremy Piven, Andy Garcia).  He continued to add to his resume with appearances in American Gangster, Street Kings, and this year’s Wanted, and despite his ongoing rap career (a new album is due in 2009), audiences can expect to see him in the upcoming Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nLudacris \nChris “Ludacris” Bridges may not have many film credits to his name, but he has quickly emerged as a promising screen presence. The King of the South’s hilariously ribald rhymes may have drawn the ire of Bill O’Reilly, but it’s his personality and charisma that have gotten him in the door in Hollywood. Ludacris played a key role as a politically savvy, thoughtful hood in the Acadamy Award-winning Crash, and in Hustle &amp; Flow he had an electric turn as a rap star who’d grown too big for his britches. Lately, he’s been featured in action flicks like Max Payne and Guy Ritchie’s RockNRolla, but he also narrated the critically-acclaimed The Heart of the Game, a documentary about a girls’ high school basketball team in Washington State.\nWarning: Clip is NSFW — language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\n2Pac \nIn an interview with RT\n last year, director Julien Temple lamented the fact that most pop singers have too much star baggage to be convincing as actors. However, Tupac Shakur, who starred in Temple’s Bullet, was different. “Tupac had quite an aura about him,” he said. Shakur was hardly a typical rapper-turned-thespian; as a child actor, he performed in A Raisin in the Sun as part of Harlem’s 127th Street Ensemble, and in high school, he appeared in Shakespeare plays and The Nutcracker. After a stint with the Digital Underground, 2Pac became one of the biggest MCs in the game, and some of his biggest hits, like “Brenda’s Got a Baby” and “Dear Mama,” contained a sense of cinematic observation and drama. Now a star, 2Pac turned to the big screen, and his air of desperate menace elevated such genre films as Juice and Above the Rim. However, he also displayed nuance as a sensitive mailman in Poetic Justice and as a down-on-his-luck jazz musician in Gridlock’d.\nWarning: Clip is NSFW — language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nMark Wahlberg \nDelinquent, rapper, underwear model, actor, Oscar nominee — the artist formerly known as Marky Mark (AKA Mark Wahlberg) has done it all. First came the hip-hop hit “Good Vibrations,” a 1991 dance single that went platinum thanks to Wahlberg’s semi-clothed gyrations and lyrics like “Yo! It’s about that time/To bring forth the rhythm and the rhyme” — an early success that led to his exclusive contract modeling in nothing but boxer briefs for Calvin Klein. But once Wahlberg’s Funky era ran its course, he turned to acting, putting his streetwise persona to good use in films like Renaissance Man (1994), The Basketball Diaries  (1995), and Fear (1996).  In only his fifth feature film, Wahlberg found his star-making role: high school drop-out Eddie Adams (AKA Dirk Diggler) in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 1970s porn opus, Boogie Nights. A little over a decade later, Wahlberg has become one of Hollywood’s most reliable A-listers, with films like Three Kings, A Perfect Storm, Invincible, and most recently, Max Payne under his belt; he even received an Oscar nomination for his role in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed and somewhere along the way found time to executive produce HBO’s hit inside-Hollywood series Entourage, based on his own life — not bad for the little brother of a New Kid on the Block. In the immortal words of Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, “Feel it, feel it!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nWill Smith \nAs the Fresh Prince, Will Smith was one of hip hop’s earliest mainstream stars, and it isn’t hard to see why. At a time when parents and the media were alarmed by the genre’s more explicit and political content, Smith spun playful yarns like “Parents Just Don’t Understand” and “Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble” that showcased his amiable personality. (It didn’t hurt that he was ably assisted by respected turntablist Jazzy Jeff). He brought his smarts and charm to the boob tube in the hit series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air before graduating to the big screen, winning plaudits as a charming con man in Six Degrees of Separation. With Independence Day, Men in Black, and Enemy of the State, Smith graduated to the big leagues, becoming one of Hollywood’s most marketable stars, and despite some setbacks (Wild Wild West, anyone?) Smith has maintained a remarkably high level of consistency. He has even picked up some Academy Award nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of MCs that have traded in their mics for a shot at big-screen glory by no means ends there. Eminem was a one-film wonder in 8 Mile. Bow Wow has turned in some respectable performances in a variety of films, from Like Mike to Roll Bounce. DMX starred in a series of action flicks. Master P directed and starred in numerous straight-to-DVD titles. Both members of OutKast have been featured in theatrical releases in recent years. Both Who’s the Man and Belly found nearly their entire casts from hip hop’s ranks. And the beat goes on.\nThink you know your rapper-actors pretty well?

He’s written books, plays, and is currently promoting his first album of original banjo music alongside Pink Panther 2; clearly, even in the collection of larger-than-life personalities known as Hollywood, Steve Martin is in a class of his own. So let’s spin the dials on the Tomatometer and relive the 10 freshest films in the Martin filmography — and when we’re done, have a look at the rest of his releases, including all your favorites that missed the cut!10. Pennies from Heaven (83 percent)Worried about being typecast as a buffoon, Martin used the career capital he’d earned with The Jerk to make his dramatic debut in the American remake of the 1978 BBC series Pennies from Heaven. Having loved the source material — he publicly proclaimed it “the greatest thing I’ve ever seen” — Martin went all out for the role of Depression-era sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker, taking six months of tap-dancing lessons in preparation for what ended up being one of the more critically well-received flops of the first half of the decade. Although audiences ignored Pennies, bringing in a paltry $9 million return on its $22 million budget — and Fred Astaire bitterly bemoaned the use of his old footage in a film he derided as “cheap and vulgar…froth” — many critics appreciated the script’s cynical update on the classic musicals of the 1930s; Roger Ebert captured the mood of many of his peers when he termed it “dazzling and disappointing in equal measure.”9. The Jerk (83 percent)Martin’s first role in a feature film came in 1978’s Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the less said about that, the better; for all intents and purposes, his movie career kicked off with his appearance as the simpleminded Navin R. Johnson in the rags-to-riches-and-back-again story The Jerk. While it certainly isn’t for everyone — if you require your comedies to have brains to go along with their hearts, or even to make complete sense from start to finish, then you may not find it all that funny — but it’s full of classic bits, and Martin’s willingness to get dumb helped blaze a trail for everyone from Adam Sandler to Jim Carrey. (Don’t thank him all at once.) Not all critics appreciated The Jerk when it was released, but it’s aged well, moving into the pop-culture consciousness and inspiring fond memories in scribes like Channel 4 Film‘s Richard Luck, who wistfully remarked, “if only he could have satisfied himself with this area of expertise, people would still talk of Steve Martin as one of the kings of comic cinema.”8. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (88 percent)Faithful in story, if not entirely in spirit, to 1964’s David Niven/Marlon Brando farce Bedtime Story, 1988’s Dirty Rotten Scoundrels acts as a sort of closing chapter in the career of Steve Martin, absurdist funnyman; after yukking it up with Michael Caine in the French countryside for this tale of dueling grifters — and offending eyepatch-wearing inbreds everywhere with his unforgettable scenes as Ruprecht the Monkey Boy — Martin mostly avoided abject silliness until signing on for The Pink Panther. Critics were, for the most part, quite kind to Scoundrels; although they were quick to point out the film’s recycled origins, as well as the occasional plot defect, the fun being had by the leads is as obvious as it is infectious. In the words of the BBC‘s George Perry, “there is a slightly perfunctory air in the way the story unreels as though it’s all been done before. Nevertheless, Caine and Martin make a great double act.”7. The Spanish Prisoner (88 percent)Although Martin had attempted a number of dramatic roles by the late 1990s, his appearance in David Mamet’s The Spanish Prisoner still seemed like something of a revelation — partly because it came during a period in which Martin was receiving positive notice for branching out into new areas (the 1993 play Picasso at the Lapin Agile; his essay-writing gig for the New Yorker), and partly because it was a good deal more entertaining than any of his recent comedies (including Mixed Nuts and Sgt. Bilko). Of course, the star of any Mamet production is Mamet’s script — something pointed out by several critics who took issue with the many Mamet-isms in The Spanish Prisoner‘s dialogue — but Martin acquitted himself admirably as Jimmy Dell, the mysterious stranger who may or may not be pulling the strings in a high-stakes con, impressing writers like Filmcritic‘s Christopher Null, who wrote “Steve Martin and Campbell Scott — wow! Who knew they had such talent?”6. All of Me (89 percent)Between 1978 and 1984, Martin averaged a film a year, encompassing everything from typically Martinesque comedies (The Jerk, The Man with Two Brains) to a musical revival (Pennies from Heaven) and a film noir parody (Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid). Not everything he made during this period was particularly well-received, either by critics or filmgoers, but 1984’s All of Me represents an early career peak. Teaming with director Carl Reiner for the fourth time, Martin plays Roger Cobb, an attorney/jazz guitarist who ends up having half of his body taken over by the spirit of a deceased client (played by Lily Tomlin). The setup is ridiculous, but it allows Martin plenty of room to display his incredible gift for physical comedy; the scenes in which he struggles with Tomlin’s spirit for control of his body would make the movie worth watching even if they were its only good qualities. Fortunately, there’s a very good story, and some fine performances, behind all the laughs; as Time Magazine‘s Richard Corliss observed, “Martin vaults to the top of the class with his brazen, precise performance. This one goes in the time capsule.”5. Little Shop of Horrors (91 percent)Okay, so Little Shop of Horrors isn’t a Steve Martin movie in the truest sense; his appearance as the sadistic dentist Orin Scrivello is basically a glorified cameo. But what a cameo it is — Martin’s big musical number, the terrifically witty “Dentist!,” just about steals the show, which is all the more impressive when you stop to consider that the show in question features a bloodthirsty talking plant with spellbindingly full lips and the voice of Levi Stubbs. Most critics enjoyed this colorful, Frank Oz-directed musical update on Roger Corman’s 1960 film, but even the ones who didn’t — such as eFilmCritic‘s Brian McKay — admitted that Little Shop is “made tolerable by Steve Martin and the talking plant.”4. Parenthood (92 percent)Ten years after redefining doofus comedy with 1979’s The Jerk, Steve Martin had (mostly) traded in props and pratfalls — and he cemented his more reflective, mature on-screen persona with his appearance as sensitive dad Gil Buckman in Ron Howard’s Parenthood. Blending comedy and drama with crowded casts was trendy for a time in the late ’80s (thirtysomething, anyone?), and there are few better examples of the “dramedy” subgenre than this tender, witty look at the tangled bonds between parents and their kids; Parenthood was greeted with a wave of glowing reviews upon its release, many of them reserving their highest praise for the uncommon dexterity with which the story (written by Howard, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel) jumps between its numerous threads. Martin disappointed some critics (and fans) by trading in madcap laughs for gentle observations, but there’s no denying he did it well. As Rolling Stone‘s Peter Travers pointed out, “It’s a shock, and a welcome one, to see Steve Martin cast against type as a doting dad. Martin’s nippy wit continually lifts this movie above the swamp of sentiment.”3. Roxanne (93 percent)The years leading up to Roxanne were not the most active ones for Steve Martin — after 1984’s All of Me, he surfaced only to make a brief appearance in 1986’s Little Shop of Horrors remake and co-star with Chevy Chase and Martin Short in Â¡Three Amigos! the same year — and this was due, in part, to the time he spent working on the script for Roxanne. A loose modern update on Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac, it stars Martin as C.D. “Charlie” Bales, a small-town fire chief and all-around good guy who just happens to have an enormous nose. Afraid to express his feelings for the titular object of his affections (played by Daryl Hannah), he compensates by helping a loutish volunteer fireman woo her. Like many Martin movies, Roxanne is unabashedly sweet, and although some critics found it overly sentimental — Variety dismissed it as “hopelessly sappy stuff” — most agreed with the Washington Post‘s Hal Hinson, who held it up as “the most unabashed, and most satisfying, romantic movie to come along in years” and “a swooning, delicate, heart-on-its-sleeve work.”2. L.A. Story (94 percent)New York has received plenty of cinematic love letters in its day — take, for instance, the bulk of Woody Allen’s output — but what about poor, smoggy Los Angeles? Steve Martin addressed this imbalance when he wrote and starred in 1991’s L.A. Story, an affectionate sendup of the city’s many foibles (and tribute to its strengths) in which he played Harris K. Telemacher, a down-on-his-luck weatherman whose quest for meaningful relationships is aided by a riddle-dispensing electronic billboard. It sounds ludicrous — and it is — but it’s also very charming and often very funny. As Vincent Canby of the New York Times put it, “Like Mr. Martin himself, L.A. Story seems basically decent, intelligent and sweet. It’s a fanciful romantic comedy whose wildest and craziest notion is that Los Angeles, for all of its eccentricities, is a great place to live.”1. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (95 percent)Today it’s regarded as a modern holiday classic, but in 1987, a person could have been forgiven for assuming Planes, Trains and Automobiles would be little more than lowbrow piffle; after all, neither its stars nor its writer/director were known to pass up any opportunity to make a joke about a bodily function. But guess what? Planes proved that John Hughes could make an adult comedy when the mood struck him, provided John Candy with an opportunity to broaden his range, and gave Martin his second non-wild and crazy role in less than a year. As Neal Page, the uptight ad exec who watches haplessly as his 90-minute flight home devolves into a torturous three-day journey, Martin has plenty of chances to go for easy laughs — but he also shows a subtler, more restrained side, one that foreshadowed some of the projects he’d choose in the years to come. It is, in the words of Moviehole‘s Clint Morris, “One of John Hughes’ finest hours, and a tour de force for Candy and Martin.”For Steve Martin’s complete filmography, click here.

In the Valentine’s spirit, we decided this week’s Total Recall would be the perfect place to celebrate love, Hollywood style.The movie business has a long, rich tradition of on-set romances — some of which have gone on to produce impressive bodies of work (Bogie and Bacall), some that sparked professional partnerships that lasted longer than the relationships themselves (Keaton and Allen), and some that, well, sold a lot of tabloids (Bennifer). This is only a very partial list, of course, but we take a look at 10 of our favorite on- and off-screen partnerships here, celebrating both the films that endure (Brokeback Mountain) and those that perhaps didn’t turn out as planned (Days of Thunder). Sit down with a box of your favorite chocolate and enjoy!Jennifer Lopez and Ben AffleckAh, Bennifer. What good times we all had together, devouring column inch after column inch of breathless speculation on the extremely tabloid-friendly exploits of the Armageddon actor and his singing, dancing, film-starring paramour! Affleck and Lopez’s relationship was paparazzi catnip from the start, making its public debut as the seeming cause of the dissolution of Lopez’s marriage to her second husband, and the tabloids’ love affair with the couple continued right on up through their last-minute wedding postponement and subsequent breakup. Their brief two-year union managed to produce two films — Gigli (2003, 6 percent) and Jersey Girl (2004, 40 percent) — but their most critically respected collaboration was probably their joint appearance in Lopez’s video for “Jenny from the Block.”Ali MacGraw and Steve McQueenWhen tongues wagged over Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie starring together in Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, it was at least in part because of the long Hollywood tradition of falling for one’s co-star — a tradition established by infamous on-set romances such as the one that flared up between Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw during the filming of The Getaway (1972, 82 percent). When the cameras started rolling, McQueen was one half of a 15-year marriage and McGraw was the wife of Paramount chief Robert Evans, but even that wasn’t enough to contain the spark between the stars; they went on to become one of the most hotly scrutinized couples in the industry. Of course, their union was always just as notable for its off-screen aspects as anything that went on in front of the cameras, and their troubled five-year marriage never made room for another co-starring vehicle — but their work in The Getaway left enough of an impression that it served as the inspiration for a remake more than 20 years later — starring another couple that met on a movie set, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.Jada Pinkett Smith and Will SmithNever let it be said that The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air contributed nothing of lasting value: Jada Pinkett took her first step toward walking down the aisle with Will Smith when they met on the set of the long-running sitcom. Pinkett didn’t land the guest-starring role she sought, but her career didn’t suffer for it — and neither did Smith’s, obviously; these days, Will and Jada are two of the biggest, brightest stars in the Hollywood firmament, responsible for billions of dollars in box office moolah. Since marrying in 1997, the couple has only starred together in one movie, the Muhammad Ali biopic Ali (2001, 68 percent), but they’ve been very busy behind the scenes with projects such as the short-lived UPN sitcom All of Us — and as we learned in The Pursuit of Happyness, in which Will co-starred with their son Jayden, the Smiths aren’t shy about getting together in front of the cameras for the right reason.Michelle Williams and Heath LedgerThey both rose to prominence thanks to roles in relatively middlebrow fare — he in 10 Things I Hate About You, she in the long-running nighttime soap Dawson’s Creek — but Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams always had higher aspirations for their careers, and by the time they met on the set of Brokeback Mountain (2005, 87 percent), they’d acquired reputations for being two of the braver and more unconventional young actors in the industry. Brokeback‘s same-sex love story reinforced that, particularly for Ledger, whose no-holds-barred portrayal of Ennis del Mar proved how gravely his talents had been wasted in projects like A Knight’s Tale. Ledger and Williams’ relationship lasted only a few years, but the daughter they bore together — as well as Ledger’s shocking death in 2008 — ensures that its (albeit tragic) legacy will endure.Angelina Jolie and Brad PittAfter years of providing an unbeatable answer to the question “which celebrities would make the cutest kids?” Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie joined forces for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005, 58 percent) — so naturally, despite Pitt’s marriage to Jennifer Aniston, the duo inspired an incredible amount of speculation about whether their palpable onscreen chemistry had carried over into their offscreen lives. Though both stars denied any behind-the-scenes monkey business, they eventually caved into peer pressure and became the Brangelina we know and love today, and arguably the last of the Hollywood supercouples to carry the old-fashioned aura of mystique that the paparazzi has all but destroyed. They’ve been too busy building a football team-sized brood to plot a cinematic reunion, but if and when they ever get around to it, you can bet on plenty of publicity buildup; as Michelle Alexandria of Eclipse Magazine wrote, “Pitt and Jolie sizzle together.”Rita Wilson and Tom HanksTom Hanks and Rita Wilson have two of the most down-to-earth public personas in Hollywood, so it’s only fitting that they’d also be partners in one of the industry’s most quietly successful marriages. After meeting on the set of Hanks’ short-lived ’80s sitcom Bosom Buddies, Hanks and Wilson fell for each other while co-starring in Volunteers (1985, 50 percent) and finally wed in 1988. Since becoming Mr. and Mrs. Hanks, they haven’t exactly made a habit of starring in each others’ projects, but they have made time to work together occasionally, both appearing in Bonfire of the Vanities (1990, 25 percent), and Sleepless in Seattle (1993, 74 percent); Wilson also made a brief cameo in That Thing You Do! (1996, 91 percent). They’ve also worked together behind the scenes, most notably as producers of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002, 76 percent), which provided an astronomical $241 million return on its $5 million budget.Nicole Kidman and Tom CruiseTom Cruise has had multiple high-profile relationships — he was married to Mimi Rogers before meeting Nicole Kidman on the set of Days of Thunder (1990, 41 percent) and wed Katie Holmes after divorcing Kidman in 2001 — but none of them boast the extensive filmography he enjoyed with Kidman; after filming Thunder, they reunited onscreen for Far and Away (1992, 50 percent) and Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut (1999, 78 percent). Though few would argue that either Cruise or Kidman delivered their finest performances in any of these films — of the three, only Eyes Wide Shut is Certified Fresh, and it sharply divided critics — they all made money, which is, as we all know, the most important benchmark for success in Hollywood, and one the post-couch-jumping Cruise seems unlikely to try and match.Diane Keaton and Woody AllenUnlike most of the couples on this list, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen’s working relationship far outlasted their romance; although they were involved for only a year, they worked together on a long list of films, including a six-picture run that started with Play It Again, Sam (1972, 97 percent) and continued through Sleeper (1973, 100 percent), Love and Death (1975, 100 percent), Annie Hall (1977, 98 percent), Interiors (1978, 77 percent), and Manhattan (1979, 98 percent). It’s a period that includes much of Allen’s best work — and some of the performances that Keaton is most closely identified with, led, of course, by her Academy Award-winning turn as the lovably ditzy Annie Hall. Keaton and Allen have worked together sparingly since finishing their hot 1970s streak, but when the project is right — as it was with Radio Days (1986, 95 percent) and Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993, 86 percent) — Keaton can still help bring out the best in her old partner.Joanne Woodward and Paul NewmanAs one of the most well-respected actors in the business, Paul Newman enjoyed a long line of on-screen partners — Robert Redford, Tom Hanks, Steve McQueen, and Elizabeth Taylor among them. But his best work — his life’s work — was created with his wife of 50 years, Joanne Woodward, whom he met during their 1953 stint on a Broadway production of William Inge’s Picnic. Newman and Woodward starred together in 10 films: The Long, Hot Summer (1958, 87 percent), Rally ‘Round the Flag, Boys! (1958, 33 percent), From the Terrace (1960, 38 percent), Paris Blues (1961), A New Kind of Love (1963, 0 percent), Winning (1969, 50 percent), WUSA (1970), The Drowning Pool (1975, 62 percent), Harry &amp; Son (1984, 22 percent), and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge (1990, 71 percent) — a long list that doesn’t take into account the projects Newman directed or produced for Woodward, or the HBO miniseries Empire Falls. Clearly, their work together had its ups and downs, but their marriage remained exceptionally steady over the five decades leading up to Newman’s death in September 2008 — a lovely exception to the flashy-but-brief unions seen all too often in Hollywood (and on this list).Lauren Bacall and Humphrey BogartOf all the couples on this list — heck, in all of Hollywood’s history — few can approach the legendary status of Bogie and Bacall, either in terms of star power or quality of work. Meeting on the set of To Have and Have Not (1944, 100 percent), the 45-year-old pro and the 19-year-old rising star quickly threw sparks; though Bogart resisted the temptation to end his unhappy marriage for Bacall, by the time they were finished with their second picture, The Big Sleep (1946, 95 percent), there was no turning back. After their 1945 marriage, Bogart and Bacall reteamed for two more features, Dark Passage (1947, 100 percent) and Key Largo (1948, 96 percent) — a track record almost as impressive as the marriage itself, which lasted until Bogart’s untimely death from esophageal cancer in 1957, just five years after the birth of their second child. In an industry that often makes love seem even more fleeting than it really is, Bogart and Bacall proved a pleasantly enduring exception.Check out the rest of our Total Recall archives here.Finally, we thought we’d end by highlighting one of cinema’s most enduring and glamourous couples: Jay and Silent Bob.Happy Valentine’s Day!","section":"Total Recall","tags":"based, bond, San, movie, Network, Holiday, Plus, X-Men","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Love-Hollywood-Style"},{"id":"47508993154698","title":"Total Recall: Directors Who Made A Splash At Sundance","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Directors Who Made A Splash At SundanceWe look at 10 prominent filmmakers who got a big boost in Park City.by Tim Ryan | January 21, 2009 |  CommentsThis week, the Sundance Film Festival is in full swing. With that in mind, we decided to take a look at some of the prominent directors who’ve gotten some major breaks at America’s most important showcase for independent film. The snowy climes of Park City, UT, may seem to be an odd incubator for independent film, but Robert Redford’s brainchild remains one of the key places to get a first look at some of film’s most important voices.The Coen brothersThe mid-1980s were a time of high-concept action pictures; “independent film” was practically a dirty word in the movie biz. But once in a while, a specialty picture would come along and announce that its makers were talents ready for the big time. Blood Simple was such a film; Joel and Ethan Coen’s debut was a highly original noir/crime thriller that proved there was a market for strong, original material from the underground, and took home the Grand Jury Prize at the 1985 Utah/U.S. Film Festival (rechristened Sundance in 1991), a key early accolade in the brothers’ illustrious career.Jim JarmuschIf the Coen brothers’ twisted take on crime cinema proved that indies could breathe new life into old genres, Jim Jarmusch’s Stranger Than Paradise showed that a film with a low budget could still aspire to the realm of high art. Stranger Than Paradise tells the deceptively simple tale of two New York scenesters and a young Hungarian woman on vacation; though this minimalist black and white film utilized single, static shots, and had the feel of a European arthouse flick, the only thing dry about Stranger Than Paradise was its wit. In addition to picking up a Special Jury Prize at Sundance, it inspired a number of independently-minded directors, and kicked off Jarmusch’s eccentric career; even the director’s relatively mainstream fare (Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers) was light years away from conventional.Steven SoderberghBy the late-1980s, Sundance had earned a reputation as a showcase for bright, original talent, but few of its entries entered the national consciousness. Steven Soderbergh’s sex, lies, and videotape changed that. Set in Baton Rouge, LA, the film details the troubled marriage of an upscale couple (Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell) — a bond that becomes more tenuous when an uninhibited old friend (James Spader) reenters their lives. sex, lies, and videotape won Sundance’s first Audience Award, and, with a big push from Miramax, became one of indie film’s first breakout hits. Ironically, though the film helped to put both Soderbergh and Sundance on the map, the director would have a falling out with Robert Redford; Soderbergh is now associated with Slamdance, another Park City festival that screens films by first-time filmmakers.Richard LinklaterMany budding artists have a revelatory “I can do this too” moment; for Kevin Smith, and lots of other indie filmmakers, Slacker was the film that inspired them to make a movie. Richard Linklater’s second film was decidedly short on plot, but it resoundingly proved that long stretches of conversation could be thrilling; Slacker‘s collection of misfits and eccentrics proved irresistible to a new generation of independent directors — and freethinkers. Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 1991, Slacker was a calling-card for one of American film’s most interesting voices — and the result has been such faves as School of Rock, Dazed and Confused, and Before Sunrise.Quentin TarantinoIn its early years, Sundance was known for intimate character studies and quirky tales of Americana; profane, gun-toting diamond thieves weren’t generally considered acceptable fodder. So when Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs screened at the 1992 festival, it elicited some particularly strong reactions; some praised the director as a brilliant wunderkind, while others were repulsed by the film’s (sometimes gleeful) violence. The mixed reaction was ironic, since Reservoir Dogs was a Sundance film through-and through; Tarantino had work shopped the film at the institute’s labs. The result was a movie that helped to expand the definition of what an independent film could be.Robert RodriguezRobert Rodriguez epitomizes the Sundance success story. His first feature, El Mariachi, was shot for an unheard-of $7,000 (Rodriguez helped finance the movie by participating in an experimental test for a cholesterol drug), and it continues to embody the festival’s against-all-odds spirit. Rodriguez has maintained an independent streak ever since; even his high-profile projects, like Once Upon a Time in Mexico and Sin City, were largely shot in his home base of Austin, and, like El Mariachi, have an infectious energy and remarkable look and feel despite costing much less than most films made in Hollywood.Bryan SingerThe 1993 Sundance Film Festival was a heady time for future X-Men and Superman Returns director Bryan Singer. Not only did he pick up the Grand Jury Prize for his low-budget thriller Public Access, but the germ for his breakout hit, The Usual Suspects, originated when he and co-scripter Christopher McQuarrie discussed McQuarrie’s loose idea for the story. Public Access is the tale of a drifter who decides to host a cable show in the seemingly idyllic town of Brewster; the show quickly becomes a one-stop shop for citizen discontent, and it becomes clear there are sinister undercurrents just below the surface.Kevin SmithThe world of indie film is full of outsized personalities, but few made a bigger splash on the scene than Kevin Smith. His debut, the micro-budgeted Clerks, was filmed at the convenience store where Smith toiled, and he captured the speech patterns and daily rhythms of over-educated, underemployed slackers with remarkable clarity. Smith picked up a Filmmakers Trophy for his effort — pretty impressive for a spiritedly profane black and white feature financed by maxing out his credit cards.Wes AndersonThe Sundance shorts program has spawned a number of talented filmmakers; few, however, have made as big a splash as Wes Anderson. Bottle Rocket began life as a 13-minute short, and follows Dignan (Owen Wilson) and Anthony (Luke Wilson) as they execute a not-so-daring robbery. The short caught the attention of James L. Brooks, who discovered that Owen Wilson and Anderson had written the script for a feature. Though the full-length version would not screen at Sundance (to Anderson’s disappointment), it proved to be a cult favorite, and set the tone for Anderson’s eccentric later work, most notably Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums.Christopher NolanPark City has been good to The Dark Knight‘s helmer. His first feature, Following, was an award-winner at Slamdance in 1999. Two years later, with Memento, Nolan proved he was ready for the big time. This non-linear tale of a man searching for his wife’s killers while battling a strange type of amnesia picked up a Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award at Sundance in 2001. However, despite warm feelings, a number of distributors passed on the film, concerned it was too confusing to be embraced by audiences. The film’s production company, Newmarket, decided to distribute the film itself, and the result was an immediate cult hit — one that generated feverish debate and made Nolan a director to watch.Check out the rest of our Total Recall archives here.Finally, here’s an excerpt from a documentary about the Sundance Labs, which has cultivated a number of innovative filmmakers:","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Epix, concert, james, Showtime, PlayStation, 007, telelvision, drama, book, Elton, Kemper, Golden, Talk","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Directors-Who-Made-A-Splash-At-Sundance"},{"id":"47508993171090","title":"Total Recall: Sexy Vampires","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Sexy VampiresIn honor of Twilight, we pay tribute to some of cinema's hottest bloodsuckers.by Jen Yamato and Tim Ryan | November 19, 2008 |  CommentsThis week, the hotly-anticipated Twilight hits theaters. The film,starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the tale of young vampires inlove, got us thinking: blood suckers are sexy. Thus, we thought we’d present acompendium of some of the hottest vampires in big-screen history!more info…AaliyahAppears in: Queen of the Damned (2002)Tomatometer: 14%Six years after Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt surprised Anne Rice fans with acommercially-successful adaptation of the author’s novel Interview withthe Vampire, Warner Bros. rushed into production on a follow-up, skippingInterview’s direct sequel The Vampire Lestat in favor of shooting arevamped version of Rice’s sexier third book; the result was 2002’s Queenof the Damned, a critical and commercial failure that drew comparisons tothe Goth-pop music videos streamed on MTV. Despite all this, Queen of theDamned featured a central performance by the late R&amp;B star Aaliyah (thevictim of a tragic airplane crash six months before the film’s release) thatremains one of the sexiest, if utterly camp-tastic, vampire portrayals put tocelluloid. Scantily clad and golden-eyed as the Egyptian vampire queen Akasha— the oldest and most powerful of all vampires on earth — Aaliyah slitheredher way through Queen with the lithe poise of a dancer, and memorablyjoined Stuart Townsend’s Lestat in a rose petal-strewn bath that still has ussteamed. Damned to the ranks of rotten on the Tomatometer? Yes. Queen of thesexiest vampire movies in history? Undoubtedly.more info…Kate BeckinsaleAppears in: Underworld (2003),Underworld: Evolution (2006)Tomatometer: 27%, 14%As if Kate Beckinsale needed to do anything more than slink into a blackleather bodysuit, her Selene in 2003’s Underworld possessessuperhuman strength, packs major firepower, and has a taste for blood — theultimate lethal, sexy succubus. The only thing that could make this vampiresexier? Her steamy forbidden romance with one Michael Corvinus (Scott Speedman),the human-turned-werewolf who happens to be the newfound enemy of her people.That the camera in both Underworld and its 2006 sequel, Underworld:Evolution, near-fetishizes Selene’s every move doesn’t hurt (director LenWiseman begun dating his star halfway through filming on Underworldand married her in 2004). While the next Underworld installment, Riseof the Lycans, will go Beckinsale-less — it’s a prequel story starringRhona Mitra and Michael Sheen, Beckinsale’s real-life ex — look for herhugely anticipated return to the vampire lady assassin role in a rumoredfourth Underworld film.more info…Anne ParillaudAppears in: Innocent Blood(1992)Tomatometer: 42%This gangster/vampire hybrid from John Landis failed to excite the critics,who found it to be an uneasy marriage between supernatural and crime dramatropes, with an excess of gore. However, there’s a good reason to see it: AnneParillaud, who plays a Pittsburgh blood-sucker that gets in over her head whenshe fails in the contract killing of a crime boss, who becomes one of theundead himself. Parillaud, hot off a supporting role in La Femme Nikita,didn’t quite crack the American market with Innocent Blood, but herperformance as a sex-and-blood crazed vampire turned some genre fans’ heads.more info…Catherine DeneuveAppears in: The Hunger (1983)Tomatometer: 44%Long on atmosphere but short on plot, Tony Scott’s debut, The Hunger,is still remembered for Catherine Deneuve’s performance as of the sexiestvampires in movie history. Deneuve stars as Miriam Blaylock, who looksterrific given the fact that she’s been feasting on human blood since the daysof King Tut. John (David Bowie), her longtime companion, is on death’s door,aging decades in hours. He turns to an attractive young doctor named SarahRoberts (Susan Sarandon) who is baffled by his condition; when she turns up atJohn’s house, Miriam is waiting, and decides Sarah might make a suitablereplacement. Critics felt that the love scene between Deneuve and Sarandon wasone of the few reasons to see The Hunger, but for many, that’s reasonenough. Plus, The Hunger provided young Goths with one of their mosttreasured love songs — “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” by Bauhaus.more info…Vampyros LesbosAppears in: Vampyros Lesbos (1970)Tomatometer: 50%A classic of Eurotrash exploitation cinema, Vampyros Lesbos has aclassy veneer that belies its seedy subject matter. Vampyros starsthe beautiful Soledad Miranda in one of her last roles (she died in 1970 in anauto accident) as Nadine, a vampire that haunts the dreams of American lawyerLinda Westinghouse (Ewa Stromberg), who is tasked with handling Nadine’sinheritance. Linda is both attracted to Nadine and scared of her — after all,she is a sexy vampire. In retooling Bram Stoker’s short story Dracula’sGuest for the psychedelic era, director Jesus Franco concocted abrightly-colored soft-core fantasyland, with cheesy freak-out camera work,beautiful Turkish locales, and a sitar-mad, way-too-funky soundtrack thatQuentin Tarantino memorably cribbed for a key scene in Jackie Brown.In terms of both eroticism and scares, Vampyros Lesbos might seemtame by today’s standards, but it’s still pretty hot.more info…Tom Cruise and Brad PittAppear in: Interview with the Vampire (1994)Tomatometer: 59%Critics were split on Neil Jordan’s adaptation of Anne Rice’s bestselling vampire chronicle, but there was one demographic that was thoroughly impressed: the ladies. Starring Tom Cruise at the height of his powers, and Brad Pitt on the way up, Interview with the Vampire was, for the fairer gender, a gothic nightmare and a dream come true all at once. Cruise played Lestat, the merciless bloodsucker who leads despondent Louis (Pitt) to the dark side; Louis is conflicted, but later decides to sink his teeth into his new lifestyle, bringing a young girl (played by Kirsten Dunst) along for the ride. If some found the violence to be a little much, that didn’t stop Interview posters from lining the walls of female dorm rooms across the country.more info…Salma HayekAppears in: From Dusk Til Dawn (1996)Tomatometer: 66%In Robert Rodriguez’s From Dusk Till Dawn, George Clooney andco-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino play a pair of bank-robbing brothers on therun from the law. While cooling their heels in a boarder gin house (the nameof which is unprintable in a family website), the brothers gaze lovingly uponthe exotically-monikered Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek), the bar’s mainattraction. She’s something to behold: a dancer who’s minimally clothed, savefor a giant snake, she’s also got a taste for blood — which she shares withthe rest of the establishment’s employees. From Dusk Till Dawn was abreakout role for Hayek, and it’s not hard to see why: she makes sharp teethlook hot, and brings new meaning to the term “snake charmer.”more info…Jason PatricAppears in: The Lost Boys (1987)Tomatometer: 77%Joel Schumacher’s 1987 cult classic The Lost Boys had more than a fewmagic elements going for it: a gang of modern-day punk vamps, a hunky21-year-old Jason Patric (or, if you prefer, a hunky 21-year-old KieferSutherland), and the two Coreys! The comedy-horror tale of brothers (CoreyHaim and Patric) who stumble upon a network of vampires in a seasideCalifornia town benefited from its teen idol cast — which included actressJami Gertz in her hottie heyday — as much as it did from theeternally-quotable Frog brothers (played by Jamie Newlander and CoreyFeldman). But Patric’s tortured, drool-worthy performance as the half-vampireMichael (not to mention his sweltering love scene with Gertz’ Star) earned hima spot on our Tiger Beat-plastered walls — and made us think we wouldn’t minddrinking a little vampire blood wine ourselves.more info…Monica BellucciAppears in: Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1992)Tomatometer: 81%Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Francis Ford Coppola’s sensuous vampire flick,makes a key point about the Count: It’s not the worst gig in the world. Sure,you have to suck blood, live in the dark, and avoid garlic, but there’s hardlya shortage of female companionship. In BSD, Dracula (Gary Oldman) ishot for Mina (Winona Ryder) and Lucy (Sadie Frost), but when he’s not ravaginginnocents, he’s got three hot wives waiting at home — among them MonicaBellucci, who made her English language debut here. Despite theirvivaciousness, however, the brides come with a downside: they’re alwaysnagging the poor count to get them more blood.&nbsp;If you’re new to the world of Twilight and could use a quick primeron the major players, check out our Twilight Character Guidehere.

It’s almost Halloween, gang, and you know what that means — there’s a new Saw sequel heading for a theater near you!In honor of the imminent Saw V, your pals at RT decided it would be fun to compile a list of some of the most iconic serial killers in horror film history. You’ll find Freddy and Jason here, of course, but we’ve also made room for a few less obvious choices, and dug up clips of the whole rogue’s gallery in all their gory glory. Let the slashing begin!more info…JawsHaunting grounds: The Jaws seriesEstimated Body Count: low teensMost of the slashers on our list are bona fide film icons, but few of them can boast of having changed the entire industry the way Peter Benchley’s great white shark did: Before Jaws‘ 1975 debut, studios actually held their big films out of the summer market, believing the vacation months to be a commercial graveyard. Almost $500 million (and lots of bloody ocean water) later, a franchise was born — and although the third and fourth installments aren’t good for much besides unintentional humor, the original remains a certified classic with a 100 percent Tomatometer rating. And it’s no wonder, really — as Benchley knew, the ocean is scary enough even without a gigantic bloodthirsty shark chasing you around.more info…LeatherfaceHaunting grounds: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre seriesEstimated Body Count: 12The twisted true-life tale of grave robber Ed Gein has inspired many notable cinematic grotesques, from Norman Bates in Psycho to Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs. However, Tobe Hooper may have done the most to immortalize Gein in the annals of perverse pop culture by emphasizing his habit of making clothing out of human flesh. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced Leatherface, a developmentally disabled fellow under the control of his cannibalistic family. Though he started out as a pretty timid guy who was as afraid of visitors as they were of him, Leatherface came out of his shell in the sequel, making up for lost time in liberally employing his Poulan 306A.more info…Norman BatesHaunting grounds: The Psycho seriesEstimated Body Count: 15Has there ever been a cinematic slasher more pitiable than Norman Bates? The poor guy is practically at war with himself, and his mom nags him from beyond the grave. Heck, every time he makes friends, they seem to end up dead. If Psycho exerted a profound influence on the slasher genre (and onscreen violence in general), it wasn’t because Norman was a particularly prolific killer. Alfred Hitchcock’s original (and the sequels) depicted a man in the clutches of inner torment and madness that was so gripping and scary that it didn’t need buckets of blood (or, in one memorable case, chocolate syrup) to be deeply unsettling.more info…The CreeperHaunting grounds: The Jeepers Creepers seriesEstimated Body Count: 20When Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer wrote “Jeepers Creepers” in the late 1930s, they surely never guessed their snappy little pop ditty would go on to provide the theme song for a murderous winged creature who possesses a bee-and-dog-like ability to smell fear and can regenerate body parts by ingesting those of his victims. And that’s not all — the Creeper can also overcome overwhelmingly negative reviews, too! Although critics kept 2001’s Jeepers Creepers from a Fresh certification, the Creeper was back just two years later with a sequel, and a third installment is scheduled for next year. Not bad for a bad guy who’s limited to a single 23-day feeding frenzy every 23 years, right?more info…Hannibal LecterHaunting grounds:Manhunter,The Silence of the Lambs,Red Dragon,Hannibal,Hannibal RisingEstimated Body Count: 21Before 1991, you may not have even known what fava beans were — but after Anthony Hopkins’ first appearance as Doctor Hannibal “The Cannibal” Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, nobody ever thought of them the same way again. (Seriously: Google “fava beans,” and underneath a handful of recipes, you’ll see a link to the famous clip where Lecter recalls what has become arguably his most famous dining experience.) Like Jason Voorhees, Lecter doesn’t appear in much of this reboot — he’s only in a little over 15 minutes of Lambs — but audiences had a clear, um, appetite for the flesh-craving serial killer’s brand of mayhem, and he’s since gone on to appear in a number of other books and movies. A fansite dedicated to the good doctor puts his body count at 21 — although it’s been awhile since his creator, author Thomas Harris, has published a new account of his adventures.more info…The ThingHaunting grounds:The Thing From Another World,The ThingEstimated Body Count: 22Human beings have long been fascinated with outer space, and what might be lurking there — which helps to explain the enduring appeal of John W. Campbell’s 1938 short story, Who Goes There?, about a malevolent alien rescued from an icy grave by an Antarctic research team, and goes on to repay the favor by forcibly (and messily) assimilating every living creature within reach, including 22 unlucky scientists and a handful of dogs. Campbell’s creature — referred to as the Thing — has provided rich fodder for filmmakers over the decades, inspiring both 1951’s The Thing from Another World and John Carpenter’s 1982 cult classic, simply titled The Thing. Another remake is currently under development, proving that no matter how things change, audiences will always have room for an extraterrestrial with an axe to grind.more info…GhostfaceHaunting grounds: The Scream seriesEstimated Body Count: 25One of the rare slasher antagonists who’s a killer-by-committee, Ghostface terrorizes the self-referntial Scream series with a revolving door of mask-donning, knife-wielding psychopaths. Their motives are different (peer pressure, revenge, etc.), but the results are the same, no matter who wears the Edward Munch-inspired getup: teenagers will turn up dead, following the conventions of horror movies. And, as with other horror franchises, the body count goes up from the original to the sequel; in all, this council of killers is responsible for at least 25 slayings.more info…FateHaunting grounds: The Final Destination seriesEstimated Body Count: 28Remember the old margarine commercials that said you can’t fool Mother Nature? Well, according to the Final Destination series, you can’t cheat Fate, either. It’s often said that revenge is a dish best served cold — but for the unseen hand of Fate, it tastes even better when garnished with a series of incredibly brutal (and, it must be said, very morbidly entertaining) booby traps. According to the Final Destination Wikipedia entry, the series’ unseen antagonist has dispatched 28 victims, using everything from the mundane (death by falling brick) to the cleverly rewind-worthy (shower cord strangulation, ladder through the eye, death by falling cherry picker). With a fourth installment scheduled for 2009 (in hi-def 3-D, even!), audiences can expect to see even more attractive young people cut down in their prime in fiendishly inventive ways.more info…ChuckyHaunting grounds: The Child’s Play seriesEstimated Body Count: 30Chucky may have devolved into a pint-sized Tony Clifton at this point, but the original Child’s Play was a superior genre piece — creepy, suspenseful, and blessed with an insidious sense of humor. Child’s Play riffed on the idea of innocence gone horribly wrong, with a quasi-Cabbage Patch Kid embodied by a vicious serial killer with the help of a voodoo ritual. Subsequent sequels have delivered more camp than scares, but Chucky’s left a trail of more than 30 corpses in his wake — and probably didn’t enamor himself to Teddy Ruxpin.more info…PinheadHaunting grounds: The Hellraiser seriesEstimated Body Count: 35By the late 1980s, the slasher genre was starting to feel a little stale — and then along came Pinhead, the sadomasochistic leader of the extradimensional pack of hooligans known as the Cenobites. The spike-headed hook fetishist wasn’t featured heavily in 1987’s Hellraiser, but Pinhead’s combination of creepy appearance, selective taste for victims, and clear fondness for gruesome torture stole the movie; throughout the eight-film series (four of which were released straight to DVD), Pinhead has remained the only constant. And for good reason: Although his body count may be relatively low — Joe’s Little Horror Place puts it at 35 “so far” — no one else can match his way with a sharp, well-placed hook.more info…JigsawHaunting grounds: The Saw seriesEstimated Body Count: 40John Kramer must be a huge fan of Se7en. As the Jigsaw Killer, he specializes in setting elaborate Rube Goldberg-style traps for those he feels take life for granted, and then tasks them with attempting to escape, with regularly grisly results. Dressed like a carnival barker and often confined to a wheelchair, Jigsaw uses his wits more than sharp objects, but the results are often bloodier as a result — he’s perhaps the preeminent slasher antihero for the torture-porn era.more info…Freddy KrugerHaunting grounds: The Nightmare seriesEstimated Body Count: 42Perhaps the 1980s’ most recognizable movie monster, Freddy Kruger may not be able to compete with other horror icons for killing in bulk. But the dermatologically-challenged Elm Street resident certainly wins points for style; in addition to his expert use of claw-tipped leather gloves, Freddy is adept at shape-shifting, strangulation, and generating geysers of blood from the bodies of future heartthrobs. The whimsically-monikeredHead Injury Theater provides an incomplete but still perversely engrossing rundown of Freddy’s ghastly work, and charges Mr. Kurger with 42 counts of homicide.more info…LeprechaunHaunting grounds: The Leprechaun seriesEstimated Body Count: 45The Leprechaun series is the embodiment of the finest that Irish culture and letters has to offer, easily surpassing the works of James Joyce and Oscar Wilde. The titular antihero is murderously committed to acquiring a pot o’ gold, an undertaking that prompts travel to such exotic locales as Compton and outer space. The fanpage Connie’s Warwick Davis Fanpage and Leprechaun Center has a remarkably detailed chronicle of the little green guy’s deadly exploits; despite his diminutive stature, the Leprechaun’s super-sharp claws and teeth have helped him tally 45 onscreen fatalities.more info…Michael MyersHaunting grounds: The Halloween seriesEstimated Body Count: 56The best-known escapee of Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, Michael Myers has never been a big fan of babysitters, nor is he particularly fleet of foot. He digs Blue Oyster Cult, and makes special use of Star Trek paraphernalia and kitchen cutlery. Since the release of John Carpenter’s landmark Halloween, Myers’ legend has been told in a number of sequels, and if his reasons for killing are obscure, he’s still coldly efficient at the task; he’s racked up 56 notches on his belt, according to Houseofhorrors.com.more info…Jason VoorheesHaunting grounds: The Friday the 13th seriesEstimated Body Count: 146Rocking facial protection that would do Jacques Plante proud, Jason Vorhees terrorized Camp Crystal Lake with cold precision and an ability to avoid death that rivals Rasputin’s in Friday the 13th. Occasionally breaking out of the bucolic confines of the countryside to wreak havoc in the big city (Part VI: Jason Takes Manhattan, Hades (Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday) and the future (Jason X). According to the absurdly detailed website Fridaythe13thfilms.com, Jason put 146 unfortunate souls on ice (with another 42 self-inflicted or accidental deaths within the series). Pretty impressive for a cat who died from drowning in 1958.Still feeling spooky, and all together a little ooky?

Plus, reading this list means you might learn to stay off some crusty old guy’s lawn — making the neighborhood a happier place for all.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nRoyal Tenenbaum, The Royal Tenenbaums\nCruelly manipulative, casually racist, and capable of remarkably cold put-downs, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) is the little-loved patriarch of a family of eccentrics. He’s left a wide swath of pain in his wake — from his brisk dismissal of step-daughter Margot’s precocious theater work to blasting son Chas in the hand with a BB gun. As he attempts to re-ingratiate himself with his estranged clan, Royal shows a softer side — even if he can’t help but be a mean old codger much of the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nMr. Hand, Fast Times at Ridgemont High\nJeff Spicoli (Sean Penn) could not be as memorable a stoner if it weren’t for the adversity supplied by history teacher Mr. Hand (Ray Walston). Convinced everyone is on dope, Mr. Hand trusts no one — though he’s happy to hand out Spicoli’s double cheese and sausage pizza when the order arrives. (Only to his favorites in class, of course.) Sharpened and bitter from years of teaching the indolents of Ridgemont High, Mr. Hand (played by the actor formerly known as “My Favorite Martian”) was not wholly lacking in a dark sense of humor. After all, he did offer Spicoli a mandatory and impromptu history tutorial that lasted just long enough to make Spicoli late for the prom. (“You guys wouldn’t want me to go to your house and discuss U.S. history on your time, would you?”)\n\nMore info…\n\n\nJohn Gustafson and Max Goldman, Grumpy Old Men\nJohn (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) are proof that not everyone mellows with age. These neighbors have resented each other for years, ever since John won the affections of Max’s first love. Despite being a bit long in the tooth for such antics, John and Max have maintained a veritable Spy vs. Spy-esque prank war for years, which include bouts of verbal put-downs and the careful placement of dead fish. Things escalate when the pair vies for the attention of Ariel (Ann-Margaret), and the result is the destruction of a perfectly good ice hut. (Matthau gets bonus curmudgeon points for joining forces with Ossie Davis in the crabfest I’m Not Rappaport.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info…\n\n\nJudge Smalls, Caddyshack\nThe Fresca-offering, satisfaction-demanding Judge Smalls (Ted Knight) was one of the founders of the Bushwood Country Club, and he’s none too pleased by the miscreants currently making hay with his beloved game (and don’t get him started on the gophers wreaking havoc on the fairways). A stern jurist in the courtroom, Smalls is a death penalty proponent, and probably wishes he could use capital punishment on wisecracking Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). In addition to his lack of amusement with the antics of those around him, Smalls nearly kills a woman flinging his putter in disgust, and attempts to renege on a giant bet after ladies’ man Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) defeats him on the links. Still, Smalls speaks for curmudgeons the world over when he says, “You’ll get nothing and like it!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead about Clint Eastwood’s best directorial efforts here.

The fact that Christopher Nolan will one day not be atthe directorial helm. The Bat has seen more hands pass through it than any othercomic book franchise, guided as low as the final days of the JoelSchumacher era, and reaching peaks like Nolan’s successful attempts inlegitimizing the genre. With The Dark Knight dropping this Friday, evacuatingAmerica of its pent-up superhero demand like teenage timebombs, Rotten Tomatoesis exploring the storied theatrical history of Batman.&nbsp;more info…Batman: The Movie (1966, 80%)Who’s the Bat? Adam WestThe villains: The Penguin, The Riddler, The Joker, Catwoman. (Holy multipleconundrum!)&nbsp;For a Batman interpretation frequently derided for itscampiness, Batman: The Movie has a surprisingly high number of quotable linesand memorable scenes. Remember how the dynamic duo deduce that all theirarchenemies — Penguin, Catwoman, The Riddler, and The Joker — are workingtogether to take over the world? Or the insane logic Robin consistentlyapplies to Riddler’s questions that always turn out to be right? But the bestbit has to be the one highlighted below. It involves bat ladders, sharkrepellent Bat-spray, and a high seas encounter with an exploding Megalodon.“Holy Cornball Camp, Batman!” exclaims Scott Weinberg, “This movie’s a hoot!”more info…Batman (1989, 69%)Who’s the Bat? Michael KeatonThe villain: The Joker&nbsp;One of the most hyped movies in Hollywood history, and one of the finestexamples of movie tie-ins and cross-promotion (so successful it made t-shirtbootleggers filthy rich), Batman is also one of the weirdestevent pictures of all time. Director Tim Burton jettisoned the plots (if notthe dark tone) of Bob Kane’s original comics, and came up a picture with setdesigns reminiscent of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and freakish, broodingcharacters similar to… well, a Tim Burton movie. Particularly compelling isJack Nicholson as the Joker, who gleefully relishes his plan to kill thecitizens of Gotham City with lethal gas. Michael Keaton makes for a subduedDark Knight, a hero who dispenses vigilante justice while living a moroseexistence in Wayne Manor. A precursor to more complex comic book adaptations,Batman made piles of money, and the bat-logo was ubiquitous in thesummer of 1989. “Burton brings back film noir elements to the new Batman,elevating it to a dark, demented opera,” wrote Jeffrey Anderson of CombustibleCelluloid.&nbsp;more info…Batman Returns (1992, 79%)Who’s the Bat? Michael KeatonThe villains: The Penguin, Catwoman&nbsp;Tim Burton has said he always sympathized with monsters, and so, for hissequel to Batman, he gave audiences not one, but two empathetic,pitiable villains. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) is a deformed orphan who leadsan army of aquatic, flightless birds from the bowels of Gotham City. TheCatwoman (Michelle Pfeifer) is a frumpy secretary who is killed by her boss(Christopher Walken) after she learns of his evil schemes but is brought backto life by a group of cats. Teaming up against Batman, the pair plans anassault on the city above. Batman Returns is so cold and dark it makesthe first installment look like Amelie by comparison, but that’s notnecessarily a bad thing; it still made a killing at the box office, and wasBurton’s favorite of the two Batman movies he helmed. “Of all the Batman pictures, this is the most striking, atmospheric and effective,”wrote David Keyes of Cinemaphile.org.more info…Batman:Mask of the Phantasm (1994, 87%)Who’s the Bat? Kevin ConroyThe villains: The Phantasm, The Joker&nbsp;Before the Nolan Batman movies, Mask of the Phantasm wasthe most articulate exploration of the Bruce Wayne character. While the movietakes the action that made The Animated Series such great afternoon fun andexpands it (but avoiding cheap, empty thrills that having a big budget canafford you), it also showers loving detail on a pivotal romance in Bruce’slife and an affecting scene of Bruce begging for release at his parents’gravestone. It’s the rare movie that shows its protagonist for what he is:essentially insane. “[Mask of the Phantasm] managed to soar above thetheatrical Batman adaptation,” states Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures, “And wouldremain the best Bat Movie to hit the big screens until Batman Beginsshook things up in 2005.”more info…Batman Forever (1995, 40%)Who’s the Bat? Val KilmerThe villains: The Riddler, Two-FaceOne can draw a fairly direct line from the 1966 Batman to Joel Schumacher’smid-series reboot. Garish colors. Some tongue-in-cheek dialogue. The presenceof Robin to draw in the young’uns. This may not be a great Batman movie, butit is a successful one — drawing in a legion of new viewers while shift theseries away from the twisted mindscape of Tim Burton (whose movies weren’tthat representative of the comics anyways). And if you were the at the rightage, there was nothing more fun in 1995 than this (except getting aPlayStation probably). It’s “a free-form playground for its variousmasquerading stars,” wrote Janet Maslin for The New York Times.&nbsp;more info…Batman &amp; Robin (1997, 12% Tomatometer)Who’s the Bat? George ClooneyThe villains: Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, BaneOne of the least-loved blockbusters of recent years, Batman &amp; Robinbrought the Batman 1.0 franchise to a screeching halt. Unlike theearlier installments, which returned the Caped Crusader to his brooding noirroots, Batman &amp; Robin was a veritable camp-o-rama, closer in spirit tothe 1960s TV series. Utilizing punny dialogue to a jaw-dropping degree werevillains Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze (“Ice to see you!”) and UmaThurman as Poison Ivy (“My garden needs tending”). Even George Clooney madelittle impression as Batman, and his sidekicks (Chris O’Donnell as Robin,Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl) failed to drum up much audience or criticalenthusiasm. As a result, a planned fifth sequel, Batman Triumphant,which would have pitted our heroes against the Scarecrow, never materialized,so it was left to Christopher Nolan to resurrect the series. “Fans of themovie series will be shocked at the shortage of original thought put into thisproject,” wrote John Paul Powell of Jam! Movies.&nbsp;more info…Batman Begins (2005, 84%)Who’s the Bat? Christian BaleThe villains: Ra’s al Ghul, Scarecrow&nbsp;With his lack of superpowers and a vast fortune at his disposal, Batman wasalways the most plausible of heroes. With Batman Begins, directorChristopher Nolan shucked off the direction of the previous big-screenincarnations and boiled the Batman mythos down to its essence, resulting in oneof the most realistic superhero movies ever. Thankfully, Nolan didn’tskimp on action-paced pyrotechnics, and as the suitably suave and torturedBruce Wayne, Christian Bale added a greater emotional heft to the CapedCrusader (he was also ably abetted by the likes of Morgan Freeman, MichaelCaine, Cillian Murphy, and Gary Oldman). Batman Begins signaled a boldnew beginning for the franchise, and was a huge hit with audiences and punditsalike. “It’s a wake-up call to the people who keep giving us cute capers aboutmen in tights,” wrote Kyle Smith of the New York Post. “It wipes thesmirk off the face of the superhero movie.”more info…The Rogue’s GalleryBatman&amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero (1997, 89%)Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (2000, 86%)Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman (2003)The Batman vs.Dracula (2005)Batman: Gotham Knight (2008)&nbsp;The Batman franchise has had no shortage ofdirect-to-video animated releases, the most recent being Batman: GothamKnight, an Animatrix-esque collection of anime that bridges the year gapbetween Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The other movies range from servicable to good, with Return of the Joker being the classic of thebunch.

Are we in the midst of a genre golden age?Pineapple co-star/writer Seth Rogen insists this is less a stoner movie andmore a movie with alot of smoking (and shooting) in it, which got our wheels clicking: what are the mostinteresting portrayals of marijuana users out there, and how many of them are inmovies actually classified as a stoner movie? Read on to check out RottenTomatoes’ findings, and check out the Top 10 Stoner Movies over at our sister site, IGN Movies.more info…15. Sam, Dewey Cox’s drummerAs seen in: WalkHard: The Dewey Cox Story(2007)Zen moment: “Itmakes sex even better!”Smart weed noobs know it’s best to have an experienced user around duringa first smoke sesh, and one would be hard-pressed to find a better trip guidethan Sam, Dewey Cox’s loyal drummer. In one of Walk Hard‘s many running jokes,Sam is frequently caught in flagrante with groupies, half-heartedly resistingDewey before sharing some drugs. As played by Tim Meadows, Sam lays out thepleasures of marijuana, coke, and ecstasy straight up, and, best of all, neverbacks off when the rules are broken: “You never paid for the drugs. Not evenonce!”&nbsp;&nbsp;more info…14. Floyd, the roommateAs seen in:True Romance (1993)Zen moment: “You guys wanna smoke a bowl or, uhh…”He’s hardly in the movie, but for more than a few fans of 1993’s TrueRomance, Brad Pitt’s perpetually stoned Floyd steals the show — no meanfeat for a guy who never even gets off the couch, doesn’t do much besidessmoke out of a bong made out of an empty container of honey, and has to go upagainst similarly terrific (and similarly brief) performances from ChristopherWalken, Gary Oldman, Bronson Pinchot, James Gandolfini, and Michael Rapaport.It was no accident, though — Quentin Tarantino’s script came soaked in blood,and Tony Scott’s direction added a layer of visual brilliance, but Floyd?Floyd gave us a few minutes of blissed-out humor between the gunshots.more info…13. The FreelingsAs seen in: Poltergeist(1982)Zen moment: “Just have an open mind. Reach back into our past when I used toknow you with one and use it for the next couple of minutes.”Written, produced, and virtually ghost-directed by Steven Spielberg, Poltergeistclearly comes from a personal place and it shows in the small details litteredthroughout the movie. One scene, for example, shows Mama and Papa Freeling(Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams) casually smoking, talking, and goofingaround in bed. Their marijuana use actually makes them more sympathetic ascharacters: judging by their oldest daughter’s age and the movie’s setting, theFreelings were flower children who married and had children young. It’s ajuggling act for the two to keep in touch with their youth as they settle downinto the dull suburban dream (soon to be invaded by some pissed-off,face-destroying ghosts).more info…12. Annie HallAs seen in: Annie Hall(1977)Zen moment: “You’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 15 years. You shouldsmoke some of this. You’d be off the couch in no time.”Arguably, drug portrayal in movies has different meanings in differentdecades. With Easy Rider, it opened America’s eyes to the long-gestatingcounterculture movement. The Cheech &amp; Chong series kickstarted the good timesattitude that lasted well into 80s cinema. And modern stoner classics (theHarold and Kumars, Pineapple Express) explore decriminalization and thepursuit of freedom of choice. Diane Keaton’s Annie Hall, as a rare positiveportrayal of a woman under the influence, is a brand of female empowerment, anaive New York intellectual who plagued the city at the time.more info…11. Steve ZissouAs seen in: The LifeAquatic With Steve Zissou(2004)Zen moment: “Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies invented the idea of puttingwalkie-talkies into the helmet. But we made ours with a special rabbit ear onthe top so we could pipe in some music.”Steve Zissou: oceanographer, documentary star, and self-proclaimed “showboat,and a little bit of a prick.” Wes Anderson works have a small reputation asarthouse stoner flicks (chill movies with outbursts of action, emotion, and radmusic), but The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is his only one that addressesthe issue head on. Bill Murray’s Zissou is seen regularly smoking on his seasidemisadventures, and one memorable scene has him rushing to the stern of his boatafter learning about his illegitimate son, with David Bowie’s “Life on Mars?”swelling on the soundtrack. It’s a beautiful and sad moment, portraying a brokenman resorting to his last defense against life’s little lemons.more info…10. Wayne CampbellAs seen in: Wayne’s World(1992)Zen moment: “Party on!”You never see Wayne Campbell, co-host of the most awesome public access showever, do any drugs. Hell, the issue never even comes up. But similar to TheMonkees comedies, Wayne’s World uses typically “stoner” humor while adroitlyavoiding the issue completely. The plot has hilariously bizarre tangents,people cruise around doing nothing but singing and satisfying their munchies(director Penelope Spheeris inserts a shot of a White Castle; read that howeveryou will), and Wayne and Garth have random philosophical discussions whilelooking at the sky. Or maybe that was just how the 90s were.more info…9. The Half-Baked trioAs seen in: Half-Baked (1998)Zen moment: “So y’all wanna smoke?”Most of the movies on this list include one or two stoners, but let’s hear itfor 1998’s Half Baked: Almost everyone in this critically reviled cultclassic has five on it, including Steven Wright’s “guy on the couch,” acharacter with amazing, near-total inertia. Our favorites, though, are Thurgood,Brian, and Scarface, the cheeba-selling trio played by Dave Chappelle, BrianBreuer, and Guillermo Diaz, buddies forced into dealing stolen medical marijuanain order to raise bail for their friend Kenny, who was arrested for accidentallymurdering a horse. (Look, it’s a stoner comedy. What do you want, The 400Blows?) As a film, there isn’t much to it — something critics were only toohappy to point out — and Chappelle himself was unhappy with the final script,but as the movie’s enduring popularity on the home market attests, critics andDave Chappelle don’t always know what they’re talking about.more info…8. Billy and WyattAs seen in: Easy Rider(1969)Zen moment: “It’s real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in themarketplace.”They may not bethe original movie stoners, but Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper — otherwiseknown as Wyatt and Billy, the protagonists of Easy Rider — are easilytwo of the most iconic characters to put the “bud” in “buddies”; theirspiritual freedom-seeking road trip in this 1969 feature not only gavefilmgoers a ground-level view of the counterculture, it also helped kickstartthe New Hollywood era of the early ’70s, and influenced countless futurefilmmakers in the process. In a pleasantly ironic postscript, the NationalFilm Registry added Easy Rider to its list, deeming it “culturally,historically, or aesthetically significant.” Not bad for a pair ofmotorcycle-riding hippies, man.more info…7. Bill S. Preston, Esq, &amp; Ted “Theodore” LoganAs seen in:Bill &amp; Ted’s ExcellentAdventure(1989), Bill &amp; Ted’s BogusJourney (1991)Zen moment: “Be excellent to each other.”If you were a child of the late 1980s (or plain unobservant), the Bill and Tedmovies fall into the Wayne’s World category: there’s nothing alluding toanything illicit in its humor. It’s just kinda dumb and weird and harmless,perfect for impressionable young kids. But now that we’ve all wisened up, theBill and Ted movies stick to the tenets of stoner comedy pretty closely: sillyone-liners, scatterbrained plot, and a slacker entitlement mentality thatillustrates we can be successful doing the same ridiculous things we do everyday. Ah, if only life seemed as good as when we were kids (or when we’reintoxicated).more info…6. SmokeyAs seen in: Friday(1995)Zen moment: “Weed is from the earth. God put this here for me and you. Takeadvantage man, take advantage.”All he ever does anymore is make Rush Hour movies, but onceupon a time, Chris Tucker’s biggest calling card was his turn as thestash-dipping dope dealer Smokey in this 1995 cult classic. Middle America wasterrified of South Central L.A. in the early-to-mid ’90s, thanks in part tothe ’92 riots and the music of groups like co-star Ice Cube’s old day gig,N.W.A., but the good old-fashioned weed humor and day-in-the-life plot of thescript (written by Cube and DJ Pooh) helped Friday produce a $28million return on its $3.5 million budget — not to mention a series of sequelsand Ice Cube’s budding career as a family film star. Another sequel is said tobe in the works, and like the others, it probably won’t feature Tucker — butfans continue to hope for his long-overdue return from rehab.more info…5. Jeff SpicoliAs seen in:Fast Times atRidgemont High (1982)Zen moment: “What Jefferson was saying was, ‘Hey! You know, we left thisEngland place ’cause it was bogus; so if we don’t get some cool rules ourselves— pronto — we’ll just be bogus too!’ Get it? ”Amy Heckerling’s 1982 classic is remembered for many things — CameronCrowe’s near-perfect script; early appearances from Nicolas Cage, AnthonyEdwards, Forest Whitaker, and Eric Stoltz; Phoebe Cates on the diving board —but one of the movie’s biggest, most enduring gifts to cinema was proof, in theform of the perpetually baked surfer Jeff Spicoli, that Sean Penn can beside-splittingly hilarious if he wants to. Sprinkled like brownie crumbs betweenthe movie’s more serious bits, Penn’s scenes as Spicoli –particularly those whenhe goes up against his nemesis, the sputtering Mr. Hand — provide FastTimes with some of the finest comic relief in early ’80s American cinema.Oh, gnarly!more info…4. Harold &amp; KumarAs seen in: Harold &amp; Kumar Go ToWhite Castle (2004), Harold &amp; Kumar Escapefrom Guantanamo Bay (2008)Zen moment: “The universe tends to unfold as it should.”&nbsp;Endless movies are built around the concept of the odd couple, but howmuch of an odd couple can you be when you can effortlessly blend into a crowd?Enter Harold and Kumar, a racially diverse BFF duo for our modern times. Theirenduring popularity stems from how versatile their comedy can be: as the firststoner duo in our post Cheech and Chong, Bill and Ted world; as instruments toexplore racial inequalities; and in the recent sequel, wanderers in an uncertainnation. They’re also both idiots in their own specific ways, which is alwayshilarious.more info…3. Jay &amp; Silent BobAs seen in: Clerks(1994), Mallrats(1995), Chasing Amy(1997), Dogma(1999), Jay and Silent BobStrike Back(2001), Clerks II(2006),Zen moment: “You know, there’s a million fine-looking women in the world,dude. But they don’t all bring you lasagna at work. Most of ’em just cheat onyou.”&nbsp;From the moment they appeared in 1994’s Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob —otherwise known as Monmouth County, NJ’s biggest John Hughes fans, and thescourge of any cops unlucky enough to pull duty at Quick Stop Groceries — werean instant hit. Played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, the foul-mouthedweed-dealing duo has appeared in nearly all of Smith’s films (a notableexception being Jersey Girl, and we all know how well that turnedout), even inspiring their own spinoff feature in 2001’s Jay and Silent BobStrike Back. Though they aren’t your typical movie stoners — Jay ishyperactive, and Silent Bob, when he does speak, is unfailingly profound — theyare the only characters on this list to inspire comic book charactersnamed Bluntman and Chronic.more info…2. The DudeAs seen in: The Big Lebowski(19982)Zen moment: “That rug really tied the room together.”Now what’s a drug user without a colorful cast of characters to surroundhimself with? Sure, The Dude’s (Jeff Bridges) antics are now the stuff oflegend, but there’s a reason why stoner movies usually come equipped with twomain heroes: seeing one guy do drugs is kinda depressing; seeing two or moremakes it an adventure. The Dude’s cohorts: Walter (John Goodman), an unstablemilitant, and Donny (Steve Buscemi), a spacey, good-natured doormat. The threeoccupy their own pointy end on the personality triangle, but they’re broughttogether through one shared, common belief: “That rug really tied the roomtogether.”more info…1. Cheech &amp; ChongAs seen in:Up in Smoke(1978)Zen moment: “Responsibility is a heavy responsibility.”Chronologically speaking, they may not be the grandfathers of cinematicstoners, but who cares? Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong elevated self-medicatinghumor to an art form, first through a series of popular albums, then asuccession of top-grossing movies, including Up in Smoke (47 percent), NiceDreams (50 percent), and Still Smokin’ (17 percent). Critics,obviously, have never had much use for the duo’s leafy brand of humor, but thathasn’t stopped Cheech &amp; Chong from enjoying long-running careers in televisionand film. Marin left for not-so-green pastures in the mid-’80s, expressing adesire to branch out into non-marijuana-related areas, but he and Chong are backtogether again — they recently announced plans to reunite for a tour.Check out past editions of Total Recall in our column archives.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"based, supernatural, CW","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-15-memorable-movie-stoners"},{"id":"47508994716319","title":"Total Recall: Jet Li’s Best-Reviewed Films","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Jet Li's Best-Reviewed FilmsWe celebrate the best work of the famed wushu champ and Mummy star.by Ryan Fujitani and Tim Ryan | July 30, 2008 |  CommentsThis week, with The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor hitting theaters, we thought it would be a great time to take a close look at the filmography of star Jet Li, one of the most dynamic and successful martial arts performers of recent years.Born in Beijing, Li Lianjie was wushu champion at an absurdly young age (he was dubbed “Jet” because of his quickness and power). Retiring from competition at 17, he utilized his formidable martial arts skills in a series of epic films based upon Chinese legends. But it isn’t just his athletic grace and power that has impressed audiences; Li exudes a hard-to-quantify stoicism and intensity in his performances that lend a greater level of emotional heft than your typical martial arts master. Although his Western films haven’t enjoyed the level of popularity he received in Hong Kong, he’s still a draw, as this year’s The Forbidden Kingdom proves. Without further ado, we present Li’s best-reviewed films.more info…10. Once Upon a Time in China 3(1992, 67 percent)The third time was definitely not the charm for this venerable series. Li is back as Wong Fei Hung, and this time he’s embroiled in a whole mess of drama: he’s participating in a brutal kung fu competition, he has to stop an assassination attempt on the president, and he has to keep a whole lotta gangsters from ripping him to shreds. Critics found OUATIC 3 to be a serious letdown after the dazzling inventiveness of the first two films, and some of that might have been because of on-set tensions; Li and director Tsui Hark, who had helmed the first two installments, acrimoniously parted ways after III (they’ve since made up). Still, even at the ebb of their collaboration, Hark’s visual flair and Li’s athletic prowess elevate III above most martial arts fare. The film has a “strong blend of humor, action and drama,” wrote Doug Pratt of DVDLaser.com.more info…9. The Defender(1994, 71 percent)The Defender (aka The Bodyguard from Beijing) found Li in a quasi-remake of The Bodyguard; it was a vehicle that allowed Li to put his skills to use in a contemporary setting after a long stretch of period epics (the movie kicked off Li’s “gun-fu” period). It also allowed him to show his softer, more romantic side. Directed by Corey Yuen, The Defender is the story of Allan (Li), an elite bodyguard who’s tasked with protecting Michelle, the mistress of a rich businessman, after she’s the only witness in a brutal mob slaying. At first, Michelle bristles at being sequestered in her apartment, but soon she comes to respect Allan’s efforts to keep her safe, and romance blossoms. The Defender is loaded with shootouts, double-crossings, and some wacky humor — and even if the critics may have found the plot a bit predictable, “All this is made up for by the sheer visceral pleasure of Jet Li’s charisma,” as James Rocchi of Netflix put it. Unfortunately, audiences weren’t as forgiving, as The Defender was one of Li’s first big flops in Hong Kong.more info…8. Fearless(2006, 74 percent)If, as Li has claimed, Fearless is indeed his last wushu epic, he went out with a bang. Directed by Ronny Yu and choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping, Fearless is loosely based upon the life of martial arts legend Huo Yuanjia (also the basis for the master in Fist of Legend). Set in the early 1900s, Fearless tells the story of how Huo became one of the most famous fighters in China — before his arrogance got the best of him. After a series of personal (and near fatal) hardships, Huo is nursed back to health by a kindly woman in a remote community; it’s there that he realizes that the noble martial arts he has studied have become corrupted by brutality; he seeks to make good on his early promise, clear his family’s name, and restore China to the forefront of fighting. Though the critics found Fearless less impressive than Li’s early 1990s epics, they still found plenty of emotional and spiritual heft in addition to several excellent action scenes. “The film is about more than complex stunts and breathtaking acrobatics,” wrote Forrest Harman of the Reno Journal-Gazette. “It’s about a man who learns the pitfalls of pride and becomes a national hero in the process. And it’s a good time at the movies.”more info…7. The Legend of the Swordsman(1991, 75 percent)The Legend of the Swordsman (also known as Swordsman II was Li’s highest-grossing Hong Kong film, and following the success of the Shaolin Temple series, it cemented his status as the king of the period martial arts epic. In this sequel to 1990’s Swordsman, Li steps into the role of Ling (played in the previous installment by Sam Hui), who is relocating his martial arts school to a remote mountain locale. However, he discovers that his friends, a group of female fighters, have been attacked, and Princess Yin-Yin (on whom he’s totally crushed out) has been kidnapped, by her evil uncle, who also has a scroll that outlines plenty of killer martial arts moves. Colorful, well-photographed, with a complex plot and plenty of gravity-defying fights, Legend of the Swordsman is considered a classic of the genre by many devotes. The movie contains “dazzling photography and equally dazzling fight scenes,” said Robert Roten of Laramie Movie Scope.more info…6. Twin Warriors(1993, 83 percent)The plot of Twin Warriors (also known as Tai Chi Master) may be as old as the hills, but it continued Li’s winning streak, thanks to its electric, nimble set pieces and the able support of fellow martial arts legend (and Tomb of the Dragon Emperor co-star) Michele Yeoh. Junbao (Li) and Tienbo (Chin Sui Ho) are close friends and fellow monks who are expelled from a Shaolin temple for their troublemaking ways. Soon, they’ve gone their separate ways; Tienbo has become a powerful, despotic military head, and Li, with help from Siu Lin (Yeoh) is engaged in an uprising against him. Like many of Li’s period martial arts extravaganzas from this period, Twin Warriors is both opulent and exhilarating, and features an absolutely bonkers finale in which Tienbo literally uses an army of thousands of extras as weapons against Junbao. “Nonstop action leads to furiously ingenious set pieces shot with the traditional wire harnesses and outlandish effects,” wrote Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle.more info…The Legend(1993, 89 percent)One good turn as a Chinese folk hero deserves another, so for 1993’s The Legend (or, if you prefer the original title, Fong Sai-yuk), Li suited up as — you guessed it — Fong Sai-yuk, the legendary 18th century hero. Tempering all the sweeping melodrama here is a plot that focuses on Fong’s younger years, when he was more concerned with loafing — and chasing after an illicit affair with the Manchu governor’s daughter — than concentrating on nobler pursuits. Fortunately, his mother is around to help keep him out of trouble; unfortunately, according to legend, his mom was such a formidable warrior that she regularly broke Fong’s bones in an effort to make him nearly invulnerable. Painful as that sounds, The Legend (which satirized the Once Upon a Time in China series) extended Li’s stellar track record at the box office, proving so successful that a sequel (titled, naturally, Fong Sai-yuk II) was produced in time to reach theaters the same year.&nbsp;more info…Once Upon a Time in China(1991, 89 percent)At once entertaining, culturally significant, and massively successful at the box office, Once Upon a Time in China helped kick off the resurgence of period martial arts movies that started in the 1990s, as well as spawning a franchise that saw Li play Chinese folk hero Wong Fei Hung repeatedly throughout the decade, starring in the series’ second, third, and sixth installments, as well as the spoofy spinoff Last Hero in China. Though criticized for straying into outlandish territory, Once Upon a Time nonetheless explores China’s early attempts to bridge the gap between tradition and modernization, examines social taboos, and — of course — contains more than a few terrific fight scenes. “Aided immeasurably by the acrobatic skills of its brilliant star, Once Upon A Time in China delivers the kinetic goods,” wrote Bilge Ebiri of Citysearch.more info…3. Once Upon a Time in China II(1992, 93 percent)Just a year after raking in healthy box-office receipts with Once Upon a Time in China, Li returned as the legendary Wong Fei Hung in the first sequel — and managed to outdo the first installment, grossing over $30 million during its Hong Kong theatrical run. Like the first chapter in the saga, Once Upon a Time in China II combines eye-popping martial arts action with a lesson in Chinese history; this time around, the storyline is based on events that transpired around the Boxer Rebellion that took place after the first Sino-Japanese War. Don’t worry, though — even if you slept through your world history courses, you’ll still be able to enjoy watching Li whoop copious amounts of bad guy butt (including HK superstar Donnie Yen). “More concentrated and svelte than its precursor, Once Upon a Time II also has the benefit of fights staged by Master Yuen Woo-Ping that show Jet Li — another camera-age hero — to even greater advantage,” wrote J. Hoberman of the Village Voice.&nbsp;more info…2. Hero(2004, 95 percent)Hero was a massive success in Hong Kong when it was released in December 2002, but that didn’t stop Miramax — the studio that held American rights to the film — from sitting on it for nearly two years, delaying its release six times. It took Quentin Tarantino‘s pull to get Hero into American theaters, and when it finally debuted in August 2004, it took the box office crown for the week, earning over $18 million and a spot among the highest-grossing foreign films in U.S. history. Critics enjoyed Hero almost as much as audiences, sending it to 95 percent on the Tomatometer — but their praise wasn’t quite universal. Though the movie’s visual beauty is impossible to deny, some have taken issue with what they see as a tacit approval of totalitarianism. Don’t care about politics? Not to worry — Hero comes equipped with enough wire-assisted fighting to slake your thirst for epic martial arts action. “The simple fact of the matter is this: Hero is the best martial arts movie I have ever seen,” wrote David Cornelius of Efilmcritic.com.more info…1. Fist of Legend(1994, 100 percent)Li was already an established star when he signed on for Fist of Legend — but still, it takes more than a little chutzpah to remake a classic like Bruce Lee‘s Fists of Fury. Fortunately, the results speak for themselves; at 100 percent on the Tomatometer, Legend is not only Li’s highest-rated film, but it’s entered the pantheon of established martial arts classics. And for good reason: Although there’s plenty of good old-fashioned action, the movie also makes room for a suitably twisty plot, as well as some important themes (including an updated take on the racism that fueled the original) and fight scenes so good that they convinced the Wachowski brothers to hire choreographer Yuen Woo-ping for The Matrix. It isn’t his highest-grossing film — in fact, it was something of a box-office disappointment — but any argument for Jet Li’s status as a martial arts movie superstar should begin with Fist of Legend. “[It’s] a marvel to watch,” wrote Ryan Cracknell of the Apollo Guide.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"documentaries, true, BBC, to, comics, Pictures, toronto, theme, police, Pirates, hidden, APB, American, Hallmark","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-jet-lis-best-reviewed-films"},{"id":"47508994723490","title":"Total Recall: The 10 Best Superhero Hookups","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: The 10 Best Superhero HookupsBecause caped crusaders need love, too.by RT Staff | July 9, 2008 |  CommentsNo doubt Hellboy and Liz Sherman turn heads while playingfrolf at the park, or at IKEA when looking for mid-priced dressers. Superheroesmay be unusual, but, hey, even the unusual need relationships. And these twohave picked the best summer for their blockbuster love: between the rekindledsenior romance of Indy and Marion, the sight of Israeli and Palestinian stylistsknocking combs, and the sweet purity of Wall-E and EVE, it’s been a long seasonof unusual relationships. Perfect for superheroes in love. In tribute to HellboyII: The Golden Army, here’s Rotten Tomatoes’ list of the mostmemorable superhero hookups done in Movieopolis.Warning: NSFW — language.more info…10. Bluntman and ChronicAs seen in: Jayand Silent Bob Strike Back(2001)Like their “real-life” counterparts Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (KevinSmith), these superhero buddies live by their own version of the force: ashared love for Mary Jane. Wielding their bluntsabers side by side, Bluntmanand his loyal sidekick Chronic spring from the pages of Banky and Holden’scomic in Kevin Smith’s Chasing Amy, then get the Hollywood treatment intheir film-within-a-film in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. With A-listschmucks Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek set to ruin the duo’s good name,Jay and Silent Bob arrive just in time to film a pivotal fight against theevil Cocknocker (Mark Hamill) with a cry of “Snootchie bootchies!” Justremember, they’re not gay; they’re (super) hetero life partners. Man love canbe a beautiful thing.more info…9. Green Ranger and Pink RangerAs seen in:Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995)The kids who didn’t have MTV were a desperate lot. Unable to quoteneither Beavis nor Butthead during school lunch, they would take up anypassing interest — pogs, video games, even those Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.But amidst the cheesy costumes and dollar-store pyrotechnics was the show’sconsistent romance between Tommy, the Green Ranger, and Kimberley, thePink Ranger. For afternoon programming, the back-and-forth between the two wasunusually compelling. (One episode commercial even teased the idea ofmarriage. Wild!) And in 1995, the two were lifted, along with the otherRangers, into a big-budget, effects-laden theatrical movie. Uh, not that I was there opening dayor anything.more info…8. Selene and MichaelAs seen in: Underworld(2003), Underworld: Evolution (2006)She’s a vampire; he’s a werewolf. She packs heat in black leather as amember of the “Death Dealers”; he’s an innocent — but hunky — bystander whohappens to be descended from the very first lycan. Like Romeo and Juliet beforethem, Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) have decadesof familial blood-feuding to get past, but who says a little inter-species lovecan’t trump all? Their forbidden romance could even create the ultimate vampire-lycanhybrid and unite — or destroy — the warring races forever. Now that’s a tale totell the grandkids.more info…7. Mr. Fantastic and The Invisible WomanAs seen in: Fantastic Four(2005), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer(2007)Let’s face it: in the comics, the TV show, and in themovies, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman have always been a bitdullsville. It’s hard to empathize with a couple so opulently rich, andequally hard not to chuckle at a husband whose main ability is reaching intothe window crack if he forgets his keys in the Fantasticar. But as part of theentry-level Marvel canon, the Richards are everybody’s first exposure tocross-superhero relationships. They got us to ponder the unique romanticdynamics of having a girl who can shut you out of her force field bubble afteryou forget your anniversary.more info…6. Jean Grey and CyclopsAs seen in: X-Men(2000), X2(2003), X-Men: TheLast Stand(2006)Not that the X-Men were lacking for hotties, but Jean Grey (Famke Janssen)was the most alluring and seductive of the group. Powerful, mysterious, andsensual, Jean also possessed a wild side that was so sexy it could rip theskin right off your face, and this scared the bejeezus out of everyone. ScottSummers, or Cyclops (James Marsden), the unofficial leader of the pack, seemedto be the only one who was willing to brave Jean’s darker moods, but let’s getreal for a second here — he was a bit of a shmuck. Though he doted on Jean,and his love for her could never be doubted, their relationship was a bitrocky, due to the fact that he was a jealous boyfriend… and that Jean had ahabit of exploding with telekinetic energy from time to time. Enter Wolverine…more info…5. Jean Grey and WolverineAs seen in: X-Men(2000), X2(2003), X-Men: TheLast Stand(2006)Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) was the quintessential “badboy” of the X-Men, the rebel, the rough-around-the-edges hardcase with a darkpast and a soft heart. So when he came traipsing into X-Mansion, flashing hisleather jacket and mutton chops, it only made sense that the equally troubledJean Grey would take notice. With Jean’s boyfriend Cyclops still millingabout, this couple refrained from acting upon their instincts, but the sexualtension between them was thick enough to slice with an adamantium claw. WhenJean’s powers eventually came to overwhelm her, it was Wolverine who came toher rescue and made the world right again. Theirs was a true testament tounfulfilled affection, and the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey, andWolverine helped add an extra layer to the franchise.more info…4. Daredevil and ElektraAs seen in:Daredevil(2003)It’s love at first sight — kinda — when Manhattan attorney Matt Murdock(Ben Affleck) first meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) in a flirtatiousplayground sparring match. But alas, neither is what they seem. In the traditionof great tragic lovers, the romance between the blind crime fighter Daredeviland the Greek assassin Elektra is as ill-fated as they come; separated by death,she would dream of him again in her “second life” — the spin-off movie Elektra.more info…3. Mr. Incredible and ElastigirlAs seen in: The Incredibles (2004)On the surface, the marriage of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl isn’tparticularly special. It’s essentially a what-if portrait were Mr. Fantastic achick, and The Thing a human dude. But if the private lives of Bob and HelenParr share similarities with the Richards (recurring themes include maritalstress, infidelity, and the struggle to find beauty in the mundane), they alsodeal with these issues with extra wit and color. Throw in super-powered childrenwho add to the chaos but also deepen Mr. Incredibles and Elastigirl, and youhave some of the most fleshed-out heroes this side of Alan Moore.more info…2. Neo and TrinityAs seen in: The Matrix(1999), The Matrix Reloaded(2003), The Matrix Revolutions(2003)While they don’t possess any real “super”powers, per se, outside of the virtual world of the Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves)and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) comprise a formidable duo when they’re pluggedin. Somewhere in the midst of discovering the true nature of his “whoa”-ness,gallivanting around his digital playground, and saving humanity from a future ofslavery, “The One” somehow finds the time to fall in love with his leather-cladpartner. For her part, Trinity is no slouch either, running up walls andbattling agents with reckless abandon, but only by combining their efforts andmaking a few big sacrifices for each other is this power couple able to overcomethe vast army of killer robots they face. Sometimes, “one” plus three equals a kickass two.more info…1. Batman and CatwomanAs seen in: Batman Returns(1992)A compelling facet about the Batman universe is itscharacters’ ability to represent polar extremes without reducing themselves tocardboard cutouts. Naturally, Batman is order, while Joker entertains chaos, andDC has shown just enough intricacy within these two to make their fight relevantfor decades. Now, Catwoman isn’t as simple. It’s apparent in Batman Returnsthat Selina Kyle can’t be labeled good or bad, but instead read as aperpetual victim whose idea of fighting back is at odds with Batman’s. Catwomanneeds saving from herself and her vigilantism is questionable. That probablyexplains the attraction between Bruce Wayne and Selina: in each other, they seethemselves. And it also probably explains why their tango is so compelling tous: when your line of work involves hiding away from the world, genuine humanconnection is a pretty rare thing.As for honorable mentions, we had to respectfullydecline the presence of too-cutsey Rogue and Iceman, too-obscure The Strobe andMs. Indestructible, too-odd Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, and Hancock and theMystery Superheroine We Can’t Reveal Because The Movie’s Not Even a Week Old.Check out past editions of Total Recall in our column archives.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"telelvision, WarnerMedia, Marvel, remakes, Us, Tumblr, sequel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-The-10-Best-Superhero-Hookups"},{"id":"47508994725539","title":"Total Recall: RT Celebrates the Bill of Rights","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: RT Celebrates the Bill of RightsThis Independence Day, we count down your 10 favorite amendments -- with a cinematic twist.by Ryan Fujitani and Tim Ryan | July 2, 2008 |  CommentsWe the people of Rotten Tomatoes, in order to make this Independence Day more perfect, do ordain and establish this Total Recall as a cinematic tribute to the Bill of Rights.Independence Day is a time to reflect on the history of our country, and what makes our nation unique. A good place to start is the Bill of Rights, the original 10 amendments to the Constitution, which provide Americans such essential freedoms as self-expression, the right to a fair trial, and the limits of governmental powers against U.S. citizens. However, since we don’t want to dish out a bone-dry history lesson in this festive season, we’ve compiled a list that puts each amendment in a cinematic context, with plenty of car chases, titillation, and shootouts. In other words, just what you expect on the Fourth of July: fireworks.more info…The First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.The People Vs. Larry Flynt (1996, 87 percent)One of the most profoundly important aspects of the First Amendment is that it protects unpopular — and offensive — speech. Fans of good taste found much to dislike in the oeuvre of Hustler publisher Larry Flynt. However, when Evangelist Jerry Falwell saw a fake liquor ad in Flynt’s skin mag that claimed the reverend had had a romantic entanglement with his mother in an outhouse, he sued for emotional distress. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that, being a public figure, Falwell could not claim to be distressed by what was an obvious parody. As Flynt (played by Woody Harrelson) succinctly puts it, “If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag like me, it will protect all of you.”&nbsp;more info…The Second Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.Death Wish (1974, 74 percent)Second Amendment proponents feel that guns in the hands of private citizens can prevent crime. Perhaps if Paul Kersey’s (Charles Bronson) wife and daughter had a sidearm in the house when it was invaded by three street punks, they’d be alive and/or well. The ruthless attack takes its toll on Kersey, who becomes a well-regulated militia of one — perhaps not what the framers had in mind, but an effective crime-fighting force nonetheless. However, legal scholars could successfully argue that one-man vigilante campaigns at very least violate the Sixth and Ninth Amendments.&nbsp;&lt;more info…The Third Amendment: No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.Cops and Robbersons (1994, 17 percent)Smarting from the failure of his quickly-canceled Fox talk show, Chevy Chase reunited with his Fletch director, Michael Ritchie, for Cops and Robbersons, a comedy about a tough-as-nails cop (Jack Palance, natch) who moves in with a suburban family in order to nab the crook living next door (Robert Davi). That the movie’s premise could be accused of playing fast and loose with our friendly Third Amendment was of little importance to critics — they had their hands full pointing out flaws in the direction, screenplay, and performances from the cast. Cops and Robbersons made more than one viewer wish we had an amendment forcing Chevy Chase to choose better scripts.more info…The Fourth Amendment: The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.Training Day (2001, 71 percent)Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) is certainly no card-carrying member of the ACLU. If he was, he wouldn’t be acting in such blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment, which prevents illegal search and seizure without a warrant. During the course of a particularly wild 24 hours on the beat, Harris steals money from not one, but two drug dealers. Washington picked up a Best Actor Oscar for his terrific performance, but if this was the real world, he’d be heaped with scorn from civil libertarians.more info…The Fifth Amendment: No person shall be held to answer for any capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.The Godfather, Part 2 (1974, 98 percent)In The Godfather Part 2, a senate subcommittee conducts an open hearing into the alleged illegal activities of the Corleone family. It would seem like the perfect time for Michael (Al Pacino) to invoke the Fifth Amendment and preserve his right to not incriminate himself. However, Michael didn’t get to the top of the criminal world by being a dummy, and his knowledge of the Constitution is particularly astute. “I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment although it is my right to do so,” he tells the Senate, before evoking the Sixth Amendment. “I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me.” The government’s case falls apart, and Michael eventually violates his brother Fredo’s Sixth Amendment rights by exercising his Second Amendment rights.more info…The Sixth Amendment: In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district where in the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.12 Angry Men (1957, 100 percent)Sidney Lumet‘s terrific debut is more than a compelling drama — it’s also a terrific civics lesson. Featuring an all-star cast, this Oscar-nominated classic follows the deliberations of a jury in a capital murder trial; one of the jurors (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the rest to overcome their prejudices against the defendant — a teenage boy from the wrong side of the tracks — and deliver a fair verdict. As 12 Angry Men proves, a trial by jury can be pretty messy — but it sure beats the Star Chamber.more info…The Seventh Amendment: In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.The Verdict (1982, 96 percent)Kind of a mouthful, isn’t it? Don’t worry — all that founding fathers-speak in the Seventh Amendment just boils down to one simple thing: The right to a civil trial by jury. The Verdict provides what is widely regarded as cinema’s most elegant defense of this right, and for good reason — it was scripted by David Mamet, directed by Sidney Lumet, and starred Paul Newman in one of his most finely nuanced (and most riveting) performances as a washed-up, alcoholic lawyer who finds redemption through his pursuit of a medical malpractice lawsuit that bore a strong similarity to the Karen Ann Quinlan case. Law scholars have been quick to point out that The Verdict hinges on developments that strain credulity, but the critics didn’t care — it’s one of Newman’s best-reviewed films.more info…The Eighth Amendment: Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. The Shawshank Redemption (1994, 88 percent)It routinely pops up on “Best Movies” lists and is widely regarded as a classic – in fact, Frank Darabont‘s career-launching adaptation of Stephen King‘s The Shawshank Redemption is so beloved, it’s easy to forget that during its theatrical release, the film barely earned enough to cover its $25 million budget. No one could argue that Andy Dufresne, the unjustly imprisoned banker played by Tim Robbins, isn’t subjected to “cruel and unusual punishment” — but that’s a big part of what makes him a hero we can’t help but root for. Of course, not every member of the prison population is as pure of heart as Andy or his friends — and yes, this is only fiction — but The Shawshank Redemption still provides a glimpse of life without the Bill of Rights that’s as sobering as it is entertaining.more info…The Ninth Amendment: The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.Enemy of the State (1998, 71 percent)The framers of the Constitution weren’t dummies — they knew that by spelling out the citizens’ rights upheld in these amendments, they might be encouraging the idea that any rights not specifically mentioned didn’t exist, so they gave themselves the Ninth Amendment as a loophole — basically saying that just because you don’t read something here, it doesn’t mean the government has carte blanche to do whatever it wants. This amendment comes in handy for Chris Gardner, the labor lawyer played by Will Smith in Enemy of the State, when he discovers he’s being framed by government agents for a crime he didn’t commit. To accomplish their nefarious goals, these agents resort to all sorts of dirty tricks — planting bugs, having Gardner’s credit cards canceled, even tricking his wife into thinking he’s been having an affair. A beautifully shot ode to the paranoid, Enemy made oodles of cash at the box office.more info…The Tenth Amendment: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.Smokey and the Bandit (1977, 76 percent)Yes, it’s the ever-popular “states’ rights” amendment — and in this case, those rights meant that, in the late 1970s, transporting liquor past the east Texas border was considered bootlegging, which is why the wealthy Big Enos Burdette (played by Pat McCormick) had to offer an $80,000 reward to infamous trucker Bo “Bandit” Darville (Burt Reynolds) in order to get him to bring 400 cases of Coors to Georgia. Considering that Smokey and the Bandit went on to become the second highest-grossing film of 1977 (outdone only by Star Wars) and spawn a pair of sequels, not to mention inspiring The Dukes of Hazzard, it’s interesting to note that director Hal Needham had to fight tooth and nail to get Bandit made — it wasn’t until his pal Reynolds stepped in that the studios came knocking. The results were unquestionably lowbrow, but the critics didn’t mind.&gt;And finally, for those of you who need a primer on the Bill of Rights, we present you with this:Check out past editions of Total Recall in our column archives.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"best, Certified, dc, 21st, awards, TV, HBO, movies, The, who, Walt, twilight","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-rt-celebrates-the-bill-of-rights"},{"id":"47508994711196","title":"Total Recall: RT’s Schoolhouse Favorites","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: RT's Schoolhouse FavoritesIt's higher education through the flicks this week.by RT Staff | September 3, 2008 |  CommentsIt’s time for pencils. It’s time for books. And it mostcertainly is time for teachers’ dirty looks. If you’re headed back to schoolthis week, RT’s here to ease the crippling anxiety and dread of the new year.We’ve compiled a list of some of our editors’ favorite movies about book-learnin’,so read on and school yourself.more info…Back toSchool (1986)Tomatometer: 87%Chosen by Matt Atchity, Editor-in-ChiefWho knew a Rodney Dangerfield movie could be this sweet? Dangerfield hadappeared in a couple of movies already, Caddyshack and Easy Money, both ofwhich capitalized on the raunchier side of Dangerfield’s long-running act.But Back to School is a bit different; where his previous movie charactersdidn’t really deserve respect, Dangerfield’s Thornton Melon is a self-mademillionaire, and the only respect he really wants (or even cares about) is hisson’s. Which means that Thornton is finally going to go to college. It’sprobably Dangerfield’s best performance next to Natural Born Killers.Granted, he’s basically playing himself here, but he’s having so much fun thatit’s infectious. Yes, we get all the standard clichés — the crazy parties,the tough classes, the cramming for exams, and the final sports-basedshowdown, but the twist here is that Rodney’s involved, and he’s consistentlyhilarious in almost every scene.more info…Summer School(1987)Tomatometer: 58%Chosen by Sara Schieron, RT StaffCast wholly by actors with sturdy futures on the B-list,Carl Reiner’s Summer School is hard to call a “success,” but then, thefilm’s an opus to underachieving — how big could it get? Mark Harmon (at hispre-Chicago Hope apex) and Kirstie Alley (during her run on Cheers)play Freddy Shoop and Robin Bishop; a gym teacher stuck teaching remedialEnglish at summer school and an honors English instructor. Lacking the skillto inspire his students with either literacy or competence, Freddy Shoopbribes them to study. All of Summer School‘s graduates moved forward toconsistent employment: Courtney Thorne-Smith is on According to Jim, ShawneeSmith is the vicious nurse in the Saw films and Richard StevenHorvitz is “Invader Zim” So unlike Girls Just Wanna Have Fun orFast Times at Ridgemont High, this class may not boast anyfuture-glitterati, but not one Summer School classmate flunked out.Maybe it’s proof that studying (even the bribery-inspired kind) does count forsomething.more info…FastTimes at Ridgemont High(1982)Tomatometer: 89%Chosen by Jeff Giles, RT StaffObjectively speaking, there are certainly better moviesabout high school — heck, I almost wrote about Say Anything… or TheBreakfast Club here — but I don’t think I’ve gone back to any of them asmany times as I have Fast Times at Ridgemont High. There are the film’swell-documented charms (two words: Phoebe Cates), as well as one of the bestsoundtracks of the ’80s, but even taking that stuff into consideration, FastTimes is probably better than you remember — mostly thanks to a wonderfulcast that’s anchored by stellar performances from Jennifer Jason Leigh andJudge Reinhold (yes, seriously). Of course, that’s what makes Fast Timesa good movie — I’d be lying if I said Sean Penn’s side-splitting turnas the blissfully ignorant Jeff Spicoli wasn’t what makes it my favorite.Aloha, Mr. Hand!more info…Half Nelson(2006)Tomatometer: 91%Chosen by Tim Ryan, EditorHalf Nelson upends the “liberal idealist saves the hood” subgenre ofeducational dramas like Dangerous Minds and Take the Lead. Thistime, it’s young, unconventional history teacher Dan Dunne (Ryan Gosling) whocould use some salvation; he’s addicted to crack, and he pines for an old flamewho’s subsequently gotten clean. One of his students, a precocious latch-key kidnamed Dray (remarkably played by Shareeka Epps), discovers him smoking crack onenight in a locker room, and does everything she can to help despite havingplenty of troubles of her own. Half Nelson is a wonderful character studyfilled with rich performances, but one of its greatest assets is the fact thatit shows a teacher actually teaching something. Gosling’s passion for hissubject, and the fact that he’s utterly committed to not teaching by the book,seems wholly authentic, and it’s refreshing to see a film in which inner citystudents are treated as individuals, not as a teeming mob of malcontents waitingfor a passionate teacher to tap their inner potential.more info…Au Revoir LesEnfants(1987)Tomatometer: 100%Chosen by Alex Vo, EditorRushmore is my favorite movie and it happens to be primarily set at school,but since I already wrote all I wanted to about that in a recent feature,here’s my alternate: Louis Malle’s Au Revoir Les Enfants, a 1987 French dramaset at a boarding school during World War II. The main character, Julien,befriends a new kid named Jean Bonnet, blissfully unaware of the obvious fact:Jean Bonnet is a Jew. I saw this in sixth or seventh grade and was my firstmovie in which school wasn’t depicted as a prison, the children and adultsweren’t engaged in slapstick battles, and all the small details of kid’s dailylife was captured free of condescension or cynicism. This is a fine, sweetmovie on the impending terror of war and adulthood.more info…Lean on Me (1989)Tomatometer: 64%Chosen by Ryan Fujitani, Community ManagerAs a young lad, my two favorite movies were Glory andLean On Me, and a big part of the reason for this was the presence of MorganFreeman in both. There was something in his face that felt paternal andcomforting to me, almost as if he was destined to play the sagacious fatherfigure in cinema, and this was nowhere more evident than in Lean On Me. Asmaverick principal Joe Clark, Freeman admittedly revels in a wee bit of scenechewing, and the movie isn’t without its “wise teacher earns the trust of hisrebellious students” clichés, but I don’t care. I found it absolutelycharming, it’s endlessly quotable (“I’m the HNIC!”, “I don’t have to do nothin’but stay black and die!”), it has a killer soundtrack that features Guns ‘N’Roses and Big Daddy Kane, and it’s pure fun watching Morgan Freeman stompingdown hallways doling out tough love and ordering everything to be done“Expeditiously!”more info…TerrifyingGirls High School(1973)Tomatometer: N/AChosen by Jen Yamato, EditorThere’s a special, perverse place in my heart for the “pinky violence”films of 1970s Japan, and they don’t come much more twisted than NorifumiSuzuki’s reform school tale Terrifying Girls High School: Lynch Law Classroom.Cult star Miki Sugimoto, famous for playing tough delinquent girl bosses,embodies cool as a rebellious teenager who rallies her classmates into a sex andviolence-filled coup against The Man; Reiko Ike turns in a quick cameo as theleather-clad leader of a rival gang. Yeah, it’s exploitation cinema to the core,replete with cat fights, a funky soundtrack, lots of nudity, and crazy plotturns, but you’ve gotta love a movie where the popular girls in school turn outto be glorified fascist hall monitors, heroines are handy with a switchblade,and the happy ending comes with the anarchic, window-smashing, literaldestruction of a corrupt institution called “The School of Hope.”","section":"Total Recall","tags":"worst, Biopics, Diego, scary, Crackle, parents, Ice, video, Kids, Stephen, Sabrina, Month, wars, Emmy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-RTs-Schoolhouse-Favorites"},{"id":"47508996269736","title":"Total Recall: 50 Most Memorable Movie Cars","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: 50 Most Memorable Movie CarsWe count down the 50 most famous cars to drive across the silver screen.by Matt Atchity | May 8, 2008 |  Comments50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable MentionsThis week sees the long-awaited release of the live action Speed Racer, starring Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci, John Goodman, and Susan Sarandon.

The Dude’s Gran TorinoType of car: 1973 Ford Gran TorinoSpecial features: Nihilists hate it.Appears in: The Big LebowskiIt’s rare that a car fits its owner so perfectly, but the Dude and this car are a perfect match.

Jack Cate’s CadillacType of car: 1964 Cadillac DeVille ConvertibleSpecial features: Doesn’t look like a cop car at all.Appears in: 48 Hrs., Another 48 Hrs.This beat-up Cadillac has definitely seen better days, just like its owner.

Lane’s CamaroType of car: 1967 Chevrolet Camaro RS/SS 350Special features: Muddy Waters theme song, attracts French exchange studentsAppears in: Better Off DeadLane Meyer (John Cusack) has hidden this gem under a cover in the driveway for far too long.

Fozzie’s uncle’s StudebakerType of car: 1951 Studebaker CommanderSpecial features: Custom paint jobAppears in: The Muppet MovieWhat better car for a cross-country trip than an old Studebaker? Okay, so there are a lot of better cars, but considering that it’s Kermit the Frog and Fozzie Bear taking the trip, this car fits them pretty well.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…45. The VanType of car: Customized Chevrolet Step VanSpecial features: Tail fins, custom “organic” paintAppears in: Cheech &amp; Chong’s Up in SmokeImagine you have a van.

The CarType of car: Customized 1971 Lincoln Continental Mark IIISpecial features: Demonic possession, George Barris designAppears in: The CarGeorge Barris customized this Lincoln for a film about an evil car that’s terrorizing a Southwestern town. And this car may look familiar to those who have seen Bender turn into a werecar on Futurama.more info…43. Kowalski’s ChallengerType of car: 1970 Dodge Challenger R/TSpecial features: V8 Hemi, good for playing “Ship’s Mast”Appears in: Vanishing Point, Death ProofThe Muscle Car Era inspired a lot of car chase movies, including this one about a cross-country car delivery that turns in to a multi-state car chase. The iconic Challenger was also seen in Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof, used in an exciting game of “Ship’s Mast” (don’t try that one at home, kids!)more info…42. 1973 Volkswagen Transporter (Type 2)Type of car: 1973 Volkswagen Transporter (Type 2)Special features: Bench seats, detachable doorAppears in: Little Miss SunshineThe Hoovers have a few problems with their VW Bus: a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a door that comes off. Writer Michael Arndt says that all of those problems happened to his own family on a cross-country trip while he was a kid.more info…41. EleanorType of car: 1973 Ford Mustang Mach 1Special features: Can survive really, really long chasesAppears in: Gone in 60 Seconds (1973)The original Gone in 60 Seconds had no script, and no real actors, and it shows. But none of that really matters in light of the 40 minute chase scene at the end of the film. That’s where Eleanor, the only real star of the film really shines.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…40. Milner’s Deuce CoupeType of car: Customized 1932 Ford CoupeSpecial features: Legendary license plate numberAppears in: American GraffitiGeorge Lucas was a hot rod enthusiast, and this film based on his own teenage years in Modesto, California definitely shows that. John Milner’s 1932 Ford introduced a whole new generation to this type of old style hot rod.more info…39. Cobretti’s MercuryType of car: Customized 1950 Mercury MontereySpecial features: Custom paint, nitrous injection systemAppears in: CobraApart from relatively cartoonish violence, Cobretti’s 1950 Merc is probably the most memorable thing about the whole movie. Sadly, the car is completely destroyed by the end of the film.more info…38. Tucker TorpedoType of car: 1948 Tucker SedanSpecial features: Directional front headlight, rear engine, padded dashAppears in: Tucker: The Man and His DreamIn an attempt to start his own manufacturing company, Preston Tucker came up with a car with innovative features and radical styling.

But no matter, D-Day “fixes” it just in time for Faber’s annual Homecoming parade.more info…36. Charlie Babbit’s BuickType of car: 1949 Buick Roadmaster ConvertibleSpecial features: Can be driven slow on the drivewayAppears in: Rain ManThis classic convertible is the sum total of Charlie Babbitt’s inheritance, after his father passes away. It’s not the same as getting $3 million, but the car’s true value lies in bringing Charlie together with the brother he never knew he had.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…35. Richard’s classic PlymouthType of car: 1967 Plymouth Belvedere GTXSpecial features: Can carry stunned deer in back seatAppears in: Tommy BoyAnother road movie with a classic car, but this one gets more and more abuse as the movie goes one.

Even if it does look like a giant sheep dog.more info…33. BumblebeeType of car: 1977/2009 Chevrolet CamaroSpecial features: V8 engine, robot modeAppears in: TransformersAlthough previously seen as a Volkswaken Beetle, Bumblebee makes his film debut as a 1977 Camaro. But he’s sensitive about how he looks, so he changes himself in to a 2009 Camaro. What else can he change into? A giant robot, natch!more info…32. Charlie’s getaway MINIsType of car: 2003 MINI Cooper SSpecial features: Gold bar hauling capacityAppears in: The Italian Job (2003)When BMW reintroduced the MINI in 2000, it was only a matter of time before someone got around to remaking The Italian Job. The action moves from Rome to Los Angeles, but the idea is the same; watching MINIs outrun anyone trying to chase them.more info…31. Cole Trickle’s race carType of car: 1990 Chevrolet Lumina NASCARSpecial features: NASCAR racing specsAppears in: Days of ThunderIt gets wrecked and rebuilt, and sees multiple paint schemes over the course of the film, but that’s to be expected for a typical NASCAR racing machine.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…30. Toretto’s ChargerType of car: 1970 Dodge ChargerSpecial features: Blower, wheelie barsAppears in: The Fast and the FuriousThis is the car that even Dominic Toretto admits he’s afraid of. And what’s better than watching the body twist as the engine revs? But it’s tragic to see this car get wrecked (even if the blower and wheelie bars are faked).more info…29. Buck’s Pussy WagonType of car: 1997 Chevrolet C-2500 Silverado FleetsideSpecial features: Custom paint, spoilerAppears in: Kill Bill Vol. 1Buck is such a sleazebag that we’re glad to see Beatrix kill him. And his ride is as sleazy he is, but at least it’s easy to find in a parking lot.more info…28. Garth’s Mirth MobileType of car: 1976 AMC PacerSpecial features: Custom flame job, cassette playerAppears in: Wayne’s WorldWayne may be cool, but his best buddy Garth isn’t, although he tries to be. Garth’s car is the same way: it’s isn’t actually cool, but it’s really, really trying to be.more info…27. The Family TrucksterType of car: originally a Ford LTD Country SquireSpecial features: Faux wood panelling, metallic pea paintAppears in: National Lampoon’s VacationThe producers of Vacation wanted to create an example of a completly disgusting and awful station wagon. It’s ugly, it’s badly engineered, and it’s unreliable. In other words, it’s a typical early 80s American car.more info…26. Pursuit SpecialType of car: Modified 1973 Ford Falcon XB GT CoupeSpecial features: Siren, enlarged gas tank, anti-theft deviceAppears in: Mad MaxThe last of the V8 Interceptors is the only Aussie car on the list, and it’s a doozy. It’s loud, it’s fast, and it just plain looks mean. But it’s also a cop car, which means Max gets to use it to run down evil bikers.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…25. The Mach 5Type of car: Racer Motors Mach 5Special features: Auto-jacks, bullet-proof canopy, retractable saws, tire cramponsAppears in: Speed RacerThe Mach 5 historically known for the Japanese animated TV show, but is now the star of this week’s Speed Racer. The physical version of the Mach 5 is gorgeous, and lives up to fans’ high expectations (even though the movie didn’t).more info…24. Louise’s ThunderbirdType of car: 1966 Ford ThunderbirdSpecial features: Good for flying off of cliffsAppears in: Thelma &amp; LouiseWhat is it about Road Movies that require old cars? Probably because a cross-country trip in a luxurious RV isn’t that interesting. In this case, Louise’s classic T-Bird convertible symbolizes the freedom that she and Thelma recklessly pursue.more info…23. Pepe, the Little MuleType of car: Customized 1982 Ford Bronco XLTSpecial features: Both bulletproof and fireproofAppears in: Romancing the StoneNow this is our kind of drug mule; four-wheel drive, powerful V8 engine, and easily able to outrun Columbian Secret Police vehicles. Plus it’s driven by Alfonso Arau, who was better known as El Guapo in The Three Amigos.more info…22. Greased LightningType of car: 1948 Ford De LuxeSpecial features: Auto-matic, System-matic, and Hydro-maticAppears in: GreaseThere are two versions of Greased Lightning; there’s the white one that the T-Birds modify and race, and then there’s the red fantasy version that they dance around on. That’s the one that shows up at the end of the movie, and can apparently fly.more info…21. Chitty Chitty Bang BangType of car: Customized Paragon PantherSpecial features: Pontoons, wingsAppears in: Chitty Chitty Bang BangAlthough never mentioned in the movie, the original book by Ian Fleming(!) mentions that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang had been a famous race car called the Paragon Panther. In reality, multiple versions were purpose-built for the movie, including a fully functional road-going car.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…20. ChristineType of car: 1958 Plymouth FurySpecial features: Self-repairing, evilAppears in: ChristineWhen Plymouth introduced the Fury name in 1957, it was essentially a sport and trim package on the Belvedere model. And the red paint and interior were custom orders; those options weren’t regularly available on the real cars. But what other color works on a demonic, murderous car – beige? We don’t think so.more info…19. Joel’s dad’s PorscheType of car: 1981 Porsche 928Special features: Annoys pimps, falls off of piersAppears in: Risky BusinessJoel’s parents leave for the weekend, and tell him not to drive his father’s Porsche, but he just can’t resist. But Porsches aren’t meant to be U-boats, and it costs serious money to repair the water damage before Joel’s parents get home.more info…18. The TumblerType of car: Wayne Industries assault vehicleSpecial features: Rocket powered, armor platedAppears in: Batman Begins, The Dark KnightThey never could get the bridge to work, but this baby works just fine, according to Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). In reality, four street-ready versions were built, and were spied driving at extreme speeds (one was also in an accident) in Chicago before the release of Batman Begins.more info…17. The LamborghiniType of car: 1980 Lamborghini Countach LP 400SSpecial features: Scissor doors, spandex jumpsuitsAppears in: The Cannonball RunIf you were a teenage boy in the 80s, you wanted one of these cars. The black Countach that appears in The Cannonball Run is a standout in a movie filled with hot cars, and it doesn’t hurt that it’s driving by a smoking hot, spandex-wrapped Adrienne Barbeau.more info…16. James Bond’s submersible LotusType of car: 1975 Lotus EspritSpecial features: Oil slick, rocket launcher, submarine modeAppears in: The Spy Who Loved MeThis is the second-coolest car that James Bond ever drove (we’ll get to his best car shortly). It looks good, it handles well, and it’s great for a day at the beach. No boat? No problem!50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…15. Eleanor IIType of car: 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500Special features: Custom bodywork and paintAppears in: Gone in 60 Seconds (2000)Like the Lamborghini in The Cannonball Run, Eleanor stands out in a film full of hot cars. Her appearance has proved so popular that it’s contributed to higher pricing of late-60s Mustang fastbacks, and there’s now a cottage industry based on creating Eleanor replicas.more info…14. Ben’s Alfa RomeoType of car: 1966 Alfa Romeo 1600 Spider DuettoSpecial features: Attracts older womenAppears in: The Graduate, Wayne’s World 2The success of The Graduate turned the Alfa Romeo Spider into a worldwide icon, and definitely boosted sales of the car. The car’s fame and longevity would eventually inspire Alfa Romeo to introduce a “Graduate” edition.more info…13. George Barris BatmobileType of car: Customized 1954 Lincoln FuturaSpecial features: Bat-phone, bat-turbineAppears in: Batman: The MovieAlready famous as a star of the Batman TV show, the 1960s Batmobile made the jump to the big screen in 1966. This is probably the most iconic George Barris design, and it’s based on the Lincoln Futura concept car.more info…12. Charlie’s getaway MinisType of car: 1968 Austin Mk I Mini Cooper SSpecial features: Drives on sidewalks, stairs, roofs as easily as roadsAppears in: The Italian Job (1969)The Mini was already a popular car in 1969, but The Italian Job is what helped make the car a legend in Europe. That, and a succession of mid-sixties Monte Carlo Rally wins. Although Michael Caine and Noel Coward are the stars of the movie, the Minis really steal the show.more info…11. The BluesmobileType of car: 1974 Dodge Monaco with police packageSpecial features: Cop motor, cop tires, cop suspensions, cop shocks, and runs good on regular gasAppears in: The Blues BrothersAfter trading the orginal Bluesmobile (a Cadillac) for a microphone, Elwood picked this gem up at the Mount Prospect city police auction. “They were practically giving them away!”50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…10. Mr. Frye’s FerrariType of car: 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder SWBSpecial features: attracts joyriding parking attendantsAppears in: Ferris Bueller’s Day OffCameron says his father loves this car more than life itself. Ferris scoffs at his priorities, but does highly recommend picking one up, if you have the means. It’s a simply beautiful car, and fortunately the filmmakers destroy a mere replica, not the real thing.more info…9. Tim Burton’s BatmobileType of car: GM BatmobileSpecial features: Turbine, remote control, shieldsAppears in: Batman, Batman ReturnsThe 1989 Batman needed to overcome a lot of the camp baggage left by the old TV show, and the new Batmobile was big step in that direction. Although the 1960s Batmobile was cool, this new one was simply mind-blowing.more info…8. Starsky’s Gran TorinoType of car: 1976 Ford Gran TorinoSpecial features: Mag wheels, custom paintAppears in: Starsky &amp; HutchThe long-running TV show helped make this car popular, but it’s the 2004 film the qualifies the iconic red Gran Torino hot rod for a high rank on the list. About ten of the cars were destroyed during filming, and only a couple have survived.more info…7. Bandit’s Trans AmType of car: 1977 Pontiac Trans AmSpecial features: T-tops, CB RadioAppears in: Smokey and the Bandit, Smokey and the Bandit IIBurt Reynolds’ previous stint as bootlegger in White Lightning involved a relatively boring Ford 500. But this time around, he drives the outrageously-styled Trans Am, complete with the “Flaming Chicken” decals.more info…6. Ecto-1Type of car: 1959 Cadillac Miller-MeteorSpecial features: Siren, sliding proton pack storageAppears in: Ghostbusters, Ghostbusters 2According to Ray, it just needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end. Also new rings, mufflers, a little wiring. But hey, the old ambulance was only $4800. That’s only about $10,000 when scaled up for inflation.50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable Mentionsmore info…5. James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5Type of car: 1963 Aston Martin DB5Special features: Oil slick, smoke screen, ejector seat, radar tracking system, machine guns, revolving license platesAppears in: Goldfinger, Thunderball, The Cannonball Run, Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, Casino RoyaleThis car is as much a part of James Bond lore as is the Walther PPK. Sean Connery can be seen driving it in Goldfinger and Thunderball, Pierce Brosnan drives one in Goldeneye and Tomorrow Never Dies, Daniel Craig drives one in Casino Royale, and Roger Moore uses one to goof on himself in The Cannonball Run.more info…4. Bullitt’s MustangType of car: 1968 Ford Mustang GT390 FastbackSpecial features: Makes you feel almost as cool as Steve McQueenAppears in: BullittBullitt may be the coolest movie by the coolest actor ever, Steve McQueen. So naturally, his car has to be cool, too. Two identical Mustangs were used for filming the iconic chase scene; one was scrapped after filming, and it’s rumored that the surviving car has been stored in a barn in the Ohio River Valley.more info…3. The General LeeType of car: 1969 Dodge ChargerSpecial features: Extensive race modifications, musical hornAppears in: The Dukes of HazzardDumb movie, dumb TV show, awesome car. The General Lee is proof that you can keep a TV show on the air for 6 seasons simply based on the popularity of a single car (and Catherine Bach in tight shorts). Like some other cars on this list, the General was mainly known for TV, but found regained popularity when jumping to the big screen.more info…2. HerbieType of car: 1963 Model 117 Volkswagen Type 1 (Beetle)Special features: Ultimate cruise controlAppears in: The Love Bug, Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, Herbie Goes Bananas, Herbie: Fully LoadedThe 1968 Disney film The Love Bug was partly inspired by and helped push along the Beetle craze in the 1960s.

Try finding someone who doesn’t know who Herbie is.more info…1. Doc Brown’s De LoreanType of car: 1981 De Lorean DMC-12Special features: Flux capacitor, remote control, hover conversion, Mr. Fusion generatorAppears in: Back to the Future, Back to the Future Part II, Back to the Future Part IIIThe Back to the Future movies were all blockbusters, and were all based around one thing – a De Lorean-turned-time machine invented by the eccentric Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd).50 – 46 | 45 – 41 | 40 – 36 | 35 – 31 | 30 – 26 | 25 – 21 | 20 – 16 | 15 – 11 | 10 – 6 | 5 – 1Honorable MentionsAs we put together this list, we came up with enough cars to fill a good-sized parking structure.

Thus it’s high time we pick out some memorable big-screenspecters for your ghoulish pleasure.more info…Candyman(1992)Tomatometer: 74%Based on a short story by celebrated horror icon Clive Barker, Candymanplayed on familiar archetypes to introduce a chilling new figure toscare-cinema. Tony Todd, who RT had the pleasure of meeting at this year’sComic-Con, plays the hook-fisted apparition who appears in mirrors when hisname is spoken five times, and Virginia Madsen is the skeptical grad studentresearching the history of his legend in the housing projects of Chicago.Whether it was the unsettling gracefulness of his gravelly voice, the imposingstature of his presence, or the fat, bloody hook where his right hand shouldhave been, Candyman effectively scared the bejeezus out of millions ofmoviegoers in 1992. He was so effective, in fact, that the movie spawned twosequels (one of them DTV) and reignited a centuries-old fear of mirrors. It’s“very clever, well-made and unpredictable,” wrote Andreas Samuelson of Slasherpool.more info…Ghost (1990)Tomatometer: 78%In a quiet way, Ghost proclaims the death of the 1980s. Fresh from TheColor Purple, Dirty Dancing, and St. Elmo’s Fire, the film’sstars (Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Swayze, and Demi Moore, respectively) hitcareer peaks shortly before Jerry Zucker (yes, the man responsible forAirplane!) brought this film to theaters and pop culture consciousness. Sure,it’s schmaltzy and often indifferent to things like logic, but its regret-freetone and “love will stay with you” message struck a deep chord with thecountry and its performances were hard to forget: Demi Moore in the throes ofpassion with a glow-in-the-dark Patrick Swayze; sexy pottery throwing;“Ditto.” Before you start singing “I am Henry the Eighth, I am,” consider fora moment how something so sappy could seep into the collective consciousnessas deeply as Ghost did. For as much as it purports to be a mystery, it’s nomystery: the 1980s are dead, God save the 1990s. “Call me corny, but I reallydig it,” wrote efilmcritic’s Scott Weinberg. “Not without its flaws, Ghoststill boasts drama, comedy, romance and a bit of the spooky stuff to boot.”more info…Beetlejuice (1988)Tomatometer: 82%Tim Burton’s “look” — which resembles German Expressionism, addled with dryBritish wit, channeled through late-50’s magazine camp — was never so easy toidentify as in Beetlejuice. It was all there: the tongue-in-cheek comedyof shrunken heads, the irksome brightness of Dia de los Muertos candy, thelight-heartedness of suicide victims — and the absurdity of high art. Nothingwas sacred, and that was right funny. From the “Handbook of the RecentlyDeceased” (available on Amazon) to the cloying agendas of thrill-pedaling,upscale, ghost hunters, this story of two newlyweds who find themselves, shallwe say, indisposed to the living, takes liberties with many virtues, anddepicted the afterlife as a den of bureaucratic meanderings, peppered with theoccasional silver screen starlet (Sylvia Sydney as the head paper pusher!).Michael Keaton stole the show as the title character and an uncharacteristicallysubdued Alec Baldwin played the ideal straight man with Geena Davis and WinonaRyder, both in their heyday. Catherine O’Hara and Jeffrey Jones rounded out acast of players Burton would use again, most confusingly in Batman. Isuppose if you think the afterlife looks like a freaky DMV, Beetlejuice asBatman is not so big a leap. “Beetlejuice means something good: that imaginativeartists can bring a fading genre back from the dead,” wrote Richard Corliss of Time.more info…Poltergeist (1982)Tomatometer: 84%Considered by many to be among the best horror films of the decade, Poltergeistwas one of the first truly scary movies that succeeded while remaining below theR-rating threshold — but with Tobe Hooper at the helm and Steven Spielberg onwriting and producing duties, this certainly isn’t surprising. The storyrevolves around an all-American family whose home suddenly becomes infested withpoltergeists, mischievous spirits known for moving inanimate objects around. Itsoon becomes apparent that their visitors are up to no good, and the familyenlists the help of experts, resulting in some terrifying experiences. Whileseveral spirits are responsible for the earlier, more playful scenes, the filmbecomes significantly darker when one of them, referred to only as “The Beast,”begins wreaking havoc on the family. Though the Beast and the poltergeiststhemselves don’t make very many appearances in the film, they are both hauntingand ferocious when they do, as with the ghastly image of a woman at the top ofthe stairs. If you have yet to see this movie, treat yourself to a classic;you’ll never look at fried chicken the same way again. “Poltergeist works— and works extraordinarily well — because it shows us the horrors of beyondcoming to haunt us not in a moldering house on a hill or a grimy dungeon butrather in a gleaming, modern, comfortable suburban housing development,” wroteJames Rocchi of Netflix.more info…The SixthSense (1999)Tomatometer: 84%It’s said that film is little more than a ghost itself: just light and shadowon a wall. So for a director to debut with a ghost story he’s conceivablybroadcasting his smarts to those “in the know.” Still, this hardly matters ifthe final film isn’t affecting — and whether you were privy to theimplications or the theory, you were likely still irked by the scene in thedumbwaiter, or haunted by the little girl throwing up under the bed. Sure, theperformances were stellar — Bruce Willis and Toni Collette were amazing andHaley Joel Osment clearly made a name for himself — but this film’s greatestasset is its dynamic, deliberate direction. M. Night Shyamalan demonstratedinfluences from Hitchcock and Spielberg to Kurosawa and Murnau, and dropped afinal plot twist that kept people talking for months. To boot, he made a bigpoint — yes, movies might be made of the same stuff as ghosts, but even amongthose ghosts, it’s hard to distinguish the substance from the specters. “Thescreenplay, with its terrific scares and its amazing double-whammy at the end,is a grand achievement,” wrote Jeffrey M. Anderson of CombustibleCelluloid.more info…Field ofDreams (1989)Tomatometer: 91%It’s got Kevin Costner, some eminently quotable dialogue, and a storyline thatmade it okay for grown men to cry with their dads. Looking back, is it anywonder that Field of Dreams went on to become one of the biggest hitsof the ’80s? In case you’ve been living on Pluto for the last 20 years, here’sthe basic gist of the plot: Costner plays a farmer who obeys a disembodiedvoice telling him to raze one of his cornfields and turn it into a baseballdiamond. He obeys — he’s a dreamer, people! — and is rewarded withappearances from some of the sport’s deceased outcasts. Yes, it oozessentimentality, but who can help responding to a movie that tells you it’snever too late for redemption — that it’s never too late to heal? As EmmanuelLevy put it, “here’s no denying the film evokes the vastness and grandeur ofMiddle-America,” and — oh, we’re getting choked up already.more info…Ghostbusters (1984)Tomatometer: 93%This wasn’t just a movie in 1984, it was a phenomenon. Between Ray Parker,Jr. on the airwaves and Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and ErnieHudson on the big screen, you couldn’t throw a rock without having it bounceoff a hand-drawn ripoff of the logo — or the head of someone making an “Iain’t afraid of no _____” joke. And okay, so maybe America got a littlecarried away with Ghostbusters mania, demanding a spinoff cartoon, aline of toys, and an inferior sequel that inspired Bobby Brown to rhyme “Vigo”with “legal” — but who could blame us? Not only does Ghostbustersfeature a heaping helping of then-cutting-edge special effects (Slimer! TheSta-Puft Marshmallow Man!), it also boasts one of Murray’s most brilliantlydeadpan performances, not to mention a terrific script by Aykroyd and Ramis.Whether or not those persistent Ghostbusters III rumors ever come tofruition, the original remains, in Roger Ebert’s words, “an exception to thegeneral rule that big special effects can wreck a comedy.”more info…TheInnocents (1961)Tomatometer: 95%Injecting an air of sophistication into horror movies at a time whenWilliam Castle’s schlockfests inundated theaters, The Innocentsportrays a descent into madness that still has the power to unsettle. DeborahKerr plays Miss Giddens, who arrives at a country manor to serve as agoverness for two orphaned children. But as she learns more about the house’sdark history, and becomes overly protective of her charges, Miss Giddensstarts to see dead people — the deceased former employees, perhaps? Featuringa bleak air of gothic ambiance and some of the creepiest kids to be foundoutside a Stephen King novel, The Innocents may not shock likecontemporary frightfests, but it’s got an air of psychological dread that putsmost horror flicks to shame. “Is it the finest, smartest, most visually savvyhorror film ever made by a big studio?” asked The Village Voice‘sMichael Atkinson.more info…Topper (1937)Tomatometer: 100%Modern special effects have numbed audiences to even the niftiest spectralhijinks, but in 1937, moviegoers were far less blasé about thebehind-the-scenes magic that helped George and Marion Kerby (Cary Grant andConstance Bennett) torment their good friend Cosmo Topper (Roland Young) frombeyond the grave. Like the Thorne Smith novel from which it draws itsinspiration, Topper plays its haunting for laughs — and Grant, whonegotiated a percentage deal for his participation, chuckled all the way tothe bank. He opted out for the sequels (and the ’50s TV series), but they allretain a measure of what the Chicago Reader’s Dave Kehr called “arch screwballstyle.”more info…Ugetsu (1952)Tomatometer: 100%Ominous but yearning, Lady Wakasa is not your typical apparition. AndKenji Mizoguchi’s Ugetsu is certainly not your typical haunted tale;this masterwork, which helped bring Japanese cinema to worldwide prominence,is a moving story of the ravages of war, the complex bonds of family, and theloneliness of the grave. As conflict envelops his village, Genjuro (MasayukiMori) decides to sell his pottery in a more prosperous town. It is there thatthe noblewoman Lady Wakasa (Machiko Kyo) takes a shine to his work — andGenjuro as well. She invites him to her palace, and demands that he marry her,so she can feel the love she missed out on in her first lifetime. Genjuro isenraptured, but also conflicted, still duty-bound to his earth-bound wife andson. Ugetsu is “a masterpiece from Mizoguchi — for its historicaldrama, its moving social and family themes and its marvellously moody ghoststory,” wrote Daniel Etherington of Channel 4 Film.

Thus, we at RT thought it was a good time to get into the spirit of things by taking a closer look at some of the most misbegotten, perversely wonderful films of all time.The appreciation of so-bad-it’s-good cinema is not new. As Village Voice critic J. Hoberman noted in his seminal essay “Bad Movies,” “The Surrealists loved bad movies, seeing them as subversive attacks on the tyranny of narrative form.” And as the great critic Pauline Kael wrote in “Trash, Art, and the Movies” in 1969, “Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them.” However, it was the publication of Michael and Harry Medved’s book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time that helped to usher in a new, codified fondness for cinematic ineptitude; a few years later, the institution of the annual Golden Raspberry Awards and the popularity of Mystery Science Theater 3000 brought ironic movie appreciation to the mainstream.However, in the ensuing years, it’s become increasingly difficult to determine that certain je ne sais quoi that distinguishes a merely mediocre film from a sublimely bad one. Hollywood churns out plenty of laugh-free comedies and unexciting action flicks each year, but many are made with at least a semblance of proficiency and feature competent actors. Lapses in craft don’t necessarily make for bad movies, either; the many supporters of the film noir classic Detour (100 percent) will concede that it is riddled with technical imperfections. Intentions are important, too: films with camp followings, like Road House (30 percent) and R. Kelly’s Trapped in the Closet may be loaded with absurd dialogue and overheated plotting, but it’s pretty clear that’s what their makers were going for. And for every perversely hilarious folly like Valley of the Dolls (36 percent), there are theoretical so-bad-they’re-good entries (From Justin to Kelly, nine percent, or Myra Breckinridge, 26 percent) that are, in reality, pretty much unwatchable. (Frankly, I’d be surprised if RT’s worst-reviewed film of all time, Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever, has any ironic defenders.)What makes for a truly stellar so-bad-it’s-good movie is a gulf between conception and execution so wide it helps audiences to reconsider the notions of what constitutes good filmmaking. No essay on bad movies is complete without mention of Edward D. Wood, Jr., the master of delirious cinematic wrong-headedness. So enamored was Wood with the process of directing (and so tight were his budgets), that he would rarely, if ever, reshoot a scene. Utilizing every cut-rate trick in the book (hubcaps stood in for flying saucers, stock footage abounds), Wood crafted a series of anti-masterworks that brought to light his obsessions; Glen or Glenda? (33 percent) was a plea for the tolerance of transvestites (of which Wood was an enthusiast), and Bride of the Monster (29 percent), the last speaking role ofBela Lugosi, whom the director considered to be a great star, even years after his prime. Wood’s films were so weird and so seemingly incompetent they stayed well below Hollywood’s radar during his lifetime.But a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity and posthumous derision. Slowly but surely, Wood’s films were absorbed into the cinematic cannon, not because of their quality but because of their singularity: nobody made bad movies like these. Hoberman has called Wood an unconscious avant-gardist, and he’s something of a patron saint for against-all-odds indie filmmakers. (Tim Burton‘s brilliant, Oscar-winning biopic didn’t hurt matters, either.) Wood’s most famous work, Plan Nine From Outer Space (60 percent!), was long considered the worst movie ever made. But how bad is it, really, more people today have seen it than, say, How Green Was My Valley? Featuring an all-star ensemble of Wood regulars (including former wrestlerTor Johnson, ghoul girl Vampira, and charisma-free narrator Criswell), Plan 9 tells the story of aliens who want to reanimate the dead into an army that will conquer the world. After shooting only three minutes with Lugosi before his death, Wood hired a chiropractor friend to flesh out the role (which he did — by covering his face with his cape). The mistakes are too numerous to count: characters call each other by their real names, daytime and nighttime scenes butt against each other (sometimes in alternating shots), cardboard tombstones shake in the graveyard scenes, and the fight sequences are some of the stiffest ever captured on film. But Plan 9‘s badness is so pervasive and so original that contemporary critics find it — gasp! — pretty impressive. “Like the greatest cinema poets, [Wood] always managed to work in his own particular pet pleasures or concerns, and that odd, ear-bending dialogue is almost like a bizarre kind of open-verse poetry,” wrote Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustable Celluloid.With the throne vacant, bad movie aficionados needed a new champion in the “Worst Movie Ever Made” sweepstakes. They found it in Manos, The Hands of Fate (eight percent). The lone directorial effort of fertilizer salesman (how a propos!) Hal Warren, Manos would have been a quickly forgotten oddity had it not been for the critical reassessment provided by the bad movie connoisseurs from Mystery Science Theater 3000. After betting a screenwriter he could make a successful horror film, Warren scraped together some money, hired actors and models in the El Paso area, and began work on his anti-masterpiece: the story of a family that takes a wrong turn and ends up in the clutches of a demonic cult.Manos is a stunningly bad film, filled with endless driving sequences, insipid music, awkward pauses before and after cuts, disjointed dubbing, and ludicrously wooden acting. Some scenes (like an extended, graceless catfighting sequence) seem included only to increase the film’s length, while the dialogue (“There is no way out of here. It’ll be dark soon. There is no way out of here,” ominously declares the iconic Torgo, a satyr who helps run the house on the verge of hell) is incredibly stiff and not at all spine-chilling. What makes watching Manos a sublime experience is the same thing that made MST3K a hit: the fact that certain bad movies are tailor-made for vulgar, smart-alecky audiences, who can collectively delight at the sheer awfulness onscreen. (Naturally, Quentin Tarantino owns a copy of one of the few surviving original prints of Manos.) When it first screened in El Paso in 1966, Manos drew howls of disapproval and disbelief; now, there’s really no other way to view it. As Eric D. Snider put it, “Manos is virtually unwatchable without the aid of Joel and the ‘bots and their merciless mocking.”Since we’ve covered movies so bad that they aren’t bad at all, and movies that are bad but become good with incredulous guffaws, it’s time to explore the rarified realm of a third kind of bad movie: one so off-kilter so as to be entertaining, but still pretty far from good. I’m speaking, of course, of Uwe Boll‘s Alone in the Dark (one percent). Mr. Boll (whose latest, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale, hits theaters this week) has become something of a critical punching bag in recent years (going so far as to turn the tables and pummel one such unlucky critic). But I’ll be darned if I don’t find his movies blissfully entertaining; unlike many of the big-budget mediocrities that litter the multiplex each summer, Boll is fairly upfront about his intentions. He’s not making filet mignon, he’s making cheeseburgers.Unlike the schlockmeisters of old, it cannot be said that Boll is completely devoid of cinematic craft; if you caught patches of Alone in the Dark on late-night cable, you could be fooled into thinking it’s better than it is. And the actors in Alone (Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff), despite their tabloid misadventures, have all been involved in worthy entertainments. What makes Boll’s films so perversely entertaining is their distillation of time-tested commercial elements in jarringly askew ways. For example, Alone features ludicrously world-weary dialogue (“I learned the truth a long time ago. Just because you can’t see something, doesn’t mean it can’t kill you,” Slater portentously intones), pointless stylistic tricks (do we really need a zoom into the barrel of Slater’s gun before he pulls the trigger?), incomprehensible action (there are two shootouts that are so darkly lit and discordantly edited it’s literally impossible to know what’s going on), hilarious miscasting (Reid as an archaeologist?!), and a pretentious scrolling prologue that makes Star Wars‘ look like a monument to brevity. Alone also shamelessly cribs elements from such classics as Alien and the Indiana Jones movies, and features one of the most out-of-nowhere romantic interludes in recent cinema. But it is never, ever boring; as MaryAnn Johnson of Flick Philospher raved, Alone is “an instant classic of cheeseball cinema, an orgy of overblown dialogue and hammy overacting, 90-some-odd minutes of cheap-looking, jaw-dropping incoherence.”Entertaining badness comes in many other shapes and sizes. From misbegotten vanity projects like the Vanilla Ice vehicle Cool as Ice (eight percent) to the un-erotic, un-thrilling erotic thriller Fascination (four percent); from the knuckleheaded geopolitics of Navy SEALS (21 percent) to the goblin-infested cheesiness of Troll 2 (zero percent), badness can be goodness. Sometimes.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Kimmy, Century, TBS, Bravo, spanish, book","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-its-a-bad-bad-bad-bad-world"},{"id":"47508996286128","title":"Steal These 11 Heist Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Steal These 11 Heist MoviesCaper flicks more than worthy of getting your hands on.by RT Staff | March 5, 2008 |  Comments“There’s something quite fascinating with crooks, and criminals, and all things against the law,” Jason Statham said inour RT interview, “It’s a fascination that will never, ever die.” After a series of martial arts flicks, Statham returns to his petty crime roots with The Bank Job, opening this Friday, starring as a man over his head in the real-life 1971 robbery of safety deposit boxes. The film itself is a throwback to the gritty heist flicks of decades past, a stark difference to the frothy genre efforts that have dominated the scene as of late (like The Italian Job or the Ocean’s remakes). But the heist movie continues to survive not because of our obsession with the slimeball anti-hero, but also the genre’s ability to convincingly morph into areas like comedy, action, and horror. In this week’s Total Recall, take a look at a some of the many masks the heist movie can wear.Mission: Impossible (1996, 67 percent on the Tomatometer)The Job: Framed for his team’s ambush, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) goes on the run, assembling a new crew to steal the list of C.I.A. undercover agents in exchange for the real mole’s identity. Released during the summer of Independence Day and Twister, directorBrian de Palma bucked the blockbuster trend by making a thriller long on plot and intentionally muddled storytelling. “Destined to satisfy the thrill junkie and the sophisticate alike (Joe Baltake, Sacramento Bee),” de Palma consistently keeps the audience on their toes, especially with an outrageous late-game twist that had the TV show fans crying foul.The Payoff: Mission: Impossible‘s most memorable sequence features Ethan’s descending into a C.I.A. computer room. Re-envisioning Rififi for the espionage age, it’s a tense, blisteringly silent caper.The Score (2001, 75 percent)The Job: Criminal mastermind Max (Marlon Brando) lures his safecracking colleague Nick (Robert DeNiro) into a high stakes score that’ll let them retire from crime for good. His inside man Jackie (Edward Norton) has found his way into a job at the Montreal Customs House as a janitor – a physically handicapped janitor – all to procure a “priceless” Scepter in lock at Customs. Director Frank Oz reportedly struggled with Brando, who couldn’t take him seriously given his past life as Miss Piggy. Kenneth Turran of the LA Times wrote, “The Score will remind you of classic caper films of the past, and that is a good thing.”The Payoff: Great performances by three generations of method actors are real highlight. Norton has gotten a lot of the attention, particularly the moment when he drops his dog and pony show and pulls a gun on his coworkers in the Customs House.The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974, 100 percent)The Job: A gang of crooks takes a subway hostage, threatening to kill a person a minute unless the city delivers them a cool mil. As a transit cop (Walter Matthau) negotiates with the leader, Mr. Blue (Robert Shaw), he ponders just how they plan on getting away trapped underground. The Taking of Pelham One Two Three moves along confidently, showing not just the crooks’ point of view but develops Matthau’s story as he plugs away at the control center, along with scenes at city hall as they struggle to deliver the sack of money on time. Director Joseph Sargeant never lets his foot off the tension (and the comedy), with the movie coming off as a gritty love letter to the Big Apple: “There’s a skillful balance between the vulnerability of New Yorkers and the drastic, provocative sense of comedy that thrives all over our sidewalks,” write New York Times‘ Nora Sayre.The Payoff: “Gesundheit.” (Trust us, you’ll get it once you watch it.)Scarecrows (1988, no Tomatometer)The Job: Mercenaries successfully loot Camp Pendelton for $3.5 million, but get trapped in a forest filled with scarecrows. This, like Reservoir Dogs, is a heist movie that’s all aftermath. And whileTarantino takes that opportunity to deconstruct the genre, Scarecrows directorWilliam Wesley goes for flat-out horror instead. What follows is one long night as the men and women are individually sliced up and zombified by walking straw men. Cult horror movies almost always have their reputations precede them but Time Out‘s Derek Adams calls it “reasonably well put together, and features some stomach-turning grisliness.”The Payoff: One zombie encounter shows off amazing gore wizardry; after the victim becomes an involuntary organ donor, he gets filled with straw and hundreds of dollars.Bottle Rocket (1996, 78 percent)The Job: Three twentysomethings (Owen andLuke Wilson, Robert Musgrave) plan to crack open a warehouse’s safe while the place is unoccupied. Unlike most heist movies, Bottle Rocket‘s thugs are motivated by something most of us can empathize with: the suburban malaise. Of course, we usually respond to listless emotional drainage by skateboarding or picking up the drums, not robbing cold storage facilities. Regardless, as Jam! Movies‘ Liz Braun sees it, Wes Anderson‘s first feature is “a beautiful, little film with an uptempo heart.”The Payoff: The surprising final shot. Owen Wilson’s hangdog expression is that rare instance where Anderson’s bubbleworld of adolescent love and whimsy is punctured by that small inconvenience we call reality.Topkapi (1964, 83 percent)The Job:Peter Ustinov stars as Simpson, a small-time Athens-based hood that becomes entrenched in a plan to steal a jewel-encrusted dagger from Istanbul’s Topkapi Palace. While transporting supplies for the job across the border into Turkey, Simpson is stopped by authorities, who mistake the weapons in his car as part of a plot to stage a coup against the government. He’s subsequently enlisted as a mole to foil the plot, even as he becomes a more integral part of the caper. Directed by Jules Dassin, Topkapi may lack the heft and menace of his groundbreaking gangster film Rififi. Still, it’s an enjoyable, swingin’ affair that inspired not only the Mission: Impossible TV series but a real life jewel heist in New York City shortly after the film’s release. “It’s fun, light hearted, smart and wildly entertaining,” wrote Ryan Cracknell of Apollo Guide.The Payoff: When the heights-averse Simpson scales the palace as part of the heist, its not just a suspenseful, dryly comic moment; the scene also provides a breathtaking view of scenic Istanbul.The Thomas Crown Affair (1968, 76 percent)The Job: While most thrill seeking businessmen get their kicks sky diving, mountain climbing, or from good old-fashioned booze, Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) masterminds bank robberies. Of course no one suspects him of the crime but since those banks need their money, they hire an insurance investigator (Faye Dunaway) to find the perpetrator and see him to justice. Laughing in the face of all the powerful men who underestimate them, Dunaway’s investigator and McQueen’s criminal-businessman are made for each other. At the height of their respective careers, TV Guide wrote that “McQueen is charming, reads his lines well, and shows that he isn’t just another short actor with an interesting face.”The Payoff: You can’t help seeing some commentary about the exploitation of workers in this movie, with criminals for hire suffering gunshot wounds while their boss laughs like he lost some replaceable toy soldier. For all the strange economic commentary and nods to women’s liberation, the film’s greatest highlight is its aggressively self-aware editing. You haven’t seen split screen until you’ve seen this score.The Castle of Cagliostro (1977, 83 percent)The Job: After a heist on government-controlled casino nets them only high-quality counterfeit bills, Arsene Lupin III and his sidekick Jigen travel to the bills’ country of origin: Cagliostro, which also happens to hide a massive treasure the two can pilfer. Hayao Miyazaki’s reputation as Japan’s Spielberg can be witnessed here: Miyazaki softens the Lupin character (usually a bit of a cad in the manga and other media) and gets him invested in a love story with the Cagliostro princess, creating a movie that’s as much a romance as it is a mystery and caper flick. The Castle of Cagliostro is filled with “high adventure, stylish jazz grooves, and archetypal characters,” writes Reel.com’s Marc Fortier, “In other words, Cagliostro is a film first, and an anime second.”The Payoff: It’s all in the details. Though Miyazaki shows a knack for action sequences even at this early stage (this was his directorial debut), equally impressive is his devotion to scenery and early 20th-century European architecture. Fortunately, we get further glimpses of this wondrous perspective in films like Porco Rossoand Kiki’s Delivery Service.Bob Le Flambeur (1955, 96 percent)The Job: When it comes to making gritty, morally knotty crime flicks, nobody did it better than Jean-Pierre Melville, helmer of such classics as Le Doulos, Le Samourai, and Le Cercle Rouge. But Bob Le Flambeur (aka Bob the High-Roller ), Melville fashioned a heist film of uncommon suspense and depth of feeling. Roger Duchesne stars as Bob, a smooth middle-aged gambler and gangster who has earned the respect of both the underworld and the cops. After a string of big losses, he sketchily decides to rob the Dauville Casino, gathering a group of less-than-expert thieves to pull off the job. That the plan isn’t foolproof is the least of Bob’s concerns; his understudy-in-crime (Daniel Cauchy) and the object of their desire (Isabel Corey) pose a combustible risk as well. Bob Le Flambeur exerted a powerful influence on both the burgeoning French New Wave and the Ocean’s pictures. “Melville mixes an old-fashioned sureness of storytelling with some remarkably frank and modern touches of evil, sensuality and foreboding,” wrote Shawn Levy of the Oregonian.The Payoff: Even if we can see where it’s headed, Bob Le Flambeur remains satisfying because of Bob’s unwavering charm; he may be a crook, and he may be at the end of the line, but doggone if we don’t like the guy.Small Time Crooks (2000, 66 percent)The Job: Two inept New York citizens who should know better (Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman) assemble a crew to dig under a bank while using a cookie store as a front. Stuffed with one-liners and zany slapstick, it’s Allen’s welcome return to the territory of his early 1970s days, and is virtually a spiritual sequel to his first feature, Take the Money and Run. One of the director’s first box office successes in America in over a decade, Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid called Small Time Crooks “a return to good laughs and good fun.”The Payoff: The movie’s bizarre second-act plot turn. The cookie store turns out to be more successful than the bank job, catapulting the crooks into the upper echelons of society. Naturally, enterHugh Grant.Heist (2001, 66 percent)The Job: After getting caught on camera during jewelry store robbery, Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) is going to have to go into early retirement, but not until he completes (say it with us…) one last job. While the story of a thief taking on one final job isn’t new, Heist is memorable for few reasons, not the least of which is the solid cast (Hackman, Delroy Lindo, Danny DeVito, and Sam Rockwell). But the key element of Heist is the script from writer/directorDavid Mamet. The combination of the cast, the script and the direction led The Chicago Tribune’s Michael Wilmington to say “The cast is brilliant, the plotting ingenious, the dialogue incendiary.”The Payoff: As with any Mamet script, the dialogue often steals the show. And Danny DeVito may have the best line in the whole film: “Everybody wants money — that’s why they call it money!”Authors: Matt Atchity, Timothy Mead Ryan, Sara Schieron, Alex Vo","section":"Total Recall","tags":"potter, live, saw, Chernobyl, wars, Disney, biography, Fall, Plus, service, Emmys, Kids, AMC, Paramount, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"total-recall-steal-these-11-heist-movies"},{"id":"47508996284079","title":"Total Recall: Punching and the Movies — A Solid Combination","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

They’re a little old now, but I think you’ll forgive me —after all, they’re Atonement, Juno,Michael Clayton,No Countryfor Old Men, and There Will BeBlood.I’ve never been good at predicting the Oscars. Last year, forexample, I thought Pan’s Labyrinth was going to win Best Foreign. Silly me! So this year,I’m ditching gut feelings and going the experimental route: the Tomatometer. Theaverage Best Picture nominee’s Tomatometer hovers in the upper-80 percentile, socritical reception and Best Picture nomination go hand in hand. Mymini-experiment: can an ad hoc formula using Tomatometer and box officenumbers be used to predict the winner?To begin with, here are this year’s Best Picture nominees:&nbsp;Movie titleTomatometerBox office so far(in mil.)No Country for Old Men94%$61Juno93%$126There Will Be Blood91%$31Michael Clayton90%$48Atonement82%$48I’m going to predict an upset and say either Juno orMichael Clayton will take Best Picture. I’m probably wrong. And I hopeI’m wrong — I want There Will Be Blood to win. No Country hasalso deserved all of its momentum. But going on purely Tomatometer and boxoffice statistics, the numbers are against both NCFOM and TWBB.But more on that later.First, let’s talk Atonement. What happened here? Ithas strong performances, a rousing score, gorgeous panoramas, and a love storythat transcends both time and large bodies of water. In other words, the perfectOscar movie. And directorJoe Wrightskillfully avoided preening for the award throughout his movie. But, suddenly,it’s Atonement, not Juno, that should be happy to have gotten this far.This week’s issue of Entertainment Weekly pegs Atonementwith a 10 percent chance of victory, writing, \"Aren’t the days of the typical ‘Oscarmovie’ over?\" Indeed, the smear-and-sneer campaigns the last historical, epicBest Pictures (TheEnglish Patient [85 percent] and Titanic [82 percent])have endured after their wins reveal audiences have had their fill. Plus, Wrightwasn’t even nominated for Best Director. There’s only been three instances thata movie has won Best Picture under those circumstances (Wings[100 percent], GrandHotel [84 percent], and Driving Miss Daisy[78 percent]), and two of those came at a time when Private Snafuseemed like cutting-edge animation.I can’t decide if either Michael Clayton and Juno will win.They both exist in the now, even as they embody specific eras: Clayton recallsmeaty American dramas like Network (90 percent)and On theWaterfront (100 percent), and Juno, with its precious music andGen Y jive, is a movie with its head in the clouds, leaning ever-so-slightlyinto the future. If I had a gun to my nose, I’ll say Juno will pull theupset. It’s been a while since a movie mainly identified as a comedy has won BestPicture. And Juno has much in common with Annie Hall (98percent): they’re both culture-driven products of their time, but theirruminations on love and relationships have universality.So what does the Tomatometer have against a movie like No Country for Old Men, with itsvirtual lock on the Best Picture race? Get this: my cursory peek intocriticism history shows that in the past 36 years, only twice has the nomineewith the highest Tomatometer won Best Picture: Annie Hall in 1977, and Unforgiven(96 percent) in 1992.Why is that? Ideally, a year’s Best Picture is ameeting point between art and commerce: a movie of deep thoughts with the sweet charmto pass them on to whomever’s around. Critics, thirsty for something to wow themafter watching several hundred movies a year, are likely more wont to praisemovies of extreme novelty and subtlety before audiences (and the Oscars) canfully latch onto them.No Country for Old Men is the only Best Picturenominee that has virtually no backlash against it. The movie is challenging anddeliberately obscure, but the Coens’ mastery of their medium has kept audienceselectrified. I still feel jolts and chills thinking about it. ButTomatometer-wise, NCFOM has a 5.5 percent chance of winning. So if we areheading for an upset, I would normally picture There Will Be Bloodsneaking up to take home the statue.And that would be a remarkable feat for reasons beyond the fact thatThere Will Be Blood is a sprawling, shapeless movie about an ugly misanthrope. TWBBhas grossed the least of all the nominees. And from what I can guess, thelowest-grossing nominee has never,ever won. The reason’s fairly obvious: even though There Will Be Bloodhas been drawing strong per-theater averages, the less a country feels compelledto watch a movie, the less likely they are to vote for it.The Oscars have suffered a number of embarrassments thisyear. Snubs for Zodiac(89 percent) and The Simpsons Movie (89 percent). The sheer presence of Norbit (9 percent).And on the rejection of Persepolis (96percent), The Band’sVisit (98 percent), and 4 Months,3 Weeks, and 2 Days (97 percent), foreign Oscar chairman Mark Johnsonhadthis to say: \"It’s just inconceivable to me that they weren’t included.\" Butpublic humiliations aside, this year’s Best Pictures selections are among themost thoughtful, well-rounded crew to represent cinema in decades.In last month’s \"TheDownsizing of Oscar,\" Richard Corliss wondered, \"Why not just change thename, from the Oscars to the Independent Spirit Awards?\" But I don’t think it’sa matter of the academy out of touch with what the public watches. In fact, it’sthe opposite: not only do these movies represent the still-smoldering hope ofindie fare connecting with audiences, it demonstrates the Academy is finallycatching up with the rest of us.After giving Best Picture to the lazy, self-congratulatorypap of Crash(75 percent), the Academy atoned by givingMartinScorsese his Oscar last year. And now they’re recognizing five movies eachrelevant in its unique way.&nbsp; I haven’t seen as much online discourse sparkedas the complexities of deceit in Atonement and Michael Claytonhave, or of the annoying/endearing personality of Juno, the mystique of AntonChigurh, and the general WTFness of Daniel Plainview. Their stories maynot always make a mint at the box office, but they are exactly the thing to rileup the modern community — the bloggers, the users, the podcasters, the buddingscholars and filmmakers. Choose the movies that get us talking. We will be theones who make them last.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Watching, Pictures, NBC, globes, Moore, nightmare, Pirates, Apple","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-And-the-Oscar-Goes-To"},{"id":"47508996278956","title":"Total Recall: Shine a Light on Martin Scorsese","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Shine a Light on Martin ScorseseGive these a spin: Who's That Knocing At My Door, The King of Comedy, and After Hours.by | April 2, 2008 |  CommentsThis week,MartinScorsese‘s Rolling Stones documentary Shinea Light hits theaters. We at Rotten Tomatoes have decided to highlight someof the lesser-known gems in the filmography of a man many have called America’sgreatest living director.If you haven’t seen Mean Streets, Taxi Driver,Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or his long-awaited Best Picturewinner The Departed, get thee to a video store immediately. Still,Scorsese’s body of work is so consistently excellent that even his second-tierfilms contain plenty of riches (Life Lessons, the short he made for theomnibus New York Stories) or have influenced other filmmakers (bothQuentin Tarantino andRichard Linklater have paid homage to Scorsese’s little-seen doc American Boy in their own movies).After directing several audacious student films at NYU,Scorsese made his feature debut with Who’s That Knocking At My Door (1967, 75percent on the Tomatometer), a raw slice-of-life story strongly influenced by indie auteurJohn Cassavetes‘ Shadows. Door follows J.R. (Harvey Keitel, in hisfirst billed role), a young man from Little Italy who idles away his hourshanging with a group of buddies. He falls for a girl from the other side of thetracks after a lengthy discussion of The Searchers on the Staten IslandFerry. However, when he learns she’s been raped, J.R. falls into a morass ofunease and Catholic guilt — themes that would continue to inform laterScorsese’s films.It’s easy to view Who’s That Knocking At My Door assimply a rough draft for Scorsese’s later, greater films. The movie went througha long period of development, with Scorsese editing scenes together that hadbeen shot at different times for different projects; he even added an arty (and,frankly, overblown) sex scene after an exploitation distributor requested it.However, such an analysis overlooks the many pleasures — and innovations — ondisplay. Scorsese’s ability to present the daily rhythms of life in an urbanneighborhood is already in evidence, and his use of contemporary pop tunes onthe soundtrack was groundbreaking for its time. Channel 4 called Who’sThat Knocking At My Door “a wonderfully inspiring low-budget feature, withmore than just an inkling of the treats to come.”Who’s That Knocking At My Door‘s party scene (with different music).Scorsese’s films are filled with men who, despite limitedtalent or smarts, desperately want to be someone. If Rupert Pupkin, theantihero of The King of Comedy (1983, 92 percent), has a sunnier outwarddisposition than Travis Bickle, he’s no less psychotic on the inside. Pupkin(played with smarmy neediness byRobert DeNiro) dreams of stand-up comedy fame;his apartment is decorated like the set of a talk show, and he has imaginaryconversations with cardboard cutouts of big stars. One night, he weasels his wayinto the limo of late night host Jerry Langford (deftly played byJerry Lewis).Langford is cordial to Pupkin, vaguely promising to check out his act. However,Pupkin blows this chance meeting out of proportion, showing up at Langford’soffice calling his home; after being rebuffed several times, he and fellowstalker Masha (Sandra Bernhard) hatch a plot to kidnap Langford.As black as black comedies come, The King of Comedyis often painful to watch; Pupkin’s unearned self-regard lands him in plenty ofawkward situations, but there are stretches of the film (including themuch-debated ending) in which Pupkin’s delusions seem painfully within hisgrasp. If King was met with confusion by the critics upon its release,its dark critique of the culture of celebrity looks eerily prescient in ourpaparazzi-saturated age. Chuck O’Leary of Fantastica Daily called it “oneof the most disturbing, thought-provoking and funniest films of the 1980s. Thisunderappreciated Scorsese great is more relevant today than ever.”The King of Comedy: How to blow a date in four minutes.Pay attentionto AfterHours (1985, 92 percent): it’s the closest Scorsese will ever cometo making a stoner comedy. Set during one increasingly bizarre night, plainoffice drone Paul (Griffin Dunne) has one simple goal: to get back home after afailed one night stand. How many obstacles can Scorsese and screenwriterJosephMinion stuff in a few hours? Try three psychotic blondes, angry taxi drivers andsubway employees, an ice cream truck,Cheech Marin andTommy Chong, a bonafidebloodthirsty mob, and Paul’s Kafkaesque ability to never have enough money toget anywhere. Shot quickly and aggressively to rekindle Scorsese’s love forfilmmaking, After Hours is as hilarious as it is kinda frightening. The grit,the grime, the sheer randomness of New York as filtered through the eyes of a1980s yuppie makes this “a rich, wincingly funny metaphysical farce.” (Dave Kehr,Chicago Reader)After Hours: “Give me a token!”Throughout his career, Scorsese has shown a devotion tobranching out past strictly movies, uncovering new platforms to tell hisstories. While the movies we just discussed aren’t as widely recalled among themovie-going public compared to his other successes, even less seen is Scorsese’swork in television, music videos, and short film. If you haven’t gotten aroundto them yet, we’ll start you off: the complete 16-minute video to MichaelJackson’s “Bad” is available on YouTube, as is 2007’s The Key to Reserva,which doubles as a really long commercial and a ravishing homage to Hitchcock.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"DC, quibi, Awards, Box, Classic, Us, ESPN, Disney, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Shine-a-Light-on-Martin-Scorsese"},{"id":"47508997734073","title":"Total Recall: Stay on the Line for Phoney Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Stay on the Line for Phoney MoviesOperator, can you connect me to Sorry, Wrong Number, Dial M for Murder, and Scream?by Sara Maria Vizcarrondo | January 2, 2008 |  CommentsThis week, One Missed Call brings to US screens thestory of a girl terrorized by her wickedly foreboding cell phone. In honor ofthis J-Horror remake, Total Recall takes a look at at film about freaky phones.It’s fascinating how many horror films hinge on a phonecall — and not singly calls from hit men, ghosts or psycho killers either. Thewhole \"knock-knock-boo!\" horror convention has left the ranks of gimmick andmoved full-blown into sub-genre. Like I wrote, there are plenty of these filmsout there (we’ll only discuss three influential ones here), boasting tendenciesto boot. You’ll usually find a girl at the receiving end of the call. Tackilysuggesting a need to get the last word, the girl in question will sometimesreturn the call (I mean if you’re stupid enough…that’s what you get), and thekiller is generally close at hand. Predictable, right?The fun of these films often comes from clever direction.These older phone films were commonly chamber plays, featuring characters tiedto rooms and phones with cords. So, the more film literate audiences go to seehow a director could suck suspense from four walls. Obviously cordless phonesand even mobile phones alter the dynamics of suspense: I once heard a mysterywriter bemoan cell phones saying he could never pull suspense from an \"out ofoffice alert\" again.Within the \"scary phone\" sub-genre, the origin spot, thefontanel of the genre would have to be 1948’s Sorry, Wrong Number (90 percent onthe Tomatometer). Time has been kind toAnatole Litvak‘s noir about a pushyprincess with a weak constitution. StarBarbara Stanwyk spends literally theentire film chain-smoking in bed, compulsively making calls on a rotary phone.Her husband (Burt Lancaster), is the weak sort of WWII vet that populates thesenoirs with their bossy women and easy scores. When Stanwyk hears, by way ofcrossed phone wires, a murder plot and is completely disregarded by the police,she takes things into her own hands. Up until, of course, she finds out she’sthe mark for the murder and then her self-righteous vigilance devolves intohysteria. Stanwyk is brilliant as always and Lancaster is sort of incrediblehimself, playing a resigned and beat down husband who married up and hates everymoment. Oh, all the tricks up all those fabulously tailored sleeves.Critics like it now (\"The film’sbasic premise is just too compelling to resist,\" wrote Doug Pratt of DVDLaser),but it was less kindly received when it came out. Bosley Crowther of the NewYork Times, for example, said \"the narrative structure of the story and the involuted way in which it is told, with flashbacks occurring within flashbacksand extraneities popping here and there, cause it to be quite bewildering andtherefore tedious in the lengthy middle phase.\" We don’t often recall that noirwas not universally liked before the French gave it its affectionate moniker.Also, this chamber play accomplishes plenty outside of the room, employingflashbacks and Pac Bell almost simultaneously.The award for \"glossiest\" phone horror has to go toHitchcock‘s Dial M for Murder (1954, 78 percent). Picking up a bit where Sorry,Wrong Number left off, the murder in Dial M can again be traced tomarital discord and upward mobility. Boy, those wimpy men love theircomeuppance.Grace Kelly plays glamorous and resourceful wife Margot toRay Milland‘s conniving and money hungry husband Tony. Tony discovers Margot’sinfidelity and hires a college classmate to do her in. The cue for murderousaction is a phone call. Because of what happens after the phone call, the filmtakes a direction that’s darker than is generally expected from a Technicolorspectacle slash 3-D eye popper.\" Dial M For Murder includesone of the most intricate plots of any murder mystery as well as maximum amountsof Hitchcock’s trademark suspense,\" wrote David Bezanson of Filmcritic.com.Dial M for Murder: Trailer.Popcorn is commonplace in film culture and it’s anaccessory well at home inWes Craven‘s uber-referential horror masterwork, Scream(84 percent) Okay, so maybe \"masterwork\" is a big word here, but I remember whenthis film came out and the buzz reached past critical ballyhoo and ventured wellinto the territory of genre-defining cultural reference. Like Billy Wilder’sassociation with the rise and fall of noir, Craven had an association with theslasher film and in the height of self-reference, Scream provided aperfect balance of teen sex appeal and genre study.&nbsp;The teenagers in Scream have seen all the horrorfilms they need to get the rules. And sophisticated as they are, those thrillseekers don’t take anything seriously, playfully chatting with the killer,masked as the existentially agonized screamer from Edward Munch’s \"The Scream,\" waits quietly behind the plate glass door. The opening scene famously featuredthe return of long absentDrew Barrymore, some Jiffy Pop, and a chat abouthorror films with the prank caller/cineaste/killer and was widely praised. MikeBracken of Toxicuniverse.com wrote, \"The film opens with one of the best, mostintense, most unexpected opening sequences I’ve ever seen then rips on foranother ninety minutes or so, rarely flagging in terms of pace.\" See…girls don’talways need the last word.Scream: Trailer.If you still need to (cinematically) reach out and touchsomeone, check out Phone Booth (72 percent), Cellular (53percent), or Fred Walton‘s When a Stranger Calls circa 1979 (44 percent).","section":"Total Recall","tags":"elevated, BET, LGBT, zero, Trophy, on, MSNBC, Arts","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Stay-on-the-Line-for-Phoney-Movies"},{"id":"47508996281005","title":"Total Recall: Go All In with These Gambling Movies","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Go All In with These Gambling MoviesPlay your cards right with Dr. Mabuse, Maverick, and Rounders.by Sara Maria Vizcarrondo | March 26, 2008 |  CommentsGambling is a great central theme for a film, if for no better reason it’s fullof drama, deceit, and the occasional reason to look at someone (hopefullysomeone hot) under a table. With the appearance of 21 in theaters, wethought it time to run through some of our personal highlights in the universeof gambling movies.Sure, you can throw a rock and hit an iffy gambler or thug at the tables (Scorsese‘sCasino made that point perfectly clear) but the enduring lure of thegambler revolves around his (or her) prowess at the game — which, if weremember Rounders, has little to do with luck and lots to do with beingone step ahead. Card players (especially sexy ones) are the intellectualequivalent of the football player: They have to see the plays coming from yardsaway but when the play approaches their move should be liminal and give nothingaway. The gambler’s tricks mingle the cool of social skill and the intellect ofstrategy with monk-like intensity. It’s no wonder James Bond played Baccarat —icons are always enigmatic.Thetitular character of theFritz Lang classic Dr. Mabuse, Der Spieler (1922, 89 percent on the Tomatometer) is a master of magnetism, a hypnotist, an actor, animpersonator with multiple identities and, of course, a gambler. The most commontranslation of the title is Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, but “spieler”literally means “player” — and that implies all Mabuse’s acts, not simply whathe does at the card table. While dealers in the upper-class vice dens of WeimarGermany dole out cards, Mabuse (in crosscut) is shown playing his own game ofsolitaire with a stack of IDs. This isn’t just about poker face — Mabuse is oneman playing a thousand and that puts a twist on his game. Lang constructs thistreatise on identity and the image while fully entrenched in his own, timetested anxieties (death, authenticity, modernity).Though its four-hourrunning time (there are multiple versions on DVD) might seem daunting, the picis as magnetic as Mabuse himself, full of complex intrigue and ideas to untangle— which is probably why it became such a successful serial in Germany, spawningcontinuations. Keith Ulrich of Slant said, “Mabuse is a true bogeyman, ahollow shell of surface tics with a terrifying dead-eyed stare.” Well, that’sone way to describe a poker face.Notall iconic movie gamblers are menacing. Take Maverick (1994, 69 percent), forexample. The New York Times‘ Caryn James said, “You don’t have to knowanything about poker to guess that even away from the table, everyone in Maverickis bluffing all the time.” James’ quote strikes two major chords: Firstly, thefilm is as much about gambling as Margot at the Wedding is about floralarrangements. Secondly, while the highest drama in Maverick happens atthe tables, bluffing and raising are practices just as actively pursued withoutcards at play.Inspired by the TV show of the same name,Richard Donner‘s direction big-ups allthe conventions Westerns turned to cliché — but Donner does it in a gentlyironic way that makes all the Wagon-hanging, garter-gun-hiding hi jinx play wellfor the megaplexes. Best of all is the wayMel Gibson (then at the post-LethalWeapon height of fame) plays dumb to get his way. It’s an easy game that hedoesn’t do as well as his adversary/love-interestJodie Foster (sporting an off-southern accent) but it’s charming, and what’s a poker game without a littleflirtation?Thetension between the players is what drives Rounders (1998, 64 percent). Rightafter Good Will Hunting,Matt Damon was a hot commodity with everywhereto go — not unlike his character inJohn Dahl‘s neo-noir. Damon’s MikeMcDermott was years reformed from a career in poker when he opts to return inorder to help a friend pay off a loan shark. Time Out said, “Powerhouse castingis the film’s strong suit,” but its abundant Indiewood cast isn’t its lone claimto fame.Rounders did for poker picture what The Asphalt Jungle didfor heist movies: it proves the specifics can be interesting. Most gamblingfilms skate right past gambling into the intrigue of cold reading or the quippyplay of bluffing, but not Rounders. Advised by a small army ofprofessional poker players, McDermott’s line, “it’s a game of skill,” echoes asmuch in the dank corridors of New York’s underground dens than in the cavernoushalls of Las Vegas’ Bellagio. More famous is his incantation: “If you can’t spotthe sucker in the first half hour at the table, then you are the sucker.”Ifyou need more to get your gambling fix, consider watchingJohn Garfield take apunch in Robert Rossen‘s Body and Soul (100 percent), or seeElliot Gouldand George Segal get dicey inRobert Altman‘s California Split (90percent). If you’d rather root for some sexy criminals maybe consider somevintage Redford andNewman inGeorge Roy Hill‘s The Sting (93 percent),Sterling Hayden inKubrick‘s The Killing (1956, 96 percent) orSharonStone in Scorcese’s Casino (83 percent).","section":"Total Recall","tags":"nfl, indie, biography, GLAAD, language, Disney, TV, FXX, of, Paquin, San, Reality, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Go-All-In-with-These-Gambling-Movies"},{"id":"47508996288177","title":"Total Recall: Fairy Tales for Grownups","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Fairy Tales for GrownupsLet us tell you a story about Freeway, The City of Lost Children, and Tideland.by Sara Maria Vizcarrondo | February 27, 2008 |  CommentsOn the festival circuit, Penelope, starringChristinaRicci as a pig-nosed recluse embarking upon the modern world for the firsttime, seemed to getabout as much press attention as its shut-in titular character. Now that thefilm is seeing release Friday, we thought it time to conjure up other movies in tiny crosssection of the genre to which it belongs.No one’s going to argue that traditional fairy tales have acreep factor. Perhaps we can credit Disney for our unnatural comfort withanthropomorphic animals, but before you go squealing about the cuteness of atalking hedgehog, let’s remember that both the Three Little Pigs (talkingabominations in and of themselves) and Little Red Riding Hood were duped bytalking wolves. Which brings to bear a point: To a kid these tales may beliteral, but to adults, the beauty is all in the metaphor.Playing fast and loose with a familiar story,Matthew Bright‘s 1996 update of Red Riding Hood, Freeway (74percent on the Tomatometer), cleverly modernizes Red by swapping the gothic doomof the fairy tale for the danger of South Central.Vanessa Lutz (ReeseWitherspoon) lives with her prostitute mother (Amanda Plummer) and her sexuallyabusive (wicked) step-father (Michael T. Weiss). Surrounded by meth addiction andcrippled gang war veterans, Vanessa is barely literate but commands a lot ofrespect in her neighborhood. When her parents are arrested she takes a basketand a six-pack and drives (did I mention she’s probably 14?) to the mythicsanctity of her grandmother’s trailer. En route to the trailer park her car diesand the perfectly clothed Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) \"saves\" her. Called\"Cynical, stylish and witty\" by Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail, Freewaylooks far more original than most other fairy tales out there. No wonder itkick-started Witherspoon’s career.Freeway‘s opening animated credits.As mentioned, the gothic touch has always loomed large withthese stories, and here to prove that the gothic is not the sole province of theGermans are Marc Caro andJean-Pierre Jeunet. Previouslyaffiliated with graphic novels, French duo Jeunet and Caro reached new career heights with1995’sThe City of Lost Children (82 percent), their second film to see a broadsuccess in the States (the forerunner being 1991’s Delicatessen).New Times critic Andy Klein wrote, \"Anyonelooking to lose themselves in an engrossing fairy-tale world will be richlyrewarded.\"StarringRon Perelmanas One, a circus strongman, Cityfollows this unlikely hero and his world-weary orphan guide Miette (JudithVittet) into the belly of a nightmare factory. A mysterious band of Cyclops/cyborgssteal One’s little brother and through a bizarre chain of events One and Miettetrace the Cyclops colony to a nightmare factory. The villain of this netherworldis an ancient, bony man who’s lost the ability to dream and so has dedicated hislife to stealing the dreams of children. Ironically all he does to inspire thesedreams is incarcerate the children and scare the crap out of them — which isfine because his mad scientist lab is equipped with its own diaper service.Those mad scientists are prepared.The City of Lost Children‘s trailer.Sadly,nothing could prepareTerry Gilliamfor the critic beating he received for his last endeavor Tideland (28percent). Critic Chris Barsanti said, \"If there was ever a film to end a career, Tideland is it.\" Barsanti was only one of a wave of critics who wrote about Tidelandas if Gilliam himself had entered their homes and beat their children. And withlittle reason, if you ask me. Gilliam’s work has always bordered the dark and dryaesthetic of old England. (He himself admits he stole his best material forRobert Hamer‘s Kind Hearts and Coronets.) Adultfairy tales paved thegolden path of Gilliam’s early career and outlined some of his pet themes. TheAdventures of Baron von Munchausen, Time Bandits, and Brazilall bandy in the same aesthetic and each are considered noteworthy contributionsto the lexicon.What makes Tideland different is that instead of celebratingGilliam’s previous themes, he’s pulling them apart; Gilliam himself is lookingfor the source. Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland) is the daughter of two washed-uprock musicians who manage their home, family, and heroin addictions with uniform sloth. Jaliza fixes her father Noah (Jeff Bridges) his\"vacations\" (hypodermics) and withstands her mother’s cruel and insane fits.When her mother dies her father flees with Jaliza to his childhood home. Shortlyafter arrival, her father dies and Jaliza is left to make her way, surviving thecruelties of her circumstance with a mixture of fantasy and denial. Though insome ways Jaliza’s fairy tale are inspired by her life, she uses these fairytales to escape reality.Perhaps the reason Tideland wasn’t a crowd pleaseris the same reason Penelope could be. Sometimes the best part of a fairytale is the escape it affords you, and maybe we just need more of that escapewhen we’re small. Like Lillian Gish says in Night of the Hunter, \"It’s ahard world for little things.\"Tideland‘s trailer.If you like these fairy tales for the fully grown, consideralso Ridley Scott’s Legend (52percent), AtomEgoyan‘s pied piper revision, TheSweet Hereafter (100 percent), orSteven Spielberg‘sPinocchio, A.I.Artificial Intelligence (72 percent). And if you’re inthe mood for comedy, there’s always The Princess Bride(95 percent) — which is as muchabout the fairy tale as about the telling.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"supernatural, Comics, Winter, Prime, Pop, E3, furious, Marvel, action, french","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Fairy-Tales-for-Grownups"},{"id":"47508997753541","title":"Total Recall: We Own The Night and Other Sibling Showdowns","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: We Own The Night and Other Sibling ShowdownsBrothers up in arms: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, Gattaca, The Royal Tenenbaums.by Alex Vo | October 10, 2007 |  CommentsThis week, We Own the Night hits theaters, telling the story of twobrothers (played byJoaquin Phoenix andMark Wahlberg) on opposite sides of thelaw. The sibling rivalry is often the basis for compelling cinema, something we’ll explore in this week’s Total Recall.Sibling conflict has been at the root of many great works of art, be they TheGodfather (100 percent), King Lear(50 percent), or the first couple Kinks albums. The reasonsare obvious: How can people with such similar DNA turn out so differently? Why,with so much in common, do brothers and sisters disagree, or follow decidedlydifferent paths in life? From uneasy Thanksgiving reunions to Cain-and-Abel-esqueshowdowns, cinematic sibling dysfunction runs the gamut. Let’s take a look atsome memorable family feuds.We can’t imagine someone who was enamored with the dark tone of the originalTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (38 percent) being particularly happy whenthe jokier Secret of the Ooze (35 percent) came out. But for a kid growing upduring the grunge era, 1991 was a perfect storm of Turtles mania: Anavalanche of merchandise, a great cartoon on the air, and Turtles in Time for the Super Nintendo. And, of course, there was the movie. Secret of the Ooze had new monsters, more interesting human characters,snappier pacing, and with an eminently quotable song from rap-poseurVanillaIce, Donna Britt of the Washington Post praises that \"it has enough jokesaimed at adults to make for a relatively painless outing for parents forced totake their kids to see it.\"While Splinter dispensed wisdom like the ad hoc parental unit he was, the relationship between Leonardo (the leader) and Raphael (theloose cannon) was always easier to digest for kids. Both devoted to honor andduty but completely different in their approaches, they were your typicalsquabbling duo that couldn’t stand each other’s presence but would do even worsewhen separated. The two create the emotional crux of the series, which isfurther explored in the recent animated TMNT(31 percent).Along with ThePrincess Bride (95 percent) and Dead Poets Society(83 percent), 1997’s Gattaca (80 percent) was one of those movies you’d always see forthe first time in middle or high school. It’s a great all-purposemovie: a literate script for English class, lectures about DNA for biologyclass, and the film’s thesis on human worth and potential can be shoehorned intohigh schools affluent enough to have philosophy classes. Gattaca starsEthan Hawkeas Vincent Freeman, a genetically inferior man tormented by his superior brotherand a harsh reality: he can never achieve his dream of being an astronautthrough legal means. It’s a thoughtful movie that James Berardinelli calls \"acautionary tale about the dangers of letting scientific ability outstrip ethicsand [a] morality play about the irrationality of bigotry.\"Loren Deanco-stars as Vincent’s brother, Anton. The two squabble and compete withincreasing severity. Anton eventually leads a shapeless life as a detective,while Vincent pushes himself beyond his supposed genetic limits. Writer-directorAndrew Niccoldemonstrates with Gattaca that characters don’t necessarily have to besupplanted by special effects and gadgets. Along with his screenplay for The Truman Show(95 percent), Niccol always insists on laying the human touch on sciencefiction.In every WesAnderson movie looms the long shadow of the father figure, but some of themost amusing relationships in his films are between brothers. See Bob Mapplethorpeand his sibling John (aka Future Man) inBottle Rocket (78percent). Or the trio on that spiritual bonding journey in The DarjeelingLimited (64 percent). And there’s no shortage of ruined familialrelationships in 2001’s The Royal Tenenbaums(80 percent), Anderson’s third feature-length effort. The film has endured as oneof Anderson’s most beloved, called \"a New Yorker cartoon come to life,droll and sad and knowing at the same time\" by MaryAnn Johnson of FlickFilosopher.Amidst the beyond-neurotic denizens that make up the Tenenbaum household arebrothers Chas and Richie, played byBen Stillerand Luke Wilson,respectively. One of Anderson’s strengths is a knack for casting (WillemDafoe as a sensitive German oceanographer in Life Aquaticremains brilliant), and here Stiller and Wilson get to take their \"shtick\" to anextreme. Clashing Stiller’s manic outbursts against Wilson’s lackadaisicaldemeanor creates the perfect comic contrast.Given the inherent potential for love and conflict in any family, there is noend to the number of stories that can be harvested from the cracks in fraternalor sororal relations. Check out Hannah and her Sisters (92 percent), RainMan (90 percent), Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (89 percent), or Vincent&amp; Theo (86 percent) for further adventures into the complex lives ofsiblings.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Holiday, Superheroe, service, streaming","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-We-Own-The-Night-and-Other-Sibling-Showdowns"},{"id":"47508998815430","title":"Total Recall: The Heartbreak Kid and the Movies of Neil Simon","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: The Heartbreak Kid and the Movies of Neil SimonSimon's cinema: Murder by Death, California Suite, and The Lonely Guyby Alex Vo | October 3, 2007 |  CommentsAfter toning down the crude and turning up the cute (evengiving JimmyFallon a chance in Fever Pitch!) forthe last six years, the Farrelly brothers return to R-rated raunch territorywith TheHeartbreak Kid,opening this Friday. It’s a remake of the 1972Neil Simonfilm of the same name and this week we’ll journey through the New Yorkplaywright’s presence throughout cinematic history.Unlike most playwrights, financial success greetedSimon on hisfirst play, a Tony nomination for the second, and from them on his reputation asone of contemporary America’s finest writers — capable of light comedy,absurdist humor, and drama, often within one pen stroke — was cemented. LikeWoody Allen,Reggie Jackson,The Ramones, andmost other artists indelibly associated with New York, the height of Simon’spowers and fame existed within the 1970s.&nbsp; This was the decade of the AmericanNew Wave, celebrating the urban landscape in all of its profane glory. &nbsp;PaulineKael and Andrew Sarriswere turning film criticism into an art. The New York auteur became an accepted,well-recognized beast. And Broadway plays were being adapted into film withsurprising regularity (and not just those funny musical ones).Four of Simon’s plays had been adapted to the screen by thetime he contributed his first original screenplay,The Out ofTowners (60 percent), starringJack Lemmonand Sandy Dennis.&nbsp;Afterwards, original works and adapted screenplays started coming out of theSimon woodwork at a steady clip. You know of (and probably have already seen)The Odd Couples,Biloxi Blues (76percent), and The Goodbye Girl (75 percent). Here’s some of the lesser-known cinematicworks of Neil Simon.Imagine some of the most iconic detectives — Charlie Chan,Nick and Nora Charles, Hercule Poirot, Sam Spade, and Miss Marple — asre-envisioned by an immature writer.&nbsp; A really smart, immature writer. In 1976’s Murder by Death(73 percent), written for the screen by Simon, an ensemble of detectivesare invited out to the countryside for a night of food, entertainment, and, ofcourse, murder. Simon sublimely spoofs the murder mystery with Murder by Death,and stuffs in more penis, poop, and tongue-in-cheek jokes you’d though possiblecoming from the mouths of such a reputable cast.&nbsp; Highlights includePeterSellers as Sydney Wang, the Chan rip-off who spouts lame profundities inbroken English, andAlec Guinnessas the blind butler who definitely maybe commits a few murders.WhenTruman Capoteenjoyed that mid-decade renaissance with two movies (Capote,Infamous) andpublication of his long-lost first novel, Summer Crossing, it was surprising Murder by Death didn’t surge inpopularity. Capote makes a late game appearance in the film as a cranky,eccentric millionaire (\"Say your ******* pronouns!\" Capote yells to thesyntax-challenged Wang) who has a lengthy meta spiel about the lameness ofmurder mysteries.Sometimes you write a piece that’s too good to throw away,but way too short to turn into a play.&nbsp; What do you do then?&nbsp; If you’re NeilSimon, you cobble them all together, centering the vignettes around a singlelocation.&nbsp; 1978’s California Suite(50 percent) is the middle of this loose trilogy, includingPlaza Suite (40percent) and LondonSuite.&nbsp;Four completelyunrelated groups converge on a Beverly Hills hotel, among them Walter Matthauas a man who, after a night of poor, drunken judgment, must hide the unconsciousgirl in his bed from his wife (Elaine May). Matthau brilliantly jugglesslapstick and simpering pathos — another notch for someone who’s never given alousy performance.From Alvy Singer to John McClane, the “New Yorkers trapped inSouthern California” trope has been a limitless wellspring for comedy.&nbsp; Simon oncefamously proclaimed there’s only 72 interesting people in Los Angeles (asopposed to the six million in New York) and the City of Angels in CaliforniaSuite clearly comes from an East Coast perspective. Simon explicitly exploresthis with the AlanAlda–JaneFonda storyline. Alda plays a reformed New Yorker who now sports a tan and apolyester wardrobe, while Fonda plays his verbosely cranky ex-wife on a forcedvisit to LA. Simon is transfixed on the possibility that a New Yorker cansomehow turn into a West Coast creep. In one scene Alda and Fonda will bearguing about this subject, and in the next they’re randomly coolin’ on somebeach.&nbsp; California!There’s only a few blemishes onSteve Martin‘sformidable portfolio of 1980s comedies.&nbsp; And they’re not necessarily bad, justrelatively unknown.&nbsp; One of them is 1984’s The Lonely Guy(50 percent), based on a book called The Lonely Guy’s Book of Lifeand adapted by Neil Simon. Martin stars as Larry Hubbard, a aspiring novelistwho becomes a Lonely Guy (yes, it’s an oft-used term in the movie) after gettingdumped. He befriendsCharles Grodin,another Lonely Guy, and they embark on a life possibly spent alone, together.&nbsp;They buy ferns, dogs, go out to dinners, and throw parties with cardboardcut-outs of celebrities. Martin is reliably funny, but Grodin steals the showwith warm performance keeps the movie grounded, and a perfect contrast toMartin’s manic movements. It makes Grodin current self-exile from movies all themore painful.The Lonely Guy‘s surreal tone and sappy romanticstory takes a very long time before they gel, but there’s more than a handful ofcomedic nuggets to keep this movie compelling. In true New York fashion, randombits of Martin and Grodin talking about nothing in particular are interspersedthroughout.&nbsp; The highlight comes in a lengthy discussion about hair and howbums, who don’t even need hair, seem so capable of keeping it together.&nbsp; It’sthe best Seinfeld segment never put on TV.Having entered his 80th year this past July, it’s understandable why Simon has slowed down in recent years. His last film was a TV adaptation of The Goodbye Girl with Richard Dreyfuss, and his last play was in 2003. But New York artists are known for their longevity. With the New York auteur making a comeback, who’s next?","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Lifetime, Channel, children's, live, Lionsgate, rings, child's","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-The-Heartbreak-Kid-and-the-Movies-of-Neil-Simon"},{"id":"47508997742270","title":"Total Recall: Malice and Medicine","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Malice and MedicineExploring the mal of medical practice.by Matt Atchity | November 28, 2007 |  CommentsImagine what it might be like if you needed surgery.&nbsp;You’re more than a little nervous about the whole idea.&nbsp; In fact when you thinkabout it, you’ll admit you’re frankly terrified by the whole idea.&nbsp; What ifsomething goes wrong?&nbsp; What if the doctors make a mistake?&nbsp; And what if youdon’t wake up after the surgery?&nbsp; &nbsp;Or worse yet, what if you wake up duringthe procedure?One of the scarier stories about medical mishaps in thelast few years is about a phenomenon called “anesthetic awareness.” Patientstalk about actually being awake and aware throughout an entire procedure andfeeling every sensation that the anesthetic is supposed to suppress, while beingcompletely unable to move or communicate with the doctors.&nbsp; That’s the basicpremise of this week’s Awake,starring Hayden Christensen andJessica Alba.&nbsp;A man with a heart problem (Christensen) goes in for a transplant, but wakes upduring the procedure, yet totally unable to move.&nbsp; And as if that wasn’t badenough, he hears his own doctor discussing plans to kill him.&nbsp; Talk about addinginsult to injury.Considering the level of trust that we as a society put inhealthcare professionals, the concept of putting a doctor in a malicious lightcan be a very effective tool for a thriller.&nbsp; Some folks are pretty squeamishabout needles and scalpels anyway, and when those tools are used tointentionally inflict pain, it can be horrific. Some filmmakers have gone forthe easy scare with throwaway slashers like Dr. Giggles (17percent) and TheDentist (0 percent), while even the Saws have some scarymedical overtones.&nbsp; And then there’s that horrific scene in Marathon Man (77percent), which did for dentists what Jaws did for trips to the beach.&nbsp;But some films, like Coma, Dirty PrettyThings, and The ConstantGardener take the very concept of health care, pick it apart, and playwith our feelings of trust and hope.&nbsp; That can be just as disturbing as anythingyou’ll see in the goriest slasher films.1978’s Coma (75 percent) isone of Michael Crichton‘s earliest directing efforts.&nbsp; Fresh off the success of Westworld, Crichtonused his own experience as a doctor to adapt Robin Cook’s novel about a darkconspiracy in a Boston hospital.&nbsp;GenevieveBujold stars as a young resident who gets a little too curious about whyso many patients are coming out of surgery in comas.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it lookslike every other doctor on staff (MichaelDouglas, Richard Widmark, andRip Torn) may bein on the plot, and the film gets increasingly more paranoid as time goes by.&nbsp;Bujold eventually discovers that the hospital is in the business of harvestingorgans from certain patients, and she narrowly avoids losing her own.Michael Crichton’s ComaDirty PrettyThings (94 percent) isn’t so much about a doctor who is evil, somuch as it’s about a doctor who may have to do evil things.&nbsp;ChiwetelEjiofor plays Okwe, a Nigerian doctor who has illegally immigrated toLondon.&nbsp; He can’t practice in England because of his status, so he works avariety of menial jobs to survive, and treats other illegal immigrants for extramoney.&nbsp; While working as a hotel porter, he discovers a human heart, and hisquest to discover where it came from leads him to a dirty business of humanorgans being traded for immigration papers, all while trying to stay out ofsight of immigration authorities.&nbsp; It’s a frightening look at what it must belike to live between the cracks of society, and how even someone with Okwe’straining and morals is driven to extremes in order to survive.Chiwetel Ejiofor and Audrey Tautou in Dirty Pretty ThingsIn The ConstantGardener (84 percent)Ralph Fiennesstars as a low-level British bureaucrat whose wife (RachelWeisz) was killed on a mercy mission in Africa.&nbsp; As Fiennes investigates, itat first seems like his wife may have been having an affair, but then hediscovers that she had been investigating the activities of a large,multinational drug company.&nbsp; Details of illegal testing, conspiracy andgovernment corruption come to light, and we learn that the businesses that makemedicine can be just as ruthless as any third world warlord.A scene from The Constant Gardener","section":"Total Recall","tags":"camera, Dead, TV, Witch, Schmidt","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Malice-and-Medicine"},{"id":"47508997745344","title":"Total Recall: Beowulf and Ye Olde Tradition of Animation","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Beowulf and Ye Olde Tradition of AnimationHumans and animation mix and match in this week's Total Recall.by | November 14, 2007 |  CommentsThese are heady times for live-action/animation hybrids.This week, Robert Zemeckis updates the Old English poem Beowulf with somehelp from Ray Winstone,Angelina Jolie, and a whole mess of technology. Nextweek, Enchanted, starringAmy Adams andPatrickDempsey, also adds a heavydose of animation to its fantasy world. With these flicks in mind, it’s a good time totake a look at some other flicks that combine live-action and animation inunconventional ways.The blending of live-action and animation is nothing new, asevinced by silent cartoons like Gertie the Dinosaur andMax Fleischer‘s rotoscoped shorts featuring Koko the Clown. Now technology has advanced to thepoint where some films, like the Lord of the Rings movies, blendtechnology and live-action so seamlessly it’s sometimes hard to tell thedifference. What was once a novelty is now relatively commonplace. But before then, rotoscoped animation hit its turning point in the 1970s when director Ralph Bakshi established it as an artistic technique (and not just a trifle or cost-cutting measure) through a series of racially charged, frequently explicit animated movies.By the mid-1970s,Bakshi wasthe American king of urbanely ribald animation with features like Fritz the Cat(53 percent), HeavyTraffic (91 percent), and Coonskin. With 1977’sWizards (53percent), he attempted something a little different. Conceptually, Wizards is a movie Walt Disney could get behind:soulful, beautiful animation (as Bakshi described it) with bright colors,fairies, and even a princess or two. In execution, he delivered post-apocalypticpsychedelia, a bizarre fable about two brothers set millions of years in thefuture. One brother is healthy and is nice to his mother, the other a mutant whoreconstructs 21st century weapon technology and breeds an army withNazi propaganda. A.H. Weiler of the New York Times calls it \"a melange ofanimation and live footage that [features] mystical, slightly scary and,occasionally, comic tones.\" Contrasted with its Disney-esque color palette andvoice acting, this movie is likethe UNICEF Smurfs ad gone feature-length.Bakshi used rotoscoping for a majority of the large-scalebattle sequences, a technique that requires an animator to paint and color livefootage. (Beowulf is a sophisticated variation on rotoscopes.) Elegant creaturessuch as Snow White or Gollum can spring out of rotoscoping, but Bakshi had aunique approach in films like Wizards and 1978’s The Lord of the Rings(50 percent): applyingjust the right amount of detail and fluid motion, he turned objects intogrotesque apparitions. Perfect when you feel like animating the monstrosity ofwar.The Wizards trailer.TRON(67 percent) was a commercial disappointment for Disney in 1982 andit’s been a notoriously long and arduous journey to get a sequel greenlit. Butit’s hard not to think that there wouldn’t be all those troubles if the movie were just a teeny bit better. The premise is intriguing (Jeff Bridges gets zapped into acomputer, where programs have to gladiate against each other in neon suits) ifhalf-formed, while the pacing is beyond plodding. But it was thespecial effects Disney was really banking on. Considering TRON can beseen as theprogenitor of computer graphics-driven studio flicks, some of its effects holdup remarkably well. \"The movie’s innovative digital special effects were jaw-droppingat the time and still seem pretty cool,\" writes Jeffrey Anderson of Combustible Celluloid. Indeed, there’s an elemental thrill inseeing a digital airship gliding over a mountain range or light cycles speedingaround on grids.TRON demonstrated that computer-generated scenes couldpropel a narrative, a lesson that countless blockbusters have taken to heart.Two years after TRON, Pixar released their first short (The Adventures ofAndre and Wally B.) and people slowly began realizing that, goodness, these cumbersome computers can also make things funny, expanding even more upon thefuture potential of the machine.The light cycle scene from TRON.RichardLinklater‘s Waking Life (2001, 79 percent)utilized rotoscoping for more philosophically-minded purposes. The movie tellsthe story of a young man wandering around Austin, listening to a variety ofpoints of view about the nature of existence — all the while wondering if he’sin the midst of an extended dream, or alive at all. Human actors were shot ondigital video, and different artists then overlaid the footage with a varietyof styles via computer (Linklater used a similar technique on A ScannerDarkly [67 percent]). The result has a textural beauty unlike virtuallyanything else — sometimes impressionistic, sometimes cartoonish, WakingLife‘s visuals add a sense of hyper-reality to its musings on the nature ofreality.Despite its fascinating technique, Waking Life hasits detractors; some find the nearly non-stop philosophizing unbearable. Butwithin the expanse of talk, there is an overall air of optimism and wonder thatmakes Waking Life hypnotic for those willing to plunge into it. And thefinal monologue, in which Linklater himself tells our sleepy protagonist a storyabout Philip K. Dick, is a knockout.The Chicago Tribune‘s Michael Wilmingtoncalled it \"truly special, truly different — a wondrous talky roundelay aboutand for people who love life.\"A clip from Waking Life.By no means are these films’ methods the only approaches pioneering animators have taken. If hyper-real meditations on war, reality, and existence prove too harsh, you can always opt for lighter fare: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (100 percent), Pete’s Dragon (60 percent) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (100 percent) all represent disparate attempts to meld live-action and animation.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Comics, remakes, Election, international, 93rd, Ice, your","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Beowulf-and-Ye-Olde-Tradition-of-Animation"},{"id":"47508997746369","title":"Total Recall: Welcome to Coen Brothers Country","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Welcome to Coen Brothers CountryA look at the filmography of the two-headed writer-producer-director.by RT Staff | November 7, 2007 |  CommentsBefore expanding wide on November 21, No Country forOld Men (90 percent) will play in select cities this Friday, riding awave of huge expectations. (RT dug it at Cannes!) TheCormacMcCarthy-based thriller has made big splashes during festivals and it’stouted as a major comeback for theCoen Brothers.What better time to look at the movies that have made the filmmaking siblings sorespected?Even with seemingly multiplex-ready movies like IntolerableCruelty (75 percent) and The Ladykillers(55 percent), Joel and Ethan Coen have rarely been boffo box office draws. But thebrothers release their movies with surprising regularity, and never seem to havemuch problem getting projects off the ground. It’s probably because the duomakes weird movies. But not too weird. The Coens are essentially genrecraftsmen — crime thrillers, neo-noirs, a stoner comedy here or there — whofinesse their movies with signature arch dialogue and a morbid, mannered senseof humor. It’s an approach that limits box office but opens countless doors toproduce a loyal and rabid cult following. Here’s a trip through the filmographyof America’s most valued team of auteurs.Combining the shocks of a slasher film with the moralambiguity and twisty plotting of film noir, the Coens’ debut, Blood Simple(1984, 98 percent),shook American independent cinema to its core. Creepy and deliriouslymalevolent, its the story of a bar owner who hires a sketchy private eye to kill hischeating wife (Frances McDormand); double and triple crosses and bloody mayhemensues. With their first film, the Coens show an aptitude for the stylisticquirks that would become their trademark: the balancing the macabre with a loopysense of humor.The first Coenbrothers film to display their knack for quirky comedy, 1987’sRaising Arizona(90 percent)helped seal the filmmakers’ reputation and cement their loyal following.Nicholas Cage andHolly Hunter are brilliantly cast as a cop and ex-conhusband/wife who resolve their infertility with kidnapping. Though not theirbiggest hit, it’s infinitely quotable (\"Edwina’s insides were a rocky placewhere my seed could find no purchase.\") and original score by Carter Burwell isnot to be ignored.As an homage to classic gangster movies,1991’s Miller’sCrossing (90 percent) is hypercharged; the language is harsher, the violencemore brutal, the plotting more labyrinthine.Albert Finney andGabriel Byrnestar as Irish mobsters, threatened externally by the Italian mob and internallyby their shared love of a woman (Marcia Gay Harden). In some ways, Miller’sCrossing is the Coens’ most straightforward work; while it has a streak ofdark humor, it features impeccable 1920s décor and intriguing tale of loyaltythroughout.Legend has it the Coens had such a bad case of writer’sblock while writing Miller’s Crossing that they took three weeks off toscript Barton Fink(1991, 93 percent), a 1930s-set black comedy about — what else? — aHollywood scribe with writer’s block. A fledgling New York playwright who sellsout (at the cost of…his soul!) and moves to the City of Angels, Barton Fink(played marvelously by Coen regularJohn Turturro)holes up in the seamy Hotel Earle, where exquisitely dismal wallpaper peels offthe walls as a heat wave sweats the city. The heat especially ramps up whenBarton’s gregarious neighbor (JohnGoodman) is around; almost hellishly so, you might say. But as everysmart filmmaker is wont to do, the Coens offer no overt explanations of what’sreally going on — just a well-told tale with visual imagery aplenty, and an odeto the sometimes infernal nature of the creative process.The Coens spooneddoses of their trademark guileless humor on The Hudsucker Proxy(1994, 58 percent), a period office comedy-cum-Christmas tale.Jennifer Jason-Leigh is pitch perfect in her role as post-warcareer woman (\"Do you think this suit looks mannish?\") againstTim Robbins‘shapless dreamer (\"You know — for kids!\"). Visionary in many ways, this filmdeserves a better reputation than it’s garnered in its odd little sleeper life.1996’s Fargo (93 percent) isthe Coens’ most successful film to date, with seven Oscar nominations and two wins:Best Actress (Frances McDormand) and Best Original Screenplay. Fargo details aransom kidnap scheme gone wrong, with very pregnant cop McDormand investigatingthe crime as the bumbling perpetrators attempt to cover their tracks. The Coens’bleak humor and taste for blood and violence never mixed as well as it did inMinnesota.Though many of theCoens’ films can be labeled cult classics, perhaps none embody the term moreso than The Big Lebowski(1998, 74 percent).Jeff Bridgesstars as pot smoking slacker hero Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski, who seeks restitution for his rug, urinated on by a pair of gangsters whomistook him for a different Lebowski — namely, the “big” one (played by Charles Durning). Along with his bowling buddies, The Dudeembarks on a wild chase that’s as funny, depraved, and plain unpredictable asLos Angeles always feels like it should be.With O Brother, Where Art Thou?(2000, 79 percent), the Coen brothers tooktheir thriller tropes (ill-fated criminal plans, ironic stereotypes, and a detachedtone) and magically applied it towards an Odyssey-inspired farce. StarringGeorge Clooney as the beleaguered but resourceful Odysseus,O Brother is asepia-toned fantasia of throwaway jokes, slapstick, and killer bluegrass. Infact, the music proved popular enough to spawn a virtual cottage industry withmultiple soundtracks, a documentary, and even a national tour.Though the brothers have flirted with the shadowy realms offilm noir, 2001’s The Man Who Wasn’t There(79 percent) is the closest they come to making aheadlong plunge into the genre.Billy Bob Thornton stars as a classic fall guy,and playing the character as a deeply emotionally repressed square, Thornton isat his most controlled, wringing pathos out of an increasingly dire scenario.Featuring sharp, evocative black and white cinematography and an excellentsupporting cast, The Man Who Wasn’t There is an existential nightmarereplete with odd touches and arguably the brothers’ most emotionally painedwork.Demonstrating that their penchant for screwball comedy was not limited to marginal environments or period-piece conceits, the Coens set Intolerable Cruelty (2003, 75 percent) in no less a setting than modern day Beverly Hills. True to the genre, starsCatherine Zeta-Jones andGeorge Clooneyare a suing wife and a wealthy divorce lawyer. Untrue to the genre, the stars gotogether like a rug and a chair.The Ladykillers(2004, 55 percent), a remake ofAlexanderMackendrick‘s 1955 crime comedy, relocatesthe film’s original London heist to the Deep South, and swaps the British war widowfor the equally archetypal black matriarch. Though The Ladykillers lacks the toothy bite of its macabre predecessor, it garneredsome noteworthy festival awards for long-time Coens cinematographerRoger Deakins and thematriarch herself,Irma P. Hall.Whether you enjoyed their more recent forays into comedy or not, one thing’s for certain; with the ultra violent No Country for Old Men, Joel and Ethan Coen mark a return to their darkly comic, sinister roots that made them cult favorites in the first place. Consider it a dip into the Western genre: the story of a hunter and an assassin facing off over a bag of stolen cash, set against the backdrop of the parched Texas plains. With plenty of firepower to spare, No Country not only revives that clever Coen knack for finding humor in the morbid, but it may just be the closest they’ll get to making an all-out action film — and one with valid awards season prospects, to boot. And that, we say, was well worth the wait.Authors: Alex Vo, Sara Schieron, Timothy Mead Ryan, Nicholas Hershey, Jen Yamato","section":"Total Recall","tags":"Martial, Christmas, demand, festivals","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Welcome-to-Coen-Brothers-Country"},{"id":"47508997744319","title":"Total Recall: Thank Goodness For Hit Men","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: Thank Goodness For Hit MenThis Thanksgiving Day, take a moment to think about all those underappreciated assassins, just like the pilgrims used to.by RT Staff | November 23, 2007 |  CommentsIt’s Black Friday. If you’re not at home (and takingprecious family time to read RT, for which we thank you), then you’re at themall picking up bargains whilst navigating this week’s deluge of wide releases.Among them is Hitman, the tale of a skilled contract killer who findshimself in the midst of deadly political intrigue, and we figure it would be agood time to explore the dark, disreputable cinematic world of the gun-for-hire.For vicarious thrills, it’s hard to top movies about contract killers. There’ssomething fascinating about watching characters that operate in shadowyterritory, following their own unyielding codes of ethics, getting into and outof danger on the strength of their wits. Movies about hitmen swim in moralambiguity, asking audiences to identify with, or even root for, people who arein the business of killing. Cinemagoers have long had obsessions with contractkillers — even if they were one-dimensional characters, so long as they lookedcool (Boba Fett, anyone?). But in the past decades, they’ve been flying out ofthe margins in a big way, discovering some personality and taking on lives of their own.After cutting his teeth on drama and action flicks like The BigBlue (67 percent on the Tomatometer) and La Femme Nikita(82 percent), directorLuc Besson hithis groove with 1994’s Léon (aka TheProfessional, 72 percent).Jean Reno starsas the titular character, a withdrawn hitman saddled with an orphaned 12-year-old (NataliePortman) after her family is slaughtered by a corrupt cop (GaryOldman). The cast and crew were firing on all cylinders with this one: Reno’sbefuddled French guy and Portman’s tomboy pixie acts are endearing; Oldman makes even something as mundane as taking a pill amusingly bombastic; andBesson’s trademark action scenes never felt as casually cool as they did here,especially Léon’s climatic fight defending his apartment.“Luc Besson’s lone-hitman thriller sees a 12 year-oldNatalie Portman push the boundaries of love and pedophilia,” writes Shannon J.Harvey of Australia’s Sunday Times, “[It’s] as emotionally complex as itis a slick action thrill-ride.”1994 proved to be a banner year for hitmen public relations. Not only didLéon strive to show a killer in a sympathetic light, butQuentinTarantino also fine-tuned their image in Pulp Fiction (96percent), presenting hitmen not as just mere antagonists who showed up, didtheir dirty work, and then disappeared. Pulp Fiction‘s killers (SamuelL. Jackson andJohn Travolta)were out-and-out bad dudes, but Tarantino also delved into their lives beforeand after murder gigs, creating a portrait of two otherwise regular guys whosuffered mid-career crises and engaged in trite conversations.The Léon trailer.Most cinematic hitmen operate with an air of detached routine. Few are guided byan ancient code of conduct. The titular hero in 1999’s Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (80 percent) is a singularcharacter in the hitman movie pantheon: contract killer, student of samuraicodes, ornithology enthusiast.Jim Jarmusch‘smoody, darkly funny film follows Ghost Dog (ForestWhittaker), who carries out contract killings for a local mobster who savedhis life years before, operating in almost total anonymity (they communicate viahoming pigeon). When one of Ghost Dog’s assignments goes awry, the mob decideshe needs to be rubbed out.Ghost Dog expertly borrows the moody ambience ofJean-Pierre Melville‘s Le Samourai (100percent) and the dark absurdity ofSeijun Suzuki‘sBranded to Kill(100 percent), and features a hypnotic score from the Wu Tang Clan’sRZA. It’s a verystrange movie, one that combines genre thrills with Jarmusch’s trademarkquirkiness. Whittaker is on top of his game, playing a character who’s either astern, ritualistic loner or a man who’s deeply, deeply troubled; the performanceis so pitch-perfect that it could be read either way. “Ghost Dog is animpeccably shot and sensationally scored deadpan parody of two current popularmodes — the hit-man glorification saga and the Cosa Nostra family drama,” wroteJ. Hoberman from the Village Voice.Ghost Dog: Freakin’ ninja moves.Pierce Brosnanhad only recently left his role as the unflappable 007 when he starred asJulian, the gun-shy assassin in 2005’s The Matador(75 percent). Beleaguered and struggling with a quasi-existential crisis, onecan’t help thinking that Julian’s professional impotence owes something to histenure at the MI6. But this high-level assassin looks more like a travelingsalesman than an International Man of Mystery: working from a suitcase, keepingno ties, and finding his happiness in either bottles or brothels. When he meetsunlucky nice guy Danny (GregKinnear), Julian is confronted with all the experiences he might have had ifhe only treated life as something that couldn’t be traded for a briefcase fullof bills.Sure it could have gone tacky and cliché — hit man finds his conscience — butinstead Brosnan’s psychology is as illusive as a hitman after a mark. Meanwhile,Kinear’s Danny practices his own brand of character assassination by spreadingthe word of his encounter with Julian to all his cocktail hour consorts.Unmoored in the seas of international intrigue and middle management, Julian andDanny alternate between clinging to each other and fleeing from each other.While a tad befuddling, The Matador makes for good cocktail conversation.“After you see this delightful black comedy about a hit man gone to seed, you’llnever again pigeonhole Brosnan as a tuxedo-clad sophisticate with nerves ofsteel,” wrote Jack Garner of the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.The Matador: Struttin’.If you can’t get enough of cinematic assassins, lock and load your Netflix queuewith Point of No Return (45 percent), Grosse PointBlank (76 percent), and The Memory of aKiller (83 percent).Authors: Alex Vo, Tim Ryan, Sara Schieron","section":"Total Recall","tags":"motion, Mystery, FXX, Binge, Out, Black, MSNBC, fast","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-Thank-Goodness-For-Hit-Men"},{"id":"47508998829770","title":"Total Recall: 3:10 to Yuma And The Dark Side of the Frontier","content":"Total Recallvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Total Recall: 3:10 to Yuma And The Dark Side of the FrontierHow the west was unfun: Duck, You Sucker, The Wild Bunch, and McCabe &amp; Mrs. Millerby Tim Ryan | September 5, 2007 |  CommentsThis week, 3:10 to Yuma hits theaters, telling the story of a cash-strapped rancher (Christian Bale) who volunteers to help escort a train robber (Russell Crowe) to federal court; what follows is a battle of wits in which the normal bounds of good and evil fall by the wayside. Thus, Yuma joins a long line of Westerns that explore the complexities of human nature against the unforgiving backdrop of the frontier.In the mid-1960s, filmmakers began to move away from the black-and-white morality of earlier Westerns in order to explore some of the darker aspects of the frontier. That’s not to say that earlier films didn’t delve into the complexities inherent in the form; High Noon (95 percent on the Tomatometer), from 1952, presented a skeptical view of the nature of heroism, and John Ford‘s 1964 drama Cheyenne Autumn (63 percent) took a more sympathetic view of the plight of Native Americans than did his previous works. But it wasn’t until later in the decade that Westerns began to depict the frontier in a more complex, ominous light: as a place of dirty living conditions, changing political and economic climates, and the razor-thin line between lawlessness and order.One of the primary forces in the shift from the traditional Western was Sergio Leone, who created the template for what would become known as the Spaghetti Western. His revisionist oaters, shot in the deserts of Spain, featured iconic, antiheroic gunslingers and almost comic violence that shook up the staid conventions of Hollywood Westerns. Starring Clint Eastwood, Leone’s “Man With No Name” trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars [94 percent], For a Few Dollars More [91 percent] and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly [100 percent]), as well as Once Upon a Time in the West (97 percent) with Charles Bronson are all classics of the genre. Lesser-known but also startlingly memorable is Duck, You Sucker (aka A Fistful of Dynamite, 81 percent), an epic meditation on revolution, class warfare, and explosives. Set during the Mexican Revolution, it tells the story of Juan (Rod Steiger) is a bandit who comes across Sean (James Coburn), an explosives expert and Irish revolutionary. After some setbacks, Juan and Sean team up to raid a bank, and Juan becomes a reluctant hero of the revolution when it turns out the bank is filled not with money but with political prisoners.Duck, You Sucker remains one of Leone’s least-seen films, but it’s got a number of the same elements that make Leone’s westerns so memorable: breathtaking vistas, explosive battle sequences, a haunting Ennio Morricone score, and oodles of moral ambiguity.Coburn doesn’t match Eastwood’s iconic, tight-lipped gunslinger, but he makes up for it with crotchety humor and an air of morality; he’s committed to a cause, but disillusioned with the revolutionary life. And Steiger’s Juan evolves from a selfish thief to a man who realizes his unique place in the midst of historical events. “The combination of Leone’s obsessive close-ups, Ennio Morricone’s melodious music, and the comradely chemistry of Coburn and Steiger ignite an emotional explosion comparable to that of Once Upon a Time in the West,” wrote Andrew Sarris in the New York Observer.As the west was tamed, the tolerance for gungsliners and bandits — once lauded as antiheroes — evaporated. Sam Peckinpah‘s The Wild Bunch is about a tight group of such undesirables, who realize their time is running short, and decide to go out guns-blazing. The aging outlaws that comprise the Bunch — which include Pike (William Holden) and Dutch (Ernest Borgnine) — mastermind a series of robberies in the dusty outreaches of rural Texas; their philosophy is encapsulated in the film’s most famous line: “If they move, kill ’em.” In between heists, the outlaws do their share of carousing, but there’s a sadness underlying even the movie’s most carefree scenes, a sense that these men share a bond, but that their specific brand of loyalty is quickly becoming outdated. Hot on their trail is Thornton (Robert Ryan), a former member of the gang who now leads a group of mercenaries to capture the Bunch, and is deeply conflicted about his new role.However, don’t be fooled into thinking The Wild Bunch is in any way a slog through the last days of the west. The movie has many moments of melancholy, but it also contains at least three battle scenes with a level of ultra-violence — and sheer awesomeness — that few have come close to matching (although many directors have tried; John Woo and Martin Scorsese have both cited The Wild Bunch as an influence. “The on-screen carnage established a new level in American movies, but few of the films that followed in its wake could duplicate Peckinpah’s depth of feeling,” wrote Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader.The end of the old west is one of the prominent undercurrents in Robert Altman‘s masterful McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller (91 percent). McCabe (Warren Beatty) arrives in the grim Northwest town of Presbyterian Church with the intention of establishing a saloon and a whorehouse. It isn’t until the British madam Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) shows up that his plan starts to take shape: She supervises the construction of the building and oversees the girls. The pair forms an uneasy-but-affectionate personal and professional partnership that contributes to the growth of the town. But powerful mining interests get wind of the business’ success, and offer to buy McCabe out; drunk with success, he insults them, with catastrophic results.Like the HBO series Deadwood (which owes an obvious debt to McCabe), one of the underlying themes of the film is how the freewheeling, pioneering spirit of the frontier was tamed by economic — and often uncivil — means. But that only goes so far in describing the poetry of this masterful film. You’d be hard-pressed to find a movie more evocatively, forbiddingly atmospheric than McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller. The harsh environs of the snowy Northwest are so vivid you can practically feel a chill from the screen. In addition, the sepia-like cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond and the elegiac songs of Leonard Cohen create a forlorn, bleak feeling of a time and place that will soon be relegated to history. “Robert Altman has made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another,” wrote Roger Ebert. “But one of them is perfect, and that one is McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller.”The Western has gone through a number of cycles, and though it’s fallen out of favor in more recent times, there are always a few oaters, like Unforgiven (96 percent), Open Range (78 percent), or The Proposition (86 percent) that explore the landscape of human complexity — usually with a shotgun in hand.","section":"Total Recall","tags":"awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Total-Recall-310-to-Yuma-And-The-Dark-Side-of-the-Frontier"},{"id":"47509000020685","title":"In the Heights Stars: “This Is for the F—king Culture”","content":"Video Interviewsvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})In the Heights Stars: “This Is for the F—king Culture”Director Jon M.
