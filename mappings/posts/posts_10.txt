Pictures)When Warner Brothers pushed the release date for Mortal Kombat back an extra week to give some room to its other pandemic water-tester, Godzilla vs. Kong, few people anticipated they were going to have their own one-on-one match for the top of the box office this weekend. All eyes were on the tournament of Outworld (that turned out to not even have a tournament), while Sony’s acquired Funimation line was about to sneak in and nearly knock-out the video game adaptation.King of the Crop: Mortal Kombat “Finishes” Demon Slayer, But What A Fight!Mortal Kombat and highly anticipated anime Demon Slayer – Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train fought for top spot this weekend, and they also duked it out for the claim of Second Best Opening since the pandemic – both opened ahead of Wonder Woman 1984’s $16.7 million Christmas weekend opening, but trailed Godzilla vs. Kong’s $31.6 million start. It was Mortal Kombat that would take both honors, with a $22.5 million haul, compared to Demon Slayer‘s $19.5 million.The 1995 Mortal Kombat&nbsp;film opened to $23.2 million on an August weekend just before kids started going back to school and finished with just over $70 million. Given the recent diminishing returns on the hybrid HBO Max titles, it appears unlikely the 2021 version will reach that total. But even a low-ball figure between $55 and $60 million is further ahead than where Wonder Woman 1984 and Tom &amp; Jerry ultimately settled. A good sign, but perhaps not quite the evidence we were looking for that theatrical is making a significant comeback.Demon Slayer, on the other hand, is a triumph for Funimation. Its last theatrical release, Dragon Ball Super: Broly, opened to $9.8 million in January 2019 and went on to gross $30.7 million. Demon Slayer’s $3.8 million from Thursday night previews is also in line with pre-pandemic Thursday night totals for films such as Ready Player One (which grossed the same), and is actually stronger even such titles as Mad Max: Fury Road ($3.7 million) and the original Iron Man ($3.5 million).The $100 Million Watch: Godzilla vs. Kong Is Coming for the Milestone(Photo by © Warner Bros., Legendary Pictures)The industry has been watching closely to see if Godzilla vs. Kong is going to be the first film during the pandemic to reach the one-time lauded milestone of $100 million. After 10 days of release it had grossed $60 million; the last film we saw do that was Disney’s Onward last March. By day 19 it had reached $80 million; the last film to do that was Sonic the Hedgehog last February, which actually did that in its first week, but who’s counting? GvK coming in with $4 million in its fourth weekend is closely aligned with the fourth weekend go-round for Tom &amp; Jerry ($3.8 million) and Raya and the Last Dragon ($3.76 million). Since that time, both of those films have made around an additional $10-11 million each. Godzilla vs. Kong currently sits at $86.5 million. Tom &amp; Jerry has made a little over $6 million since it was taken off of HBO MAX on its 31st day. There are only five more days to catch GvK at home: After that, will it hold on long enough to cross the $100 million barrier? It is certainly going to be close and we’ll monitor it right here.On These Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)April 24: In 2011, the Easter hit, Hop, grossed $2.73 million on this, its 24th day of release to cross the $100 million mark.April 25: An even greater family-movie milestone was hit on this day in 2014 when Disney’s Frozen grossed $42,742 to pass $400 million at the domestic box office. It was its 155th day of release. The sequel crossed that same milestone in just 35 days in 2019.What Should Have Been: A Different Day for Wright’s Last NightInitially scheduled for September 25 last year, Edgar Wright’s Last Night In Soho was moved to this weekend; unfortunately, it was subsequently moved again to October 22 of this year. We were also expecting Martin Campbell’s The Asset, with Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson, but that film was pushed off the schedule at the end of March and is still awaiting a new release date.On The Vine: Horror, Prestige, and An Old Friend(Photo by © Universal)April wraps up with a little horror, namely the ghost story, Separation, starring Rupert Friend and Brian Cox.

KongThe box office is seeing signs of life, but the big test will come next week when the two titans – already earning over $100 million overseas – step in to (maybe) save the day.by Erik Childress | March 28, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Allen Fraser/©Universal Pictures)Los Angeles theaters have been opening back up. More chains are opening up in April. Black Widow’s move may have delayed the summer season back to pre-1996 scheduling, but with vaccine availability being accelerated in many states, we continue to tiptoe back towards normalcy. Yet even in these stranger times, we must look for a silver lining. One such lining: the second-biggest theatrical launch of 2021 occurred this weekend. It stars Bob Odenkirk and it opened at number 1. Let’s take a moment to appreciate that.King of the Crop: Bob Odenkirk – Action Star and Box Office DrawCritics are certainly showing their appreciation for action flick Nobody, lifting the movie to a Certified Fresh Tomatometer score of 80%. That’s an improvement over Ilya Naishuller’s debut film, Hardcore Henry (52%) from 2015. Nobody also bested that film’s opening ($5.1 million in 3,015 theaters) with an estimated $6.7 million in 2,460 theaters with limited capacity. (Tom &amp; Jerry opened in 2,475 theaters.) That’s the third-best opening of the year to date behind only the family entries of T&amp;J and Raya and the Last Dragon. Is this the first good sign that adults (hopefully of the vaccinated variety) are headed back into theaters? The Little Things opened to $4.7 million on the last weekend in January , while also available on HBO Max. Last summer’s attempt to reopen with Russell Crowe in Unhinged netted a $4 million wide release (1,823 theaters); the movie then slowly made its way to $20 million. It’s going to be interesting to chart the progression of Nobody as new wide releases enter the marketplace almost every week going forward.The Top Ten And Beyond: Raya Holds On As The Courier Expands(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)After three weeks at number 1, Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon dropped to second place, falling 32% to $3.5 million for a total of $28.4 million to date. The year’s top grosser fell to third place, as Tom &amp; Jerry took in another $2.5 million for a total of $37.1 million. That makes it the 11th-highest-grossing film since the beginning of 2020 and the fourth-highest since the pandemic behind only Tenet, The Croods: A New Age, and Wonder Woman 1984; the latter two are still in the top 10 with The Croods sequel still creeping up on Tenet’s total.After four weeks, the long-delayed Chaos Walking has crept over the $11 million mark after opening to $3.77 million. That’s a feat unattained by fellow wide March releases that opened between $3.5-4 million: Slither, Missing In Action II: The Beginning, Boat Trip, Unsane, 3 Strikes, Amos &amp; Andrew, and Pride.The Benedict Cumberbatch spy thriller, The Courier, added 208 theaters and fell 48% but still grossed another $1.04 million for a total of $3.48 million. That makes it the 32nd highest-grossing release in Roadside Attractions’ history, which – all things considered – is not too shabby. Especially when it will take less than just another million for it to join the company’s top 25.These Dates In Box Office History: Milestones for Logan, Rango, Horton Hears A Who!(Photo by © 20th Century Fox Film Corp. )March 26: Back in 2011, Gore Verbinski’s Oscar-winning Rango grossed $4.39 million on its 23rd day of release to pass the $100 million mark. Two years earlier, Zack Snyder’s Watchmen passed the same milestone in just 21 days after grossing $556,443. (Rango would outgross Watchmen by over $15 million.) Eight years after Watchmen, another comic book-based film, Logan, would pass the $200 million line in only 23 days with $4.39 million. (It would gross just $24 million and change over its next 88 days.) Finally, on this day on 1998, James Cameron’s Titanic grossed $1.43 million on its 98th day of release to pass the $500 million mark.March 27: One day after Rango crossed the $100 million link in 2011, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston did it with their film, Just Go With It. The film grossed $350,105 on its 45th day to achieve the milestone. At the time it was Sandler’s 10th $100 million grosser; his 11th would come two years later with Grown Ups 2.March 28: Then for the quickest milestone grab of the lot on these three days, Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who! grossed $5.25 million to cross $100 million on just its 15th day of release. It would go on to gross over $154 million. Four years later it would only take Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax nine days to cross $100 million and go on to gross over $214 million.What Should Have Been: Boss Baby Pushes Back Due DateThis weekend was supposed to see the release of The Boss Baby: Family Business but the animated sequel has been delayed to September 17 where it will now open against two more sequels including Kenneth Branagh’s Death on the Nile (okay, a quasi sequel!) and the recently moved Venom: Let There Be Carnage.On the Vine: Godzilla, Kong, and Moviegoing’s Biggest Test YetIn this corner a giant prehistoric creature birthed by nuclear testing in 1954 who goes by the name of GODZILLA! In that corner, direct from Skull Island, he has survived (in spirit) the likes of Dino de Laurentiis, Peter Jackson and Samuel L. Jackson, the eighth wonder of the world, you know him as the King, it’s KONG! That’s right, on Wednesday this week, Adam Wingard’s Godzilla vs. Kong will also fight amongst audiences in theaters as well as those taking advantage of its appearance on HBO MAX the sane day. Warner Bros. moved up its release from May and this will be the next big test to see the public’s comfort level on returning to theaters and will be closely watched by everyone in the industry. The film has managed to already gross over $70 million in China and over $100 million overseas in total. Also, Screen Gems will be testing the levels on a smaller scale with the horror film, The Unholy, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan – it is about a girl who may be channeling the Virgin Mary or something far more evil.Full List of Box Office Results: March 26-28, 2021 84% Nobody (2021)$6.7 million ($6.7 million total) 95% Raya and the Last Dragon (2021)$3.5 million ($28.4 million total) 31% Tom &amp; Jerry (2020)$2.5 million (37.1 million total) 22% Chaos Walking (2021)$1.18 million ($11.4 million total) 86% The Courier (2020)$1.04 million ($3.48 million total) 76% The Croods: A New Age (2020)$540,000 ($55.9 million total) 37% The Marksman (2021)$375,000 ($14.8 million total) 42% Boogie (2021)$340,000 ($3.8 million total) 98% Minari (2020)$275,000 ($1.8 million total) 60% Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)$245,000 ($45.8 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on&nbsp;WGN Radio&nbsp;with Nick Digilio as well as on&nbsp;Business First AM&nbsp;with Angela Miles and his&nbsp;Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via&nbsp;Box Office Mojo]On an Apple device?

Check out the box office numbers for April 9-11, 2021.by Erik Childress | April 11, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)The people-may-be-comfortable-going-back-to-theaters narrative that erupted last week may have been a bit premature. Or we’re just seeing a word-of-mouth reaction to a frontloaded film over a holiday weekend. It’s hard to tell these days. Godzilla vs. Kong was not exactly facing major competition and won the weekend handily with $13.3 million. But it is those mid-range films that will begin to tell us just how spread out attendance is going to be, and with films like The Unholy and Voyagers filling those voids, we are still just dipping our toes into what the theatrical comeback is going to look like.Recommended: Weekend Box Office Results: Godzilla vs. Kong’s $48.5 Million Five-Day Haul Is a Rock-’Em Sock-’Em Sign Of HopeRecommended: Godzilla vs. Kong By the Numbers: Who’s the True King – According to the Data?King of the Crop: Can Godzilla vs. Kong Reach $100 Million in the U.S.?(Photo by Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)The immediate good news on Godzilla vs. Kong is that it has easily become the highest-grossing film since the pandemic began last March, passing Christopher Nolan’s Tenet. That much was inevitable after grossing over $48 million in its first five days of release. The next milestone it hopes to reach – other than surpassing Godzilla, King of the Monsters’ worldwide gross of $386 million (it currently stands at $357 million) is that of the once-fabled $100 million domestic plateau. The baby steps to the milestone after that will come much quicker for the next blockbuster, but does this film at this time have a real shot? So, let’s examine.Holding a film now to the standards of the great normal is not ideal, but we can try to make it correlate as best we can to current times. Godzilla vs. Kong dropped 58 percent in its second weekend. The higher the start, the higher the drop in these times. Wonder Woman 1984 dropped 67.1 percent in December after a $16.7 million start. More theaters plus vaccinations puts GvK with a 92.8 percent increase in its three-day weekend and a drop 9.1 percent better. That is fair progress. Now in the history of March releases that had grossed between $64 million–$75 million in their first 12 days, only two of the nine (2017’s Power Rangers and 10,000 B.C.) failed to reach $100 million, except even those films grossed $14.2 million and $16.7 million in their second weekend (and were the only two of the lot to not gross at least $20 million). Godzilla vs. Kong grossed $13.3 million. With theaters still at limited capacity.Now, GvK has a slight edge on those films gross-wise to date with $69 million estimated through Sunday. And currently we are seeing much smaller drops in third weekends amongst the pandemic films. Raya and the Last Dragon dropped just 10.2 percent and The Little Things fell only 2.6 percent. Even Chaos Walking fell just 14.5 percent. One thing they all have in common is the ability to last in a marketplace with lesser competing options for the public to experience in theaters. Raya had made $17.17 million in its first 12 days and has more than doubled that total since. The Marksman with Liam Neeson had only grossed $6.35 million in 12 days and has managed to scrounge out over $15 million. GvK will still have another weekend at No. 1 and will fall back with Mortal Kombat the week after, at which time it should settle into second place for another three weeks until Spiral comes out, and there is no reason to believe it will not still be in the top five come Memorial Day weekend. That’s a long road ahead, but it is still very possible that $100 million could be there at the end of it.The Top 10 and Beyond: Voyagers Lands with a Thud(Photo by Lionsgate)The only big theatrical contender this week was Lionsgate’s Lord of the Flies in space, aka Voyagers, which was not liked by critics (with a 27% Tomatometer score) or cared about by audiences this weekend grossing a paltry $1.3 million. Sure, it is only the 12th film of 2021 to open with more than a million, but it could not even crack the top 10 on that small list. Even the long-delayed Chaos Walking managed to open to $3.77 million, one of only seven movies this year so far to gross over $10 million.Beyond that, it was a week of small drops. Nobody retained its second-place spot falling just 12 percent to $2.65 million. It has now crossed the $15 million line. Last week’s No. 2, The Unholy, fell to third with only a 23 percent drop. It’s total now stands at $6.7 million. Tom &amp; Jerry dropped only 17 percent and has run its total to over $41 million. Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon actually increased business this week, going up 2 percent and grossing $2.1 million for a total of $35 million.These Dates In Box Office History:&nbsp;Vin Diesel’s The Fast and the Furious Franchise Revved Up Audiences for the Summer Blockbuster SeasonApril 9: On this day in 2017, the Jennifer Lawrence/Chris Pratt sci-fi film, Passengers, grossed $5,876. That was enough to push it over the $100 million mark on its 110th day of release. (What an anniversary for Voyagers to be opening on with its unwanted advances in space premise.)April 10: This is a big date for films crossing the $100 million line. In 1999, Dreamworks’ animated The Prince of Egypt made $151,406 to get there on day 114 of its release. Steven Spielberg got their faster in the director’s chair in 2018 when Ready Player One grossed $2.34 million to reach the mark in just 13 days. Though eight years earlier in 2010, the remake of Clash of the Titans took in $11.04 million to reach the milestone in just nine days. Much faster than Vin Diesel’s family film, The Pacifier, did in 2005 when it grossed $739,633 on its 38th day. Diesel got there a lot quicker – and doubled it – 10 years later when Furious 7 made $18.86 million in its eighth day to cross the $200 million line.April 11: Turns out these are big dates for one Vin Diesel as Fast and Furious is his third film on the list this week. His return to the franchise made $10.43 million in its ninth day to cross $100 million. Three years later on this date, Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax grossed $795,795 to pass $200 million on its 41st day of release. That is a milestone that Fast and Furious would not reach.On the Vine: Fresh Festival Films&nbsp;Take a Shot at Box Office GloryFresh from its debut at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, Ben Wheatley’s latest horror film, In The Earth,&nbsp;moves up two weeks to April 16. The Neon film currently has a 77% Tomatometer score. If horror is on your mind also be on the lookout for Barbara Crampton taking the lead on Travis Stevens’ Jakob’s Wife.

The numbers are certainly on the rise with the tentpole flick finally released, but do they indicate a genuine resurgence in theater-going? Let’s dig in.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Tenet&nbsp;Brings Some Moviegoers Back, But How Far Can it Go?(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon / © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection)From the weekend of March 20 up until the weekend of August 14, no film was able to crack the $1 million mark to top the box office. Up until some releases from August 14 on, the big winners of the summer were horror releases from IFC Midnight:&nbsp;The Wretched ($1.81 million total),&nbsp;The Rental ($1.56 million), and Relic ($1.04 million); the studio had only had seven films gross over a million dollars between 2017 and 2019. Beyond that, retro releases like Jurassic Park ($1,386,600), The Empire Strikes Back ($1,015,000), The Goonies ($825,000), Jaws ($758,300), and Ghostbusters ($605,000) were the big winners.On August 14, Paramount released their once-planned May release of The Spongebob Movie: Sponge on the Run, but only in Canada where it has grossed over $3.4 million to date. A week later Solstice Studios laid claim to the first wide release since March 13 when it unleashed Unhinged into theaters, earning $4 million in 1,823 theaters for a $2,194 per-theater-average. The week after, it was finally time for The New Mutants, which grossed $7.03 million in 2,412 theaters for a $2,917 per-theater-average. This weekend it was Tenet’s turn.(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon / © Warner Bros. / Courtesy Everett Collection)Evaluating just how these recent releases have been doing with many theaters still not operating and responsible social distancing limiting the amount of patrons in any auditorium may be a fool’s game. But numbers can be read through history and, until further trends reveal themselves, the way we have been looking at them is through an estimation of how they may have done in a normal year. That led to the evaluation that the current box office leaders have been doing somewhere around 2.5-to-3-times less than they may have the previous year. Looking ahead to Tenet this weekend, we looked back at Nolan’s most recent non-Batman/non-DiCaprio offerings and saw that Interstellar opened to $47.5 million (in November 2014) and Dunkirk started with $50.5 million (in July of 2017). So somewhere in the high teens, up to around $20 million, felt like a confident bet with&nbsp;realistic expectations heading into the weekend. And that is where the movie landed, with an estimated $20.2 million over the four-day holiday weekend, as well as from scattered advance screenings going back to Monday.Labeling this as either “good” or “disappointing” is still premature. After all, Tenet pretty much has theaters all to itself through the month of September until Warner Bros. challenges itself directly with Wonder Woman 1984 on October 2. One&nbsp;thing that does seem to be true is that – whatever the size of the audience may be – word-of-mouth appears to continue to remain a factor in these films’ staying power. Unhinged has fallen into a similar pattern as other adult-themed late-August releases such as 2002’s Undisputed ($4.54 million opening / $12.76 million total), 2012’s Hit &amp; Run ($4.52 million / $13.74 million), and 2013’s vehicular thriller Getaway ($4.5 million / $10.5 million). Unhinged’s estimated $1.67 million this weekend brings its total to $11.3 million after 17 days.The New Mutants, on other hand, dropped 59% from its $7 million start, bringing its 10-day total to $11.6 million ($12.2 million with the holiday). That may be more than August 2018’s mutant-esque Fox offering, The Darkest Minds, had at this point ($10.98 million after a $5.84 million start), but let’s also look back at six August releases from 2011-16 that opened between $6.5-$7.5 million for some further comparison:&nbsp;Mechanic: Resurrection, You’re Next, Our Idiot Brother, Jobs, Ricki and the Flash, and Florence Foster Jenkins&nbsp;had each earned&nbsp;between $12 million and&nbsp;$14.64 million after 10 days. In August 2017, another long-delayed and ultimately critically-reviled adaptation, The Dark Tower, opened to $19.1 million, dropped 59.2% in its second weekend, and had $34.2 million after 10 days. Divide that by three and you have $11.4 million, just shy of The New Mutants’ current total. That suggests Mutants could be headed for a final theatrical tally between $16.9 million and $20.3 million. It’s a single example, but maybe there is something to the rule of three in measuring current box office totals.So where does that leave Tenet? Dunkirk and Interstellar finished with near-identical grosses of $188,045,546 and $188,020,017, and no one is expecting those kind of heights.&nbsp;With theaters more widely opened&nbsp;overseas than in the U.S., Tenet has grossed over $150 million worldwide so far. Using our crude formula,&nbsp;Tenet would have grossed somewhere between $50.5 million and $60.6 million in a normal time, which would have made it just the fourth film to open higher than $50 million in the month of September, a feat achieved just the past three years with the It films and 2018’s The Nun. Living directly with the numbers we have now, only one film this century has gone on to gross over $100 million when starting with less than $21 million, and that was 20 years ago with Remember the Titans. The rest of the historical September releases that opened&nbsp;between $19 million and $21 million have an&nbsp;average final gross of $62 million. It will be interesting to see&nbsp;whether Tenet&nbsp;will face smaller week-on-week drops&nbsp;given the lack of competition, or whether the numbers&nbsp;will drop off as might normally be expected, especially&nbsp;given that Tenet is also the second-lowest rated Nolan film on the Tomatometer at 74%. (Interstellar stands at 72%.)On This Weekend’s Dates&nbsp;In Box Office History…(Photo by © Warner Bros. )With so little action in our current-day box office, we’re casting our eyes back this week.September 4:&nbsp;In a bit of symmetry, Christopher Nolan’s Inception crossed $275 million with $1.69 million on its 51st&nbsp;day of release 10 years ago.September 5:&nbsp;In 2016, Suicide Squad grossed $2.77 million on its 32nd&nbsp;day of release to cross $300 million. In 2011,&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made $928,509 on day 53 of its release. It took 74 days for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to make it to $400 million, which it did on this day in 2009 pulling in $303,311.September 6:&nbsp;Night Shyamalan’s Signs grossed $2.29 million to pass the $200 million mark on its 36th in 2002. That same day, Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition made $370,349 to get over the $100 million hump on its 57th&nbsp;day. It only took 24 days for Neill Blomkamp’s District 9 to do it with $2.74 million on this date in 2009. This has also been a good date for Universal sequels. In 2003, American Wedding made $984,145 to pass $100 million on its 37th&nbsp;day; then in 2008, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor made $707,455 to pass $100 million, also on its 37th day.&nbsp;Of course, that was nothing compared to Disney’s The Lion King redux making $991,156 to pass $525 million on its 50th&nbsp;day in theaters just last year.September 7:&nbsp;In 2012, another Universal sequel, The Bourne Legacy, grossed $1.13 million to cross $100 million on day 29 of its theatrical run. That was a lot faster than Adam Sandler’s You Don’t Mess with the Zohan, which finally crossed the $100 million mark with $27,114 on its 94th&nbsp;day of release in 2008.What Should Have Been This Weekend(Photo by © Paramount)At one time, this weekend&nbsp;belonged to A Quiet Place Part II, one of the first films moved out of its original opening slots back in March. It is now slated to open on April 23, 2021. The original Labor Day weekend slate – before any of the COVID-19 upheavals – was meant to include Paul W.S. Anderson’s Monster Hunter, with Milla Jovovich and Tony Jaa. Now it will open alongside John Krasinski’s sequel on the same date next year. Peter Jackson’s documentary, The Beatles: Get Back, about the band’s rooftop concert, will now open on August 27 of next year.On the Vine:&nbsp;Broken Hearts&nbsp;Heading to Theaters OnlyThe widest release in theaters next week will be the romantic comedy, The Broken Hearts Gallery, starring Geraldine Viswanathan, who you may know from from Blockers and Bad Education.

We're breaking down the box office numbers from April 2-4, 2021.by Erik Childress | April 4, 2021 |  Comments(Photo by Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)When Warner Bros. finally gave the go-ahead to put Tenet in theaters last Labor Day week, it took roughly six days to gross the reported “weekend” gross of $20.2 million. Though the numbers were fudged a bit, it is still just one of only three films since the beginning of the pandemic last March (Wonder Woman 1984 and Tom &amp; Jerry being the others) to open with $10 million or more. Theaters have been closed and more streaming options have been made available, and people have shied from large gatherings to keep safe from a deadly virus. All of that has kept the industry, especially theaters, on edge. But leave it to a giant lizard and a mega ape to provide some much-needed hope by propelling the top 10 films in theaters to the best gross ($43.68 million estimated) since the weekend of March 13-15, 2020 ($49.58 million) just as the national crisis began. Let them fight, indeed!Recommended: RT Users Crown Godzilla King of the Movie MonstersRecommended: Godzilla vs. Kong By the Numbers: Who’s the True King – According to the Data?King of the Crop: Godzilla vs. Kong Is the $48.5 Million Shot Of Hope We needed(Photo by Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures)$48 million. That’s a headline. That is more money than the combined total of the&nbsp; number 1 film at the box office for the last five weeks. It is around $6 million more than what every film has made for the last two weekends. Granted, that is a five-day total since Wednesday, but whether it is $48 million or $33.9 million (its three-day weekend haul), Godzilla vs. Kong has provided some life for theatrical prospects. Especially after besting Wonder Woman 1984’s entire domestic gross in just five days. Who would have guessed that three of the best four theatrical openings over the past year would be films also concurrently available on HBO Max for home subscribers? Warner Bros. has to be feeling particularly good about that, grabbing the best of both worlds after some serious criticism with the sudden move for their 2021 lineup to the dual-opening strategy back in December.Before everyone starts date-shaming the umpteenth-shifting No Time To Die for moving from this weekend, we’ll have to see how&nbsp;Godzilla vs. Kng holds over the next several weeks. Warner Bros. already pushed back Mortal Kombat a week to give GvK an additional week at number before that takes over. WB’s HBO Max titles are likely to be on top of the box office for six straight weeks. More theaters and chains are opening this month, which could reduce the weekly drops a little. While Wonder Woman 1984 dropped over 67% after Christmas weekend, the last three WB releases have fallen between 53.2% and 56.3% and done (to date) 2.50-3.17 times their opening grosses. The last film in the MonsterVerse series, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, had a 3-day opening of $47.7 million ($57.1 million in five days) and finished with just $110 million domestic and $386 million internationally. GvK is practically there with theaters at limited capacity and some chains still closed. The mere thought that we could even be talking about a $100 million picture again, let alone one that has already grossed $285 million worldwide, is a day many probably thought was much further down the road and provides real hope that we are on the road to recovery — if we can just hold out a bit more and continue to get vaccinated.Versus vs. Versus: Which Is the Highest-Earning and Freshest Movie Showdown?With all due respect to the 1963 King Kong vs. Godzilla, not to mention Earth vs. The Flying Saucers and Dollman vs. Demonic Toys, here are the top five-day openings for the Vs. genre.Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($193.22 million)Monsters Vs.

Last week’s number 1 film, Nobody, fell 55% to just $3.07 million. That’s a total of $11.8 million. It should have no problem surpassing The Little Things and The Marksman to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year. (Then again, only making $15 million is good enough to make you the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year!) Raya and the Last Dragon grossed another $2 million for a total of $32.1 million and Tom &amp; Jerry upped its total gross to $39.5 million. Screen Gems’ piece of Holy Weekend counter-programming, The Unholy, grossed $3.2 million in 1,850 theaters. The Rotten horror film is nearly matching the 33% Tomatometer score that the Ben Cross/Hal Holbrook film, The Unholy, from 1988 sits with.These Dates In Box Office History(Photo by Murray Close/©Lionsgate Courtesy Everett Collection)April 2: In 2012, The Hunger Games grossed $4.52 million to cross the $250 million mark in just its 11th day of release. It took Fox’s animated Robots 23 days just to hit $100 million when it made $4.36 million on this day in 2005.April 3: In 2014, Divergent grossed $1.48 million to crack $100 million in its 14th day of release. A year earlier, it was The Croods passing that milestone with $3.27 million on just its 13th day of release. Those franchises both seemed doomed to some extent as The Croods sequel got caught up in the shuffle of the pandemic and Divergent never even finished the second half of its third book with a fourth movie. (The Croods&nbsp;sequel would prove something of a phenomenon during the pandemic.) On the other hand, in 2004, one of the most honored films of all-time at the Oscars, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, grossed $375 million by taking in $165,106 in its 109th day of release. It only took four days for that film to reach $100 million. On an even more historic day in 1998, this was the date when Lost In Space opened and ended the 15-week run of Titanic at number 1.April 4: Though The Lord of the Rings series never reached the domestic milestone of $400 million, Disney’s live-action Beauty and the Beast did just that in 2017 by grossing $4.56 million on this, its 19th day of release. This date also showed that the Divergent series was not doomed just yet, as Insurgent managed to cross the $100 million mark on this day in 2015 by grossing $3.82 million. It took the sequel two additional days to reach the milestone compared with its predecessor.On the Vine: Teens In Space Vie For Your AttentionTy Sheridan, Lily-Rose Depp, and Fionn Whitehead are astronauts who may be going crazy in Neil Burger’s sci-fi film, Voyagers.

Plus, Tom &amp; Jerry and The Croods continue strong runs on the weekend of March 12-14, 2021.by Erik Childress | March 14, 2021 |  CommentsLast week New York City opened a number of its movie theaters. On Monday, Los Angeles is opening many of theirs. By May 1 we have been told that vaccines will be available to every adult in the country. July 4 – even with the recommendation of limited gatherings – is about to take on a whole new meaning. Could the sky be the limit for Top Gun: Maverick opening that week? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We still need to take this week by week. And this weekend we look to see if the top numbers tell us anything new….King of the Crop: Raya and the Last Dragon In It For the Long Haul(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Last week’s numbers for Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon seemed to put a red light on the progress some saw the week earlier with Tom &amp; Jerry. It would have been cheaper for any party of two (and some parties of one) to invest in HBO Max to see Tom &amp; Jerry&nbsp;at home than paying theater prices, and yet it still bested Raya by over 65% when you compare both films’ opening weekends. Nevertheless, Raya’s numbers in the context of screen count – relative to movies with similar screen counts released since 2010 – plus the obstacle of limited-capacity theaters, were not nearly as troublesome as some may have been quick to label them. How do this week’s numbers look?With only a little more than half of the nation’s theaters in play (most with only 25% capacity), Raya and the Last Dragon grossed an estimated $5.5 million. That is down 35% from last weekend with another 118 theaters added to its run. Right up front, that is tied for the ninth best weekend for any film during the pandemic and tied for third best second weekend for any film behind Tenet last September 11-13 ($6.7 million), Tom &amp; Jerry last weekend ($6.6 million), and estimated to be tied with Wonder Woman 1984. Raya may not catch up to Tom &amp; Jerry, being more than $7 million off its current pace. But it is only about $1.2 million off of where The Croods: A New Age was after 10 days, during the holiday season when COVID numbers were beginning to spike again.The Croods sequel has had the benefit of several holiday weekends and a lack of new releases. Despite it being available on home video now, the film is still fifth at the national box office inching its way towards Tenet‘s $57.9 million domestic haul. Raya may not get there but it certainly has another number 1 weekend coming before Nobody and Godzilla vs. Kong test the theater system. If The Croods: A New Age has managed to stay in the top five at the box office for 16 straight weeks, Raya and the Last Dragon is not going anywhere until at least the week before Memorial Day. The numbers are only going to get stronger and the trends in the rising percentages of vaccinations and theaters opening are only going to help them along. Week by week.We Have A New (Old) Number One: Avatar Reclaims All-Time Biggest Movie Throne from Endgame(Photo by ©20th Century Fox. All rights reserved courtesy Everett Collection)Hard to believe it was less than two years ago that we were watching Avengers: Endgame make its way towards becoming the highest-grossing film ever worldwide. Remember: It took a re-release to make that happen (and it still trails Star Wars: The Force Awakens domestically.) But it only took two days for James Cameron’s Avatar to reclaim its crown. The film was re-released in China this weekend and through Saturday had grossed $12.3 million, putting its global total at $2.802 billion. Cameron had congratulated the Russos when Endgame took the top spot in 2019 and it is easy to see that this could be a back-and-forth that just goes on forever as a new Marvel Phase begins to take hold, not to mention four more Avatar sequels on the way. One thing is for certain is that the title is no longer a studio point of pride since Disney bought Fox. It is now just competing with itself – and The Force Awakens is theirs too.On these Dates In Box Office History…(Photo by Andrew Cooper/©Paramount/courtesy Everett Collection)March 12: In 2010, Martin Scorsese’s Shutter Island grossed $2.4 million on its 22nd day to cross the $100 million line. It was just the third film in the director’s career to pass the milestone after 2004’s The Aviator and 2006’s The Departed. In 2013, The Wolf of Wall Street would become the fourth.March 13: Just one year ago, three new movies opened. It was the last time a film would open in over 2,000 theaters until The New Mutants did some 24 weeks later. See “This Time Last Year” below for more on this weekend in 2020.March 14: In 2013, Sam Raimi’s Oz the Great and Powerful grossed $5.1 million on this day to cross the $100 million mark in its seventh day. No doubt the film that inspired Oz to give this time frame a shot was Tim Burton’s Alice in Wonderland, which grossed $18.5 million on 10th day of release to cross $200 million.This Time Last Year: Onward Was Not Necessarily Able to Go UpwardOne year ago was the last semi-true box office weekend of the pre-pandemic era. Tom Hanks announced he was COVID-positive on March 10, the NBA shut down, and soon theaters were to follow. The weekend was won by Pixar’s Onward for the second straight week, but with a 72.9% drop from its opening, earning only $10.6 million. New openers that weekend suffered, too: Bloodshot ($9.17 million), I Still Believe ($9.10 million), and The Hunt ($5.3 million), which had once been removed from the schedule indefinitely from the previous September. Bad Boys for Life had already crossed the $200 million line on March 7. Along with Onward ($61.5 million overall), two other films were destined to be stuck in the $60 million category: The Invisible Man ($64.91 million) and The Call of the Wild ($62.34 million). Nearly every theater in the country was shut down by the next weekend.Full List of Box Office Results: March 12-14, 2021 95% Raya and the Last Dragon (2021)$5.5 million ($15.84 million total) 31% Tom &amp; Jerry (2020)$4.08 million ($28.15 million total) 22% Chaos Walking (2021)$2.25 million ($6.91 million total) 42% Boogie (2021)$730,000 ($2.28 million total) 76% The Croods: A New Age (2020)$520,000 ($54.3 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on&nbsp;WGN Radio&nbsp;with Nick Digilio as well as on&nbsp;Business First AM&nbsp;with Angela Miles and his&nbsp;Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via&nbsp;Box Office Mojo]On an Apple device?

Guy Ritchie had a better-than-average Guy Ritchie opening (when not mounting a big tentpole picture) and horror continued to take a backseat to everything, with even a low budget not being low enough.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Bad Boys for Life Aims for Biggest January Release of All Time(Photo by Ben Rothstein/©Columbia Pictures)Bad Boys For Life earned another $34 million in its second weekend release. That puts its 10-day total at $120.6 million, which places it in league with films like Ted, Twilight, and Thor, all of which grossed between $181-219 million. These are incredible numbers for a fresh January release. Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper had already been in limited release since December and was also on the verge of a big awards run when it hit a similar benchmark. The best ten-day total for a brand new January release up to this weekend was M. Night Shyamalan’s Split, whose $77.38 million at this point seems rather paltry now. By next weekend, not only will the third Bad Boys film surpass the gross of 2003’s summer release of Bad Boys II, but it’s likely to zoom past Paul Blart: Mall Cop as the biggest January release of all-time.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveRotten Returns:&nbsp;The Turning Adds to An Already Dismal January for Horror(Photo by Universal Pictures)The Grudge reboot opened to $11.4 million and only just recently crossed $20 million. Underwater started with just $6.3 million and limped past $15 million. Now it is The Turning’s turn to make the horror genre look bad. Fans just are not buying these January efforts, and neither are critics, given the film’s dismal 13% on the Tomatometer. Even with a budget estimated between $10-14 million, The Turning is going to be underwater itself, as it may have trouble even reaching $15 million. We’ll see if Gretel &amp; Hansel can break the curse next week.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;1917&nbsp;Continues to Do Well, but Audiences Shrug at&nbsp;The GentlemenGuy Ritchie returned to the world of off-kilter crime capers with The Gentlemen and managed to get folks to fork over $11 million to it. That is more than Snatch back in 2000 ($8 million), which was sold on the supporting performance of Brad Pitt, and certainly much better than the limited releases of RocknRolla; Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; and Revolver. But an opening in that range is likely to lead to somewhere in the $25-30 million range, which is just another January shrug.Sam Mendes’ 1917 may be a bit of a shrug with the&nbsp;few critics pushing back against its style, but it certainly is not with audiences who helped push the film over the $100 million line with another $15.8 million weekend. Even if you lop off its two-week limited run, 1917 has still earned more in 17 days of wide release than M. Night Shyamalan’s Split, which charts the film for a course over $140 million. While Universal can celebrate that, they are also staring down the grosses for Dolittle. With another $12.5 million this weekend, the film is coming in under the pace of two of the Underworld sequels, Awakening and Evolution, each of which finished with $62+ million. The family aspect could keep Dolittle in that range, but until it reaches a half-billion in grosses worldwide, the film is going to be deep into the red.Wrapping up other milestone news, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker finally passed half-a-billion domestically. Jumanji: The Next Level is hoping to have enough in the tank to make it to $300 million, still ranking in the top five with over $283 million. Knives Out passed $150 million after spending its ninth straight week in the top 10. And Little Women should still have enough pull to reach $100 million. It currently stands at $93.7 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Glass Remained King(Photo by Universal Pictures)M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass led for a second straight week, dropping 53% to $18.88 million. That was more than the two big new releases would make combined, with The Kid Who Would Be King coming in fourth&nbsp;with $7.17 million and the roasted Matthew McConaughey/Anne Hathaway twister, Serenity, which was eighth&nbsp;with only $4.41 million. The Top Five was rounded out by&nbsp;The Upside continuing to do solid business, falling only 20.4% to $11.94 million. In its sixth week, Aquaman made another $7.26 million, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse was fifth&nbsp;with $6.11 million. Clint Eastwood’s The Mule also finally crossed the $100 million line in its seventh&nbsp;weekend. The Top Ten films earned just $73.81 million which was the lowest full January weekend of the last decade. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $100.15 Million and averaged 66.5% on the Tomatometer. 2019’s Top Ten averaged 54.0% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;The Rhythm Section and&nbsp;Gretel &amp; HanselHorror and revenge will close out the first month of the decade. Blake Lively stars in Reed Morano’s The Rhythm Section as a woman looking for retribution for the death of her family. Then we also have Oz Perkins’ revisionist take on Gretel &amp; Hansel starring Sophia Lillis from the It movies. The horror genre has not had a great month, with the reboot of The Grudge, Underwater, and this week’s The Turning.

Backed by extensive advertising and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association awarding it top honors&nbsp;at the Golden Globes, it was a solid start for Sam Mendes’ latest on the eve of Oscar nominations Monday morning. Could a slew of nominations keep the movie racing along in the weeks ahead?King of the Crop:&nbsp;1917&nbsp;Tops the Weekend with $36.5 Million, Has More Than One Shot at $100 Million1917, the “one-take” adventure film set during the first World War, earned a solid $36.5 million over the weekend. After two weeks of limited release&nbsp;during which it earned $2.7 million, that number puts it in the range of other military pictures that opened in the same period. In 2001, Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down opened in limited release on December 28 and then, after grossing $1.84 million in three weeks of release in no more than 16 theaters, it opened wide in January to $28.61 million (and $33.62 million over MLK weekend). Kathryn Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty also did three weeks of limited release in 2012, grossing $5.48 million before opening to $24.43 million. Peter Berg’s Lone Survivor did two weeks of limited release in a pair of theaters, grossing just $326,685, before exploding with a $37.84 million wide launch. Of course, the king of them all, Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper, did three weeks in four theaters (grossing $3.42 million) and then had the highest January weekend of all time with $89.26 million and $107.21 million over the MLK holiday.Zero Dark Thirty was the lowest-grossing of them all overall with $95.72 million total, while the others&nbsp;all made more than $100 million and Sniper made over $350 million. So, $30 million-plus openings in January do not guarantee a $100 million-plus total.&nbsp;(Though, with the exception of the disastrous word-of-mouth of The Devil Inside, the $80 million&nbsp;Cloverfield&nbsp;earned is really the lowest one should expect.) As previously mentioned, 1917 is likely to see a bevy of Oscar nominations on Monday – the bulk of which in the technical categories, but it would be a real surprise to not see the film and Mendes pick up Picture and Director nods. Doing a little reverse engineering, no Best Picture nominee with a $30 million-plus wide launch has ever failed to reach $100 million.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveRotten Returns:&nbsp;Underwater&nbsp;Struggles For Air, Becomes Second Horror Flop of 2020(Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. )Underwater finished production in 2017 and is just&nbsp;now making its appearance in theaters. Amongst all the new wide launches this weekend, it finished last with a paltry $7 million. The production, with a budget reported to be anywhere between $50 million and $80 million, is the latest in a string of&nbsp;disappointments for Fox, including the $100 million Certified Fresh animated feature&nbsp;Spies in Disguise (which just crossed $115 million worldwide), Ad Astra, and even Ford v Ferrari, which even with over $211 million globally is still chasing its own large budget. The studio has only had one film (the faith-based Breakthrough) enter profit status in its theatrical run since 2018’s mega-hit Bohemian Rhapsody.Underwater, which was reasonably well reviewed – it’s at 53% on the Tomatometer –&nbsp;marks a second misfire for a Kristen Stewart vehicle after November’s Charlie’s Angels, and is the second week in a row during which horror audiences mostly ignored one of its own. Sony’s The Grudge dropped straight out of the top 10 in its second week, falling 69% to $3.5 million for a total of just $17.9 million. That puts its word-of-mouth multiple in line with other attempted reboots like Conan the Barbarian, Blair Witch, Rings,&nbsp;last year’s Hellboy and, again, Charlie’s Angels, though its budget loss is not nearly as large as the one Underwater is looking at.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Rise of Skywalker Near&nbsp;$1 Billion,&nbsp;Just Mercy&nbsp;Doing Just OK For NowHere we are on Day 24 of The Rise of Skywalker and with $478.16 million&nbsp;it is now the&nbsp;ninth-highest–grossing film ever in that period domestically, just ahead of Rogue One’s $477.36 million. However, that order may change quickly as Rogue had a $22.06 million fourth weekend on the first January weekend of 2017;&nbsp;ROS comes in with just $15 million, which is also less than the $26.11 million of The Dark Knight and the $20.20 million of 2019’s The Lion King in the same frame. That suggests a final gross coming in around the $520 million range, possibly a full $100 million less than The Last Jedi made. While the numbers may pale compared to its recent Star Wars predecessors (sans Solo, of course), this week Rise is going to become just the 15th&nbsp;film ever to gross a half-billion domestically and the 46th&nbsp;film to gross over $1 billion worldwide.The film that has just beaten The Last Jedi on the all-time global box office chart&nbsp;is Disney’s Frozen II. It has now earned&nbsp;$1.371 billion, passing Episode VIII as well as the final Harry Potter film and Black Panther to become the 11th-highest–grossing film of all time. It needs just $31.5 million to enter the top 10. Also still chugging along is Jumanji: The Next Level, with another $14 million this weekend bringing its 31-day total to $257 million, the 10th-best for a December release in that timeframe. It has grossed $632 million worldwide. Doing well for Sony too is Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, also on the eve of what should be several Oscar nominations. The film may be neck-and-neck with the 2014 version of the musical Annie after 19 days ($73.7 million), but that film had a big drop-off after the holidays and stalled with just $85.9 million. Little Women will get an Oscar bump this week that should propel it to $100-plus million.The two other newbies ran neck-and-neck over the weekend. The expansion of Destin Daniel Cretton’s Just Mercy netted an OK $10 million in 2,375 theaters, which is more than Uncut Gems made in its third-week expansion ($9.57 million in 2,348 theaters). Uncut Gems may have dropped out of the top 10 already, but it is only about $5 million away from becoming A24’s top domestic grosser ever, replacing Lady Bird’s $48.95 million. Mercy was also beaten by the Tiffany Haddish/Rose Byrne comedy, Like a Boss, which also opened to an estimated $10 million, a not-so-great start for the $29 million production from Paramount. The film has a current Tomatometer score of 22%. Ending on a positive note, we turn to the ongoing strength of Rian Johnson’s Knives Out, which is over $265 million worldwide and is going to pass Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood domestically this week to become the second-highest–grossing original film of 2019 behind Jordan Peele’s&nbsp;Us.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;The Upside&nbsp;Lands First Big Surprise of 2019One of the big surprises of 2019 opened at number 1 on this weekend. The Upside, which STX Films acquired from the Weinstein Company, started with $20.35 million on its journey to over $108 million. A Dog’s Way Home finished third with $11.25 million, and one of the worst-reviewed films of the year, the delayed Keanu Reeves sci-fi cloning thriller, Replicas, opened in 13th with just $2.37 million. Rounding out the top five were Aquaman&nbsp;in second with $17.35 million, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in fourth with $9.05 million, and Escape Room in fifth with $8.92 million. Mary Poppins Returns crossed $150 million in sixth place. The top 10 films grossed $96.77 million and averaged 69.4% on the Tomatometer; this year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed an estimated $116.8 million and averaged 71.5% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Bad Boys&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dolittle&nbsp;Set For a ShowdownTwo big event films are looking to take the box office back from the leftovers of 2019. The smart money is on Bad Boys for Life, with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence&nbsp;reuniting for the first time since 2003, only without Michael Bay at the helm. Then, Universal is hoping to avoid another disastrous special effects-laden animal movie in less than a month; if Dolittle can open to more than what Cats has grossed to date ($26.35 million) that will at least be something. But it will have a lot more to recoup given its inflated $175 million budget and we could be looking at the first big disappointment of 2020.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;January 10-121917 (2020)  89% –&nbsp;$36.5 million ($39.22 million total)Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  51% – $15.06 million ($478.17 million total)Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)  71% – $14 million ($257.12 million total)Like a Boss (2020)  21% – $10 million ($10 million total)Just Mercy (2020)  85% – $10 million ($10.44 million total)Little Women (2019)  95% – $7.66 million ($74.03 million total)Underwater (2020)  47% – $7 million ($7 million total)Frozen II (2019)  78% – $5.76 million ($459.49 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $5.73 million ($139.62 million total)Spies in Disguise (2019)  76% – $5.11 million ($54.62 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

The weekend as a whole was not overly spectacular nor outright poor by standards of the holiday this century. Two other newcomers opened respectably in relation to their low budgets while Downhill&nbsp;lived up to its title.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Sonic&nbsp;Breaks Video Game Record&nbsp;The makers of Sonic the Hedgehog can take some pride in becoming just the third Fresh video game adaptation to get a full theatrical release in America.&nbsp;Sonic’s three-day weekend of $57 million was good enough to break the short-lived record set by last summer’s Pokemon: Detective Pikachu ($54.36 million), putting 2001’s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ($47.73 million) in third place. Adding an additional estimated $11 million on Monday and Sonic is well on its way to become just the fifth game-to-cinema film to cross the $100 million line. (The Angry Birds Movie and 2018’s Rampage were the others.) Pikachu grossed over $144 million.Recommended:&nbsp;43 Video Game Movies Ranked by TomatometerRotten Returns:&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;Downhill&nbsp;And Then Some For SearchlightUnfortunately, the first film under Disney’s newly branded Searchlight Pictures got&nbsp;buried. A remake of 2014’s Force Majeure, Downhill&nbsp;was released in 2,301 theaters, the fifth-largest opening weekend launch in Searchlight’s Fox history. But&nbsp;Downhill‘s $4.67 million start from Fri-to-Sun was lower than any of their 2,000+ theater launches, below even 2016’s plagued The Birth of a Nation&nbsp;start with $7 million.&nbsp;Downhill is estimated to gross $5.19 million over the holiday, the lowest wide opening ever for a film starring Will Ferrell.The Top 10 And Beyond: Fantasy Island,&nbsp;The Photograph Open DecentlyLet’s talk for a moment about Birds of Prey – or as it is now known in the marketing, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey. There has been a lot of chatter of box office analysts jumping on the negative train when it comes to what it has made so far, while others push back that the film is actually doing fine. Part of that debate was set up by the tracking companies which predicted for weeks an opening in the $50 million range. Now even if the film had achieved that, it still likely would have been the lowest opening for a film in the recent DC Cinematic Universe. (Shazam opened to $53.5 million.) The fact that it opened $20 million lower than that is what set off alarm bells and maybe even a few reactionary claims. Remember that every film’s ultimate success is in relation to its budget. While perception can play a factor, let us focus specifically on where the film is in purely business terms.Let’s take the conservative route and say HQ:BOP cost $84.5 million to make, the lowball figure reported by Box Office Mojo. While it has grossed just $59.2 million in its first 10 days domestically (and $61.6 million with the holiday), it is up to $145 million worldwide. That puts it $108 million away from breaking even. How much of that can it make up in the U.S.? Well, films in February that have made between $56 million and $59 million in 10 days have finished between $85-$96 million. Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes To Jail is the highest-grossing film in February after 10 days ($64.5 million)&nbsp;not&nbsp;to reach $100 million. Four films to gross below $53 million in that time (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, Peter Rabbit, How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days, Wayne’s World) managed to reach the milestone. Back to Birds of Prey though: That means to break even the film still needs around another $69-$80 million internationally, where it only made another $28 million this weekend. Now if the budget was more in the $100 million region it is still going to need about another $154 million to reach profit. Anyway you slice it, the film is likely to be a disappointment regardless of whether it reaches nine digits here.&nbsp;Over to a pair of new releases that will not reach $100 million but do have a shot at making a profit. Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island did not screen for critics nor even hold any Thursday night previews. Nevertheless it grossed an estimated $14 million over the four-day holiday, doubling its $7 million production budget. A small P&amp;A addition and, even with a huge drop next week, the film could find itself in the black by the weekend. The Photograph got the best reviews among the wide newcomers this week and grossed a decent $13.3 million over the holiday. However, its budget was a little higher at $16 million so it is going to take some word-of-mouth past Valentine’s Day weekend.Moving over to definitive success stories in the Top 10, Jumanji: The Next Level passed the $300 million mark and is approaching $800 million worldwide. Sony also owns the biggest success of 2020 so far with Bad Boys for Life, which has just passed $369 million worldwide. No film that has grossed over $179 million after 31 days of release has failed to gross $200 million domestic. Bad Boys 3 passed $181 million on Sunday. Sam Mendes’ 1917 may have come up short at the Oscars last Sunday but it has just passed $145 million domestic and over $323 million worldwide. Some of that profit will go to cover Universal’s&nbsp;disastrous Dolittle, which is up to $73 million in the U.S. and $182 million worldwide, not even close to recouping its $175 million budget.Of course the big winner at the Oscars was Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, which Neon put back into 2,000 U.S. theaters this weekend. It made its first appearance into the Top 10 – despite being available on physical and streaming – with $6.47 million. That puts its domestic total at $44.34 million, which makes it the sixth highest-grossing non-English language film ever. It will pass Instructions Not Included ($44.46 million) for fifth by tomorrow, where it will then rank only behind Zhang Yimou’s Hero ($53.71 million), Life is Beautiful ($57.24 million), Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon ($128.07 million), and The Passion of the Christ ($370.27 million). Neon also had Portrait of a Lady on Fire in 22 theaters this weekend, where it grossed $514,707, equaling a $23,395 per-theater-average, 2020’s highest to date over Bleecker Street’s The Assistant ($19,785 in four theaters).Recommended:&nbsp;All Bong Joon-ho Movies&nbsp;Ranked by Tomatometer, 30 Certified Fresh South Korean MoviesThis Time Last Year:&nbsp;Alita&nbsp;Battles&nbsp;Over The TopLast year’s President’s Day weekend was loaded with new releases and the leader had a disappointing haul in the $33 million range. That was Alita: Battle Angel, which won the battle but ultimately lost the war by losing more than $50 million against its budget and production. Second place went to previous leader The Lego Movie 2 with $27.7 million, handily beating Valentine’s Day opener, Isn’t It Romantic?, which grossed $16.6 million, bringing its five-day total to $22.8 million. The top five were rounded out by What Men Want ($12.2 million) and Happy Death Day 2U ($11 million), which opened to less than half of the original. Over the week, M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass finally crossed the $100 million mark on its 28th day of release. The Top 10 grossed $126.41 million over the holiday weekend and averaged 59.6% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10 grossed an estimated $162.25 million (the ninth-best since 2000) and averaged 61.6% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Harrison Ford Answers&nbsp;The CallIn 1935, The Call of the Wild, starring Clark Gable, was the last film released under Twentieth Century Pictures before it became 20th Century Fox. Some 85 years later, Chris Sanders’ version of the Jack London classic will become the first film released under Disney’s newly re-branded 20th Century Studios after dropping the “Fox.” Harrison Ford stars in the film with a CGI dog. Then STX releases Brahms: The Boy II, the horror sequel to its low-budget success from 2016.

Three years later, the&nbsp;studio’s follow-up, A Bug’s Life, opened to $33.52 million. The only other release Pixar has had to start with less than $40 million was their troubled production,&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur ($39.15 million) – more on that in a bit. All three of those were November releases, a strategy that&nbsp;generally paid off over the years with&nbsp;Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., and The Incredibles –&nbsp;each one with a higher opening than the previous film. It was 11 years before they came back to November with The Good Dinosaur and then two years&nbsp;until they did it again with&nbsp;Coco, which opened to $50.8 million. Only five of Pixar’s films have failed to reach $200 million. Two of them were their first two films, another two were sequels to Cars, and the other was The Good Dinosaur. Onward is looking like the sixth.It’s not for lack of quality. Of the 21 previously released Pixar films, 15 have retained Tomatometer scores of 90 or above. Onward is close, Certified Fresh at 86%, and is actually the third-best–reviewed wide release of 2020 to date behind The Invisible Man and the other new opener this week. The movie’s $40 million opening weekend haul means it stacks up against other March animated releases like so:Zootopia ($71.11 million)Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax ($70.21 million)Ice Age: The Meltdown ($68.03 million)Monsters vs. Aliens ($59.32 million)How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World ($55.02 million)Home ($52.1 million)The Boss Baby ($50.19 million)Ice Age ($46.31 million)Dr. Seuss’ Horton Hears a Who ($45.01 million)How to Train Your Dragon ($43.73)The Croods ($43.63 million)Onward ($40 million)Rango ($38.07 million)Robots ($36.04 million)Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman ($32.2 million)Meet the Robinsons ($25.12 million)TMNT ($24.25 million)Onward not even cracking that top 10 March animated openings has to be even more disappointing than being on the lower rung of the pretty elevated Pixar ladder. Every film from Peabody above passed $100 million eventually, and the average multiple from Robinsons up is a decent 3.61. That would give Onward a first estimate of $142 million, which would at least be higher than The Good Dinosaur’s $123 million but could end up on the rare red side of the Pixar ledger depending on the final budget, which no one is reporting right now. Onward’s tracking was in the mid-40s range, so&nbsp;we’re showing some skepticism regarding the argument that&nbsp;panic over public health worries stopped people from hitting the cinemas.&nbsp;Whether that is the case overseas remains to be seen.The Top 10 And Beyond:&nbsp;Bad Boys&nbsp;Passed $200 Million,&nbsp;Emma&nbsp;Goes WideThere have been eight films – by our count – centered around basketball that have opened to $10 million or more:&nbsp;Space Jam, Coach Carter, Uncle Drew, Semi-Pro, White Men Can’t Jump, Glory Road, Like Mike, Blue Chips. The Way Back does not join that list. The Ben Affleck basketball drama, which sees him reteaming with his The Accountant director Gavin O’Connor (who also did sports dramas, Miracle and Warrior), opened to $8.5 million, which is more in line with romantic hoops films like Just Wright ($8.28 million) and Love &amp; Basketball ($8.13 million). Those films ended up with $21.56 million and $27.45 million, respectively. (William Friedkin’s Blue Chips opened to $10.12 million and finished with just $23.07 million.) That is not great for a film budgeted somewhere between $21 million and $25 million, but not a disaster either. The film’s&nbsp;Certified Fresh 87% Tomatometer score is the second-best among 2020’s wide releases and is up there with Affleck’s best-reviewed starring efforts, such as Argo (96%), The Town (93%), Gone Girl (88%), and Chasing Amy (87%).Last week’s number 1 film, The Invisible Man, fell a decent 49% this weekend to $14.5 million. With $52 million in the bank domestically, that puts it just ahead of The Purge and The Purge: Anarchy with a better second weekend than either Insidious: Chapter 2 or The Purge: Election Year. Last week we placed the film’s first estimate at $77 million. We’re upping that to between $79 million and $83 million. It has grossed $98.2 million worldwide to date and it cost just $7 million to make.(Photo by © Columbia Pictures)There are two other solid successes still in the top 10, with Sony’s Bad Boys for Life and Paramount’s Sonic the Hedgehog. Bad Boys finally passed $200 million domestic, which is added into its $415 million haul worldwide. Sonic’s success is more…fine…as it approaches $300 million worldwide. It’s in profit, if a small one. But a profit is a profit, especially one delayed for touch-up work.Not doing so well but still hanging in there is DC’s Birds of Prey, which is up to $82 million domestic and close to $200 million worldwide. That is going to amount to around a $25 million loss for those invested. That is a drop in the bucket compared to The Call of the Wild. The film is still on the path for around $75 million, but is only at $99.5 million worldwide right now and it is chasing down a production budget of $135 million. This film could lose anywhere between $125 million and $150 million when the final numbers are in.Finally, Focus expanded the new adaptation of Jane Austen’s Emma into 1,565 theaters in its third week and it grossed $5 million. How does that compare with Focus’s release of 2005’s Pride and Prejudice?2005:&nbsp;Pride and Prejudice – Week 1 ($2.8 million / 215 theaters), Week 2 ($2.11 million / 221), Week 3 ($7.02 million / 1,299)2020:&nbsp;Emma – Week 1 ($234,482 / 9), Week 2 ($1.15 million / 97), Week 3 ($5 million / 1,565)Pride had already grossed $15.9 million through its third weekend and finished with $38.4 million. Emma is up to $6.8 million. Impractical Jokers: The Movie is now up to $8.6 million after three weekends. Its launch was earlier and wider than Emma, which will eventually pass it. The 1996 version of Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow, released a year after Clueless, never made it into more than 848 theaters and grossed $22.23 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Captain Marvel&nbsp;Arrives With a BangCaptain Marvel opened to the third-best March weekend ever with $153.43 million. That made up 77.47% of the top 10 revenue for the weekend, with only How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and A Madea Family Funeral&nbsp;making more than $5 million among the rest of the movies in theaters. They did do a bit better than that, with $14.68 million and $12.46 million, but it trailed off from there with The LEGO Movie 2 and Alita: Battle Angel doing just $3.86 million and $3.21 million in their respective fifth and fourth weekends of release. The documentary, Apollo 11, did break onto the list with $1.25 million in just 405 theaters. The top 10 films grossed a total of $198.06 million and averaged 72.7% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top 10 grossed $92.23 million and averaged 74.1% on the Tomatometer. This is just the ninth&nbsp;time since 2010 that the top 10 films on a March weekend came in with under $100 million.On the Vine:&nbsp;A Controversial&nbsp;Hunt&nbsp;Finally Lands in TheatersNext week audiences will finally have an opportunity to see Craig Zobel’s The Hunt, which was delayed last September in the aftermath of a mass shooting. Vin Diesel takes a stroll into comic-book land with Bloodshot and we have another film about a Christian rock star, I Still Believe, which is hoping to break out for Lionsgate the way Roadside’s I Can Only Imagine did back in 2018. Onward is likely to hold onto the number 1 spot for a second week, but this is the one film that could spring an upset. Look out in your area too for Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always. The drama, which premiered at Sundance, has maintained a perfect 100% with critics and is being called one of the year’s best films.

Nor will it be anything but a blip on the box office radar, a disappointment to a studio hoping to bring back a franchise that already died a quick death once before. On the other hand, movies still hanging around from the previous decade are climbing both the yearly and all-time charts. That includes a sequel and a different remake from the same studio on a very favorable path.King of the Crop:&nbsp;The Rise of Skywalker Lagging Behind&nbsp;Last Jedi, Still Bound for Record Books&nbsp;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker leads the pack for a third straight week as people play a half-full/half-empty game with where it stands. Yes, it is still well behind the pace of The Last Jedi, which had grossed $517.21 million after 17 days;&nbsp;ROS is at $450.79 million. One can look at release timing given that The Last Jedi had a December 15 launch in 2017, which put Christmas on its 11th&nbsp;day, boosting its total following what was the second-largest opening of all-time. Skywalker has been behind since the jump and yet, with another $33.74 million this weekend, it has the eighth-best total ever after 17 days. In that time it is already the 19th&nbsp;highest-grossing domestic film of all-time (and could be in the top 15 by the end of next weekend). The film is still waiting to join the&nbsp;Billion Dollar&nbsp;Club, as it rose to over $918 million globally this weekend. The Force Awakens, at the time, was the fastest film to $1 billion, getting there in just 12 days (Avengers: Endgame did it in 11 this summer).&nbsp;The Last Jedi was the third-fastest in 2017, getting there during its third weekend.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveRotten Returns: The Grudge&nbsp;Becomes Latest Reboot to Flounder at Box Office(Photo by Allen Fraser / © Screen Gems)Sony’s The Grudge&nbsp;reboot earns its place here not because it may be a big financial loser – the budget is reportedly only $10 million – but&nbsp;because there were clearly bigger hopes even than the $9-$15 million projections it had. Also going into this weekend it had a strong $1.8 million in Thursday previews.&nbsp;But with just $11.3 million, the movie’s first-weekend haul ranks as the worst weekend total for a January release with previews over $1 million. The previous low was Resident Evil: The Final Chapter’s $13.6 million; the second-lowest was last year’s Escape Room ($18.23 million).&nbsp;The Grudge’s number is also on the low-end of attempted franchise reboots, but still ahead of 2019’s Hellboy ($12.04 million), 2011’s Conan the Barbarian ($10.02 million), 2016’s Blair Witch ($9.57 million), and 2019’s Charlie’s Angels ($8.35 million). Those films all had final gross multiples between 1.81 and 2.17. 2019’s Child’s Play opened to $14.09 million and finished with just $29.20 million, a multiple of just 2.07. That would put The Grudge on pace for a final tally between $20 million and $25 million, which would be less than Rings finished with in 2017.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;Becomes Biggest Animated Film Ever,&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;Continues Killer Run&nbsp;Sony did not have much luck with The Grudge this weekend but their other films are doing quite well. Jumanji: The Next Level may be $26 million off Welcome to the Jungle’s pace after 24 days ($262.22 million), but it is right behind it on the all-time December chart – 10th&nbsp;place in fact – at this period, well outpacing the last two Hobbit films, which finished with $255 and $258 million, respectively. All the films above The Next Level&nbsp;on the 24-day list grossed over $300 million. Only Titanic and The Fellowship of the Ring had grossed less at this point and went over the milestone. The Next Level’s $28 million weekend is almost identical to Welcome to the Jungle’s fourth weekend and is the fifth-best weekend four for a December release ever, nearly $12 million higher than even the first Lord of the Rings film.Greta Gerwig’s Little Women is hoping to just get that first $100 million and it took a solid step this week. Only one film has ever opened in December, reached $60 million in 12 days, and failed to make it to $100 million (that would be 2008’s&nbsp;Valkyrie). Little Women just reached $60.5 million. Though its $13.57 million is on the lower end of the 12-day releases that grossed between $50-$60 million, it is just over a week away from a likely slew of Oscar nominations that will no doubt boost its profile as one of the films to see over the next five weeks.Over on the animated front, Disney’s Frozen II continues to trend up the charts. The sequel is about to cross $450 million with another $11.29 million added this weekend. But more importantly, it has just crossed $1.32 billion, $50 million more than the first film, which now makes it the highest-grossing animated film ever. With another $78 million, it will pass Avengers: Age of Ultron and enter the top&nbsp;10&nbsp;movies of all time. Fox’s Spies in Disguise is not going to get anywhere near those numbers. What it is near are the numbers for The Adventures of Tintin, which had $47.47 million after 12 days&nbsp;following a $11.43 million second weekend;&nbsp;Spies is up to $46.72 million after an $10.08 million weekend. Tintin finished with $77.59 million, which would not be a great number for the $100 million production.Two of the great box office stories of the season are also still playing out. Rian Johnson’s Knives Out just crossed $130 million and is going to pass Once Upon a Time In Hollywood to become the second-highest grossing original film of the year. (Jordan Peele’s Us is number 1.) A total of $150 million is not out of the realm of possibility and $250 million globally is inevitable. Also doing great is Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems. The Adam Sandler thriller grossed $7.4 million in its second week of wide release for a total of $36.48 million. It is behind just Lady Bird ($48.95 million) and Hereditary ($44.06 million) on A24’s all-time chart and soon it will become their highest-grossing film in their seven-year history.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;Rules For a Third Weekend(Photo by © Warner Bros.)James Wan’s Aquaman led the way for a third straight week with $31 million, driving its total to over $260 million.&nbsp;As with&nbsp;this week, a horror film was the sole new release to kick off the New Year and a new franchise may have been born with Escape Room:&nbsp;It finished second with $18.23 million and its sequel is due out this August. The top five was rounded out by Mary Poppins Returns ($15.86 million), Bumblebee ($13.20 million), and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse ($13.12 million). The&nbsp;top 10 films grossed a total of $119 million, which was the best three-day weekend total of 2019 for the next eight weeks until Captain Marvel gave the box office a boost on March 8. The films averaged 66.4% on the Tomatometer. This year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed an estimated $129.68 million and averaged 66.6% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;“One-Shot” WWI Thriller&nbsp;1917 Goes Wide and Could Unseat&nbsp;SkywalkerA loaded January weekend is likely to be led by one of two expansions. Sam Mendes’ 1917 has been doing solid business in limited release and should take the number 1 spot from not just its new challengers but from Star Wars as well. Just Mercy is also headed into wide release and may draw some pre-awards interest. Brand-new 2020 releases include the sci-fi horror film, Underwater, with Kristen Stewart, which is hoping to draw more interest than Charlie’s Angels did. Then there is the comedy, Like a Boss, with Tiffany Haddish, Rose Byrne, and Salma Hayek. Finally, 2019 layover, The Informer, with Joel Kinnaman will get a limited release after moving around on the schedule.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;January 3-5Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)  51% – $33.74 million ($450.77 million total)Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)  71% – $26.5 million ($236.21 million total)Little Women (2019)  95% – $13.56&nbsp;million ($60.02 million total)The Grudge (2020)  21% – $11.3 million ($11.3 million total)Frozen II (2019)  78% – $11.29 million ($449.88 million total)Spies in Disguise (2019)  76% – $10.08 million ($46.73 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $9.03 million ($130.26&nbsp;million total)Uncut Gems (2019)  91% – $7.83 million ($36.81 million total)Bombshell (2019)  68% – $4.08 million ($24.67 million total)Cats (2019)  19% –&nbsp;$2.6 million ($24.69 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Before we get to that though, this weekend is another example of repeating how often tracking companies are bad at predicting blockbuster openings. The will of moviegoers goes beyond what can be deduced on social media and they really wanted to see what Jordan Peele had in store for them after breaking the bank and winning an Oscar for his directorial debut, Get Out. In short, we need to talk about Us.King&nbsp;of the Crop: “Original” Us Takes Records For Horror, March and “R”-Rated Films(Photo by Universal)Let’s lay out some pretty amazing facts about Us’ $70 million weekend. That is the highest opening ever for an original “R”-rated film. The 11 “R” films to open higher were either sequels&nbsp;or adapted from popular books. Us is also the biggest opening ever for an original live-action film in March and an original horror film in any month. Only It and last year’s Halloween opener higher. But…can it outgross Get Out‘s $176 million?Us has already doubled Get Out’s $33.4 million opening. A good start indeed. It is the 142nd film to open with $65 million or more. Of those previous 141 films, do you know how many failed to reach the $176 million earned by Get Out? Six. (Fifty Shades of Grey, Halloween&nbsp;2018, Fast and Furious, Quantum of Solace, X-Men: Apocalypse, 2012). That is already 95.7% in favor of Us besting Get Out’s total. The number to watch next week when Dumbo knocks Us back to second is whether its second weekend is over or under $28 million.Rotten Returns: Captive State Takes A Dive(Photo by Focus Features)In its second week, Focus Features’ Captive State could not remain in a Top&nbsp;10 where four finishers made less than $2 million this weekend. That is because it took an estimated 70.7% drop to only $918,000. The $25 million production that has grossed all of $5.2 million in 10 days of release is the second film of 2018 to have a 70% drop or higher. (Replicas fell 81.5%.) In 2018 there were six wide releases that dropped as much in their second weekend – Mortal Engines, Assassination Nation, Gringo, Super Troopers 2, Kin, and Once Upon a Deadpool.Top 10 and Beyond: Captain Marvel Hits Top 10 Of MCU(Photo by Disney)One film already carving its path amongst the all-timers at the box office is Captain Marvel. With another $35 million this weekend its total stands at $321 million, the 21st-best total for a film after 17 days of release. Its worldwide total currently stands at $910 million – or – the 7th highest-grossing film based on a Marvel property ever.Among other victories in the Top 10 this week we have How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, which is up to $488 million worldwide, just $6 million behind the original (which is still the series’ domestic champion with $217.5 million.) If estimates hold on A Madea Family Funeral it will officially be the third highest-grossing film of Tyler Perry’s directorial career. Finally while the numbers are not giant for Five Feet Apart, a 34% drop from last week means the $7 million production has now grossed over $26 million and should get itself at least over $40 million when all is said and done.This Time Last Year: Pacific Rim Led, But Would Soon Fall(Photo by Warner Bros)One of the biggest bombs of 2018, nevertheless, opened to no. 1 this weekend. Pacific Rim Uprising began with $28.1 million and later finished with just under $60 million total domestically. Black Panther was finally knocked back to second place with another $17 million as it had amassed over $631 million after six weekends. Also opening with Sherlock Gnomes ($10.6 million), Paul Apostle of Christ ($5.1 million), Midnight Sun ($4 million) and Steven Soderbergh’s Unsane which missed the top ten with $3.7 million. Leading the per-theater-average charge was Wes Anderson’s Isle of Dogs ($60,011 on each of its 27 screens for $1.62 million.) Fifty Shades Freed also managed to finally cross the $100 million mark.On the Vine: Elephants and a Beach Bum(Photo by Dumbo)Disney releases the first of their 2019 live-action remakes with Dumbo. Tim Burton’s 2010 adaptation of Alice in Wonderland was the biggest success of his career and Dumbo could very well end up being his second highest global success. Also opening wide is PureFlix’s abortion drama, Unplanned, the first “R”-rated release for the Christian-based company. Finally, Neon releases Harmony Korine’s The Beach Bum with Matthew McConaughey.&nbsp;The Full Top 10: March 22-24Us (2019)  93% – $70.25 million ($70.25 million total)Captain Marvel (2019)  79% –&nbsp;$35.02 million ($321.49 million total)Wonder Park (2019)  34% – $9.00 million ($29.47 million total)Five Feet Apart (2019)  52% – $8.75 million ($26.46 million total)How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019)  90% – $6.53 million ($145.75 million total)Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral (2019)  11% – $4.50 million ($65.88 million total)Gloria Bell (2019)  91%&nbsp;– $1.80 million ($2.49 million total)No Manches Frida 2 (2019)  13%&nbsp;– $1.78 million ($6.62 million total)The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (2019)  84% – $2.13 million ($103.32 million total)Alita: Battle Angel (2019)  61%&nbsp;– $1.01 million ($83.87 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"war, scene, BBC, e.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/24105244/Us-Poster1.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-us-70-million-weekends-a-horror-record"},{"id":"47509086372275","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Terminator: Dark Fate Underperforms but Finishes on Top Anyway","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Terminator: Dark Fate Underperforms but Finishes on Top AnywayJoker and Maleficent cling to second and third, but the Holiday Movie Season is off to a rocky start on the weekend of November 1-3.by Erik Childress | November 3, 2019 |  CommentsThe Holiday Movie Season is here (hooray!), and it’s not off to a good start (boo!). But save your panic, because this is still the season when&nbsp;The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen II, and a new Jumanji are going to make about a billion-and-a-half alone domestically. This weekend, despite four new releases, gives us a Top Ten that isn’t even going to cross $100 million. Three of those releases weren’t expected to set the box office on fire, but the numbers that the new Terminator film put up is likely to make Paramount a&nbsp;little nervous as they stare down their second big-budget sci-fi misfire in a row.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Terminator: Dark Fate is Tops, but the Bar is Low(Photo by Paramount Pictures)The Terminator series has, without question, been waning in popularity over the years. James Cameron and Linda Hamilton left after the second film. Arnold Schwarzenegger left after the third. The global sensation that was Terminator 2: Judgment Day remains one of the great action films of all-time. 12 years later, Arnold gave it another spin with Rise of the Machines, which opened to a healthy $44 million and grossed over $150 million domestically. (T2 would amount to about $386 million in ticket sales today.) The reboot of Terminator: Salvation in 2009 with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington opened to $42.5 million and finished with $125 million. Then, in 2015, Terminator: Genisys opened to $26.1 million from Weds-to-Fri — or $27 million from Fri-to-Sun — and then failed to reach $90 million stateside.Now, 35 years after Cameron’s The Terminator premiered and four years since Cameron endorsed Genisys as the “real” Terminator 3, we now have Terminator: Dark Fate being sold to audiences as the “real” Terminator 3. And audiences are not buying. A $29 million opening is well below the low-40s projections we’ve been hearing for weeks, and it comes out to only a $7,097 per-theater-average. (T3 &amp; T4 were each over $12,000.) Critically, the film is holding steady&nbsp;at 69% on the Tomatometer (the same number for the real “real” Terminator 3; the last positively-scored film in the series.) But nobody at Paramount can be thrilled with the dollar figure, given a $185 million budget, especially coming right after the failure of Ang Lee’s Gemini Man, which has grossed just $155 million worldwide to date on a $138 million budget.Consider that only four films have ever opened in November to a PTA under $7,500 and grossed over $100 million, and all four were animated – The Polar Express ($162.77 million), Bolt ($114.05), The Princess and the Frog ($104.04), and Rise of the Guardians ($103.41). That is bad news for a film that is in the same boat as Maleficent: Mistress of Evil and needs over a half-billion dollars before we come even close to talking profit. Disney’s film only just crossed $300 million worldwide on Thursday. Genisys, the highest-grossing international Terminator to date, made $350 million and squeaked out a tiny profit. But Dark Fate may be living up to its name as it has grossed just $94 million total overseas so far.Fresh Surprise: Focus Features Earns Another Solid Debut with&nbsp;HarrietRyan FujitaniSpeaking of per-theater averages, Focus Features is having a bit of a moment. Downton Abbey has grossed over $94 million and has become their highest-grossing domestic title ever. This weekend, Kasi Lemmons’ Harriet&nbsp;opened to $12 million and notches another top ten finish in Focus’ record books. While not a giant number, Harriet’s $5,828 per-theater-average is the sixth best ever for Focus when they launch a film in over 2,000 theaters. It ranks behind The Strangers, Insidious: Chapter 3, Coraline, Burn After Reading, and London Has Fallen, and is now ahead of Atomic Blonde, The Forest, and The Boxtrolls. A pair of Jet Li films (Unleashed and Fearless) represent the low bar of Focus’ films opening to $10 million or higher, as each grossed $24.53 and $24.63 million, respectively. The Forest is their only release to open over $11 million and fail to gross at least $32 million.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Motherless Brooklyn and&nbsp;Arctic Dogs Flop Spectacularly(Photo by Entertainment Studios Motion Pictures)The two remaining new releases are downright Goldfinchian. Edward Norton’s Motherless Brooklyn, also released by Warner Bros., cost $26 million and grossed just $3.6 million. That is just a $2,682 per-theater-average in 1,342 venues. That is comparable to STX’s The Best of Enemies from April, which had a $2,608 average in 1,705 theaters and finished with just $10.2 million. Norton said that he cashed in every favor in Hollywood to get this film made, so there may be a lot of Italian Jobs in his future.Then on the animated front, Missing Link can rest easy that it no longer has the weakest opening of the year. That now belongs to the $50-million budgeted Arctic Dogs from Entertainment Studios. Its $3.1 million start is the lowest for an animated film released in over 2,000 theaters since Disney’s Teacher’s Pet ($2.46 million) back in 2004. That start is also the lowest ever for one released in over 3,000 theaters, replacing 2015’s Strange Magic, which opened to $5.5 million and finished with just $12.4 million. Arctic Dogs is now destined to join a list of animated films in 2,000+ theaters to gross less than $10 million that includes Ratchet &amp; Clank, Legends of Oz: Dorothy’s Return, Rock Dog, Doogal, The Wild Life, Early Man, and Teacher’s Pet.The Top 10 And Beyond:&nbsp;Joker and Maleficent&nbsp;Hang on to Second and Third(Photo by Niko Tavernise/© 2019 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)Joker fell back to second place this week and is now just shy of $300 million domestic. It has become the 59th film in history to cross the $900 million line and is approaching the list of the 50 highest-grossing films of all time. At $299 million, Joker is ahead of where DC’s Suicide Squad was on Day 31 ($297.32 million) and beat its fifth weekend $13.90-to-$9.91 million. That should fill in at least another $25-30 million as Todd Phillips’ film is headed past $325 million. At $934 million worldwide, even without another international dollar,&nbsp;Joker is going to join this list of the Top 50 grossers of all-time.The aforementioned Maleficent: Mistress of Evil earned another $12.1 million this weekend for a total of $82 million domestic. That may be the 15th best total for an October release after 17 days and the 14th best third weekend, but it is still well in the red. It has a chance to reach $100 million domestic but even with another $298 million worldwide (which it has now) it is still about $170 million away from talking profit. United Artists Releasing’s The Addams Family, however, is headed exactly there. With another $8.4 million, the movie has passed $100 million globally and it is all IHOP gravy from there.Neon continues to make the most out of Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 99%). They expanded the film into 461 theaters and it grossed $2.6 million. That puts it in the vicinity of The Favourite, which moved into 441 theaters in weekend four and grossed $2.605 million, as well as Birdman, which was in 460 theaters and made $2.31 million. Both films from Fox Searchlight went on to become Best Picture nominees and grossed $34.36 and $42.34 million, respectively. Parasite’s total stands at $7.5 million.(Photo by Fox Searchlight Pictures)Speaking of which, the Fox specialty division now under Disney has Jojo Rabbit. Taika Waititi’s film was expanded in 256 theaters this weekend and grossed $2.4 million. That is also in the vicinity of Birdman’s third weekend ($2.39 million in 231 theaters) but also a little behind Searchlight’s (500) Days of Summer ($2.77 million in 266 theaters) and A24’s Lady Bird ($2.51 million in 244 theaters.) Those three films grossed between $32-49 million with a pair bolstered by their Oscar campaign. Still, if they can keep up interest and get the film to around $25 million, that will be a solid victory. Its total is currently $4.2 million.Finally there is The Lighthouse (Certified Fresh at 92%) which A24 expanded again into 978 theaters, but fell back from last week’s Top Ten gross of $3.02 million back to $2 million. That’s a gross on par with 2017’s The Beguiled ($2.06 million in 941 theaters) just as it was last week suggesting a final total around that film’s $10.7 million is in the cards for Robert Eggers’ follow-up to The Witch.This Time Last Year: Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;Destroys the CompetitionThree new films led the box office but only one turned into a phenomenon. Bohemian Rhapsody began its run towards the Oscars and history with a $51 million opening, more than the next three films combined. They included the Disney bust, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms ($20.35 million), Tyler Perry’s Nobody’s Fool ($13.74 million) and Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born ($11 million) which passed $165 million this weekend. David Gordon Green’s Halloween also passed $150 million in fifth place. The biggest per-theater-average of the week went to Joel Edgerton’s Boy Erased ($41,411 in 5 theaters). The Top Ten films grossed $129.38 million and averaged 57.2% on the Tomatometer, while this year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $99.3 Million and averaged 51.5% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Heeeere’s Ewan!The Holiday Movie Season is undeniably frontloaded this year, with everyone trying to get their piece of the pie before Frozen II and The Rise of Skywalker dominate. The favorite going into next week is Mike Flanagan’s two-and-a-half-hour adaptation of Stephen King’s sequel to The Shining, Doctor Sleep, with Ewan McGregor. Roland Emmerich is back to blow things up with a real-life war story in Midway. For the romance fans out there, Paul Feig is teaming up Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding in Last Christmas and for families looking for an amuse-bouche before Anna &amp; Elsa, John Cena plays a babysitting fireman in Playing with Fire. Also in limited release is Shia LaBeouf’s acclaimed autobiographical story of his relationship with his troubled father in Honey Boy.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;November&nbsp;1-3Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)  70% – $29 million ($29 million total)Joker (2019)  68% – $13.9 million ($299.6 million total)Maleficent: Mistress of Evil (2019)  39% – $12.18 million ($84.3 million total)Harriet (2019)  73% – $12 million ($12 million total)The Addams Family (2019)  45% – $8.5 million ($85.3 million total)Zombieland: Double Tap (2019)  69% – $7.35 million ($59.3 million total)Countdown (2019)  26% – $5.85 million ($17.77 million total)Black and Blue (2019)  52% – $4.1 million ($15.44 million total)Motherless Brooklyn (2019)  64% – $3.65 million ($3.65 million total)Arctic Dogs (2019)  13% – $3.1 million ($3.1 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

This is not that time. While nobody seriously gave the new Will Smith film a chance to dethrone the comic-book spinoff film,&nbsp;many&nbsp;assumed it could at least beat The&nbsp;Addams Family. It is a story about three stories at the box office this week and none of them involve Jexi. But the story of Joker is shaping up to be a bigger one than anyone truly imagined.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;Keeps on Smiling with Record-Breaking Second Weekend(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Warner Bros.’ Joker&nbsp;showed no real signs of a slow-down this week and set a new record on top of it. Initial estimates on Friday suggested a weekend just under $46 million. As of Sunday morning the projections had jumped to $55 million, which handily bests the $43.1 million that Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity&nbsp;made to have now the best first and second weekends ever for a film opening in October. With $192.73 million total domestically through 10 days it is also well ahead of Venom’s $142.1 million and Gravity’s $122.3 million. That second number is significant since Cuaron’s film is the highest-grossing October film of all time and Joker now finds itself just $78 million behind. Todd Phillips’ film also joins an elite group of movies&nbsp;opening to $80 million or higher and dropping less than 44% in their second week:&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 2002’s&nbsp;Spider-Man, Shrek 2, 2016’s&nbsp;The Jungle Book, Wonder Woman, Inside Out, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, The Passion of the Christ, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.Gravity&nbsp;was a marvel of consistency, never dropping more than 37% through its first seven weeks. Joker&nbsp;fell only 42.8% this weekend and could even challenge Gravity’s record-setting $30 million third weekend. On the all-time 10-day chart, Joker&nbsp;is more than&nbsp;$19 million ahead of Phillips’ own&nbsp;The Hangover Part II&nbsp;($177.87 million), a film which fell 63.5% in weekend two down to $31.38 million and ultimately finished with $254.46 million. Gravity’s final domestic haul was $274 million, but now Joker is in a group of 63 other films with $190 million or more after 10 days (Joker is 62nd), and only five of those films failed to reach $300 million. The lowest-grossing film among them was The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1,&nbsp;with $281.28 million – which would be good enough to secure October’s highest-grossing film ever. Worldwide Joker is up to $351 million.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Addams Family&nbsp;Spooks Up A Strong OpeningUnited Artists Releasing, which has become the roof over the heads of Annapurna, Orion and MGM, had a good weekend, and&nbsp;their animated version of The Addams Family&nbsp;is going to be their highest-grossing film to date. Addams&nbsp;took home a $30.3 million opening weekend, looking to surpass UA’s The Hustle&nbsp;($35.41 million total) in a few days and Annapurna’s Vice&nbsp;($47.83 million) before its 10th&nbsp;day. This may be less than Adam Sandler’s Hotel Transylvania&nbsp;films, which began between $42 million and$49 million each, but is now the third-best October start for an animated film behind Shark Tale&nbsp;($47.6 million) and Puss in Boots&nbsp;($34.07 million). They went on to gross $160 million and $149 million, respectively. Only nine films have ever opened in October to less than $32 million and hit $100 million (Meet the Parents, The Departed, Captain Phillips, Paranormal Activity, Argo, The Ring, Look Who’s Talking, Pulp Fiction,&nbsp;and American Beauty.)Rotten Returns: Gemini Man&nbsp;Continues Troubling October Trend&nbsp;For Gemini&nbsp;Man,&nbsp;$20.5 million is the estimate over the weekend. Paramount is hoping to keep that “2” in there come Monday, given the $138 million budget that Ang Lee’s sci-fi actioner is saddled with (before additional prints and advertising). The only Will Smith film opening to less than $21 million to reach $70 million total domestically was Enemy of the State, back during the 1998 holiday season. That leaves some heavy lifting for the international crowd to turn this into even just a modest failure.Put simply, the second week of October has proven to be a graveyard for new openers in the wake of an anticipated hit. Just last year, Damien Chazelle’s acclaimed First Man ($16 million opening) got swallowed up by&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;and A Star is Born. In 2015, WB got killed with Pan&nbsp;($15.31 million) a week after The Martian. Sony also struggled with&nbsp;the release of Robert Zemeckis’ The Walk&nbsp;the same year. Joker&nbsp;was going to be a hit the moment it was announced. The seven (now eight) highest-grossing films ever in October opened on the first weekend and the only films since 2000 to open in weekend two to gross over $70 million were Argo, Couples Retreat, Captain Phillips, The Accountant,&nbsp;and Kill Bill Vol. 1.&nbsp;Gemini Man&nbsp;is unlikely to join them.The Top Ten and Beyond:&nbsp;Jexi&nbsp;Goes Ignored as Bong Joon-Ho Slays In Three Theaters(Photo by David Moir / © Lionsgate / courtesy Everett Collection)On the same week that Ang Lee is looking at a potential financial disaster, he is also looking at losing a crown as well. Downton Abbey&nbsp;is less than $1 million away from passing Brokeback Mountain&nbsp;as Focus Features’ highest-grossing domestic film ever – though it still needs another $26 million to pass its worldwide total of $178 million. Also about to pass a milestone is STX’s Hustlers,&nbsp;which will become STX’s third $100 million grosser and second this year after The Upside. Bad Moms&nbsp;is their all-time leader with $113.25 million and looks to hold&nbsp;that title.Roadside’s Judy&nbsp;continues to draw its core audience and is now the eighth–highest–grossing film in their history. It expanded from 1,458 to 1,627 theaters this weekend, dropping 29% from its $4.59 million last week to $3.26 million this week for a total of $14.97 million. Cameron Crowe’s Almost Famous&nbsp;was in 1,193 theaters back in 2000 on its second weekend grossing $6.92 million and expanded into 1,635 in weekend three and made $5.57 million going on to gross $32.5 million total. Judy’s number was better than Lionsgate’s/CBS Films’ release of Jexi. The film&nbsp;opened to just $3.1 million in 2,332 theaters, representing Lionsgate’s worst per-theater-average ($1,329) since last year’s animated Early Man&nbsp;($1,279).(Photo by © Neon)Bong Joon-Ho’s critically beloved&nbsp;Parasite got off to a tremendous start in just three theaters. How tremendous you ask? Some $376,264 worth of tickets. How good is that? Well, it is the third-best start ever for a film released in a trio of venues, behind only The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&nbsp;($441,548) and Dreamgirls ($378,950), and it the movie earned the best per-theater-average of 2019 so far ($125,431). Neon now needs to figure out how to capitalize on this given this is their best start for a film released in under 100 theaters. The studio’s highest-grossing film to date was Oscar nominee I, Tonya&nbsp;($29.9 million) and their next two are documentaries: Three Identical Strangers&nbsp;($12.3 million) and this year’s Apollo 11&nbsp;($9.03 million).&nbsp;Parasites hould become just their fourth film to gross over $5 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;and&nbsp;Star&nbsp;Held Strong(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Despite a trio of new titles, the box office was once again dominated by the one-two &nbsp;punch of Venom&nbsp;and A Star is Born, grossing $35 million and $28.4 million, respectively. Edging a narrow victory for third was the critically acclaimed but publicly ignored tale of the moon landing, Damien Chazelle’s First Man,&nbsp;which opened to $16 million, just ahead of the $15.8 million made by Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween. Even more ignored was Drew Goddard’s twisty tale of America’s sins during the 1960s, Bad Times at the El Royale, which opened to just $7.13 million and would never reach $18 million. The top 10 films, nevertheless, grossed a healthy $126.13 million and averaged 59.2% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top 10&nbsp;grossed $132.24 million and averaged 63.6% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Sequels Aim to Dethrone the Clown Prince of CrimeA pair of sequels hopes to hold&nbsp;the top two spots at the box office next week. Angelina Jolie returns in Disney’s&nbsp;Maleficent: Mistress of Evil&nbsp;five years after the original grossed over $241 million domestic and over $758 million worldwide. Then it has been 10 years since Ruben Fleischer made a splash with Zombieland, and&nbsp;the eventual director of&nbsp;Venom returns to his most-praised film to date with&nbsp;Zombieland: Double Tap&nbsp;– with the original cast all returning to reprise their roles and hoping to recapture a bit of that magic. In limited release we also see the launch of Taika Waititi’s&nbsp;Jojo Rabbit&nbsp;(80% on the Tomatometer), Robert Eggers’&nbsp;The Lighthouse&nbsp;(95%), and the bizarro comedy,&nbsp;Greener Grass, created by Jocelyn DeBoer and Dawn Luebbe, which is currently at&nbsp;93% on the Tomatometer.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;October 1–13Joker (2019)  68% – $55 million ($192.73 million total)The Addams Family (2019)  45% –&nbsp;$30.3 million ($30.3 million total)Gemini Man (2019)  26% –&nbsp;$20.5 million ($20.5 million total)Abominable (2019)  82% –&nbsp;$6.17 million ($47.97 million total)Downton Abbey (2019)  84% – $4.9 million ($82.69 million total)Hustlers (2019)  87% – $3.85 million ($98.02 million total)Judy (2019)  81% – &nbsp;$3.26 million ($14.97 million total)It Chapter Two (2019)  62% – $3.23 million ($207.14 million total)Jexi (2019)  19% –&nbsp;$3.1 million ($3.1 million total)Ad Astra (2019)  83% – &nbsp;$1.95million ($47.04 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

The industry mostly avoids opening its&nbsp;choice titles this weekend, tending to dump some of their turkey leftovers into theaters while moviegoers either play catch-up or wait for the next round of big holiday releases. The big stories this week revolve around animated titles: one continuing to climb up the all-time–record charts and a new release that is setting a milestone at the other end of the spectrum.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All 44 Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: 2019 Holiday Box Office PreviewRecommended: Fresher Movies Make More Money at the Box Office: a Tomatometer Deep DiveKing of the Crop:&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;Takes Disney Into Unknown Territory – the first ever $10 Billion Year for a Studio(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Disney’s Frozen II, to no one’s surprise, continued to lead the way with another $34.6 million this weekend. That is the&nbsp;best number 1&nbsp;opening for the first weekend of December since… well, Frozen. The original&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;grossed $34.67 million in its post-Thanksgiving weekend.&nbsp;The all-time first-weekend champion in December is Steven Soderbergh’s 2001 remake of&nbsp;Ocean’s Eleven,&nbsp;which started with $38.1 million.&nbsp;Frozen II’s also number amounted to the 26th-best third weekend in history and its $337.5 million is the 19th-best ever after 17 days of release. Every film that has grossed at least $320 million in that period has passed the $400 million mark. Frozen II is about $2 million ahead of the pace of where The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was in 2013, which finished its run with $424 million, but it is had a third weekend about $8 million higher. A final tally in the $450 million region is still in the cards domestically. Worldwide the film has passed $919 million and it is personally going to get Disney to $10 billion in global ticket sales this week – the first time a studio has ever reached that mark in a calendar year.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Playmobil: The Movie&nbsp;Fails to Crack $1 Million&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2017, Open Road released The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature (13% on the Tomatometer). It currently owns the record for lowest-grossing opening weekend for a film released in over 4,000 theaters ($8.34 million). This year, STX released the animated UglyDolls (27% on the Tomatometer) into 3,652 theaters; it opened to $8.6 million. Open Road became Global Road and quickly dissolved. One of its last releases was to be Playmobil: The Movie (19% on the Tomatometer), which, despite getting some overseas play (to the tune of $12.4 million), was delayed and delayed here in the States. The animated film was eventually picked up by, you guessed it, STX Films, and was finally put into theaters this weekend. It grossed a grand total of $660,000. Not since the December 2008 release of Delgo have we seen a film open on over 2,000 screens and not gross $1 million. Here are the 10 worst openings of that group:Delgo ($511,920 / 2,160 theaters) – $237 per-theater-averagePlaymobil: The Movie ($660,000 / 2,337) – $282 PTAJem and the Holograms ($1.37 million / 2,413) – $570 PTARock the Kasbah ($1.47 / 2,012) – $731 PTACollide ($1.51 / 2,045) – $740 PTAWe Are Your Friends ($1.76 / 2,333) – $758 PTAFriend Request ($2.00 / 2,573) – $778 PTAMorgan ($2.01 / 2,020) – $996 PTAP2 ($2.083 / 2,131) – $978 PTAMajor League: Back to the Minors ($2.087 / 2,322) – $899 PTAThankfully for STX, this is just a pick-up release and it is not responsible for the film’s $75 million budget. Yes: $75 million. That makes it easily one of the biggest losers of the year, but it will live in infamy for years to come on that chart above.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;On Pace With&nbsp;Ferrari;&nbsp;Joker&nbsp;Moves Up the Record Books Again&nbsp;Rian Johnson’s murder mystery, Knives Out, dropped 47% to $14.1 million this week. Its total of $63.49 million continues to keep it on a $100 million pace, but it needs to maintain word-of-mouth as the film is running about neck-and-neck with Ford v Ferrari. James Mangold’s racing drama had $62 million after its first 12 days, but had a second weekend of $15.7 million, besting Knives. Ford increased its haul to $91 million this weekend with another $6.54 million. Its final domestic gross is on pace for somewhere between $102-$113 million, but it will still need around another $75-$80 million internationally to break even. Knives Out has made $124 million worldwide to date and is already easily into profit for Lionsgate.Last week’s other big release, Queen &amp; Slim, is just outpacing the release of Burlesque back in 2010, which had $26.98 million after 12 days of release and had a second weekend gross of $6.13 million. Queen &amp; Slim’s second weekend was $6.53 million and it has grossed $26.89 million domestically so far.&nbsp;Burlesque finished with $39.44 million. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is underperforming a bit, but mostly compared to our hopeful expectations for it. With $43.12 million through its third weekend the film is just outpacing Roland Emmerich’s Midway, which is up to $53.4 million in its fifth weekend – but with only $108 million worldwide it is going to struggle to break even give its budget. The Mr. Rogers drama with Tom Hanks is now looking at $55-$60 million during its run, which is still going to result in a multiple over 4x since its opening weekend, which is better than any November wide release this year. If this comes to pass it will also be only the fourth film of 2019 to open on a Friday and gross more than four times its opening weekend after The Upside, Yesterday, and Overcomer.Todd Haynes’ Dark Waters with Mark Ruffalo expanded into wide release this week (94-to-2,012 theaters) and grossed $4.1 million, which is not a particularly strong number. Just last year Focus moved the RBG biopic, On the Basis of Sex, from 112-to-1,923 theaters in its third weekend and it grossed $6.07 million. That is about the most favorable comparison we can make for the environmental drama – though it is one to watch, as its Audience Score is a very high 96%.&nbsp;Its $4.1 million is&nbsp;certainly a better number than Amazon’s The Aeronauts put up this weekend. In 50 theaters the hot air balloon weather adventure grossed just $30,000. That is worse than Noah Hawley’s Lucy in the Sky, which opened to $54,058 in 37 theaters this October. NEON’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire was the big per-theater-average winner this week, grossing $67,105 in just two theaters. That is the 16th-best PTA of 2019. The top 20 PTAs of the year have each grossed at least $2 million. Parasite meanwhile is now NEON’s second-highest grossing movie after I, Tonya,&nbsp;with $19.34 million. Finally, Joker has passed this year’s Aladdin for 34th&nbsp;place on the all-time chart with $1.051 billion.This Time Last Year: A Re-Release Over-performs as the top 10 Remains Unchanged(Photo by Courtesy Everett Collection)The big new release of the weekend was actually a re-release. Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List was put back into 1,029 theaters for its 25th&nbsp;anniversary, and while it did not make the top 10, it did gross $566,750 over the weekend. Beyond that it was business as usual as the same 10 films led the way with the top six films all remaining in the same spots. Ralph Breaks the Internet led for a third straight week with $16.25 million. Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch was not far behind with $15.03 million. Creed II dropped to $9.9 million in third place. The top 10 films of the week grossed just $73.87 million and averaged the same 61.4% on the Tomatometer as the week prior. This year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $79.04 million and averaged 72.1% with critics.On the Vine:&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;Is Back, Along with a Slew of Awards Hopefuls(Photo by Frank Masi /© Columbia Pictures)Theaters get crowded again next week with some major new releases hoping for bucks, awards, or even both. Leading the crowd in the bucks department will no doubt be Jumanji: The Next Level, which brings back the gang from the smash 2017 hit and is hoping to earn a large piece of the holiday box office. Clint Eastwood had a solid December hit last year with The Mule, and now turns to another true-crime tale with Richard Jewell (88% on the Tomatometer), about the 2006 bombing at the Atlanta Olympics and the innocent man who was accused of it. Then Universal is taking another stab at horror for the holidays with a second remake of Bob Clark’s Black Christmas. But wait, we’re not nearly done. Opening in limited release is Jay Roach’s Bombshell, about the sexual harassment scandal at Fox News. Adam Sandler teams up with the Safdie Brothers for the anxiety-raising Uncut Gems (96% on the Tomatometer), for which many are touting Sandler for an Oscar nomination. Then there is Terrence Malick’s WWII drama, A Hidden Life (80% on the Tomatometer), about a conscientious Nazi objector, and Kristen Stewart steps into the role of Jean Severg in&nbsp;Seberg (46%),&nbsp;which details how investigations into the actress’s activism destroyed her life.The Full Top 10: December 6-8Frozen II (2019)  78% – $34.67 million ($337.6 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $14.15 million ($63.49 million total)Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92% – $6.54 million ($91.11 million total)Queen &amp; Slim (2019)  83% – $6.53 million ($26.89 million total)A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)  95% – $5.2 million ($43.12 million total)Dark Waters (2019)  89% – $4.1 million ($5.28 million total)21 Bridges (2019)  53% – $2.88 million ($23.93 million total)Playing with Fire (2019)  23% – $2 million ($41.98 million total)Midway (2019)  41% – $1.94 million ($53.4 million total)Joker (2019)  68% – $1.04 million ($332.14 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

But it was Angelina Jolie’s Maleficent that was able to put the Joker in his place — second place, that is, as Joaquin Phoenix’s interpretation of the Clown Prince of Crime heads much quicker than anyone thought for the all-time October record. The numbers were solid this weekend on the surface, making for a nice October weekend, but profit for the newcomers is still up in the air.Queen of the Crop: Joker Bows Down to&nbsp;Maleficent&nbsp;Debbie DayMaleficent: Mistress of Evil took the top spot this weekend with $36 million, but won’t continue Disney’s unprecedented streak of releasing four billion-dollar films in a row. The $185 million–budgeted film joins a number of sequels in 2019 that have had significant drop-offs from their predecessors. Seven of them have fallen off 50 percent or higher from the previous film and they include:The Angry Birds Movie 2 (-72.9 percent), Happy Death Day 2U (-63.5 percent), Shaft (-59 percent), A Dog’s Journey (-55.9 percent), The Secret Life of Pets 2 (-55.3 percent), The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (-50.6 percent), and Dark Phoenix (-50.1 percent).The Angry Birds Movie 2 actually opened on a Tuesday, but even if you added the $5.7 million it made from Tuesday to Thursday, it would still have opened to 50 percent lower than the $38.1 million of the original. Disney’s Maleficent opened to $69.43 million back in the summer of 2014. The $36 million Mistress of Evil grossed this weekend represents a 48.2 percent drop, putting it between Godzilla: King of the Monsters (-48.7 percent) and Men In Black International (-45 percent) — the latter more of a spin-off than direct sequel — for the ninth-worst drop of the year among sequels or follow-ups. Globally the film is up to $153 million, but it is going to need well over $500 million total to break even. The only sequels this year to reach the total are the ones you would expect: Avengers: Endgame, Toy Story 4, Spider-Man: Far From Home, and How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.Top 10 and Beyond: Zombieland: Double Tap Debuts to $26.7 Million(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Zombieland: Double Tap did get off to a nice start for Sony. The original opened to $24.73 million in 2009 and given that would equate to about $29.6 million 10 years later, a $26.7 million opening for the sequel still is not too bad. The budget did increase from $23 million to $42 million, however, so this one also has its work cut out for it. Ruben Fleischer’s debut managed to score $75.5 million domestically but just $102.3 million total worldwide. Some estimates suggested that film even missed its profit margin due to extensive advertising costs. Like most of the top films this week, including phenomenon Joker, Zombieland: Double Tap could easily benefit from the upcoming pre-Halloween weekend.Grossing $29.2 million in its third weekend, Joker will pass Gravity to become the all-time champion of October. Joker’s third weekend is a far greater than any of the films comparative to its $246 million 17-day total, such as Man of Steel, Thor: Ragnarok, and the first parts of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn&nbsp;and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Those films grossed between $16.5 million and $21.6 million in weekend three. For Joker, $300 million now seems very likely, and the film’s global total stands at over $737 million, which makes Joker far and away Warner Bros.’ biggest hit of the year and one of the year’s biggest successes. Joker will become the seventh-highest grossing film worldwide by next weekend.Last week’s The Addams Family dropped 47 percent to $16.1 million, but its 10-day total of $56.81 million has not only driven ahead of what Abominable has made in four weeks ($53.91 million), but ahead of the pace of Where the Wild Things Are, which topped out at $77.3 million. The $40 million–budgeted film should cross $80 million with no problem and get a decent stay next week with parents looking for some spooky family-oriented entertainment to take their kids to. Though it will need to cross $100 million globally to turn a profit, The Addams Family is in much better shape than Paramount and Ang Lee’s $138-million budgeted Gemini Man, which fell 58.6% this weekend to $8.5 million. It is only at $118 million worldwide.In milestone news, Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers passed the $100 million mark this week. Downton Abbey became Focus’ all-time domestic grosser, passing Brokeback Mountain, and Roadside’s Judy is now their fifth highest-grossing film ever with designs on passing The Peanut Butter Falcon this week and maybe even Mud’s $21.5 million for third place.Three big limited-release stories are brewing right now for three filmmakers who have generated significant buzz on the festival circuit. A24 released Robert Eggers’ follow-up to The Witch in eight theaters this weekend. The Lighthouse (93% on the Tomatometer) grossed $419,000 in those eight theaters; the third-best total ever for a launch in that number of theaters behind The Big Short ($705,527) and Memoirs of a Geisha ($682,504) and ahead of Match Point ($398,593) and Dead Poets Society ($340,456). A24 will reportedly expand it into 500 theaters, similar to the strategy of last year’s Blindspotting, which went from 11 theaters (opening to $338,999) and moving to 523 theaters (where it grossed $1.28 million). The Lighthouse is one to watch next weekend.Taika Waititi’s Jojo Rabbit (77% at RT) made $350,000 this weekend in just five theaters. That is the 12th-best opening in as many theaters ever, behind La La Land ($881,104), The Master ($736,311), Brokeback Mountain ($547,425), The Big Sick ($421,577), Zero Dark Thirty ($417,150), Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride ($388,166), Boyhood ($387,618), Syriana ($374,502),and Punch-Drunk Love ($367,203) as well as Woody Allen’s To Rome With Love ($361,359) and Café Society ($359.289). Jojo’s $70,000 per-theater-average is the fourth-best of 2019 behind Avengers: Endgame ($76,601), The Farewell ($88,916) and Bong-Joon Ho’s Parasite ($128,072), which is quite the story.Parasite (99% Tomatometer score) moved into 33 theaters this weekend (up 30 from last week) and grossed another $1.2 million, a haul that puts it into some big-league conversation. Lady Bird went from four to 37 theaters in its second week and grossed $1.19 million. Boyhood went five to 34 ($1.17 million), The Farewell four to 35 ($1.14 million), and The Favourite four to 34 ($1.07 million). Parasite in 33 theaters even beat the per-theater averages of Juno ( $1.42 million in 40 theaters) and The Royal Tenenbaums ($1.26 million in 40 theaters) in their second weekends of limited release. Parasite has grossed $1.8 million to date, and Neon needs to keep spreading the word.This Time Last Year: Halloween Cast a Spell Over Moviegoers(Photo by Ryan Green /Universal Pictures)David Gordon Green’s Halloween fell just a few million shy of besting Venom’s all-time opening record; nevertheless its $76.2 million (now third after Joker) handily led the box office. A Star Is Born finally eclipsed Venom in their third weekends outgrossing the Marvel villain $19.05 to $18.04 million. In limited release, Jonah Hill’s Mid90s had the top per-theater average of the weekend ($64,539) with $258,157 in four theaters. Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me with eventual Oscar nominees, Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant, posted a $32,302 PTA with $161,510 in five theaters. The $155.99 million made by the Top 10 films was the second biggest weekend ever in October, and they averaged 70.1% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10 grossed $128.67 million and averaged 64.7% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine:&nbsp;Benedict Cumberbatch Leads The Current WarThe weekend before Halloween offers different kinds of horror on what looks to be a pretty slow one for the newbies. STX offers the Ring-like Countdown about a killer app that predicts when someone is going to die. Racial angles are explored between corrupt and righteous police officers in Black and Blue with Naomie Harris and Frank Grillo.

More on that connection later. For now, the domestic numbers may not be spectacular for Universal, but they did manage to grab box office attention for a week by taking the #1 slot this weekend. Big drops abound for last week’s releases, even as many in the top 10 seek some personal milestones.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Abominable Wins with Lowest September Debut Since 2013(Photo by Universal Pictures)Abominable was indeed the winner this weekend with a $19.5 million start. That is the lowest debut for a September release since the weekend of Sept. 6-8, 2013, when Riddick began with $19.03 million. This month has always been a better one for animated films than August has ever been with the first two Hotel Transylvanias and the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs films opening between $30-49 million for the best four animated openings ever. But Abominable’s start falls behind Open Season, Storks, and last year’s Smallfoot. History has shown that an animated opening over $16 million can still get you over $50 million (as both The Boxtrolls and Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole can attest) but that is not great for a $75 million production like Abominable. Even Smallfoot (which cost $80 million) grossed $83.2 million domestic and another $130 million overseas, and it still came up in the red. Abominable has grossed a total of $31 million so far.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Downton Abbey and&nbsp;Rambo: Last Blood Drop Significantly,&nbsp;Judy Aims for an OscarLast week’s historic #1 for Focus Features, Downton Abbey, fell 57% this weekend to second place with $13.2 million. No worries, though, as it now has the 17th best September total ever after 10 days with $58.5 million and finds itself ahead of both The Maze Runner and Eagle Eye, which grossed $102.42 &amp; $101.44 million, respectively. We’ll see if it can maintain that pace through next weekend, but it is looking good that it will become Focus’ all-time highest domestic grosser. It is over $107 million worldwide as well.Also making a run for the $100 million finish line is Hustlers, which moved back up to third place with $11.4 million. That is higher than the $9.7 million that The Equalizer grossed in its third weekend, which brought its 17-day total to $79.8 million. Hustlers is currently at $80.6 million and The Equalizer finished with $101.5 million. Approaching the $200 million line is It: Chapter Two which held on to fourth place with $10.4 million. It has grossed over $417 million worldwide.(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Last week’s other big releases are not doing as well with their drops. James Gray’s Ad Astra fell 47% to $10.1 million, putting it squarely between The Lego Ninjago Movie&nbsp;and Resident Evil: Retribution after ten days. That suggests a final gross someone in the vicinity of $50-55 million. The $80-100 million budgeted film has grossed $89 million worldwide to date. Then, over to Sylvester Stallone and Rambo: Last Blood, which fell even further at 55%, putting its total at $33.1 million. That puts the macho man just ahead of female-led hits Easy A and A Simple Favor, though Rambo’s second weekend is more than $2 million behind nearly both of them, meaning their $58 &amp; $53 million grosses are out of reach. To come full circle, it is just a couple million ahead of Riddick which, like the fourth Rambo film, finished between $42-43 million.Roadside Attractions is having a pretty solid weekend themselves. First off they debuted Renee Zellweger in Judy in the first step to securing that Oscar nomination for her. In 461 theaters, the film finished in 7th place with $3 million. Why is that a significant number? Well, only four other films since 2000 have opened between 400-499 theaters and grossed that much. Among those four were Baahubali 2: The Conclusion ($10.43 million), Closer ($7.7), Sicko ($4.5) and No Manches Frida 2 ($3.8). Only the latter grossed less than $20 million, so this suggests promise for Judy‘s&nbsp;eventual expansion and becoming one of Roadside’s biggest grossers to date. That would make two of their films entering their all-time top five in 2019, along with The Peanut Butter Falcon, which, in a real upset, has now won the battle between the festival darlings of the summer. With $18 million in the bank, it has now surpassed A24’s The Farewell from Sundance ($17.4 million) as the highest grossing fest acquisition.This Time Last Year: Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish Laugh It up in&nbsp;Night School(Photo by Eli Joshua Ade/Universal Pictures)Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish defeated the animated yeti for the top spot as Night School grossed $27.25 million to Smallfoot’s $23.04 million, even if the latter would go on to outgross the former. Lionsgate’s Hell Fest opened a month for Halloween and paid the price with just a $5.13 million start. Funimation’s anime My Hero Academia: Two Heroes was just in 508 theaters but still opened in 11th place with $1.38 million. While all the anticipation is on Greta Gerwig’s adaptation this holiday, there was nevertheless a 2018 version of Little Women, which opened to just $705,063 in 643 theaters. Night School represented 29.58% of the Top Ten gross of $92.14 million though the films averaged just 51.8% with critics. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $84.17 Million and averaged 68.2%.On the Vine:&nbsp;Joker Poised to Generate Biggest October Opening EverThe month of October is preparing itself for awards talk, a big box office splash, and controversy all right out of the gate with Todd Phillips’ Joker. The film has been somewhat divisive for critics who saw it at festivals, before and after it won the Golden Lion prize from Venice. (Its score has dropped to 77% since Toronto and could get lower.) Nevertheless, it&nbsp;has led to speculation that Joaquin Phoenix could become the second actor to win an Oscar for playing the iconic Batman villain. In the meantime, it is poised to have the biggest October opening ever, passing last year’s iconic villain reboots in Venom and Halloween. Also on tap in limited release is Natalie Portman in Lucy in the Sky, based loosely on the story of astronaut Lisa Nowak and her obsessive affair with a fellow NASA colleague. Critics from Toronto were not thrilled with Noah Hawley’s version of the story, as it currently sits at 20% on the Tomatometer. Then Pedro Almodovar is back with his introspective tale, Pain and Glory, starring Antonio Banderas. Critics are much more enthusiastic for this, as it currently registers a 95%.The Full Top 10: September 27–29Abominable (2019)  82% – $20.85 million ($20.85 million total)Downton Abbey (2019)  84% – $14.5 million ($58.5 million total)Hustlers (2019)  87% – $11.47 million ($80.63 million total)It Chapter Two (2019)  62% – $10.4 million ($193.91 million total)Ad Astra (2019)  83% – $10.14 million ($35.52 million total)Rambo: Last Blood (2019)  26% – $8.57 million ($33.15 million total)Judy (2019)  81% – $3.09 million ($3.09 million total)Good Boys (2019)  80%&nbsp;– $2.01 million ($80.37 million total)The Lion King (2019)  52% – $1.6 million ($540.02 million total)Angel Has Fallen (2019)  38%&nbsp;– $1.53 million ($67.18 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Thumbnail image by&nbsp;Liam Daniel / © Focus Features&nbsp;Like this?

Disney’s Frozen II bested the five-day holiday record set by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire ($109.93 million) back in 2013. Even more impressive that: Anna, Elsa, and Olaf did it in the film’s second weekend, and the stage is set for the animated film to best even more numbers in the coming weeks.Recommended: The 50 Highest-Grossing Movies of All TimeRecommended: All 44 Billion-Dollar Movies, Ranked by TomatometerRecommended: 2019 Holiday Box Office PreviewKing&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;Soaring to $1 Billion Club&nbsp;To no one’s surprise, Frozen II led the Thanksgiving holiday with a five-day haul of $126.3 million, with $85.3 million of that coming over the weekend. That is the eighth-best second weekend of all time, wedged between Disney’s 2017 Beauty and the Beast ($90.4 million) and, well, Disney’s Incredibles 2 ($80.34 million). Overall, the film has grossed $287.6 million in 10 days, which is the 15th-best ever for 10 days, between Captain America: Civil War ($295.96 million) and The Dark Knight Rises ($287.11 million). It is the 25th&nbsp;film to have grossed over $250 million&nbsp;in its first 10 days of release. Only three of those films (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, Furious 7, and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) failed to reach $400 million total. Amongst the 12 other films to have $75 million-plus second weekends, only one of them (Avengers: Age of Ultron) failed to reach $500 million total. However, only two of those movies opened in the holiday season (Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avatar).&nbsp;Frozen II has already amassed another $451 million worldwide for a total of $738 million as it marches to become another&nbsp;$1 billion&nbsp;grosser for Disney.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;Shows Original Films Can Still Murder At the Box Office&nbsp;It wasn’t a total surprise for us at RT – we had placed it in the top 5 holiday earners in our winter box office preview – but Rian Johnson’s Knives Out surpassed all tracking service expectations by earning $41.7 million since opening Wednesday. The $27.7 million it earned over the weekend puts it amongst the top 20 Thanksgiving holiday weekends ever – and it is just the fifth film not rated “G” or “PG” to be on that list. Some 61 films have opened in November and grossed over $40 million in their first five days; only four (Pokemon: The First Movie, Dumb and Dumber To, The Muppets, and Unbreakable) failed to reach at least $100 million total. That means Knives Out&nbsp;could&nbsp;join Hustlers, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Us as the only films not based on a previous film or property to reach that milestone in 2019.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Queen and Slim&nbsp;Gets a Solid Start, Word-of-Mouth Boosts&nbsp;Beautiful Day(Photo by © Universal)It was back and forth over the holiday for third place,&nbsp;but James Mangold’s Ford v Ferrari won the race with $13.22 million over the weekend and $18.99 million for the five days. No film opening in November to have grossed at least $74 million in 17 days has failed to reach $100 million. Ford v Ferrari&nbsp;currently stands at $81 million, but its magic number is still going to be around $250 million globally to find its way into profit. With just over $143 million internationally, it is still less than 60% of the way there.Marielle Heller’s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood got the word-of-mouth bump over the holiday we were expecting. It is now outpacing Roland Emmerich’s Midway, which just passed the $50 million mark this weekend. Gothika, Starship Troopers, and The Nutcracker and the Four Realms are the only November films to have $34 million after 10 days and not finish with at least $60 million. Midway is looking to join that list given its third weekend ($3.95 million) was less than what those three films earned in their third weekend. Meanwhile, the Mr. Rogers film, which stands at just over $34 million to date, had a better second weekend ($11.8 million) than any live-action film in November to have $37 million or less by day 10 of wide release (aside from Jingle All the Way). This suggests that a final gross over $70 million is still very possible for the $25 million-budgeted film.The other newbie of the week was Melina Matsoukas’s Certified Fresh&nbsp;Queen &amp; Slim, which grossed $11.7 million over the weekend and $15.8 million over the full holiday. That is $800,000 more than what Widows had last year in its first five days before ultimately finishing with $42 million. Last week’s cop thriller, 21 Bridges, is up to just $19.45 million after 10 days, which puts it in After the Sunset/Delivery Man territory. Its second weekend ($5.82 million) was about $1 million less than the Vince Vaughn comedy and 21 Bridges may be up at around just $28-$30 million when it leaves theaters. Finally, Todd Phillips’ Joker spent its eighth&nbsp;straight week in the top 10. It has passed $330 million domestic, $1.048 billion worldwide, and is Warner Bros.’ fourth-highest grossing film of all time. Joker also passed Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides to become the 35th&nbsp;highest-grossing film of all time.This Time Last Year: Another&nbsp;Possession&nbsp;Could Not Scare&nbsp;Ralph&nbsp;From Top Spot(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)It was the weekend after Thanksgiving so grosses were down a bit, but still a lot of people were going to the movies. The only major new release was The Possession of Hannah Grace, which opened in seventh place&nbsp;with $6.4 million. Ralph Breaks the Internet was again on top with $25.56 million, passing the $100 million mark. The Grinch moved up to second with $17.92 million, enough to pass the $200 million line. Creed II fell back to third with $16.63 million and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald had the steepest fall in the&nbsp;top 10 (61.3%) to $11.36 million. The top 10&nbsp;films grossed a total of $106.19 million and averaged 61.4% on the Tomatometer; this year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $166.98 million over the weekend and averaged 67.3% with critics.On the Vine: A Balloon Adventure and an Acclaimed Romance Set to Light Up Indie Box OfficeThe weekend after Thanksgiving is usually a dead zone for new releases and indeed only one film is going wide and that is the oft-delayed animated film from STX, Playmobil: The Movie. The $75 million production was moved from January to April to August and then into December. It has grossed just $12.4 million in international waters to date, and may have trouble matching that here. In limited release, try to catch The Aeronauts on the biggest screen possible as it is not often you get a chance for a hot air balloon adventure with Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne – especially one that’s Certified fesh at 84% on the Tomatometer to date. Even&nbsp;more acclaimed&nbsp;is the 98%-rated Portrait of a Lady On Fire. The beloved French romance was a hit at Cannes this year, winning Best Screenplay, and it is also nominated for Best International Film at the&nbsp;2020 Independent Spirit Awards.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;November 29-December 1Frozen II (2019)  78% – $85.25 million ($287.57 million total)Knives Out (2019)  97% – $27.02 million ($41.7 million total)Ford v Ferrari (2019)  92% – $13.22 million ($81 million total)A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019)  95% – $11.8 million ($34.31 million total)Queen &amp; Slim (2019)  83% – $11.7 million ($15.81 million total)21 Bridges (2019)  53% – $5.82 million ($19.46 million total)Playing with Fire (2019)  23% – $4.2 million ($139.2 million total)Midway (2019)  41% – $3.96 million ($50.28 million total)Joker (2019)  68% – $1.98 million ($330.6 million total)Last Christmas (2019)  46% – $1.9 million ($31.66 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Plus, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and 21 Bridges open modestly in the weekend of November 22-24.by Erik Childress | November 24, 2019 |  CommentsThe No. 1 films for the past five weeks going back to the opening of Maleficent: Mistress of Evil have grossed a total of $97 million. This weekend, Disney’s Frozen II surpassed that number. Tracking services went on the defensive after a few weeks of high-end estimates crashed and burned. So they went with a safe $100 million projection for a sequel to the highest-grossing Disney animated film of all-time globally. Audiences responded, “Who are you kidding?”King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Frozen II&nbsp;Scores Third-Best Animated Opening of All TimeThursday night, Frozen II had the fourth-best preview for an animated film ever behind Incredibles 2 ($18.5 million), Toy Story 4 ($12 million), and Finding Dory ($9.2 million). Take into account that those were all summer releases with no school Friday morning and Frozen II’s $8.5 million Thursday is even more impressive. No matter what the season its $127 million opening weekend is mightily impressive. That is the third-best animated opening of all time behind summer releases Incredibles 2 and Finding Dory. The previous best non-summer animated opening was Disney’s Zootopia with $75.1 million and the holiday season champion was the November release of The Incredibles ($70.5 million) back in 2004. Five of the eight animated films to open over $100 million went on to gross over $400 million, a feat 2013’s original Frozen managed to accomplish after starting with just $67.4 million (now the fourth-best November opening ever after last year’s The Grinch). Frozen II’s global haul for the weekend was $350 million as it begins its billion-dollar box office run.Rotten Returns: Cop Thriller&nbsp;21 Bridges&nbsp;Opens with $9.2 MillionProfit may be well out of its reach for director Brian Kirk’s 21 Bridges. STX pushed the cop thriller with Chadwick Boseman out of the summer into September, and then moved it away from their big success, Hustlers, into the November slot where it opened with $9.2 million. Movies this month opening between $8.8 million–$9.8 million have averaged a final gross of $30.1 million and have never grossed higher than Set It Off’s $36.5 million. That is not good news for the $33 million production. Only four STX films have grossed over $50 million outside of the U.S. and Canada in its five-year history (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, The Foreigner, Bad Moms, and A Bad Moms Christmas). The studio boasted two $100 million grossers in Hustlers and The Upside this year, but no other film has reached $30 million. Countdown reached $25 million this weekend.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood&nbsp;Opens Modestly, Primed for Holiday GrowthTom Hanks as Mr. Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood was not quite the immediate audience grabber that some of us were thinking it would be, but many still hope it will be a slow burn, gaining audiences over the holiday. Though a $13.5 million start does not give it much chance to be the success many believed it could be. The average gross for a film opening between $12 million–$14 million in November is just $41.18 million with the high-end achieved by Three Men and a Little Lady ($71.6 million.) Only four other films this month in that range grossed over $59 million: Jingle All the Way, Scrooged, Bad Santa, and My Girl. The sixth-highest grosser was Men of Honor with $48.8 million, and Arthur Christmas (3,376) was the only film of the 30 on this list to open in more theaters than Neighborhood (3,235).Last week’s No. 1, Ford v Ferrari dropped nearly 50 percent with $16 million this week, bringing its total up to just under $58 million after 10 days of release, roughly the same amount that Dumb and Dumber To reached in 2014, though it only made $14.1 million in its second go-round. Todd Phillips’ Due Date earned about $1.1 million more by this same point, made about $600,000 less than FvF in weekend two, and barely surpassed $100 million domestically. A $100 million goal means, however, that FvF will need an international haul of $150 million to break even between production and advertising costs. It currently stands at $45.8 million. Meanwhile, Phillips’ Joker continues to climb the all-time worldwide chart with almost $327 million domestic and $708 million international for a total of $1.036 billion, passing Despicable Me 3 for 36th place overall.A large group of disappointments and outright failures unfortunately make up the rest of the Top 10. At $43.2 million after 17 days, Roland Emmerich’s Midway has grossed less than last year’s Disney failure&nbsp;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, which finished with just $54.8 million. Even with international assistance, Midway still has not reached $100 million, which is what its production alone cost and making it one of the biggest losers of 2019. Playing with Fire and Last Christmas are still on pace for what we reported last week around $40 million and $36 million, respectively. And if anyone on their holiday box office card had The Good Liar making a run to outgross Charlie’s Angels, you have an appointment in Vegas. The Helen Mirren–Ian McKellen thriller is not exactly lighting things up with $11.7 million total to date, but it did stay steady in 7th place, while the Angels dropped back to 9th place with just $13.9 million total and is unlikely to hit even $20 million. Midway is still going to take a bigger hit on the books than Elizabeth Banks’ reboot or Mike Flanagan’s Doctor Sleep, which fell out of the Top 10 in its third weekend with just $28 million to date, so keep that in perspective.Todd Haynes’ Dark Waters made a decent splash with $110,000 in four theaters. That amounts to the 17th-best per-theater-average of the year and the 7th-best of launches in four theaters. Also in limited release, Amazon’s Honey Boy expanded into 44 theaters this weekend and grossed $269,000. That is a bit better than Whiplash moving into 46 theaters in its third week and grossing $248,313, but is less than Anamolisa grossed going from 17-to-37 theaters ($305,364) and ultimately finished with $2.61 million. Honey Boy has made $939,677. Both Jojo Rabbit and Parasite lost screens for the first time in their runs. They have grossed $16.1 and $16.5 million, respectively. Lulu Wang’s The Farewell still leads all releases in 2019 that did not expand to over 1,000 theaters with $17.6 million. Both films are in position to pass it.This Time Last Year: Sequel Fever Took Hold with&nbsp;Ralph Breaks the Internet, Creed II, and&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of GrindelwaldIt was the Thanksgiving holiday and three sequels led the five-day stretch starting with the one-two punch of Ralph Breaks the Internet ($84. 8 million) and Creed II ($56 million). Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald finished third with $42.4 million and crossed the $100 million mark to $116.6 million; though the film would go on to make only another $43 million total. The Grinch was right behind in fourth with $42.1 million, and Bohemian Rhapsody may have fallen back to fifth with $19.5 million, but it also crossed the $150 million line. One of the biggest bombs of the year in Lions Gate’s Robin Hood grossed a paltry $14.3 million and would eventually squeeze out just over $30 million. From Friday-to-Sunday the box office grossed a total of $203.8 million. Add in Wednesday and Turkey Day and the 5-day total rose to $298.6 million, the largest ever for the holiday. The Top 10 films also averaged 64.8% on the Tomatometer compared to this year’s Top 10, which averaged 60.5% with critics. This week’s pre-Thanksgiving total amounted to $187.52 Million.On the Vine:&nbsp;Knives Out&nbsp;for ThanksgivingRian Johnson introduces a little mystery into the holiday season with the critically acclaimed Knives Out. At 97% on the Tomatometer, the film is the best-reviewed title to date to come out of the fall festival circuit and is expected to become one of the big crowd-pleasers to close out 2019. It grossed $2 million at 7 p.m. preview screenings on Friday and Saturday in 936 venues. Melina Matsoukas and Lena Waithe’s outlaw justice road movie Queen &amp; Slim, starring Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie-Turner Smith, is also doing well early with critics.

Even with a 60 percent drop, the animated film was still able to haul in $78 million. That is the ninth-best second weekend of all time, and with $353 million in the bank it is good enough for eighth place after ten days of release. Incredibles 2 last year had $349.7 million and the live-action Beauty and the Beast was at $319 million in 2017. They now move down to ninth and tenth all-time. All signs right now suggest Jon Favreau’s redo is headed north of $600 million domestic. It is over $962 million worldwide to date and already 47th on the all-time chart.Once Upon a Time…Generally, films about Hollywood and the industry do not draw the same reactions from the public as they do from critics and people in the know. Comedies such as Tropic Thunder, Get Shorty, and Bowfinger have done well enough, but more inside baseball stuff about the business, like Ed Wood and Hail, Caesar!, have not exactly attracted major interest. But throw in two of the most recognizable names in front of the camera and a third behind it and all of a sudden you have Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which earned the biggest opening of Quentin Tarantino’s career with $40.35 million. Better even than his last go-round with Brad Pitt in August 2009 when Inglourious Basterds opened to $38.05 million. However, it may be the other star that is the true secret sauce.Leonardo DiCaprio is as safe a bet these days in casting original projects. Directors like Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan help, but the Oscar winner also elevated Baz Luhrmann and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu to the biggest successes of their careers as well. DiCaprio’s last four films (including his supporting turn in Django Unchained) have grossed $116 million or higher. Go back a full decade to 2010 and you can make the streak six out of seven (with Clint Eastwood’s J. Edgar being the sole outlier with just $37.3 million total). Inception ($62.7 million), The Great Gatsby ($50 million), and Shutter Island ($41 million) all opened higher, but that just means that Once Upon a Time… is the fourth-best opener of DiCaprio’s career, just as it is Pitt’s. World War Z ($66.4 million), Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith ($50.3 million), and Troy ($46.8 million) all opened higher. Pitt has had ten $100 million grossers as either a lead or co-lead. If you count Django, then DiCaprio has had ten as well. An opening like this certainly gives both actors a chance to take those numbers to 11.The Top Ten And Beyond(Photo by Sony Pictures)Spider-Man: Far From Home crossed the billion-dollar line worldwide this week; it is the first Spidey film to do so. With $344 million after 27 days, the film overall is still right in line with $400 million grosser The Hunger Games and still a bit ahead of 2002’s Spider-Man. However, its fourth weekend of $12.2 million is well behind the respective $21 million and $28.5 million fourth weekends of those films, so it is fading a bit faster. Transformers: Dark of the Moon posted a $12 million fourth weekend as well, and finished with $352 million. Far From Home is still about $15 million ahead of that film’s place and is likely headed somewhere in the vicinity of Spider-Man 2’s $373 million. Worldwide it is currently the 32nd-best earner of all time and seems on track to pass Skyfall’s $1.108 billion and become Sony’s highest-grossing film ever.Toy Story 4 is going to cross $400 million domestic next weekend, and after 38 days is the 18th-highest grosser ever. Its $9.8 million sixth weekend is better than 11 of the top 20 films on that list, and looks ready to finish north of $425 million. That will help get the film over a billion as it currently stands as the 56th-highest-grossing film ever worldwide. Ahead of it at the moment, globally, is Disney’s live-action Aladdin, which, with $1.009 billion in the bank, is the 39th-highest-grosser ever.Finally, in limited release news, Lulu Wang’s The Farewell — still brandishing a perfect 100% on the Tomatometer — made it into the Top Ten this weekend. It is the first film not in wide release to hit the top ten since the weekend of Mar. 22-24 when No Manches Frida 2 grossed $1.77 million in 472 theaters. The Farewell is only in 135 theaters nationwide and grossed $1.55 million this weekend. How does that stack up to similar releases? That is better than A24’s Eighth Grade did last summer when it expanded to 158 theaters in weekend three and grossed $1.26 million. When Revolutionary Road jumped to the same number of theaters in its third weekend, it grossed $1.42 million that week and went on to gross $22.91 million total. Among a sample of some of the more successful indie releases between 125-150 theaters at this point, The Farewell is not quite up to the heights of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Midnight In Paris, but with $3.6 million after 17 days it is ahead of all the rest of them, including such notable titles as There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights, and Thank You For Smoking. Next weekend’s nationwide expansion will paint a larger picture.This Time Last Year(Photo by © Paramount)It was Tom Cruise and Mission: Impossible – Fallout handily leading the way with a $61.23 million opening. That was more than the next five films in the top ten combined, including the disappointing bow for Teen Titans Go! To The Movies, which only began with $10.41 million. Both films were very well-liked with critics, scoring 97% and 91%, respectively. Last year’s entire Top Ten averaged 71% on the Tomatometer and the Top Ten grossed $143.33 million; just the 42nd-best among July weekends since 1990. This year’s Top Ten averaged 73.7% on the Tomatometer and grossed a total of $152.52 million, only the 34th best.On the Vine: Hobbs &amp; Shaw Hopes For Spinoff SuccessFor the third week in a row Hollywood is delivering just a single new wide release into theaters and it could be another big one. Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw hopes to explode next week after the previous three films in the franchise opened to $97 million or higher. Will Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham’s partnership draw the loyal fanbase to similar numbers? Also next week, A24 expands Lulu Wang’s The Farewell nationwide. And look for other well-received Sundance fare in limited release, including Luce (95%) with Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, and Kelvin Harrison Jr., as well as Jennifer Kent’s follow-up to The Babadook, the revenge drama The Nightingale (82%).The Full Top 10:&nbsp;Jul 26-28The Lion King (2019)  52% – $75.52 million ($350.77 million total)Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85% – $40.35 million ($40.35 million total)Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)  90% – $12.20 million ($344.45 million total)Toy Story 4 (2019)  97% – $9.87 million ($395.62&nbsp;million total)Crawl (2019)  84% – $4.00 million ($31.46 million total)Yesterday (2019)  63% – $3.00 million ($63.34 million total)Aladdin (2019)  57% – $2.78 million ($345.92 million total)Stuber (2019)  42% – $1.67 million ($20.10 million total)Annabelle Comes Home (2019)  65% – $1.56 million ($69.73 million total)The Farewell (2019)  97% – $1.55 million ($3.68 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Hobbs &amp; Shaw actually had an opening that both Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham can brag is higher than any of their previous starring vehicles, but as part of this particular franchise, its domestic numbers are not nearly as impressive.King of the Crop: Hobbs &amp; Shaw Leads Weekend But Trails Franchise Numbers(Photo by Universal)Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw opened to $60.8 million this weekend. That is higher than either Johnson’s San Andreas ($54.58 million) or Statham’s The Meg ($45.40 million), but it is lower than any of the films since 2009, when both Diesel and Paul Walker returned for the first time together back to the series. That started this cinematic phenomenon that began with a $70.95 million opening that increased to $86.19 million in 2011, then $97.37 in 2013. After Walker’s untimely death, the series had the same kind of bump in interest that The Dark Knight had in 2008. Nolan’s film opened to $158.41 million six months after Heath Ledger’s passing. After a delay in the release for Furious 7, it opened in April 2017 to the highest Tomatometer score in the series (81%) and a weekend of $147.18 million, which at the time was the ninth biggest opening ever. That opening is now 24th best, but it is still the eighth-highest ever worldwide with $1.516 billion.The Fate of the Furious was to continue its global dominance with $1.236 billion (good for 17th all-time – though will soon be passed by The Lion King) but its domestic gross of $226 million fell behind the sixth and seventh chapters. If Hobbs &amp; Shaw followed in sync with the rest of the series, it should have had no worse than the third-best August opening ever. Alas, it will have to settle for sixth place. The lowest-grossing film in August to open to at least $50 million was 2009’s G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, a series that Dwayne Johnson was added to with G.I. Joe: Retaliation only to see it gross less than its predecessor with $122.52 million.The budget for H&amp;S was $200 million, not counting P&amp;A (prints &amp; advertising), even with a current worldwide haul of $180 million; however, this is still a series that has not grossed less than $626 million since the fourth (and worst-reviewed) film in 2009. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was Dwayne Johnson’s only headlining film that grossed over a half-billion worldwide. Statham’s sole film in that regard was The Meg and previously had not had a starring vehicle reach $126 million globally. Maybe Vin Diesel can smile until Fast &amp; Furious 9 opens next Memorial Day weekend, which may be a true test if this series is past its peak.Fresh Surprise: Adult Fare&nbsp; Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood Finds an Audience(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Sony won the opportunity to be the first studio to distribute a Quentin Tarantino film in the post-Weinstein era, and it looks like it is paying off with Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood. The $90 million production had a solid hold this weekend and is right where it wants to be: between the 10-day hauls of Django Unchained ($86.26 million) and Inglourious Basterds ($73.02 million) with $78.84 million. Hollywood’s second weekend ($20.02 million) was slightly higher than Django’s $20.01 and Basterds’ $19.30. That’s a great place to be, which could see it nestling into a $140 million–$150 million haul and it has not even opened internationally yet. Again, never underestimate that DiCaprio draw, but the trifecta with Brad Pitt and Tarantino has got audiences talking and that alone is a win for Hollywood (the movie and the town.)The Top 10 and Beyond: Four Films Continue To Climb the All-Time Chart(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)The Lion King grossed another $38 million this weekend bringing its haul to $430 million, the ninth-best ever for a film after 17 days.Though it is also fading a little faster than some of its contemporaries. This weekend ranked as the 18th-best third weekend; though among the all-time top 30, only three dropped 50 percent or more, and they all fall under the Marvel banner (Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 3). This only seems to be the difference between grossing over $500 million or over $600 million domestically. Internationally, it has grossed over $764 million bringing its worldwide total to $1.195 billion, already good for 19th place all-time and less than $150 million away from passing Black Panther and entering the top 10, which it will do with no issue. It has also now outgrossed the 1994 animated film with its combined initial release and its 3-D re-release in 2011. Disney’s live-action remake of Aladdin has also crossed $350 million domestic and is the 38th highest–grossing film worldwide ever.Speaking of Marvel, Spider-Man: Far From Home fell just behind the pace of Sam Raimi’s 2002 kickoff. On Thursday after 31 days, Far From Home was at $352.57 million, while Raimi’s film had made $353.82 million. That is still the 30th best of all-time domestically in that timeframe; however only two films among those 29 ahead of it grossed less in their fifth weekend than Far From Home ($7.90 million), and they were Captain America: Civil War ($7.82 million) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($7.25 million), so $400 million looks off the table. But its global haul stands at $1.075 billion, the 29th-highest ever.Pixar’s Toy Story 4, which crossed $400 million at home and has risen to $959 million worldwide, placing it 50th on the all-time chart. Domestically, its numbers are still really impressive. On its 40th day, just before it hit $400 million, the fourth film in the series had the 16th best-ever tally in that period. On top of that, the $7 million it made in its seventh weekend is higher than 12 of the top 20 grossers after 40 days. After this weekend it is the 27th highest-grossing film domestically of all time.Limited Release News: The Farewell Joins Impressive Company(Photo by A24)We continue to watch the progress of Lulu Wang’s The Farewell, which is becoming the limited release story of the summer. The film has a 99% Tomatometer score after just a single negative review. In its fourth weekend, A24 expanded its release from 135 to 409 theaters, and it grossed $2.4 million, good enough to jump from 10th place last week to seventh place this week. To put this in context with other films in 300-500 theaters in weekend four, check out these films with the numbers representing their weekend gross, number of theaters and total gross in their first 24 days:The Hours ($4.64 million / 402 theaters / $7.33 million)Manchester by the Sea ($3.17 / 366 / $8.34)There Will Be Blood ($2.94 / 389 / $5.86)Match Point ($2.93 / 441 / $8.02)The Joy Luck Club ($2.83 / 340 / $5.97)The Favourite ($2.60 / 441 / $6.77)Boyhood ($2.39 / 310 / $7.44)Birdman ($2.31 / 460 / $8.08)The Farewell has made a total of $6.83 million to date. Even if some of the numbers don’t quite match up with the above titles, this is nevertheless the company Wang’s film will be mentioned in among future limited-release successes. Amazon’s $12 million pickup of Late Night out of Sundance only grossed $15.3 million this summer. The Farewell should surpass that, but would need to do Manchester-type numbers to best A24’s Lady Bird. One weekend at a time, though, as audiences will continue to discover this film going forward.Julius Onah’s Luce is another limited release to watch. The film enjoyed the best per-theater average of the weekend making $132,000 in just five theaters. That’s a fifth-best PTA for Neon behind I, Tonya; Ingrid Goes West; Three Identical Strangers; and Colossal. Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale opened in two theaters in NY and LA and grossed $40,000.This Time Last Year: Pooh No Match For Ethan Hunt(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Mission: Impossible – Fallout spent its second weekend atop the charts with a $35.32 million haul, nearly outgrossing the next two films combined. Disney’s Christopher Robin opened in second to $24.58 million and The Spy Who Dumped Me placed third with $12.10 million. The adaptation of young adult sci-fi novel&nbsp;The Darkest Minds&nbsp;made $5.84 million, good enough for just eighth place. Black Panther, meanwhile, in its 25th week of release, passed the $700 million line to become the third-highest-grossing film ever at the time. Last year’s Top 10 grossed $119.73 million and averaged 70% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10 averaged 75.8% with critics, and its estimated gross of $143.88 million is good enough for the ninth-best August weekend since 2000. If it can get over $143.895 million when results are released Monday it will be eighth.On the Vine: Onslaught of New Releases Hope To Take Over Half the Top 10Debbie DayFive new releases open wide next week in hopes of capturing your attention, and there appears to be something for everyone. Family audiences are going to have to decide between the big-screen, live-action version of Dora the Explorer with Dora and the Lost City of Gold and the Look Who’s Talking Now/Marley &amp; Me hopeful, The Art of Racing in the Rain, which appears to be going for every heartstring. Melissa McCarthy, Elisabeth Moss, and Tiffany Haddish go pre-Widows against the mob in The Kitchen. Horror fans get the Guillermo Del Toro–produced Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.

Marvel and Pixar both led the way again and the two newcomers could barely combine to beat the film in second place. For those in a&nbsp;Chicken Little panic over supposed dwindling ticket sales this year, this weekend certainly gave fuel to that fire with the top 10&nbsp;films adding up to the lowest July weekend total since 2009.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;Not Far From the $1 Billion Club&nbsp;(Photo by © Columbia Pictures / © Marvel Studios/ Courtesy Everett Collection)Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;took the lead again to no surprise for a second straight week. With $229.2 million on Thursday, it ranked as the 32nd&nbsp;highest-grossing film ever after 10 days in theaters. However, the drop to $45.3 million this weekend has put its numbers closer to&nbsp;Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 2&nbsp;than many of the top-tier MCU films. Raimi’s film had $225.1 million after 10&nbsp;days and a $45.1 million second weekend. It finished its run with $373.5 million. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;made $44.2 million in its second weekend. Just remember that Far From Home&nbsp;also had a Tuesday opening (and the biggest one of all-time). Amongst the 35 films to have reached $375 million domestic, only Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Titanic, and&nbsp;Frozen&nbsp;made less in their second weekends than Far From Home. (Titanic’s $35.4 million in 1997 would be about $56.5 million today.) Worldwide the film has grossed over $847 million and will soon become the&nbsp;ninth&nbsp;film of the MCU to gross over a billion dollars.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Stuber&nbsp;Disappoints with $8 Million Start(Photo by Mark Hill/ © TM &amp; copyright © Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.)Stuber&nbsp;may not be a mega-budgeted production at $16 million, but unless you are a true indie or working under the Blumhouse margin, an $8 million opening is just not going to cut it. Thirty six films in 2019 have opened in 3,000 theaters or more&nbsp;and only Missing Link&nbsp;($5.9 million) and Fox’s The Kid Who Would Be King&nbsp;($7.1 million) – both Certified Fresh at 89% on the Tomatometer, incidentally – grossed less in their opening weekends. (A Dog’s Journey&nbsp;made $8.03 million.) Stuber, with a Tomatometer score of 46% currently,&nbsp;joins Winnie the Pooh, Ramona and Beezus, Monte Carlo,&nbsp;and Katy Perry: Part of Me&nbsp;as the films this past decade to open between $7 million and $8 million in July. They all posted final tallies between $23.1 million and $26.7 million. None of those films were rated “R” though.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Crawl&nbsp;Takes Small Bite as Disney Offerings Show LegsToy Story 4&nbsp;crossed the $750 million line worldwide this weekend. Plus, the once-dubbed “disappointment” from burned analysts is only the 23rd&nbsp;highest-grossing film ever after 24 days with over $346 million at the domestic box office. Though the film is right in line with Toy Story 3’s fourth weekend of $21 million, it did slip slightly behind during the week from being $17 million ahead of the third film’s pace to just around $7 million. No worries, however, as it is still on pace for a $400 million haul in North America. The fim is over $771 million worldwide.To finish up the Disney dominance news this week, their live-action version of Aladdin&nbsp;has officially become one of the 50th highest-grossing films of all-time in the world with over $960 million. The Lion King&nbsp;is already gearing up to join that list having grossed $54.7 million in China this weekend. Then, of course, Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;grabbed an additional $2.8 million across the globe and is now less than $8 million away from capturing Avatar’s all-time record with $2.780 billion.(Photo by © Paramount Pictures / courtesy Everett Collection)Over to the horror side of the top 10, Paramount chose not to screen Alexandre Aja’s alligator horror film, Crawl, for critics this week. Nevertheless those that reviewed it gifted it with an 88% on the Tomatometer and it’s already Certified Fresh. It may have bested Stuber&nbsp;for the newcomer crown this weekend, but its $12 million start is not entirely a cause for celebration, even with just a $13.5 million budget. That is more than the $10.9 million that another mid-July alligator film called Lake Placid&nbsp;opened to back in 1999. That film would have opened to about $16.7 million in today’s dollars and finished with $31.7 million. The smart money is on Crawl&nbsp;finishing with less, unless word-of-mouth – which again, is good – pushes it further.Ari Aster’s Midsommar&nbsp;has $18.4 million after 12 days, which puts it between fellow Wednesday openers No Escape, the 2015 terrorist thriller,&nbsp;and the 2004 remake of Around the World in 80 Days.&nbsp;That may&nbsp;suggest a finish in the $24-$27 million range. Except Midsommar’s $3.5 million weekend was less than either of theirs. The film would need $25.2 million to pass A24’s first wide opener, The Witch, for fifth place on their all-time chart. Midsommar&nbsp;is nevertheless going to finish no worse than right behind it in sixth place with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;The Disaster Artist’s $21.1 million. Annabelle Comes Home&nbsp;is now over $60 million, placing the film firmly between the third weekend grosses and totals of The First Purge&nbsp;($5.10 million, $69.48 million) and Rocky Balboa&nbsp;($6.01 million, $70.27 million), so figure a final tally in there while it currently stands at over $173 million worldwide – far less than either of the previous films but more than enough to turn a profit.Coincidences in box office are always fun to find and this week’s example comes with Danny Boyle’s Yesterday,&nbsp;which has become the director’s second highest-grossing film ever. That has nothing to do with coincidence though. Actually the $6.75 million it grossed this weekend and a total at $48.3 million puts the film in league with another tale of a singer from the U.K. that opened in June and was released by Universal some nine years ago. That film was Get Him To The Greek. It grossed $6.1 million in its third weekend and had $47.8 million after 17 days on its way to $60.9 million.On the Specialty Box Office:&nbsp;The Farewell&nbsp;Shows Signs of Being a Breakout HitFinally, in limited release news, Bleecker Street’s The Art of Self-Defense&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 92%) grossed $121,000 in seven theaters. That per-theater-average of $17,285 is just a bit less than Late Night’s $17,593 average in 14 theaters when it first opened. Amazon expanded that film into over 2,200 theaters in weekend two and it has grossed more than $14 million to date. Bleecker will expand Art into over 500 theaters next weekend and it is the ninth film in Bleecker’s history (out of 32 releases) to score 90% or higher on the Tomatometer.But the developing story may be that of Lulu Wang’s The Farewell,&nbsp;with Awkwafina. One of the most beloved films out of Sundance this year grossed $351,330 this weekend in just four theaters. That is the 15th&nbsp;best opening ever for a film launched in just four venues and the third best for A24. Moonlight&nbsp;($402,075) and Lady Bird&nbsp;($364,437) opened just a bit stronger and they, respectively, rank third and first amongst all A24 releases. The Farewell&nbsp;also maintains a perfect Certified Fresh score of 100% on the Tomatometer. It is the 28th&nbsp;A24 film to score 90% or higher out the distributor’s 77 releases.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 3&nbsp;Bests&nbsp;Skyscraper(Photo by © Sony Pictures Releasing)Adam Sandler’s ghoulish animated series showed no signs of wavering as Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation&nbsp;got its first taste of the box office outside of September and opened at number 1&nbsp;with $44 million. Ant-Man and the Wasp&nbsp;dropped 61% to second place, but that was still good enough to keep back Dwayne Johnson’s attempt at Die Hard in Skyscraper,&nbsp;which opened to just $24.9 million. In limited release, Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade opened to $263,797 in just four theaters. The Top 10 films grossed $154.03 million and averaged 67.7% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10&nbsp;did an estimated $113.04 million and averaged 66.9%. It was actually the lowest Top 10&nbsp;total for a weekend in July since the July 31-August 2, 2009 weekend when Funny People&nbsp;led the way with $22.65 million and a top 10 total of $107.14 million.On the Vine:&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;Set to Be HugeStories written about the trailing box office for this summer – and the year – might change in tone a bit when Disney’s The Lion King&nbsp;goes unchallenged next weekend. Jon Favreau’s latest live-action reimagining of a Disney classic is likely to easily surpass the total $966 million that 2016’s The Jungle Book grossed worldwide and join, if not also surpass, both 2017’s Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;and 2010’s Alice in Wonderland&nbsp;in the billion dollar club (they&nbsp;will also soon be joined by this year’s Aladdin).&nbsp;The Lion Kingis also likely headed to become the second highest-grossing film of the year after Avengers: Endgame&nbsp;and could also have one of the biggest opening weekends of all-time.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;July 12-14Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)  90% – $45.3 million ($274.52 million total)Toy Story 4 (2019)  97% – $20.66 million ($346.36 million total)Crawl (2019)  84% – $12 million ($12 million total)Stuber (2019)  42% – $8.04 million ($8.04 million total)Yesterday (2019)  63% – $6.75 million ($48.31 million total)Aladdin (2019)  57% – $5.87 million ($331.49&nbsp;million total)Annabelle Comes Home (2019)  65% – $5.55 million ($60.76 million total)Midsommar (2019)  83% – $3.55 million ($18.4 million total)The Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019)  60% – $3.1 million ($147.13 million total)Men in Black International (2019)  23% – $2.21 million ($76.48 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

The Tom Holland era of Spider-Man lives on with numbers not only greatly exceeding the lowball estimates of the studio but giving them a new standard to live up to with the character. Speaking of standards, do you recall all those “disappointment” labels for Toy Story 4? Well, two weeks later it has staked out a path to reach one of the numbers many of us expected it to in the first place.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Far from Home Outshines All Previous&nbsp;Spider-Man Movies(Photo by Sony Pictures)Did Spider-Man: Far From Home get the same Avengers bump that Iron Man 3 did years ago? We’ll answer that in a minute, but Tom Holland’s fifth appearance as the superhero (and just his second stand-alone film) is nevertheless looking like another monster for Marvel. Just last week it had the highest Tuesday opening of all-time ($39.25 million) and the highest single Wednesday of any Marvel film ($27 million). That was all before the weekend. By the end of its first six days, it has grossed $185 million. That is more than Sam Raimi’s 2002 origin story, which had $144.1 million after six days (around $205 million if you figure inflation.) Spider-Man: Homecoming had $154.1 million, Raimi’s Spider-Man 3 ($176.1 million), and Spider-Man 2 ($180 million) now all trail Far From Home. But we need to be looking at more recent examples to have an idea of what Spidey’s future holds.The eight MCU films to crack the $400 million line domestically, the lowest total after six days was Captain Marvel&nbsp;with $187.6 million, and that was without a trio of summer weekdays. Next on the list is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 which had $175.9 million and finished with over $389 million. Homecoming finished with $334.2 domestically and $880.1 million worldwide. Far From Home has already grossed over $580 million worldwide. The broadest estimate we can start with for Far From Home is somewhere between $390-425 million domestic. It also has a distinct advantage in not exactly having much competition with Stuber and Crawl next week. War for the Planet of the Apes helped knock Homecoming back a bit with a 62% decline in its second week. Far From Home is unlikely to see such a dip next weekend.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Toy Story 4 Chugs Along, Midsommar&nbsp;Leads All Indies(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Toy Story 4 did not reach $200 million in its opening weekend as some people thought. It did not even reach $150 million. But two weeks later, it is over $300 million, making it just the 27th film ever to do that in 17 days or less — at $306 million it ranks 24th. Among the 26 other films that have done it, only three failed to reach $400 million. They were Revenge of the Sith, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Two of those were final chapters of sorts like Toy Story 4, with each of them still finishing between $380-390 million. Guardians actually had a slightly higher third weekend with $34.6 million and is the only film to ever have $300 million in 17 days and a $30+ million third weekend but still miss the $400 million line. Remarkably though, Toy Story 4 has not just maintained a steady pace with #3, it is actually outpacing it even further now by over $17 million. Toy Story 3 had a $30.2 million third weekend (compared to 4’s $34.3) and finished with over $410 million. With a worldwide total just under $650 million, where exactly is the disappointment again?On the other hand, there may be some slight disappointment for Ari Aster’s Midsommar. Critics scored it at 82% on the Tomatometer, and it was certainly hoping for something closer to Hereditary‘s $17.2 million five-day start. $10.6 million for Midsommar suggests word of mouth is hitting it earlier and harder, despite an audience score that is currently 4% higher than Aster’s debut. Nevertheless, it is already the 11th film released by A24 to gross $10 million or higher, it could still be one of their five highest-grossing films ever, and it has already secured the best opening for an indie studio this year.&nbsp;Hereditary is their second-highest with $44.06 million.Last week’s releases each experienced their own share of success. Annabelle Comes Home&nbsp;is up to $50.3 million after 12 days. That puts the film a bit over the pace of the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street, which finished with over $63 million. Annabelle is aiming for somewhere between $65-70 million, which would be the lowest-grossing of the Annabelle films. But with over $134 million globally already on a budget in the vicinity of $30 million, it is already well into profit. Danny Boyle’s Yesterday maintained its third place slot and has collected over $36 million in 10 days. It will shortly become Boyle’s second highest grossing film, and with around another $34 million total, it will be into profit territory as well.Finally in coincidence city, Disney’s live-action Aladdin remake grossed $8.2 million in its seventh weekend. Back in 1992 in its seventh weekend of wide release, the animated Aladdin grossed $8.43 million. That is also enough to get the 2019 version over $921 million worldwide, the 55th film to ever cross that line. And it is still in the top five. Now imagine how much The Lion King is going to make. Probably not as much as Avengers: Endgame, which, by the way, is now less than $16 million away from Avatar’s all-time global record with $2.772 billion. If Men In Black International drops enough next week (and its global total stands at just $244 million), Endgame could make one last stand in the Top Ten next week.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp Loom Large(Photo by ©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)The MCU was in full effect as Ant-Man and the Wasp took the lead with a $75.81 million weekend. The First Purge was no match for it when it finished fourth with $17.3 million and a $31.2 million haul since its opening the prior Wednesday. The documentary Whitney opened to $1.26 million in 451 theaters. But it was Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You winning the per-theater-average of the week earning $727,266 in just 16 theaters. Incredibles 2 also passed the half-billion mark domestically in its fourth weekend. The Top Ten films grossed a total of $176.8 million and averaged 71.3% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $176.83 Million and averaged 71.6%.That total is only the 17th best July weekend since 2007. Even if next week ends up ranking much further down the list, do not let the box office panic being peddled seem like the theater experience is dying. 2018 was the biggest year on record and the years surrounding it from 2015-19 would all be 9-11% off the pace at this current time. 2019 is currently off 10.3% with The Lion King on the way.On the Vine:&nbsp;Ubers and Alligators on the Hunt(Photo by 20th Century Fox)In a bit of a placeholder week between high-profile blockbusters, we nevertheless get Dave Bautista hailing down Kumail Nanjiani’s uber to catch a terrorist in Stuber. The film had a mixed reception when it premiered at SXSW in March and currently has a 42% on the Tomatometer. Then again, at least Fox screened it for critics, something that Paramount is not doing for Crawl, the latest horror film from Alexandre Aja, the director of High Tension and the remakes of The Hills Have Eyes and Piranha. This time it’s alligators in a flooding house hoping to chomp down on Kaya Scodelario and hopefully more bucks than the Child’s Play remake, which went from second place to 12th in three weeks.The Full Top 10: June 28-30Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)  90% – $93.6 million ($185.06 million total)Toy Story 4 (2019)  97% – $34.3 million ($306.55&nbsp;million total)Yesterday (2019)  63% – $10.75 million ($36.88 million total)Annabelle Comes Home (2019)  65% – $9.75 million ($50.15 million total)Aladdin (2019)  57% – $7.6 million ($320.78 million total)Midsommar (2019)  83% – $6.56 million ($6.56 million total)The Secret Life of Pets 2 (2019)  60% – $4.76 million ($140.74 million total)Men in Black International (2019)  23% – $3.64 million ($71.98 million total)Avengers: Endgame (2019)  94% – $3.1 million ($847.86 million total)Rocketman (2019)  89% – $2.78 million ($89.16 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

But with Angel the most expensive film in the franchise yet, financiers are also going to be hoping for some hefty international bucks.King of the Crop:&nbsp;I’ve Fallen, But Can Still Get Up To #1(Photo by Simon Varsano / © Lionsgate / courtesy Everett Collection)Angel Has Fallen has gotten into the positive side of Butler’s box office history with a $21.25 million start, but will it have enough in the tank to recoup its $80 million budget?&nbsp;Olympus Has Fallen was the highest-grossing domestically of the series with $98.92 million. But it only grossed $71.34 million overseas resulting in the $70 million production coming up in the red. London Has Fallen dipped at home with just $62.5 million, but more than doubled the international haul of the first film with $143.23 million. Hence,&nbsp;the green light for Angel.With 39% on the Tomatometer, the movie ranks somewhere in the middle critically for Butler. Compare it to previous entries: 49% and 26%, respectively. This for an actor who has never top-lined a film registering higher than 60%, achieved by RocknRolla and 300 both. With March openings, the Fallen&nbsp;films grossed multiples of 3.25 and 2.88 over their opening weekends. August box office history suggests that should decrease even more, marking Angel for somewhere around a $57 million domestic total, leaving international the duty of making up the rest…to the tune of&nbsp;$182 million to match London.&nbsp;Top 10 and Beyond: A Mild Time At The Movies(Photo by Eric Zachanowich/ TM &amp; copyright © Fox Searchlight Pictures)Last week’s top film, Good Boys, which many were expecting to repeat, dropped 45% to $11.7 million. That puts it at $42.05 million after 10 days, which puts it about right in line with a more kid-appropriate August release in David Lowery’s remake of Disney’s Pete’s Dragon, which finished with over $76 million. Universal’s primary cash cow, the Fast &amp; Furious series, may be showing signs of wear and tear in the U.S., but Hobbs &amp; Shaw just opened in China to the tune of $110 million this weekend. That brings its global total to over $588 million – the 8th highest of 2019. Its $147 million at home is still one of the lower bars of the series.Fox Searchlight’s Ready or Not had a lot of support from critics this week (Certified Fresh at 87% on Tomatometer) and many were hoping it would have opened stronger than it did: $7.55 million over the weekend and $10.57 million since its debut on Wednesday. That gives&nbsp;Ready a first final estimate between $26 million and $29 million. Not terrible for the $6 million-budgeted film, but additional advertising costs may keep it in the red if word-of-mouth cannot boost its total further.Sony is not just feeling the brunt of anger from Marvel fans this week, but the belated realization that animated films and August do not mix. The latest example is The Angry Birds Movie 2, which is now up to just $27.09 million after 13 days.&nbsp;The film is currently $277 million behind the global gross of the first film, which in scale is on par with The Secret Life of Pets 2 doing $460 million less than its predecessor. Disney’s The Lion King, on the other hand, is now the 14th film ever to cross the half-billion line domestically and the 9th film to pass $1.508 billion globally. It needs just over $2 million dollars outside the U.S. to become just the 9th film in history to surpass the $1 billion mark exclusively with international dollars.Rounding out the top 10, Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood&nbsp;is now over $122 million and has surpassed Inglourious Basterds to become his second highest-grossing film, behind Django Unchained. Along with Jordan Peele’s Us,&nbsp;it is one of only two 2019 original projects to break $100 million. Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark joined the $50 million club this weekend. Dora and the Lost City of Gold&nbsp;is headed to join that club too, but not much beyond that.We continue to monitor films from the festival circuit as this week Roadside’s The Peanut Butter Falcon, which debuted at SXSW this year, expanded in its third weekend from 49 to 991 theaters and grossed $3 million for a total of $3.7 million.&nbsp;Last week’s 90%-Tomatometer opener from Sundance, Blinded by the Light, dropped 52% for a $2.1 million second week haul, bringing its total to $8.2 million. Neon continued to expand its 93%-approved drama, Luce, into another 102 theaters (for a total of 160), bringing its total to $864,182. Finally there is A24’s The Farewell, which lost a small handful of screens this weekend and grossed another $944,000, bringing its total to $14.47 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Asians&nbsp;Continues&nbsp;Crazy Rich Domination(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)Crazy Rich Asians won handily for a second straight week, dropping just 6.4% from the previous weekend and earning another $24.8 million. The Meg maintained its second place status with $12.8 million. The best of the new challengers was Melissa McCarthy and the puppets in The Happytime Murders,&nbsp;which opened to $9.5 million, which is $4 million more than McCarthy’s ensemble film&nbsp;The Kitchen grossed this month. The mechanical dog film, A.X.L., opened to just $2.79 million. And among limited releases, the remake of Papillon&nbsp;made $1.09 million in 544 theaters, but Sundance success Searching (Certified Fresh at 92%) would turn out to be the one to keep an eye on after $388,769 in just 9 theaters. The top ten films grossed $84.55 million and averaged 56.3% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $87.60 Million and averaged 68.5%.On the Vine: Don’t Let Go&nbsp;and&nbsp;Saaho To Open Over Lackluster Holiday Weekend(Photo by Blumhouse)We hit the calm before the storm that will be It: Chapter Two on September 6. But for Labor Day weekend, Hollywood is going old-school in releasing, well, not much. Don’t Let Go, which premiered under the title Relive at Sundance in January, follows David Oyelowo’s character on a Frequency-like murder mystery that did not impress the press at the festival this year. It currently stands at 47% on the Tomatometer. The lackluster numbers could then indeed open the door for Bollywood action thriller, Saaho, to find a spot in the&nbsp;top 10 as no film is likely to dominate over the holiday weekend.The Full Top 10: August 23-25Angel Has Fallen (2019)  38% – $21.25 million ($21.25 million total)Good Boys (2019)  80% – $11.75 million ($42.05 million total)Overcomer (2019)  53% – $8.20 million ($8.20 million total)The Lion King (2019)  52% – &nbsp;$8.15 million ($510.63 million total)Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw (2019)  67% – $8.14 million ($147.70 million total)Ready or Not (2019)  88% – $7.55 million ($10.57 million total)The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019)  73% – $6.36 million ($27.09 million total)Scary Stories (2019)  82% – $6.00 million ($50.48 million total)Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019)  85% – $5.20 million ($43.09 million total)Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85% – $5.00 million ($123.18 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Tracking services were once again made the fool this weekend as they did not even give Good Boys a chance over the shark sequel, let alone besting a second sequel that few were asking about nor the franchise spinoff showing signs of wear and tear. But Jacob Tremblay, Brady Noon, and Keith L. Williams – backed by word-of-mouth since their SXSW premiere in March – managed to do just that and now Good Boys&nbsp;hopes for a long shelf life.King of the Crop: Good Boys Takes Advantage of Comedy Drought(Photo by Ed Araquel / © Universal)Good Boys is the eighth&nbsp;R-rated film of 2019 to have an opening weekend of $20 million or more. That may seem low until you realize there were only eight R-rated films all of last year to achieve that. The bigger question many are asking&nbsp;is: where are the successful comedies? Until Good Boys, the highest-opening comedies of the year were all headlined by African-Americans:&nbsp;A Madea Family Funeral ($27.06 million), What Men Want ($18.23 million), and Little ($15.4 million). The Rebel Wilson pair in the first half of the year turned out to be a mixed bag as Isn’t It Romantic, despite being the only positively-scored of this batch (69%), fell short due to international rights being handled by Netflix, while&nbsp;The Hustle&nbsp;was a hit, thanks to its overseas release – even if it’s one of the worst-reviewed films of the year (14%).SXSW had three big comedy premieres this year well in advance of their releases, each maintaining highly-acclaimed status by critics. In May, United Artists Releasing and Annapurna failed to capitalize on the premiere for Booksmart (97% on the Tomatometer), which only grossed $22.68 million. Lionsgate also seemed to miss with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen in&nbsp;Long Shot (81%), which finished with just $30.31 million, though one could easily blame that on folks not wanting any more politics with their night out at the movies. The third of the batch was Good Boys, produced by Rogen and holding steady with a Certified Fresh 79% on the Tomatometer. Its placement in August is certainly no accident, as the first two American Pie sequels were successes in this month, as were the Rogen productions&nbsp;Superbad and Sausage Party. Back on the same weekend in 2005, Universal released The 40-Year-Old Virgin, which opened to $21.42 million and went on to gross over $109 million. Other high-grossing R-rated comedies released in August include We’re the Millers ($26.41 million opening / $150.39 million total), Tropic Thunder ($25.81 million/ $110.51 million), Pineapple Express ($23.24 million / $87.34 million), and&nbsp;The Campaign ($26.58 million / $86.90 million), even if the latter three were technically financial failures. Good Boys, with a budget of just $20 million, is well on its way to joining the profit list.Rotten Returns: Where’d You Go, Bernadette? Oh, There You AreRyan FujitaniThe United Artists Releasing experiment has seemingly had a lot of bottoms this year from releasing one of the worst-reviewed films of the year in The Hustle to not cashing in on the aforementioned goodwill of Booksmart to failing to get the Child’s Play remake to outgross even the original’s take of $33.2 million. But thanks to at least one international haul and a few skimpy budgets, those are minor failures at worst and could each be written up as profitable. They won’t be able to escape the numbers on Richard Linklater’s Where’d You Go, Bernadette,&nbsp;though. It’s only the fourth wide opening of his career but certainly weaker than The Newton Boys, which opened to $4.01 million in 1,965 theaters. Bernadette grossed $3.4 million in 2,404 theaters and reps a new low for UA Releasing and Annapurna when it comes to a 2,000+ launch.The Top 10 and Beyond(Photo by Daniel Smith / © Universal)Anyone who had Hobbs &amp; Shaw at number 1 this weekend was not paying attention to either the breakout potential of Good Boys&nbsp;or the evidence that the popularity of the Fast &amp; Furious series – at least as it relates to spinoffs – is dwindling. We’ll certainly test that theory when Vin Diesel returns in Fast and Furious 9&nbsp;next Memorial Day weekend, and yes,&nbsp;Hobbs &amp; Shaw has the eighth-highest gross after 17 days for films opening in the month of August, just ahead of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which did gross over $176 million. However its $14.1 million this weekend trails the $16.1 million that Apes made in weekend three, which&nbsp;suggests&nbsp;a final gross in the $160 million range. That is going to be around $65 million less than The Fate of the Furious (itself finishing with $127 million less than Furious 7). More concerning for Universal about this series’ future is that the film has only grossed $303.3 million internationally to date. That alone is about $700 million less than Fate acquired, though H&amp;S still has not opened in China, which added $392+ million alone to that overseas haul; a couple million higher than Furious 7.The battle for the family dollar was joined this week by The Angry Birds Movie 2, proving once again that Hollywood still has not received the memo that releasing animated films in August is a fool’s errand. Sony may have felt bullish, given that Sausage Party is the highest-grossing animated film ever released in this month, making $97.68 million. But they should have looked further down the list and realized that kids are back in school, weekday numbers are down, and that has resulted in only three other animated films to even pass $50 million (Planes, Barnyard, and ParaNorman). Now, The Angry Birds Movie 2 may not be joining that list either. Despite giving the film an extra day’s head start on Tuesday, the film has grossed just $16.2 million in its first six days. That is a just a million more than Kubo and the Two Strings had in five days ($15.2 million), and it finished just shy with $48.02 million.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)Dora and the Lost City of Gold had $22.67 million in its first five days. It now has $34 million after 10 days, which is about a million ahead of where Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters was at. However, Dora trailed that film’s second weekend, $8.7 million-to-$8.5 million, suggesting a final haul right now between $60 and $68 million. Families were still too busy seeing The Lion King, which is just a few days away from passing the $500 million mark. It is the 10th&nbsp;highest-grossing film after 31 days of release, though its fifth weekend haul is more around what the 14th-16th&nbsp;place films had done. It still maintains a pace to get it around the $530 million line domestically. But it has already joined history as one of the ten highest grossing films of all-time globally with $1.435 billion, with eyes on Furious 7 ($1.516 billion) for eighth&nbsp;place. In other Disney news, Toy Story 4 became their fifth billion dollar release of 2019, not to mention their 23rd&nbsp;of all time in a field of just 43 films to reach the milestone. It needs another $20 million to surpass their live-action remake of Aladdin.Sony is also keeping an eye on Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood, which just began its international run, which it’s going to need to turn a profit. Domestically the film is still doing very well. The $90 million-budgeted film has grossed over $114 million and is about on par with the pace of Mission: Impossible III, putting its final estimate between $130 and $135 million. It has only made $7.7 million overseas so far, but that is only in Hong Kong and Russia. The film still needs another $148 million to break even. Leonardo DiCaprio’s last three films all grossed over $200 million internationally. Sony is also ready to pop the champagne on Spider-Man: Far From Home, which, with over $1.1 billion, is on the verge of passing Skyfall as the highest-grossing film in the history of the studio.(Photo by Kathleen Pollard, 2019. © CBS Films)Over in the terror category, folks still preferred last week’s Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark to this week’s&nbsp;47 Meters Down: Uncaged. The former is doing better than most horror films in August, currently smack dab in the middle of where Rob Zombie’s Halloween was in 2007 and what The Cell and The Possession had after 10 days. Stories’ $10 million second weekend was better than any of those films, putting a $60+ million total in play. Uncaged opened to $9 million, less than the $13 million many tracking services had figured. It is also less than the first film, which started with $11.2 million on its way to $44.3 million. With the exception of ’80s horror classics An American Werewolf in London and David Cronenberg’s remake of The Fly, horror films released August that have opened to less than $10 million have not made it to $30 million total.Looking at the summer of Sundance, we have WB/New Line’s pick-up of Blinded by the Light opening to just $4.45 million in 2,307 theaters. The distributors are certainly now hoping for some Bend It Like Beckham international numbers to make up the $15 million budget and acquisition. Then, expanding again but out of the crowded top 10, is A24’s The Farewell. It upped its theater count to 861 and grossed $1.5 million, which is down 28% from last week’s expansion to 704 theaters. Looking at a collection of films that increased from the 700 to the 800-theater range from fifth-to-sixth week, including Enough Said, Emma, Garden State, The Favourite, The Shape of Water, and Gosford Park, the 28% drop is higher than any of them, as they grossed between $1.58 million and $3.13 million. Last week we made the comparison to Garden State, and that still holds, as both films had a near identical gross after 38 days of release. The Farewell stands at $12.83 million while Garden State had $12.84 million. However, Zach Braff’s film’s expansion to 813 theaters at this point netted $2.9 million, suggesting that Lulu Wang’s film does not have the momentum to reach $25 million. That said, it still should have enough in the tank to best Amazon’s Late Night ($15.46 million) and become the highest-grossing pickup from Sundance of 2019 thus far.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians Began an Impressive Run(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)One of the biggest success stories of 2018 opened this weekend when Crazy Rich Asians grossed $26.51 million on its way to a remarkable 6.58 multiple and $174+ million domestic haul. The Meg was still second with $21.15 million, and the latest Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg collaboration, Mile 22, opened in third with $13.71 million. Albert Hughes’ prehistoric adventure tale, Alpha, finished fifth with $10.35 million. The top ten films grossed a total of $110.71 million; the second-lowest weekend of the summer at the time. Critics graded the films an average of 65.3%. This year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $101.54 million and averaged 70.5% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine:&nbsp;Ready or Not, Will Audiences Fall Again for Gerard Butler?Ryan FujitaniThe summer is definitely winding down if the week’s highlight is a new film from Gerard Butler, who has not headlined a positively-scored (non-animated) film since RocknRolla in 2008 (and even that is just barely Fresh at 60%). Nevertheless he is back to possibly conclude the “Fallen” trilogy with Angel Has Fallen. The first two films are his most successful (again as the star in a live-action film) since 2010’s The Bounty Hunter, though London Has Fallen grossed $36 million less than Olympus Has Fallen. Regardless there is also Ready or Not, a humans-hunting-humans horror-comedy that Fox Searchlight did not cancel and is hoping to draw more interest to than recent Fox films. Overcomer is the latest faith-based film from the genre’s most successful director, Alex Kendrick, whose last film, War Room, grossed over $67 million. Then in limited release is Brittany Runs a Marathon starring Jillian Bell in one of the great surprises out of Sundance this year. Amazon is hoping their pick-up will find the necessary word-of-mouth to make this a late summer expansion.The Full Top 10: August 16-18Good Boys (2019)  80% – $21 million ($21 million total)Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw (2019)  67% – $14.14 million ($133.74 million total)The Lion King (2019)  52% – $11.9 million ($496.12 million total)The Angry Birds Movie 2 (2019)  73% – $10.5 million ($16.24 million total)Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019)  78% – $10.05 million ($40.22 million total)47 Meters Down: Uncaged (2019)  45% – $9 million ($9 million total)Dora and the Lost City of Gold (2019)  85% – $8.5 million ($33.91 million total)Once Upon a Time In Hollywood (2019)  85% – $7.6 million ($114.35 million total)Blinded by the Light (2019)  89% – $4.45 million ($4.45 million total)The Art of Racing in the Rain (2019)  43% – $4.4 million ($16.88 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

But as the dust settled on the rainy CGI, that number came down significantly, and it certainly spells trouble for the Warner Bros. franchise.KING OF THE CROP:&nbsp;Godzilla&nbsp;Wins the Throne, but For How Long?(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Godzilla: King of the Monsters carried a reported production budget of $200 million. Whenever you see a number like that, you can expect that the film is going to need to gross somewhere in the $550-600 million range just to break even. Gareth Edwards’ 2014 Godzilla reboot opened to a terrific $93 million, but then had the worst final multiple of that entire summer (2.15) which just barely got the film over $200 million. The total gross for that $160 million production was $529 million, translating into a minor success. In 2017 the $185 million production of Kong: Skull Island opened to $61 million, grossed $168 million domestic and $566 million globally. Another minor success, and another potential crisis averted. That may not be the case going forward.A $63 million opening for the King would have already been just marginally optimistic by barely beating Skull Island’s March 2017 opening. Instead it posted the second weakest opening for a Thursday preview start of over $6 million (Paranormal Activity 2 had a $40.6 million start after the same $6.3 million Thursday as Godzilla). A drop from opening day that quickly amounted to just $49 million (just a little over half of the 2014 opening) spells trouble for WB, considering that they have already committed to Godzilla vs. Kong for March 2020. That may draw more interest, given the two titans in the title, but how quick are audiences going to want to continue going with this franchise if they are in league with critics who scored the film just a 39% on the Tomatometer? WB is hoping that the $70 million increase in international sales from Godzilla to Skull Island will continue to go north with King of the Monsters&nbsp;— so far it has made an additional $130 million overseas — except domestically, we could be looking at a Van Helsing ($51.7 million opening / $120.1 million finish) or Prometheus ($51 / $126.7) situation in a year when only two American productions (Endgame &amp; Captain Marvel) have surpassed $360 million overseas.Top Ten And Beyond: Rocketman and Ma Have Solid Starts. Endgame Still Eyeing RecordThe two other big releases of the weekend are in much better shape than Godzilla. Paramount’s Rocketman, at a cost of $40 million, is riding a bit of the Bohemian Rhapsody wave with a $25 million opening. That is better than the $22.3 million Walk the Line started with in November 2005, though the $119.5 million the Johnny Cash biopic finished with was helped by its award season push. Still, it’s a solid start for the 90%-scored Elton John film that, along with international numbers, should push the film into a decent profit for the studio.The bad news for Universal’s Ma is that, despite having a stronger Thursday start with $1.3 million, it opened to slightly less than Blumhouse’s Ouija (10% / $911,000 / $19.8 million) and Truth or Dare (16% / $750,000 / $18.6 million) with $18.2 million. The good news is, who cares, when it only cost $5 million and a film starring Octavia Spencer opened to $18 million? The dropoff is likely to be steep enough to keep the 62% Fresh film from grossing over $50 million, but again, the film is going to be well into profit by the time audiences stop showing up.Looks like audiences seem to enjoy Aladdin, as it did something no other $100+ million Memorial Day weekend grosser has ever done. The live-action Disney remake had a second weekend drop of less than 55%. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was the only film on that list to pull off a drop less than 60%, and if that estimate holds, Aladdin will have the smallest drop at the top of that holiday list. At $186 million domestic, Aladdin now has the third best 10-day gross for a Memorial Day release, pulling ahead of X-Men: The Last Stand and Fast &amp; Furious 6, which puts its final gross somewhere between $239-286 million in North America. Like Godzilla though, it is eyeing that half-billion number and with $446 million in the bank, and Aladdin is looking like another winner for Disney. On the flipside, the $150 million Pokemon Detective Pikachu is looking for help to get into the black with only $368 million worldwide to date.As for last week’s controversy over Annapurna’s Booksmart, it can claim at least one victory this weekend. The 47% drop is certainly not it, but leapfrogging Sony/Screen Gems’ Brightburn is. Olivia Wilde’s film is still only going to earn barely over $20 million total, but it will not be saddled with the third-largest second weekend drop of the year that Evil Superman had. Losing 69% of its audience from last weekend puts the film behind only Replicas and The Beach Bum among wide release drops in 2019. Though, again, at a cost of just $6 million, Brightburn is hardly a disaster. And no, a platform release would not have helped it either.Finally checking on the two big success stories in the Top Ten, we have John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum&nbsp;falling 58% in its third weekend, but with nearly $125 million domestic, it is forging a path to around $150 million — more than the first two films combined. Parabellum&nbsp;has made over $221 million globally to date. Then there is Avengers: Endgame, which has dropped out of the Top Five and is slowing down, but earlier this week, it became just the second film to pass $800 million domestic and is now the second film to pass the $2.7 billion line worldwide. It is now only $75 million away from beating Avatar’s all-time record, but has dropped down the all-time weekend lists significantly recently. Looking at films that have grossed between $7-8 million in their sixth weekend (Endgame grossed $7.8 million), the average that they have left in the tank is between $20-30 million. Then, with its foreign totals falling from $47 million down to $17 million last week, I think we can expect one last marketing push as it spends just two more weeks in the Top Ten before dropping out.This Time Last Year: Boats and Jackasses No Match For Solo Or Deadpool(Photo by @ Lucasfilm, @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Back in 2018, the first weekend of June did not offer much challenge to Solo: A Star Wars Story or Deadpool 2, which stuck in the #1 &amp; #2 slots. The Shailene Woodley survival tale, Adrift, finished third with $11.6 million. Leigh Whannell’s sci-fi action film, Upgrade, placed sixth with $4.67 million and the Jackass team’s abandoned Action Point ended up ninth with just $2.39 million. Deadpool 2 cracked the $250 million line while Solo was just behind $150 million. The Top Ten films grossed just $97.05 million and averaged 54.9% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $167.1 Million and averaged 66.4%.On the Vine: Pets Sequel To Hold Attention Over X-Woman And Talk Show HostIllumination plans to takeover the family market for a couple of weeks with&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets 2 before Disney reclaims it for the rest of the summer. The sequel to the highest-grossing domestic film ever for the animation studio is hoping to pull in a fraction of that success before Toy Story 4 and The Lion King keep families busy. For the comic book fans, the oft-delayed Dark Phoenix finally makes its way into theaters. Originally scheduled for March 2018 and then February 2019, Simon Kinberg’s troubled production could become the lowest-grossing film in the X-Men series. Finally there is Late Night with Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling (who also wrote the script.) This was the first of Amazon Studios’ big pickups at Sundance this year to the tune of $12 million and they are hoping it will find the same audience that The Big Sick did back in 2017.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;May 24-27Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)  42% –&nbsp;$49.02 million ($49.02&nbsp;million total)Aladdin (2019)  57% –&nbsp;$42.33 million ($185.03 million total)Rocketman (2019)  89% –&nbsp;$25 million ($25 million total)Ma (2019)  56% –&nbsp;$18.26 million ($18.26 million total)John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019)  89% – $11.1 million ($125.75 million total)Avengers: Endgame (2019)  94% – $7.81 million ($815.5 million total)Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)  68% –&nbsp;$6.67 million ($130.6 million total)Booksmart (2019)  96% – $3.33 million ($14.37 million total)Brightburn (2019)  58% – $2.32 million ($14.21 million total)The Hustle (2019)  13% –&nbsp;$1.3 million ($33.2 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

Although it’s early, the latest entry, Tim Burton’s dark take on Dumbo, could be the first failure among the recent films. Meanwhile, Harmony Korine’s latest film fails to make a Spring Breakers-level splash, and Us and Captain Marvel continue to impress.King of the Crop: Dumbo Leads But Is Still Very Far Behind(Photo by Disney)While Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book and Bill Condon’s Beauty and the Beast made a collective $2 billion-plus worldwide, it was Burton’s Alice In Wonderland that really began the live-action remake trend back in 2010. That film remains Burton’s biggest success, a billion-dollar spring hit that was also the second-biggest opening in Disney’s history at the time. (It is now the 17th.) Though Dumbo was not expected to challenge that $116.1 million start, it was also expected to do a lot better than $45 million this weekend.With a $170 million production budget, Dumbo is clearly counting on the international dollar to save it. Even with optimistic projections domestically, no live-action film opening between $39-49 million stateside has ever reached $170 million. (Disney’s Wild Hogs came closest with $168 million.)Don’t blame critics on this one, as Dumbo’s 50% score on the Tomatometer is not much lower than Alice in Wonderland’s 51%. But that film was also able to market a very bankable (at the time) Johnny Depp, putting him front and center on every poster. Meanwhile, the trailers for Dumbo almost went out of their way to reveal more of the circus than the film’s high-flying star. We’ll update its progress next week.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;The Beach&nbsp;Bum(Photo by NEON / VICE)Neon had a great little story this year with the documentary Apollo 11. With $7.65 million in the bank, it is the company’s third-highest-grossing title after I, Tonya ($30 million) and the documentary Three Identical Strangers ($12.3 million). Harmony Korine’s&nbsp;The Beach Bum (51% on the Tomatometer) is likely to become the fourth-highest-grossing film in its catalog, but the 1,005-theater launch only produced $1.8 million this weekend. That’s the fourth-worst per-theater average for Neon ahead of just Borg vs. McEnroe, Revenge, and the $10 million Sundance pickup Assassination Nation, which had the studio’s widest launch (1,403 theaters) and opened to just $1.05 million for a per-theater average of $743. In March 2013, A24 released Korine’s last film, Spring Breakers, into 1,104 theaters in its second weekend, where it grossed $4.85 million on its way to $14.1 million total.The Top Ten And Beyond: Captain Marvel&nbsp;and Us Continue to&nbsp;Impress(Photo by @ Universal)Last October, Blumhouse released David Gordon Green’s Halloween, which grossed $126 million in its first ten days. Last week, the company released Jordan Peele’s Us, which has now grossed $128 million in its first ten days. Halloween finished its run with just $159.3 million even as it grossed $31.4 million in its second weekend. However, Us‘ second weekend made $33.6 million —&nbsp;a smaller drop (52.7 percent) than Michael Myers’ (58.8 percent). Of the 21 films to have grossed between $123-133 million in their first ten days, only six have failed to reach $200 million. Halloween was one of them. Us is forging a path to another incredible milestone, and it has already grossed $174 million worldwide.Captain Marvel maintained its impressive pace with another $20 million this weekend, the 27th-best fourth weekend ever for a wide release. With more than $353 million, it is the 21st best-performing film of all time after 24 days and well on its way to $400 million. Every film to have grossed $350 million in 24 days has reached $400 million, and Captain Marvel’s fourth weekend was higher than six of them (The Dark Knight Rises, Captain America: Civil War, Iron Man 3, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.) In other milestone news, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World passed $500 million worldwide this weekend.PureFlix’s&nbsp;abortion film Unplanned made the top five with $6.1 million, the second-largest opening in the Christian-based company’s history after God’s Not Dead 2. Five Feet Apart continues to enjoy a rather healthy stay in the top five, dropping just another 26.9 percent to $6.2 million for a running total of nearly $36 million —&nbsp;not bad for a $7 million production. Tyler Perry’s A Madea Family Funeral passed $70 million and may just have enough in the tank to surpass Boo! A Madea Halloween to become the second-highest-grossing film of his directorial career.Finally, Bleecker Street expanded its harrowing true-life terrorist drama Hotel Mumbai&nbsp;to 924 theaters, and it grossed $3.1 millon. Where does that rank among the company’s wide launches in more than 650 theaters?A solid fifth, following Logan Lucky ($7.6 million, 3,031 theaters), Eye in the Sky ($3.9 million, 1,029 theaters), Megan Leavey ($3.8 million, 1,956 theaters) and Unsane ($3.7 million, 2,023 theaters). Hotel Mumbai ($3.1 million, 924 theaters) finishes ahead of The Lost City of Z ($1.8 million, 866 theaters), Beirut ($1.7 million, 755 theaters), Danny Collins ($1.4 million, 739 theaters), Pawn Sacrifice ($1 million, 781 theaters), and Trumbo ($951,068, 660 theaters).This Time Last Year: Audiences Were Ready For Player One(Photo by Warner Bros)Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One had the second-highest opening of 2018 to date with $41.7 million. Tyler Perry’s Acrimony placed second with $17.1 million. Black Panther passed $650 million, and Isle of Dogs for the second straight week had the top per-theater-average ($17,839), grossing $2.9 million in just 165 theaters. The top ten films grossed $115.25 million and averaged 55.2% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top ten grossed an estimated $128.30 million and averaged 58.7% with critics.On the Vine: Shazam! To Lead, But Pet Semetary Could Surprise(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)The latest offering from the DC side of the aisle opens with some glorious reviews so far. Shazam has 93% to date on the Tomatometer just three weeks before Avengers: Endgame opens. That’s certainly enough to take the top spot at the box office —&nbsp;and audiences can take it from there. Also blessed with strong early reviews is the new adaptation of Stephen King’s Pet Sematary. It boasts a 91% thanks to reviews from closing night of SXSW, and with a solid opening weekend could end up becoming the third-highest-grossing King adaptation to date. Finally, STX releases the educational drama The Best of Enemies with Taraji P.

Outshines Hellboy and Everyone ElsePlus, Little proves it's bigger than Hellboy too, Missing Link falters, and people actually went to see After on the weekend of April 12-14.by Erik Childress | April 14, 2019 |  CommentsComic book characters went head-to-head this weekend and the family-friendly version won the battle. Both films were hoping for greater turnouts, but while one is still posting decent numbers, the other may represent the third strike for its character. Worse than that is the launch of a new joint studio venture that kicked things off by failing one of the most praised animated studios making movies today.King&nbsp;of the Crop: Shazam!&nbsp;Repeats, but Its Final Estimate Falls(Photo by Warner Bros.)As stated last week, Shazam is more DC’s Ant-Man than their Guardians of the Galaxy. To maintain the kind of momentum that would keep it in the universe of Paul Rudd’s character financially, it was hoping for around a 45% drop for its second weekend. Instead it fell 53%. Still good enough to beat this week’s challengers handily, but its hopes of reaching $170 million and beyond fell a bit. Among comic book adaptations to earn between $90-100 million after ten days, Shazam! joins the company of X-Men, X-Men: First Class, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, The Incredible Hulk, Batman Returns, The Wolverine, and Wanted. Batman Returns is the high bar with a $162 million final tally, while the four films surrounding it on that list grossed between $131-135 million. Shazam!’s second weekend ($25.1 million) was higher than all of those films except for Batman Returns ($25.4 million) but its final estimate is now in the $150 million range. Shazam! has grossed over $221 million worldwide to date.Rotten Returns: Laika Is Failed Again, but Not By Critics(Photo by Annapurna Pictures)This story is either sad or infuriating — maybe both, depending on who you ask. Ask critics which animated studio they would rather see put out more film – Illumination or Laika – and they’re&nbsp;likely to say Laika every day and twice on Sunday. Laika’s output has included Kubo and the Two Strings (97%), Coraline (90%), ParaNorman (87%), Tim Burton’s Corpse Bride (83%), and The Boxtrolls (76%), all of which are Certified Fresh. Yet, since Coraline in 2009, each successive Laika film has grossed less than the last from Coraline’s $75 million down to Kubo’s $48.Laika jumped ship from Focus Features, a studio whose Laika projects rank as four of the top 12 grossers in their history. Now they put themselves in the hands of Annapurna, who this February partnered with MGM and Orion to release films under the banner of United Artists Releasing. Missing Link (89%) is their first effort, and they opened it to $5.8 million. In 3,413 theaters. That is a lower per-theater-average ($1,712) than Matthew McConaughey’s Serenity ($1,724). It is a worse average than Focus Features got for Neil Jordan’s Greta ($1,859). Focus opened Ratchet &amp; Clank to $4.8 million for Pete’s sake. While UA Releasing has some high profile remakes and sequels on the horizon (Child’s Play, Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music, Bond 25), this is a really disconcerting start. Especially for the animated company, which deserves better.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Hellboy Hits Bottom with Critics and Audiences(Photo by Summit Entertainment)Another film that could have gone into the “Rotten Returns” section was the reboot of Hellboy. From Sony to Universal to Lionsgate, no studio has been able to make this character a thing. Despite two efforts from Gullermo del Toro, both 2004’s Hellboy and 2008’s Hellboy II: The Golden Army were financial failures, albeit ones with PG-13 ratings. The new R-rated Hellboy may not be family-friendly, but it wasn’t critic-friendly either. Garnering just a 15% on the Tomatometer, Hellboy is one of the worst-reviewed wide releases of 2019, ahead of only A Madea Family Funeral (13%),&nbsp;Replicas (10%), and this week’s release of After (13%), which Aviron opened in 2,138 theaters to bigger numbers than Missing Link ($6.2 million).Back to Hellboy, though. It continues Lionsgate’s history of lackluster returns for comic book adaptations. Red was their biggest success, opening to $21.7 million and finishing with $90.3 million. Its sequel was not as well-received, with lines of $18 and $53.8 million. Kick-Ass was $19.8 and $48 million. Hellboy could not even reach their PG-13 Thomas Jane Punisher film, which opened to $13.8 million just two weeks after del Toro’s&nbsp;Hellboy opened to $23.1 milion in 2004. The Punisher finished with just $33.8 million. Neil Marshall’s $50 million production of Hellboy may not even make it to $30 million domestic, which is less than Hellboy II’s opening weekend alone of $34.5 million.Disney’s Dumbo is also headed for a rough landing. The live-action version of their 1941 classic is up to just $89.9 million after 17 days. That puts it in league with Apollo 13, Borat, Home Alone 2, The World is Not Enough, District 9, Blades of Glory, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, Fifty Shades Freed, Superbad, Doctor Dolittle, The Fugitive; films between $89-91 million in the same period. Among that crop, only Fifty Shades Freed made less ($7.1 million) in its third weekend than Dumbo ($9.1 million). That is putting Tim Burton’s $170 million production somewhere between $100-110 million. With only $266 million worldwide, the film could end up being another $100+ million loser for Disney. Fortunately for them, not only is Avengers: Endgame on the horizon, but Captain Marvel still has the 21st best total ever after 38 days with $385 million, and with $1.064 billion worldwide, it’s now the 28th highest-grossing film ever.(Photo by Paramount Pictures)The new Pet Sematary adaptation is following the path suggested in last week’s column. With a 59% drop in its second weekend to $10 million, the film is now in danger of coming up short of the $57.4 million of the 1989 film. The 2019 version is in league with other horror films like&nbsp;The Omen (2006), Evil Dead (2013), Gothika, White Noise, Dracula Untold, Happy Death Day, and The Cell – each of which had between $40-42 million after ten days of release, and only The Cell and Gothika made more than $57.4 million. With The Curse of La Llorona set to take a chunk of the horror fans away from a film that dropped from 82% on the Tomatometer after its closing night SXSW premiere to 58% by the end of its first weekend, an under $5 million haul next weekend could seal its fate in missing the 1989 goal. Nevertheless, it’s sill on pace to turn a profit for Paramount.Doing better with horror fans is Jordan Peele’s Us, which is over $163 million, officially passing last year’s Blumhouse production of Halloween. The film is still $15 million ahead of last year’s A Quiet Place after 24 days, but it has fallen behind its fourth weekend take ($11-to-$6.9 million.) That is also less than Get Out’s fourth weekend ($13.4 million), though Us is still $30 million ahead of the pace of Peele’s debut. Us looks to land somewhere in the $180 million range. Universal also managed to open Little this weekend ahead of Hellboy. Its $15.4 million opening is higher than their Jason Bateman/Ryan Reynolds body-switch film, The Change-Up, which started with $13.5 million and finished with $37 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Dwayne Johnson Led with Another Video Game Adaptation(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)The video game adaptation, Rampage&nbsp;with Dwayne Johnson led the way with $35.7 million, just barely beating the second weekend of A Quiet Place, which finished with $32.9 million to just pass the $100 million mark in its 10th day of release. Opening in third was Blumhouse horror, Truth or Dare, with $18.6 million and Roadside’s most successful film to date, the song origin tale of I Can Only Imagine, passed $75 million in total sales. The Top Ten films grossed $131.79 million and averaged 66.8% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $101.45 and averaged 58.5%On the Vine: Horror and Sci-Fi Bring the Calm before the&nbsp;Avengers Storm(Photo by New Line Cinema)Another horror film tries to separate fans from their money. This time it is The Curse of La Llorona, part of The Conjuring universe, about the infamous weeping woman who steals children. Its premiere at SXSW this year was not as well received as Pet Sematary, as it owns a 44% on the Tomatometer at the moment. (Sematary’s score dropped 20% from its SXSW premiere.) Also look out for 2018 SXSW premiere, Fast Color, from director Julia Hart and co-writer/producer Jordan Horowitz, starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a woman with powers in a bleak future.The Full Top 10: April 5-7Shazam!

First things first, though, as one superhero is not done yet — even if he would be wise to fly away from the screeching phantom that challenged him this weekend.King of the Crop: Curse Opens on Top, But May Come In for a Soft Landing(Photo by New Line Cinema)Warner Bros.’ Conjuring Universe film, The Curse of La Llorona, opened to a very respectable $26.5 million. Not terribly well received after its screening at the SXSW film festival this March, the studio then decided to forego press screenings altogether, and it is sitting on a 32% Tomatometer score. That’s the weakest rating for a wide release horror film since last November’s The Possession of Hannah Grace (20%). Even The Prodigy got a 45%. La Llorona’s opening is well ahead other April horror entries like 2008’s Prom Night ($20.8 million), Scream 4 ($18.69), and last year’s Truth or Dare ($18.66). Those three films finished between $38 million–44 million. It is also ahead of this month’s Pet Sematary, which began with $24.5 million and currently sits at $49.5 million, just ahead of the pace of White Noise, which finished with $56.38 million; less than Mary Lambert’s 1989 Pet Sematary ($57.46 million). But a potential $60 million finish domestically for La Llorona would be solid for the $15 million production. It is already over $56 million worldwide.Rotten Returns: Penguins March to the Bottom of DisneyNature(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)The DisneyNature films have done fairly well as far as documentaries go. Earth and Chimpanzee are the 6th and 7th highest-grossing docs of all-time, and Oceans, Bears, Monkey Kingdom, and African Cats are still all in the top 20. So they had to be hoping for better with the 90%-rated Penguins, given that March of the Penguins is the second-highest grossing documentary ever with $77.4 million. Disney’s film has managed just $3.2 million since opening on Wednesday. Even the weakest entry in the series, Born in China, made $5.6 million in its first five days.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Captain Marvel Hits Milestone Just Before the Endgame(Photo by Marvel Studios)Shazam! dropped to second this weekend, but only with a 29% fall as it joins 15 films to make between $120 million–122 million in 17 days, seven of which are animated. Its $17.3 million third weekend is the fifth-best amongst them behind just Hitch, Wreck-It Ralph, Coco, and Happy Feet. Those four films grossed between $179 million–210 million, while the 11 films Shazam! beat grossed between $139 million–192 million. DC’s latest could be headed for somewhere in the $160 million range, That is clearly nothing compared to Captain Marvel, which appears to be getting the Black Panther treatment now, as fans want to make sure they are completely caught up for Endgame. It has reached the $400 million domestic mark, and at $1.098 million, it is the 25th highest-grossing film of all-time. Its 5.7% increase from last week to $9.1 million this weekend is the eighth-best seventh weekend ever.Another version of a superhero is on display in Breakthrough. Namely, The Almighty, as the power of prayer beats doctors in reviving a drowned boy. Over the weekend the 64%-rated film grossed $11.1 million, ranking it ahead of Soul Surfer and God’s Not Dead on the faith chart. That’s less than other pre-Easter releases like Heaven Is For Real ($22.5 million) and Miracles From Heaven ($14.8 million), each involving children, illness, and revival. Breakthrough has made $14.6 million since opening Wednesday.Dumbo finally hit $100 million on its 24th day and likely finishes somewhere between $110 million–120 million. That means a worldwide total somewhere in the $300 million range, which may be just enough to be the second-biggest bomb of 2019, leaving the top title to Paramount’s Wonder Park. Annapurna’s United Artists Releasing did no favors for Missing Link, which crash-landed on opening (despite a 90% critical rating). Audiences may have caught on to the critics singing its praises because the film dropped just 26% this weekend — the second smallest drop of the year after The Upside — but it has still only grossed $12.9 million.(Photo by @ Universal )Last week’s releases fell further down the chart. Little dropped 45 percent from second to fifth and has made $29 million to date. Lionsgate’s Hellboy, though, is a domestic failure. It’s 67.8-percent drop is the third worst of 2019 for a wide release behind Replicas and The Beach Bum. Neil Marshall’s film has made less than Elektra did in its first 10 days; the 2005 film lost more than half its theaters in its third week. If that happens to Hellboy next week, then it may not even reach $25 million. Guillermo del Toro’s Hellboy made $23.1 million in its opening weekend. Finally, Jordan Peele’s Us looks to be preparing for one more Top 10 stay next weekend. Currently on par in weekend five with X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Thor, it may settle in with a final gross between $179 million–181 million; ahead of Get Out’s $176 million.This Time Last Year: Audiences Chose Quiet Over Rampage(Photo by @ Paramount Pictures)A Quiet Place reclaimed the top spot at the box office, edging out Rampage in its second weekend by less than $900,000. I Feel Pretty ($16 millon) also took third place by less than $900,000 over challenger Super Troopers 2, which made nearly half of its total money this weekend. The Paula Patton thriller, Traffik, opened all the way back in ninth with just $3.94 million. The top 10 films grossed $106.60 million and averaged 60% on the Tomatometer. This week’s top 10 grossed an estimated $96.65 million and averaged 61% with critics.On the Vine: Avengers: Endgame Looking to Bust Some Records(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel)The summer movie season once again begins in April and no one wants to get in the way of Avengers: Endgame. Eleven years in the making. Who lives? Who dies? All questions the fans want answered, but Disney is looking at others. Will Endgame best Infinity War’s all-time opening weekend of $257.6 million? (Likely.) Could it actually climb to $300 million by the end of Sunday? (Quite possibly.) Does it best Black Panther’s $700 million to become the highest-grossing Marvel film ever? (Could be.) Are the numbers of Avatar and Star Wars in any danger? (We’ll see.) But we will track its progress week-to-week right here.The Full Top 10: April 19-21The Curse of La Llorona (2019)  28% – $26.50 million ($26.50 million total)Shazam!

The Avengers march on into history though, shattering one of the expected records this weekend while coming up short on another.KING OF THE CROP:&nbsp;ENDGAME MISSES ONE RECORD BUT APPROACHES ANOTHER(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel Studios)The Endgame is still strong. In just ten days it has passed $600 million, managing to do what it took James Cameron’s Titanic to do in 252. With nearly $620 million, the film is still $79 million ahead of the pace of The Force Awakens. That is down from the $110 million lead it had after last weekend. Part of that is due to&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame only having the second greatest second weekend of all-time ($145.8 million) behind Force Awakens’ $149.2 million. Marvel’s juggernaut also fell to third place on the all-time daily tallys for Monday and Tuesday on opening week and second place on Wednesday and Thursday (for non-opening days.) This weekend’s drop (59.2%) was in line with Age of Ultron’s 59.4% and Captain America: Civil War (59.5%) which is still rather impressive given it bested the all-time opening record by $100 million.Looking forward to next weekend, its haul will be expected to be somewhere between Black Panther’s $66.3 million and The Force Awakens’ $90.2 million —&nbsp;Endgame could be in the realm of $745-823 million. Avatar’s final domestic gross was $760.5 million with a worldwide haul of $2.78 billion. Avengers: Endgame is now the second-highest grossing film ever with nearly $2.19 billion. The Force Awakens took 54 days to reach the $2 billion milestone. Infinity War did it in 48 and Avatar in 47. Endgame opened internationally in 25 markets on Apr. 24, 2019 and achieved the goal in just 12 days.ROTTEN RETURNS: DOLLS UGLY INDEED, AND&nbsp;LONG SHOT&nbsp;MISSES BY A MILENormally this section is dedicated to just one movie, but this is a bad weekend for one struggling studio and a wake-up call for another. STX Films had a hit this year with The Upside, though that was a fortunate pickup from its original home at the Weinstein Co. That and Second Act (with Jennifer Lopez) were its only successes since 2017’s A Bad Mom’s Christmas. A $45 million attempt to get into the animated game with Uglydolls (34%) is not going to help when it starts with just $8.5 million. Sure that’s better than Annapurna/United Artists Releasing got from Missing Link opening weekend but it’s less than Funimation received for Dragon Ball Super: Broly ($9.8 million) in January this year on just about a third of the screens as Uglydolls.However it is Lionsgate’s release of Long Shot that is far more troubling. At just $10 million this weekend, the Charlize Theron/Seth Rogen romantic comedy is the lowest wide opening for the studio this year. Lionsgate’s successes as of late have been primarily because of their smallest budgets like Tyler Perry’s A Madea Family Funeral ($20 million budget / $73 million gross), A Simple Favor ($20 million / $53 million), Overboard ($12 million / $50.3 million) and Five Feet Apart ($7 million / $45.4 million). Compare that to the likes of Hellboy ($50 million / $21.7 million), Cold Pursuit ($60 million / $32.1 million), Robin Hood ($90 million / $30.8 million) and now Long Shot’s $50 million budget.(Photo by Hector Alvarez / © Summit Entertainment)Since the days of Twilight and The Hunger Games, Lionsgate has struggled to find a place in the current state of the franchise wars, unable to even finish their Divergent series. While they have had some major success stories like La La Land and Wonder, decent franchise returns from Now You See Me and John Wick and even a few surprises like The Hitman’s Bodyguard (which is now getting a sequel) and Hacksaw Ridge, the post-Wonder overlook is one where the only $20+ million opening with the Madea Funeral ($27 million) and their second best was Tyler Perry’s Acrimony ($17.1 million).Long Shot is the 7th straight non-Tyler Perry entry in the Lionsgate catalog to open wide and fail to to achieve an opening weekend of $15 million. Robin Hood, Hunter Killer, and Hell Fest could not even do it in five days. Lionsgate had so much confidence in Long Shot that they moved it from the first week of June into the wake of Endgame in the hopes of being the&nbsp;Notting Hill to Fox’s&nbsp;Phantom Menace, and it backfired spectacularly. Even with an 83% on the Tomatometer and critics praising it as one of the great surprises of 2019, Long Shot could go down as the biggest failure to market a Seth Rogen comedy since the Weinsteins couldn’t turn Zack and Miri Make a Porno into a success just months after Knocked Up grossed over $148 million. Long Shot opened to less than that Kevin Smith film.TOP TEN AND BEYOND:&nbsp;THE INTRUDER FALTERS WITH CRITICS BUT IS WELCOMED BY AUDIENCESThis week’s final newcomer, The Intruder, feels like a minor success compared to those two movies, besting Long Shot for second place with an $11 million opening and all on an $8 million budget. That’s more than Cold Creek Manor opened to in 2003 ($8.1 million) — the film where Stephen Dorff played the previous owner of a house that terrorized Dennis Quaid. That got a 12% from critics here, while The Intruder got a score of 27%. So here’s to minor successes.As for major successes, Captain Marvel has just moved into 24th place for the highest-grossing domestic total of all-time. Shazam! is not nearly in its league, but with over $355 million worldwide, it’s still a minor success for the DC Universe. That is more than the $338 million that Dumbo has accumulated to date, which, at the moment, puts the film in the red in the vicinity of Disney’s holiday bomb, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms.THIS TIME LAST YEAR:&nbsp;AVENGERS RULED, BUT FELL BEHIND ALL-TIMER PACE(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, @ Marvel Studios)The weekend prior, Avengers: Infinity War had the largest opening of all-time. This weekend it had the second-best second weekend of all-time with $$114.7 million, bringing its total to $453.1 million as it already began to fall well off the pace of The Force Awakens. Counterprogramming was offered with the role-reversal remake of 1987’s Overboard which made $14.7 million for second place while Jason Reitman’s Tully was another acclaimed disappointment with Charlize Theron that was released in 1,353 theaters and made just $3.2 million. Also opening in just 34 theaters was RBG, which went on to become one of the most successful documentaries of 2018. The Top Ten films grossed $158.9 million and averaged 60.5% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top Ten grossed $192.4 Million and averaged 59.6% with critics.ON THE VINE: CAN&nbsp;PIKACHU BEAT THE&nbsp;AVENGERS? SERIOUSLY, CAN IT?(Photo by @ Warner Bros. Pictures, @ Legendary)A Pokemon with the voice of Ryan Reynolds is going to try its best to knock back the Avengers in its third weekend. Is Detective Pikachu really going to be a force this summer or has its appeal window shortened as people found new games to play? 1964’s Bedtime Story with Marlon Brando and David Niven is getting another redux; you may know it better as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Steve Martin and Michael Caine. This year it is known as The Hustle with Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson. Last year’s Book Club turned into a little surprise hit for Paramount. This year STX is hoping for the same results with Poms starring Diane Keaton, Jacki Weaver, Rhea Perlman, and Pam Grier in a comedy about a retirement community that starts a cheerleading squad; a film that could have sleeper hit written all over it.

But the Mouse House is not&nbsp;immune to the occasional box office disappointment. A Wrinkle in Time, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, and this year’s Dumbo come to mind. Some of their biggest disappointments have also been a part of three of the last four Memorial Day holidays, and they would certainly like to turn that streak around. Thankfully for them, their live-action version of Aladdin has gotten off to a solid start with a magical $112.7 million over the four-day weekend.KING OF THE CROP:&nbsp;Aladdin&nbsp;Makes Magic, But Will It Be Lasting?(Photo by @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)If there is one number Aladdin surely wanted to get in front of it was the four-day number that Solo: A Star Wars Story put up last year over the holiday. Over the first three days of this weekend the numbers were pretty close, with Aladdin on top $90.4 million to $84.4 million and then pulling ahead further on Monday with an estimated $112.7 million vs. $103 million. That number is good enough for the fifth-highest Memorial Day weekend ever, though no film has cracked $120 million it would take to enter the&nbsp;top three&nbsp;since Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008. Which is actually a bit&nbsp;shocking given the frequency at which records seem to be broken these days.So just how good are these Aladdin numbers? As big as some of the past Memorial Day opening numbers have been, very few of the films behind them have actually played the long game. Of the seven previous films to score $100-plus million over the holiday (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End, Crystal Skull, X-Men: The Last Stand and Days of Future Past, Fast &amp; Furious 6, The Hangover Part II) only Crystal Skull dropped less than 60% the following week. Aladdin is already likely to drop back behind Godzilla: King of the Monsters and, if Rocketman can grab $30 to $35 million, it may even find itself back to third. Indiana Jones and the Caribbean Pirates are the only Memorial Day releases in the modern era to gross over $300 million total. (The original Star Wars opened on the Wednesday prior to Memorial Day 1977 and did it too.) On top of that, only The Hangover Part II and Return of the Jedi made it&nbsp;past $250 million after opening this weekend. Aladdin and Disney can celebrate this weekend, but with a $183 million production budget, this is a win that will be decided again with the international box office. It’s worldwide total stands at $233.7 million. Dumbo is still only at $348 million.Rotten Returns: While&nbsp;Booksmart Lands&nbsp;Toward Bottom of the Class, Word-Of-Mouth Could Help&nbsp;Olivia Wilde’s Booksmart has nothing published about its budget, though one can assume it was on the small side. (How much more could it have cost than Brightburn’s $6 million?)&nbsp;And yet it’s still surprising many the the movie only managed to make $8.69 million over the weekend.&nbsp;Some are saying&nbsp;United Artists Releasing (a.k.a. AnnapurnaOrionMGM)&nbsp;had a tough job of&nbsp;selling it to audiences. The same team&nbsp;gave Laika Animation their worst tally to date with Missing Link (88% on the Tomatometer),&nbsp;which earned less than $17 million total. Now Booksmart,&nbsp;the best-reviewed narrative feature of 2019 (Certified Fresh at 98%) makes a mere $8.69 million over its first four days.&nbsp;The&nbsp;female-oriented teen comedy, which made a splash at South By Southwest in March, is now unlikely to outgross the&nbsp;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels redux, The Hustle, which has made nearly $31 million to date and ranks in the bottom 10 films of the year, according to critics, with a 15% Tomatometer&nbsp;rating. Though it is not like Booksmart is leaving theaters right now. Audiences still have the opportunity to see it and get the word out. And as this is a word-of-mouth film, there is still a chance it could take off.The rest of the Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Wick&nbsp;Climbs Lionsgate All-Time Chart as&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;Heads for the TopLionsgate also received some criticism for failing Long Shot (which dropped 752 theaters this weekend but still hung on just enough for one last&nbsp;week in the Top 10,&nbsp;for a total of $29 million). But the studio is enjoying great numbers for John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum, which came in second this weekend.&nbsp;Another $31 million over the holiday puts the film on par with Night at the Museum: Battle for the Smithsonian, which finished its run in 2009 with&nbsp;more than $177 million. Wick&nbsp;is going to become the sixth&nbsp;highest-grossing domestic film in Lionsgate’s history (behind four Hunger Games and a Twilight).&nbsp;Third place for the weekend went to&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame, which is now&nbsp;the second film to ever cross the $800 million line domestically (it is currently $54 million off the pace of The Force Awakens at the U.S. box office). With $2.677 billion worldwide,&nbsp;Endgame is just $105 million away from breaking Avatar’s all-time international record.Getting back to Brightburn, the James Gunn-produced evil Superman horror film, which cost $6 million to make, had a not-so-great $9.5 million haul over the weekend. But, again, it was made for $6 million, so that’s more disappointing than calamitous. Especially considering that Sony’s other low-budget May release, The Intruder, has crossed $32 million to date. Meanwhile, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is up to over $120 million. That puts it on par with past May releases Sex and the City and San Andreas, which finished with $152.6 million and $155.1 million, respectively. The $150 million production is up to $356 million worldwide.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Solo&nbsp;Sets Course for Disappointment(Photo by @ Lucasfilm, @ Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Over the Memorial Day holiday, Solo: A Star Wars Story made $103 million in its first four days. That turned out to be 48.1% of its entire gross in what became one of the biggest&nbsp;disappointments&nbsp;of 2018. Deadpool 2 finished second and actually made more in 10 days than Solo would make over its entire run. Avengers: Infinity War had passed the $600 million mark earlier in the week. The Top 10&nbsp;films grossed $219.2 million over the four-day holiday and averaged 58.4% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top 10 grossed an estimated $216.7 million and averaged 63.8% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine:&nbsp;Godzilla Will be Box Office King, As&nbsp;Rocketman&nbsp;Aims for Potential Second PlaceNext weekend is set to&nbsp;be led by&nbsp;Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla opened to $93.1 million in 2014;&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island started with $61 million in 2017. Both&nbsp;are Certified Fresh at 75% on the Tomatometer. What will the King do before the two epic creatures square off in 2020? The story of Elton John, Rocketman, is hoping to get some piece of the Bohemian Rhapsody crowd. So far&nbsp;the movie is impressing critics, Certified Fresh at&nbsp;88% compared to Tomatometer score of 61% for&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody. Then there is the latest from Blumhouse: The last time Octavia Spencer worked with Tate Taylor, she baked a poop pie and won an Oscar; in Ma, she kidnaps a group of teenagers and terrorizes them.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;May 24-27Aladdin (2019)  57% –&nbsp;$112.7 million ($112.7 million total)John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019)  89% – $31 million ($107.64 million total)Avengers: Endgame (2019)  94% – $22.3 million ($803.63 million total)Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)  68% –&nbsp;$17.28 million ($120.1 million total)Brightburn (2019)  58% – $9.5 million ($9.5 million total)Booksmart (2019)  96% – $8.69 million ($8.69 million total)A Dog's Journey (2019)  50% – $5.52 million ($16.35 million total)The Hustle (2019)  13% –&nbsp;$4.79 million ($30.81 million total)The Intruder (2019)  33% –&nbsp;$2.93 million ($32.59 million total)Long Shot (2019)  81% –&nbsp;$2.1 million ($29.23 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]Like this?

If they had been, something could have actually dethroned M. Night Shyamalan’s&nbsp;Glass after just a single week. Instead they were catching up on Oscar nominees and the surprise hit of 2019 while Glass (still a success) may be coming up shorter than expected.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;Slips, but Stays on Top(Photo by Universal Pictures)M Night Shyamalan’s&nbsp;Glass managed to stay on top despite a 52% drop. Another $19 million has brought the film to just over $73 million, but where exactly does that leave it after 10 days? Split had $77.3 million by its 10th&nbsp;day but that was also just after a 35.9% drop to a $25.6 million weekend. No film with $70 million in ten days ever failed to reach $100 million. The lowest-grossing film on that list ended up being The Conjuring 2 with $102.4 million — it had a 63.2% drop in its second weekend to $14.8 million.&nbsp;At this rate it is conceivable that 2019’s first real breakout hit, The Upside, could leapfrog Glass&nbsp;in the coming weeks and may even have a shot at outgrossing it if Night’s fans begin dropping off harder in the coming weeks. Stay tuned, money watchers.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Serenity Not Now for Audiences,&nbsp;King Only a Hit with Critics(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Things do not look great for either of the new releases this weekend. Fox’s The Kid Who Would Be King grossed just $7.2 million, with some expectations of at least $10 million. Neither is positive for a production reportedly costing $59 million. The only number that is positive for Joe Cornish’s film is the critical response, which has registered a Certified Fresh 86% on the Tomatometer, comparable to his&nbsp;Attack the Block, which was also Certified Fresh at 90%.Then there is Aviron Pictures’ Serenity, delayed from its October release into the January dumping ground, where critics have already turned it into a story by publicizing it’s crazy twist ending. That mocking has it down to a 21% score, and its $4.8 million start is a career low for star Matthew McConaughey for a film opening in more than 2500 theaters. (His previous low was We Are Marshall with $6.1 million, though that holiday release went on to gross over $43 million.) Serenity could struggle to make $10 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Death Cure Knocked Down&nbsp;Jumanji(Photo by 20th Century Fox)Maze Runner: The Death Cure&nbsp;ended a three-week run for&nbsp;Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;by topping the box office with $24.1 million.&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;was not too far behind with $16.1 million for second place, while the expansion of&nbsp;Hostiles&nbsp;with Christian Bale netted $10.1 million. Also entering the Top Ten was the Hindi film,&nbsp;Padmaavat, which grossed $4.49 million in just 326 theaters for the highest per-theater-average of the week. The Top Ten films grossed $102.4 million and scored an average of 68.4% on the Tomatometer. Last year, the week’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $102.4 million and averaged 68.4%.&nbsp;This week’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $75.3&nbsp;million and averaged 61.8%.On the Vine:&nbsp;Choose Between Surviving the Cartels or the&nbsp;Arctic(Photo by Canana Films)Gina Rodriguez stars in the American remake of 2011’s&nbsp;Miss Bala, the original film from Mexico that was Certified Fresh at 87% on the Tomatometer.

Plus, Mary Poppins Returns and Bumblebee on track for $100 million club.by Erik Childress | December 30, 2018 |  CommentsJames Wan’s Aquaman may have started with the lowest opening ever in the DC Universe, but seven days later, it is looking more like Michael Phelps than some lowly dog paddler. The film is entering very exclusive territory this weekend just as two more December releases join the $100 million club by the time the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve. That makes 32 for 2018 with at least two more films still hoping to surpass last year’s (and 2014’s) total of 33 to become second only to 2013’s 35 $100 million-plus films. That record may come up short, but Hollywood has shot past its previous ticket sales record ($11.37 billion in 2016) and is now eyeing a $12 billion year at the box office.King of the Crop: Aquaman&nbsp;Joins Impressive Club of December Releases(Photo by Jasin Boland/ ™ &amp; © DC Comics)After its first weekend, Aquaman&nbsp; was $26 million behind Justice League. After weekend two it is now $17 million ahead and climbing. How high? Quite actually. Because as of this Sunday, Wan’s film is now the sixth highest grossing December release after 10 days, behind five little films: Star Wars trio The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and Rogue One, as well as Avatar&nbsp;and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. All seven December films to have made $150 million by this point have reached the $300 million mark, and Aquaman is $20 million ahead of The Two Towers. Peter Jackson’s film opened on a Wednesday, so that pace will tighten over the next couple of days. But Return of the King made $48.8 million in its second weekend and ended with $339.7 million. Aquaman grossed $51.5 million and is likely looking at a final gross in that vicinity, which would surpass both Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman for second highest grossing feature film in the DC Universe behind Wonder Woman. With $748 million worldwide, it is the seventh highest grossing film of 2018 and will be passing Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Venom soon with its eye then on a billion dollars.Fresh Surprise: WWI Documentary Out-Performs New Releases(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Speaking of Peter Jackson, his WWI 3D documentary, They Shall Not Grow Old, has become one of the top-grossing documentaries of the year. After just two nights. Fathom Events held special single-night screenings on December 17, when it broke the company’s record with $2.3 million, and then again this past Thursday, when it broke it again with another $3.37 million. That was more than this week’s openers, Holmes &amp; Watson and Vice, grossed on Thursday with a full day of screenings. With $5.7 million in two nights it has made nearly as much as partisan documentaries, Death of a Nation (with a 0% Tomatometer score) from pardoned felon Dinesh D’Souza ($5.88 million) and Michael Moore’s Fahrehheit 11/9 ($6.35 million). Warner Bros. will open the film in a few cities on January 11, and you can expect it to rise from the seventh highest grossing documentary of 2018 into the top five – and maybe even higher.Rotten Returns: Holmes &amp; Watson (aka the Anti-Aquaman)(Photo by Columbia Pictures)Holmes &amp; Watson opened in theaters without being screened for critics. Hey, Disney did the same thing for Christmas opener, Tombstone, back in the day, too. How bad could it be? Well, it is currently just the third wide-release of the year to score lower than 10% on the Tomatometer after Slender Man and Death of a Nation’s golden doughnut of 0%. That is where Holmes was with its initial set of reviews, but folks were already in the midst of paying good money to see it on Christmas Day. Around $6.4 million and 24 hours later, some were already calling it a “commercial flop” on Twitter despite the fact that only four of 23 films to open on Christmas to more than $6 million failed to reach $60 million.That still would not have been enough to cover its $42 million budget in domestic dollars, but it’s not like it was Mortal Engines or Welcome to Marwen this month; however, Holmes &amp; Watson’s audience numbers have been scaling down to its current Rotten Tomatoes score of 9%. Though $19.7 million after its first six days still has it pacing for somewhere between $40-60 million, its numbers are diminishing at the pace of Aliens Vs. Predator – Requiem, which finished with just $41.7 million after it opened on Christmas. So it will depend on international audiences to determine whether the film is “a commercial flop” or not.The Top Ten and Beyond: Poppins &amp; Bumblebee To Join $100 Million Club Soon(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Mary Poppins Returns just missed becoming the 26th film opening in December to reach $100 million in its first 12 days; though it will do so on New Year’s Eve. Of the films in its 12-day company that had between $97 million to $107 million at this point, Poppins’ $28-million weekend is second only to Daddy’s Home’s $29.2 million. (Poppins is likely to fly past Daddy’s Home’s $150 million.) The next crop of films above them (sans Marley &amp; Me) are all $200 million grossers. So as long as Rob Marshall’s film maintains its current pace it should rise high enough to be one of the three highest grossing films of the season.Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse did join the $100 million club this weekend. At $103.6 million it is in the company of Catch Me If You Can, Les Miserables (2012), Into the Woods, True Grit (2010), and Unbroken, but its third weekend of $18.3 million surpasses all of theirs, suggesting the film is headed for north of $160 million — an estimate that could continue to rise with the word-of-mouth it is receiving.Bumblebee, with another $20 million this weekend, is also headed for $100 million like every other film from December to have $60 million after 10 days. Clint Eastwood’s The Mule, on the other hand, took 17 days to hit the $60 million mark, but it is not out of the running to become the 34th film of 2018 to reach $100 million. For a film that needs around $150 million to break even, $80 million seems to be the worst-case domestic scenario at this moment. As it is pretty closely aligned with the $100.7 million–grossing The Pelican Brief, there is still a possibility this will be Clint’s sixth film as a director to reach that height.While Holmes and Watson was grossing $6.4 million on Christmas Day, Adam McKay’s award hopeful, Vice, was gathering up $4.7 million and a 64% score on the Tomatometer. It has made $18 million in its first six days and eyes somewhere around $50 million final domestic gross, but is already Annapurna’s highest grossing film to date surpassing this summer’s Sundance pickup, Sorry To Bother You. Ralph Breaks the Internet has fallen behind the pace of last year’s Coco, but is still $9 million ahead of Tangled, which keeps $200 million very much in the picture. It only takes Ralph and Poppins to break the single-year record of most films to reach the milestone in any year. A $300 million final gross may be out of reach for Illumination’s The Grinch, but its $266 million makes it undoubtedly one of the biggest hits of the season, even while it could end up being the company’s third-lowest grossing film to date; albeit one with still over $100 million in profit.Beyond the Top Ten you will find both The Favourite ($15.2 million) and Mary Queen of Scots ($9 million) doing decent business in less than 850 theaters each. Both continue to do better than Robert Zemeckis’ Welcome to Marwen, which has grossed $7.7 million. There are still seven films this year further in the red than Marwen (including Ralph Breaks the Internet), though it is still little comfort being among the 10 biggest financial losers of 2018.In further limited release news, we have the three best per-theater-averages of the week: The Ruth Bader Ginsburg drama, On the Basis of Sex (74%) averaged $20,909 this weekend and has made $1.5 million in 33 theaters since Christmas. Destroyer (76%) has been in three theaters since Christmas and has made $115,661. It averaged $19,491 this weekend. Then there is Stan &amp; Ollie (89%), which opened on Friday in five theaters, averaging $15,935 for a total of $79,674. Aquaman had the fourth best average with $12,497, and Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk was fifth, adding 60 theaters (for a total of 65). It averaged $11,686 and has grossed nearly $2 million.This Time Last Year: The Last Jedi Held Off Jumanji for the Last Time(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)Star Wars:&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;maintained the top spot for a third straight week (and passed the $500 million mark), though Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle closed the gap with a $52.5 million-to-$50 million showdown. Christmas day openers, All the Money in the World and Molly’s Game made $12.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, in their first full week of release. Steven Spielberg’s The Post and Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread led the per-theater-average list with $62,342 (nine theaters) and $54,124 (four theaters). The Top Ten films grossed a total of $173.3 million over the weekend, which included New Year’s Eve, and they averaged 65.1% on the Tomatometer.

Plus, Taraji P. Henson in What Men Want and Liam Neeson's Cold Pursuit take spots 2 and 3 on the weekend of February 8-10.by Erik Childress | February 10, 2019 |  CommentsConventional wisdom speculated that The Lego Movie 2 was not only going to lead this weekend’s box office, but also outgross the trifecta of other new releases. While the former turned out to be true, the failure of the latter calls into question just how much longer the Lego brand&nbsp;will still click&nbsp;for Warner Bros.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Lego Movie Leads, But Joins List of Diminishing Sequels(Photo by Warner Bros.)Another early record of 2019 that was expected to fall was Glass’ top opening weekend of $40.3 million. Lowball projections on The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (84% on the Tomatometer) were at $45 million with an uptick to a potential $60 million. That estimate was reasonable given the diminishing returns of the series: 2014’s The Lego Movie (95%) opened to $69 million and finished with over $257 million;&nbsp;2017 spin-off, The Lego Batman Movie (90%), also opening in February, began with $53 million and ended with $175 million; and in the same year, the September release of The Lego Ninjago Movie (56%) grossed a total of just $59 million, but had little connection to the other films. This is why the $34.4 million start for the sequel is such an eye-raiser.The $99 million production has history on its side for at least cracking the $100 million mark. The only animated film to open with more than $32 million and not reach the milestone was the R-rated Sausage Party. But anything less than $150 million total is going to feel like a real disappointment. The first two Lego movies were bigger successes in North America than internationally with totals that came in at $469 and $311 million, respectively. So if the law of diminishing returns is any indication, The Second Part is not going to reach the $300 million worldwide it is going to need to break even. Looking at sequels over the years, some of the biggest drops in opening weekends are as follows:Alice in Wonderland (2010) / Alice Through the Looking Glass ($116.1 million to $26.8 million)Bruce Almighty / Evan Almighty ($67.9 million to $31.1 million)The Lego Movie / The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part ($69 million to $34.4 million)Clash of the Titans (2010) / Wrath of the Titans ($61.2 million to $33.4 million)Sex and the City / Sex and the City 2 ($57 million to $31 million)Ghost Rider / Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance ($45.3 million to $22.1 million)Happy Feet / Happy Feet 2 ($41.5 million to $21.2 million)Rotten Returns:&nbsp;The Prodigy&nbsp;Sinks&nbsp;to the Bottom of the Box Office Horror Class(Photo by Orion Pictures)This week, the&nbsp;resurfaced Orion Pictures dropped a trailer for the new Child’s Play reboot being released this summer. Hopefully, they will see better returns for their creepy-doll film than their creepy-kid film this weekend. The Prodigy opened to just $6 million, which is weak even for February horror. Last year’s Winchester made $9.3 million over Super Bowl weekend. Hell Fest ($5.1 million opening) and The Possession of Hannah Grace ($6.4 million) each failed to reach $15 million total. Even for a mere $6 million price tag (before distribution and advertising costs), The Prodigy (45% on the Tomatometer) is not looking like much of a winner for Orion.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Men and Pursuit Don’t Live Up to Predecessors(Photo by Paramount Pictures)What Men Want&nbsp;(48% on the Tomatometer) is not the same story that Nancy Meyers’ What Women Want was back in 2000 when it opened to $33 million and grossed over $182 million. But $19 million is still a decent start for the $20 million production from Paramount. The film should see a Valentine’s Day bump on Thursday even with competition from Rebel Wilson’s&nbsp;Isn’t It Romantic&nbsp;and finish with over $60 million. The final new release of the week, the darkly comic revenge tale Cold Pursuit, an American remake of Norwegian film, In Order of Disappearance, made $10.8 million, which is less than recent Liam Neeson films, The Commuter ($13.7 million) and Run All Night ($11 million). The latest film’s 74% Tomatometer score is Neeson’s best starring vehicle with critics since 2012’s&nbsp;The Grey&nbsp;(79%), however — though the actor did appear in acclaimed films Widows (91%), The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (91%), Silence (83%), and A Monster Calls (86%).M. Night Shyamalan’s Glass, which had led the box office for the past three weeks, dropped to fifth place for a total gross of $98.4 million so far, which is nearly $9 million behind the pace of The Village, but the film is well into the black for Universal and Blumhouse with over $221 million worldwide. The Upside jumped over Glass on the chart this week after just an 17% drop, and with nearly $86 million, it will be taking a serious run at $100 million. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse crossed $350 million worldwide while the fifth-highest grossing film of 2018, Aquaman, is just a bit more than $11 million away from becoming the 20th highest-grossing film of all-time worldwide.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Terrorists, Rabbits, and S&amp;M Led the Way at the Box Office(Photo by Universal Pictures)Five days before Valentine’s Day, audiences got the final chapter of Fifty Shades Freed which led the way with $38.5 million. While mom and dad were seeing that, their kids were in the next theater over watching Peter Rabbit. The bunny tale finished second with $25 million, but ultimately outgrossed Christian and Anastasia $115.2 million to $100.4 million. Clint Eastwood’s first film of 2018, The 15:17 To Paris, made $12.5 million for third place, helping to knock the three-peating Jumanji: Welcome to Jungle back to fourth where it crossed $365 million. The top 10 films grossed $113.8 million and averaged just 51% on the Tomatometer. This week’s top 10 grossed an estimated $96.4 million and averaged 59.3% with critics here.On the Vine:&nbsp;Romance, Horror, and Cyberpunk Invade Valentine’s Day(Photo by 20th Century Fox)It is going to be a crowded Valentine’s Day week at the box office. Getting a jump on Wednesday is Rebel Wilson in Isn’t It Romantic, a Groundhog Day–like take on romantic comedies, as well as horror sequel Happy Death Day 2U. Then on Thursday comes Robert Rodriguez’s Alita: Battle Angel, which was pushed from its December release date and hopes to generate enough interest worldwide to cover its budget, reported to be as high as $200 million.

Anyone see Escape Room? Some of you did. More than prognosticators expected. Still, many more of you were out catching up on all the holiday releases and continuing to add to that 2018 box office record. In another 11 months or so we’ll probably be talking about 2019’s record year, but let’s get through week one first – a week aided by schools still being on holiday break and&nbsp;that&nbsp;DCEU behemoth.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;On Top For Third Weekend, Eyes Global $1 Billion(Photo by Warner Bros.)Aquaman is not going anywhere. Not at least until Glass dethrones what should be a four-week run atop the box office on January 18. The last film to do that was Black Panther. While Aquaman won’t quite reach the heights of last year’s box office champion, it is fixing to do something that not Batman, Superman, nor even Wonder Woman could do in DC’s extended universe. For the first time since Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight films, a DC property is going to reach the $1 billion mark worldwide. Aquaman is the sixth-highest grossing film ever in December after 17 days and is looking at a final domestic gross somewhere in between Peter Jackson’s The Two Towers ($339 million) and The Return of the King ($377 million.) James Wan’s film had a better third weekend (and first week of January) than either of those films, and its international total currently stands at $940 million. Not only will it be the fifth film&nbsp;released in 2018 to cross the billion dollar mark, but it will be the fifth film in Warner Bros.’ history to do it after the final Harry Potter chapter, the two Dark Knight sequels, and the first Hobbit film.The Rest of the Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Escape Room&nbsp;Manages a Break Out(Photo by @ Sony)Sony went a little Blumhouse on us this weekend with the low-budget and respectable opening of Escape Room.&nbsp;Critics weren’t too harsh on the $9 million production – especially for a horror flick released in January – giving it a 53% on the Tomatometer, and it grossed $18 million this weekend. That puts it in between 2010’s&nbsp;Legion and 2004’s&nbsp;The Butterfly Effect for January horror openings. Audience response&nbsp; suggests it could fall in&nbsp;the same final range of those films, between $40 million and $50 million. Sony’s success continues with Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse which will be heading into profit soon with a final estimate that continues to rise; the film now looks to finish with around $172 million. But on the other end of the spectrum for Sony, Holmes &amp; Watson is proving to be a real embarrassment. It could become just the second film to open on Christmas Day with more than $5 million and not reach $40 million.&nbsp;Holmes &amp; Watson’s had a $42 million production budget and has currently earned $28.4 million.Disney’s Mary Poppins Returns is still hoping to forge a path to clear $200 million. As of now it should have no problem passing comparable past December opener&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows’ $186 million, but it is going to need some solid daily holds to maintain the pace of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, which opened mid December in 2011 and&nbsp;finished with $209 million. Ralph Breaks the Internet has a clearer path to the milestone, likely finishing somewhere between $200 and $205 million. However, with an international total of just $217.6 million to date, Ralph is still well in the red for Disney.(Photo by @ Paramount Pictures)In a few days, Bumblebee will become the 33rd&nbsp;film released in 2018 to reach $100 million. It is still $22 million behind Transformers: The Last Knight’s pace overall, but posted nearly twice as much in its third weekend as that film, so there is still hope that the best-reviewed (and only Fresh) Transformers film will not have the lowest-grossing domestic run of the series. There is also some good news for Clint Eastwood’s The Mule. Only one December film has ever reached $80 million in its first 24 days and not finished with over $100 million; that was WB’s 2008 film,&nbsp;Yes Man, with Jim Carrey ($97.6 million). The Mule, which has not yet opened outside the U.S., will need roughly $50 million internationally to get into the black for the studio.In limited release, Destroyer led this week’s per-theater-average with $18,335 in six theaters, followed by Cold War ($15,500 on the same number of screens) for totals of $110,012 and $93,000, respectively. Focus’ On the Basis of Sex expanded into 112 theaters and grossed $1.67 million, a $14,920 average per screen. Then there was Stan &amp; Ollie&nbsp;with a $12,022 average in eight theaters. Also expanding were Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk, now in 335 theaters, and Mary Queen of Scots,&nbsp;which added 211 theaters for a total of 1,052. They grossed $1.84 and $2.2 million, respectively. The Favourite also continues to chug along adding $1.97 million for a total gross of $19.3 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;Finally Beats out&nbsp;The Last Jedi(Photo by @ Columbia Pictures)© Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection2018 kicked off with Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;celebrating a box office victory in its third week, but Insidious: The Last Key was no slouch either with a $29.5 million start for second place. The Post and Phantom Thread continued to lead the per-theater-average list in limited release with $47,167 and $40,040 per screen, respectively. The&nbsp;top 10 grossed a total of $144.1 million and scored an average of 69.9% on the Tomatometer. This year’s&nbsp;top 10 grossed an estimated $118.1 million and averaged 64.8% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine: Kevin Hart and Keanu Reeves In Two Long-Delayed Films(Photo by © STX Entertainment)Two long-delayed projects go up against a puppy next week, even as one is expected to be a dog. The Upside, starring Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017 when it was owned by the Weinstein Co. A few scandals later and STX is now finally releasing the remake of 2012’s&nbsp;The Intouchables, one of the most successful films of all time in France. It will go up against Keanu Reeves in the sci-fi clone film, Replicas, which was filmed back in 2016 and is likely to arrive with a thud. Then Charles Martin Smith, the actor-turned-director&nbsp;who helmed&nbsp;Air Bud and the Dolphin Tale films, brings us&nbsp;A Dog’s Way Home, not to be confused with 2017’s A Dog’s Purpose, nor its 2019 sequel, A Dog’s Journey. Finally, On the Basis of Sex expands nationwide.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;January 4-6Aquaman&nbsp;– $30.7 million ($259.7 million total)Escape Room&nbsp;– $18 million ($18 million total)Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;– $15.8 ($138.7 million total)Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse– $13 million ($133.9 million total)Bumblebee&nbsp;– $12.8 million ($97.1 million total)The&nbsp;Mule&nbsp;– $9 million ($81.1 million total)Vice&nbsp;– $5.8 million ($29.8 million total)Second Act&nbsp;– $4.9 million ($32.9 million total)Ralph Breaks the Internet&nbsp;– $4.7 million ($187.2 million total)Holmes &amp; Watson&nbsp;– $3.4 million ($28.4 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Comic, fiction, Horror, we, Netflix, Mary, 2019, romantic, the, vampires, criterion, caribbean, Arrowverse, zombies, Red","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/05121415/Aquaman-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-aquaman-set-to-be-first-dceu-film-to-make-1-billion"},{"id":"47509089328597","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Captain Marvel Soars to Glowing Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Captain Marvel Soars to Glowing DebutPlus, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World and A Madea Family Funeral pull into second and third on the weekend of March 8-10.by Erik Childress | March 10, 2019 |  CommentsAs Marvel properties go, Captain Marvel&nbsp;just broke into the top 25 best-reviewed entries with an 80% on the Tomatometer (Iron Man 3&nbsp;and Captain America: The First Avenger are&nbsp;also at 80%), but there was no stopping its power at the box office this weekend. That sound you heard was Carol Danvers leading the charge to the 18th highest opening weekend in history.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Captain Marvel Shines(Photo by Marvel Studios)Coming in right between other female-led hero movies (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and The Hunger Games) on the all-time chart, Captain Marvel scored a $153 million three-day haul, which included $20.7 million on Thursday.&nbsp; It was the 16th film to make at least $20 million from Thursday night previews; eight of which are comic book adaptations and five of which belong to Marvel. It was also the third highest opening ever in March behind Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;($174.7 million) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($166 million). But now comes the word-of-mouth test.Only three films have ever opened to $150 million or more and failed to reach $400 million. They were Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Spider-Man 3, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. They were all sequels, though, so the Captain has a little history on her side. Wonder Woman opened to $103 million and nearly pulled off a 4x multiple with a final gross of $412.5 million. Captain Marvel&nbsp;already has a slight edge and we will continue to monitor its progress week to week on where it stands. Among Marvel films in the 70% range on the Tomatometer, Captain Marvel joins Thor, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Iron Man 2, and The Amazing Spider-Man.Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Dragon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Madea Can’t Compete,&nbsp;Apollo 11 Squeaks In(Photo by @ DreamWorks Animation)How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World dropped 51% to $14.6 million, joining a small collection of films to have between $119-120 million on their 17th day – Sex and the City, Hotel Transylvania 3, and San Andreas. Upping the total to the $121 million range, only the first Mission: Impossible film managed to climb to over $177 million, the haul for the second Dragon film. The third film currently looks to finish in the range of $160 million – or what Captain Marvel nearly did in just three days. It’s worldwide total stands at $435 million. A Madea Family Funeral had its expected 55% drop, but at the end of its second weekend, it is only behind four of Perry’s films – Madea Goes to Jail, Boo!: A Madea Halloween, Why Did I Get Married Too?, and Madea’s Family Reunion.As for the so-called #AlitaChallenge urging people to boycott one female-led superhero movie owned by Disney for another under a company soon to be controlled by Disney, Alita: Battle Angel dropped 55% and now has a domestic total of $78 million and global tally of $382 million. Until that latter number leaps over $500 million, there is no sense talking about it being any semblance of a success story. Captain Marvel, meanwhile, has already grossed $455 Million worldwide. Speaking of space adventures though, Neon’s documentary, Apollo 11, continues to do strong business, grossing another $1.3 million in just 400 theaters, many of them IMAX. It has grossed $3.7 million to date.This Time Last Year: No&nbsp;Wrinkle for&nbsp;Panther(Photo by Walt Disney Pictures)A Wrinkle In Time nearly gave Black Panther some competition, but by the end of the weekend its $33.1 million was not enough to best the $40.8 million of the now four-time champion. The horror sequel, Strangers: Prey at Night, mustered up $10.4 million for third, but&nbsp;The Hurricane Heist ($3.02 million) and Gringo ($2.72 million) were both dead on arrival. The Top Ten films grossed at total of $123.1 million and averaged 59.9% on the Tomatometer. This year’s Top Ten grossed an estimated $197.3 Million and averaged 72.4% in part thanks to the 100% approval of Apollo 11 as well as Fighting With My Family (92%) and How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (91%).On the Vine: Amusement Parks and A Sick Romance to Pose No&nbsp;Marvel Challenge(Photo by Paramount Animation)A great number of limited releases will be spread out around the country include the sci-fi thriller, Captive State, Keira Knightley’s WWII drama The Aftermath, and Matthias Schoenaerts in the Sundance prison entry&nbsp;The Mustang. Falling behind the second week of Captain Marvel in wide release though will be Paramount’s animated amusement park comedy&nbsp;Wonder Park&nbsp;and Haley Lu Richardson in the sick-teen romance&nbsp;Five Feet Apart, neither of which are likely to be competing for the top spot at the box office.The Full Top 10: March 8-10Captain Marvel (2019)  79% –&nbsp;$153 million ($153 million total)How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019)  90% –&nbsp;$14.7 million ($119.66 million total)Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral (2019)  11% – $12.05 million ($45.88 million total)The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part (2019)  84% –&nbsp;$3.83 million ($97.11 million total)Alita: Battle Angel (2019)  61% –&nbsp;$3.2 million ($78.35 million total)Green Book (2018)  77% – $2.49 million ($80.14 million total)Isn't It Romantic (2019)  70%&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.41 million ($44.15 million total)Fighting with My Family (2019)  93%&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.19 million ($18.66 million total)Greta (2019)  60% – $2.16 million ($8.25 million total)Apollo 11 (2019)  99%&nbsp;–&nbsp;$1.3 million ($3.78 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Talk, canceled, of, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/10122828/Captain_Marvel_BO_Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-captain-marvel-soars-to-glowing-debut"},{"id":"47509089340892","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Glass Smashes Holiday Box Office with $47 Million","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Glass Smashes Holiday Box Office with $47 MillionPlus Dragon Ball Super: Broly has a super six days and Bohemian Rhapsody edges closer to $800 million worldwide on weekend of January 18-21.by Erik Childress | January 21, 2019 |  CommentsM. Night Shyamalan’s highly anticipated&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;may&nbsp;not be blowing away the critics, but audiences still showed up for the director on the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday weekend. Will they stick with the film over the coming low-competition weeks? Let’s look at the numbers.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;Has&nbsp;Third-Best Holiday Weekend, But May Have A Ceiling(Photo by @ Universal Pictures)With an estimated take of $47 million over the four-day MLK holiday, Glass&nbsp;just missed besting the $48.6 million that Ride Along made on the same weekend back in 2014. (American Sniper is still the highest grosser over this weekend with $107.2 million in 2015.) How does the&nbsp;Glass&nbsp;opening compare to the director’s other hits?&nbsp;Shyamalan’s Signs opened to $60.1 million in 2002;&nbsp;The Village opened with&nbsp;$50.7 million two years later. The audience response to that film – a final gross just 2.25 times its opening – appeared to be the beginning of the decline for the filmmaker once dubbed “the next Spielberg.” Total grosses continued to&nbsp;fall with Lady in the Water ($42.2 million) and&nbsp;The Happening ($64.5 million). Big-budget bombs like The Last Airbender and After Earth&nbsp;came next, and it looked like it might be over the man friends call “Night.” Enter Blumhouse Productions.Working with smaller budgets seemed to give Shyamalan new life. After The Visit was a moderate hit, he had one of the biggest financial successes of his career with Split, which made almost $280 million globally and cost just&nbsp;$9 million to make. Given anticipation for&nbsp;Glass, it felt certain it would beat&nbsp;Split‘s Friday-to-Sunday opening back in 2017, and it did, but only by&nbsp;$575,025 with Sunday totals boosted by the holiday. By all accounts&nbsp;Glass should become just the sixth true January opener ever to reach $100 million (the other 14 films to earn over $100 million from a “January” launch either began limited runs in December or were a special edition of Star Wars.) The film may still be able to pull a&nbsp;three-week&nbsp;run atop the box office, but those weekend-winning numbers could be in the low teens by then – and poor reviews won’t help (the movie is at 36% on the Tomatometer). If Miss Bala somehow manages to beat it on February 1,&nbsp;it may be a sign that fans are starting to turn on the filmmaker again. If The Kid Who Would Be King can somehow get over $16 million, it could be taken down this coming weekend.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Dragon Ball&nbsp;Has a Super Six Days(Photo by @ FUNimation/ courtesy Everett Collection)FUNimation is one of the premier distributors of anime on the home entertainment market, but&nbsp;it has had some notable theatrical releases over the past four years, like Shin Godzilla (85%) and Your Name (97%), which have caught the attention of critics as well.&nbsp;This week they can celebrate their biggest box office success to date:&nbsp;Dragon Ball Super: Broly opened on Wednesday with $7.04 million in just 1,440 theaters (including 180 IMAX venues). No only is that more than Unbreakable made on its opening Wednesday before Thanksgiving ($6.8 million), but only three films since 2000 have begun their run in 1,400-1,500 theaters and grossed over $7 million. And they did it in a weekend. They were Tyler Perry’s Diary of a Mad Black Woman ($21.9 million), Breach ($10.5 million), and Nurse Betty ($7.14 million).&nbsp;Broly added $9.7 million over the three-day weekend and an estimated $11.4 million over the holiday for a total of $21.9 million. FUNimation’s highest-grossing film before this weekend&nbsp;was Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ which made just over $8 million total in 2015.The Rest of the Top 10 and Beyond: More Milestones Crossed for&nbsp;Aquaman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody(Photo by @ Warner Bros. Pictures)Last week’s no. 1 film, The Upside, is turning into a real story for STX Films.&nbsp;With just a 26% drop this weekend, plus nothing on the hook besides its advertising and whatever was spent to pry it away from Harvey Weinstein, the film is headed towards being their second biggest success after Bad Moms.Aquaman passed the $300 million mark domestically this weekend but, more importantly, is now the 27th&nbsp;all-time&nbsp;earner worldwide and is poised to be the highest-grossing film based on a DC property ever when it passes The Dark Knight Rises. Over on the Marvel side, Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse has also crossed the $300 million line&nbsp;worldwide. It has also leapfrogged Mary Poppins Returns in domestic dollars, which also just crossed the global $300 million threshold.&nbsp;Bumblebee is besting both of them on that front with over $413 million, which is still $187 million less than Transformers: The Last Knight (though it still has a shot to beat that film’s domestic total).Finally, this week Bohemian Rhapsody will be passing two huge and unexpected milestones: The movie reached $200 million here at home this weekend and later this week it will hit $800 million worldwide. That makes it the seventh&nbsp;highest-grossing film of 2018 behind four comic book films and two sequels. An extraordinary accomplishment&nbsp;ahead of likely Oscar nominations this Tuesday.This Time Last Year: Battle of the Brawn(Photo by David James /© Warner Bros.

Neither number was strong enough to beat Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle which held onto the&nbsp;no. 1 spot for a third straight week as it crossed the $300 million mark. On the same weekend, Star Wars: The Last Jedi was passing $600 million, Coco got over $200 million, and Pitch Perfect 3 reached $100 million. The young-adult drama, Forever My Girl, barely made the&nbsp;top 10 with $4.2 million. The&nbsp;top 10 films last year grossed $104.1 million and averaged 61.7% on the Tomatometer. This year’s&nbsp;top 10&nbsp;grossed an estimated $109.7 million from Friday-to-Sunday and averaged 66.7%.On the Vine:&nbsp;The Kid Who Would Be King&nbsp;Not Likely to Take the Throne(Photo by Kerry Brown / © 2018 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.)Attack the Block director Joe Cornish returns to theaters for the first time in eight years with The Kid Who Would Be King, a new riff on the Arthurian legend that is&nbsp;currently at a healthy 87% on the Tomatometer.

You’ll note, though, the gap between the two titles is shrinking. What was good news for last week’s winners was not so great news for this week’s newcomers, with audiences delivering mostly disappointing results for a long-anticipated Neil Armstrong biopic, a&nbsp;Goosebumps&nbsp;sequel sans Jack Black, and Cabin in the Woods‘&nbsp;Drew Goddard’s latest.King of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;First Man&nbsp;Faces Tough Box Office Mission(Photo by @ Universal)Amongst the new releases, Damien Chazelle’s First Man did indeed come out on top even if it only&nbsp;managed an overall third-place finish with $16.5 million. How does that fare in the cinematic space race? In 1995, Apollo 13 opened in June to $25.3 million, and when&nbsp;Hidden Figures finally expanded into wide release in January 2017, it grossed $22.8 million. Both of those films went on to gross $172 and $169 million, respectively. Those numbers appear out of reach for First Man right now,&nbsp;but you’d be wise not to write the movie off too soon: Universal may be playing the long game here, given the film’s award prospects.The trouble for now seems to be the timing of the movie’s release. Opening&nbsp;seven days&nbsp;after&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;has proven a challenge – that word-of-mouth movie has eaten up a ton of the adult moviegoing dollars. Meanwhile, opening just a&nbsp;week after a Marvel film – even one many purported to have no interest in – was&nbsp;always going to be tough. And Universal will be playing against itself when it releases&nbsp;Halloween next week. David Gordon Green’s modernization of the 1978 slasher classic is expected to bring in huge numbers, which provides even less room for First Man to take off.Where might the movie finally land at the box office?&nbsp;First Man&nbsp;has an 88% Tomatometer score, which is right in the vicinity of Apollo 13’s and&nbsp;Hidden Figures’ 95% and 92%, respectively. Films that opened in the $14.5-$18.5 million range in October have an average multiple of 3.36, while films that opened in October, since 2003, with Tomatometers between 83% and 93% had an average final multiple of 3.62. (That group includes Best Picture nominees The Martian, Captain Phillips, Bridge of Spies, The Departed, and Michael Clayton.) So let’s give First Man a final domestic range of between $55 and $75 million. It has made another $8.6 million internationally so far.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;El Royale&nbsp;and&nbsp;Goosebumps&nbsp;sequel struggle against strong competition(Photo by @ 20th Century Fox)Bad Times at the El Royale&nbsp;checked in&nbsp;at a lower-than-expected $7.2 million.&nbsp;Drew Goddard’s&nbsp;film, which currently sits at 71% on the Tomatometer, continues a trend of low returns for movies focused on strangers in hotels. Earlier this year,&nbsp;Hotel Artemis grossed a total of just $6.7 million. The new movie likely suffered from competing with a number of higher-profile adult-focused offerings, including the&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;juggernaut and&nbsp;First Man.Meanwhile, Sony’s&nbsp;Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween&nbsp;landed in theaters without lead Jack Black, and the numbers for the sequel are down all over.&nbsp;The new movie has a 43% Tomatometer score, compared to the original’s&nbsp;72%,&nbsp;and made $16.2 million compared to the first movie’s $23.6 million. The good news for Sony: It also had a significantly lower production budget than the original.The Rest of the Top 10:&nbsp;Venom,&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;Chasing More October Records(Photo by Neal Preston/© Warner Bros.)Venom may have dropped 55% from last weekend, but it was still enough for a narrow victory over A Star Is Born, and it maintains a $20 million edge over October’s all-time champion, Gravity.&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;has currently earned $142.8 million, and&nbsp;no film to have grossed over $130 million in its first 10 days has ever failed to hit the $200 million mark. Last week, A Star Is Born finished $36 million behind Venom for second place; this week it is behind by just under $8 million, and its $94.1 million after 10 days is the fourth best first 10 days ever in October. The fifth-best October 10-day gross was Shark Tale, and it finished with $160 million.Fox’s&nbsp;The Hate U Give, Certified Fresh at 97%, expanded to 242 theaters and made $1.76 million for a total of nearly $2.5 million to date; it expands further next week. The best per-theater-average of the weekend, though, belongs to Amazon’s award hopeful, Beautiful Boy, with Steve Carell and Timothée Chalamet. The film, which has a Tomatometer score of 64%, grossed $221,437 in just four theaters, giving it a per-theater-average of $55,359. Only Free Solo ($294,288) and&nbsp;Eighth Grade ($263,797)&nbsp;have done better opening on four screens this year.This Time Last Year: Happy Days for&nbsp;Death(Photo by @ Universal)Happy Death Day took over the&nbsp;no. 1 spot from Blade Runner 2049 with a $26 million haul. The film, which was made for less than $5 million, went on to gross over $122 million. A sequel is slated for next Valentine’s Day. Jackie Chan returned to theaters in The Foreigner, his first English-language live-action film since 2010’s The Karate Kid remake; it took in just $13.1 million, but finished with over $145 million worldwide. The top 10 films for October 13-15 last year&nbsp;grossed a combined $88.7 million and averaged 65.5% on the Tomatometer; this weekend’s top 10 grossed an estimated $128.1 million and averaged 67.2% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine: Michael Myers Returns to Haddonfield,&nbsp;As the 100% Club Comes to Theaters(Photo by Ryan Green/ © Universal)Forty years after John Carpenter’s seminal classic Halloween opened comes, well,&nbsp;Halloween, which&nbsp;is sitting at 86% on the Tomatometer.&nbsp;The movie, which ignores every sequel that came before it, and stars Jamie Lee Curtis once again as Laurie Strode, is expected to comfortably dispose of the competition.&nbsp;Elsewhere, look out for a number of buzzy, critically acclaimed films opening in limited release, all of which currently have Tomatometer scores of 100%:&nbsp;Can You Ever Forgive Me?,&nbsp;with Melissa McCarthy and Richard E. Grant, and which tells the true story of Lee Israel and the infamous letter-writing fraud she perpetrated; Paul Dano’s directorial debut,&nbsp;Wildlife, with Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal; and Danish cop thriller,&nbsp;The Guilty. Not to be outdone: Jonah Hill’s directorial debut,&nbsp;Mid90s,&nbsp;is also opening; it&nbsp;sits – appropriately – at 90% on the Tomatometer.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;October 12-14Venom –&nbsp;$35.7 million ($142.8 million total)A Star Is Born&nbsp;– $28 million ($94.1 million total)First Man&nbsp;–&nbsp;$16.5 million ($16.5 million total)Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween&nbsp;– $16.2 million ($16.2 million total)Smallfoot&nbsp;– $9.3 million ($57.6 million total)Night School&nbsp;–&nbsp;$8 million ($59.8 million total)Bad Times at the El Royale –&nbsp;$7.2 million ($7.2 million total)The House With a Clock In Its Walls – $3.9 million ($62.2 million total)The Hate U Give–&nbsp;$1.7 million ($2.4 million total)A Simple Favor&nbsp;– $1.3 million ($52 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Netflix, Arrowverse, Comics, Musical, thirty, TV, Amazon, Teen, razzies, Awards, Emmys, Competition","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/13170213/Venom-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-venom-fends-off-first-man-for-second-weekend-at-no-1"},{"id":"47509090603495","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Bohemian Rhapsody Is Box Office Champion With $50 Million Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Bohemian Rhapsody Is Box Office Champion With $50 Million OpeningThe Freddie Mercury biopic posts one of the all-time biggest openings for a musician-centered film on the weekend of November 2-4.by Erik Childress | November 4, 2018 |  CommentsIt was classical ballet vs. arena rock as&nbsp;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&nbsp;took on&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;at the box office this weekend. As expected, the story of Queen’s frontman, Freddie Mercury, rocked the competition. The movie earned $50 million, making it one of the highest openings ever for a movie centered around a musician.Queen of the&nbsp;New Crop: Critics May Be Lukewarm, But Audiences Are Hot for Mercury BiopicJoel MearesBeca and the Barden Bellas, N.W.A., B-Rabbit (a.k.a. Eminem), and now Queen: Those are the subjects of the music-themed films (not straight musicals) with the biggest openings ever. Bohemian Rhapsody’s $50 million start even bested Bradley Cooper’s A Star is Born which, just a month ago, started with $42.9 million and remains a force at the box office. With this big of an opening there is a good chance Bohemian Rhapsody – which is teetering on just Fresh at 60% on the Tomatometer –&nbsp;could be no. 1&nbsp;next weekend too, though a certain green guy may have something to say about that.Among the historical November openings most similar to Bohemian Rhapsody’s first weekend, six are animated films. One of the other four happens to be 2002’s&nbsp;8 Mile, which began with $51.2 million but managed just a 2.27 multiple afterwards for a final haul of $116.7 million. Queen has a broader appeal (as does a PG-13 rating), so it should be able to fly right past that. The other non-animated films on the list of similar November openings are&nbsp;The Matrix Revolutions ($48.4 million opening / $139.3 million total), Die Another Day ($47 million / $160.9 million), and Interstellar ($47.5 million / $188.0 million).As of this weekend, A Star is Born is up to a 3.86 multiple and continues to climb after its fifth straight week of eight-digit weekend earnings. The top three openers on the music-themed movies list (ranging from $51.2 million to $69.2 million for their opening weekends) have multiples of just 2.66 (Pitch Perfect 2),&nbsp;2.67 (Straight Outta Compton), and the aforementioned&nbsp;2.27 (the aforementioned 8 Mile). With those numbers in mind,&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody could end up with a final total of&nbsp;between $126 million and $193 million. The smart money is likely somewhere in the middle.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Nutcracker&nbsp;Fails to Draw Big Holiday Crowds(Photo by Laurie Sparham /© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is the sixth film since 1986 to feature Tchaikovsky’s seasonal ballet in the title. Its&nbsp;$20 million opening weekend&nbsp;is almost quadruple the combined grosses of those previous five films ($5.88 million). Time for a celebratory dance, right? But here’s the thing. Not only is this the worst-reviewed Disney film since Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, with a Tomatometer score of 34%, but its opening weekend is the lowest opening for a Disney project released in over 3,000 theaters since the back-to-back releases of The BFG ($18.7 million) and Pete’s Dragon ($21.5 million) in the summer of 2016. Lasse Hallström’s film (with re-shoots by a co-credited Joe Johnston) cost nearly as much as The BFG (reportedly somewhere between $120 million and $133 million), so it will need to over-perform significantly overseas.&nbsp;Thankfully, the Mouse House still has Marvel, Pixar, and Episode IX to help cover the cost, not to mention the return of&nbsp;Mary Poppins later in the year.The Rest of the Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;Slides,&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;Soars, and&nbsp;Boy Erased and&nbsp;A Private War&nbsp;Light Up Specialty Box Office(Photo by © Universal)Halloween ruled the box office for the last two weeks. However, Octover 31 is over and audiences are starting to abandon it fast. A 65% drop this week puts the film at just over $150 million. Looking historically at films that had earned box office totals in that range after 17 days, the lowest grosser is X-Men Origins: Wolverine, with a total take of $179.8 million. If&nbsp;Halloween&nbsp;can get there, it will&nbsp;surpass Get Out as Blumhouse’s highest domestic grosser to date. Not so fast though. XMO: Wolverine had a third weekend of $14.7 million; Tim Burton’s Planet of the Apes, which finished with $180 million, made $13.3 million; and The Simpsons Movie made $11.2 million on its third weekend, though went on to&nbsp;finish&nbsp;with $183.1 million. Halloween made $11 million this weekend. If Halloween drops below $6.8 million next week, Jordan Peele’s Oscar-winning film is going to start breathing a little easier.Because they’re so heavily frontloaded, only 45% of Marvel films have managed a 2.60 multiple or higher over their opening weekend. Venom, which will be hitting $200 million in the next week, needs to earn $208.7 million to&nbsp;enter that club. Meanwhile, A Star is Born is climbing its way to one of the biggest multiples of 2018 for wide openers. With $165 million to date, it currently has the 10th&nbsp;best multiple of the year, and the seventh best of movies opening in more than 3,000 theaters. The year’s champion remains WB’s Crazy Rich Asians, with a 6.52 multiple.Tyler Perry had a new film with Tiffany Haddish out this weekend called Nobody’s Fool. It finished third with $13.8 million, which is the filmmaker’s third weakest opening ever ahead of just Daddy’s Little Girls ($11.2 million) and The Single Moms Club ($8 million). Nobody’s Fool&nbsp;is the ninth&nbsp;film directed by Perry to hit 25% or below on the Tomatometer.(Photo by Paul Conroy / © Aviron / courtesy Everett Collection)In limited release, Beautiful Boy was bumped up to 540 theaters this weekend and it grossed $1.4 million for a total of $3.2 million to date. That’s just a $2,620 per-theater-average, which&nbsp;is just below the expansion of Luca Guadagnino’s Suspiria (61% on the Tomatometer): Last week, the horror remake had the highest PTA of the year in just two theaters, but after adding another 309 to that total it grossed just $964,722 for an average of $3,102 per theater. Joseph Kahn’s rap-battle festival favorite, Bodied (Certified Fresh at 87%), made $50,528 for a $3,609 average in 14 theaters. In another corner of the music world, Sony Classics’ documentary, Maria By Callas, posted a $9,540 average in 16 theaters for a total of $152,633. Lee Chang-dong’s Burning (94% on the Tomatometer), released by Well Go, just beat that out with a $9,592 average in six theaters. Its total stands at $97,299. Leading the PTA battle this week was&nbsp;Joel Edgerton’s&nbsp;Boy Erased, Certified Fresh at 85%, which made&nbsp;$220,000 in five theaters, followed by&nbsp;A Private War (88% on the Tomatometer), featuring an incredible Rosamund Pike,&nbsp;which made $72,000 in four theaters.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Psychedelic&nbsp;Ragnarok&nbsp;Anchors a Huge Weekend(Photo by © Marvel / © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures /Courtesy Everett Collection)Marvel kicked off the holiday box office with a bang when Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;opened with $122.7 million. That film’s earnings made up 68% of all grosses tracked that weekend and was the ninth&nbsp;highest opening for a Marvel film at the time. Since then, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and Deadpool 2 have knocked it back to 12th. A Bad Moms Christmas&nbsp;opened on Wednesday and managed $21.2 million in its first five days; the first film made $23.8 million in its first three days. As for milestones, It crossed the $325 million mark in its ninth weekend. The top 10 films grossed a total of $164.6 million and averaged 53.9% on the Tomatometer; this year the top 10 earned an estimated total gross of $128.3 million and is currently averaging 57.1% with critics.On the Vine: Christmas Set To Be Stolen, Once Again(Photo by @ Universal)The studio behind Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets, and Sing&nbsp;is set to deliver their next major success when Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch gets the Illumination treatment. The film, featuring the voice talent of Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead mean role, should have legs as it plays into the holiday season. Meanwhile,&nbsp;it’s Claire Foy’s turn to play Lisbeth Salander in The Girl in the Spider’s Web, director Fede Alvarez’s follow-up to his successful thriller, Don’t Breathe. The movie is currently Fresh at 68% based on 22 early reviews. J.J.

Freddie Mercury.King of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;Grinch&nbsp;Steals the Weekend With $66 Million In His Sack(Photo by © Universal)Eighteen years ago, Ron Howard’s How The Grinch Stole Christmas, with Jim Carrey, opened to $55 million on Nov. 17. It went on to do 4.72 times that business and gross over $260 million domestically. Illumination Entertainment, the animation studio behind Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets, and Sing, has a five-film winning streak when it comes to titles besting that Grinch number. (That includes two billion-dollar films and one that came up just $30 million shy.) Funnily enough, the last film Illumination release that did not hit the $260 million mark was Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, which still made $214 million in the spring of 2012 (and was the 11th highest-grossing film of that year.)Their second pass at Dr. Seuss, The Grinch, earned $66 million over the weekend. That is less than The Lorax’s $70.2 million start, but that is probably neither here nor there as The Grinch is well placed for the holidays, even with families going to be divided over the coming weeks with Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald and Ralph Breaks the Internet. Final grosses for animated films that opened in the $60-$70 million range in November are a bit all over the map – with Frozen on the high end ($400.7 million total), and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa on the low ($180 million). Those films received better reviews from critics than The Grinch, though, which sits at 54% on the Tomatometer, making it the fourth almost-Fresh for Illumination after The Lorax (54%), Minions (56%), and Despicable Me 3 (59%). We’ll get more of a sense of the mean one’s longevity next week.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;The Girl&nbsp;Who Struggled at the Box Office(Photo by Nadja Klier / © Columbia )Sony managed to squeeze $102 million out of David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo remake in 2011; seven years later, The Girl in the Spider’s Web has kicked off its box office run with just $8.8 million. (It helps that they dropped the budget from $90 million down to $43 million.) Sure, Fincher’s film started with just $12.7 million and managed an 8.02 multiple with better reviews (86% vs. 44% on the Tomatometer), but the studio is certainly not going to replicate the success of last year’s big mystery, Murder on the Orient Express. Since 1990, films that opened between $7.5 million and $8.5 million in November have had final grosses between $15 million and $31.1 million.Overlord is not doing much better, earning $10.1 million this weekend, despite strong reviews (81% on the Tomatometer). Paramount moved the film out of the path of Halloween&nbsp;(its original slot was October 26), but placed it in a month that has not often been favorable to unestablished horror. The only horror films to open in November with more than $20 million have been Interview with the Vampire, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Sleepy Hollow, and Arnold Schwarzenegger’s End of Days. (If you want to include Eddie Murphy’s The Haunted Mansion on that list, that’s your business.) The next films on that list include Gothika ($19.2 million), I Still Know What You Did Last Summer ($16.5 million), and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein ($11.2 million). It’s all under $11 million from there and that is where Overlord finds itself – with an additional $9.2 million overseas.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;Queen Continues Strong Run with Dream Second Weekend(Photo by © 20th Century Fox)Bohemian Rhapsody, now at 61% on the Tomatometer, had a sensational second weekend. A 41% drop to just $30 million puts the film just ahead of $100 million domestic on its 10th day, if the estimates hold. This path closely resembles, of all things, two James Bond films (Die Another Day and Casino Royale), which each made $31 million and $30.7 million, respectively, in their second weekends, and finished in turn with $160.9 million and $167.4 million. That is the Bohemian path at the moment, and with $285 million worldwide it now becomes one of Fox’s biggest original live-action films since 2015, up there with The Martian, The Revenant, The Greatest Showman, and Hidden Figures.Not to be outdone, Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born’s 27% drop this weekend, taking around $8 million for a total of $178 million, has upped its chances of crossing the $200 million mark; still, only a single film to have earned between $173 million and $183 million after 38 days of release has reached the milestone. That film was Wedding Crashers. Sony’s Venom has already reached that milestone with over $206 million and is standing at over $673 million throughout the world. David Gordon Green’s Halloween is going to have to settle for being Blumhouse’s second biggest all-time domestic grosser, having earned $3.8 million this weekend, and possibly their second biggest worldwide grosser as well. Its totals stand at $156.7 million and $245 million worldwide (Get Out and Split are the current champs with $176 and $278 million, respectively).Finally, in limited-release news, Jason Reitman’s The Front Runner (62% on the Tomatometer) might be showing that audience’s aren’t so interested in political scandal on the big screen: a $56,000 start in just four theaters is less than the documentaries The Cove and Comedian. On the semi-bright side, though, last year’s Roman J. Israel, Esq. started with $61,999 and expanded into a final gross of $11.9 million. Fox Searchlight’s Can You Ever Forgive Me?&nbsp;(Certified Fresh at 98%) added 211 theaters and grossed $1.47 million for a total of $3.6 million. The studio’s The Old Man and the Gun (90% on the Tomatometer) crossed the $10 million line as well. Amazon’s Beautiful Boy (69% on the Tomatometer) is up to $5.1 million after expanding into 776 theaters and grossing $1.40 million this weekend.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;Wins Second Weekend As Oscar Frontrunners Open(Photo by © Marvel Studios)There was no stopping Thor: Ragnarok, which took the top spot at the box office for a second straight week. Its $57 million take put it over the $200 million mark. Second and third place were pretty evenly matched, with Daddy’s Home 2 narrowly edging Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express redux $29.6-to-$28.6 million. Then, in limited release, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, grossed $322,168, making it the second-best four-theater average of 2017. Lady Bird grossed $364,437 the week earlier and finished 10th this week with $1.19 million in just 37 theaters. The top 10 in 2017 grossed a total of $137.8 million and had just a 50.8% average on the Tomatometer; this weekend brought in an estimated $149.8 million and averaged 58.8% on the Tomatometer.On the vine:&nbsp;Can Fantastic&nbsp;Beasts&nbsp;Cast the Usual Potterverse Box Office Spell?(Photo by © Warner Bros. Pictures)Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald continues the prequel series whose first film earned a solid $234 million domestically but made the bulk of its $818 million overseas. Will the addition of Johnny Depp turn some people away or will folks who discovered the film at home turn this into an even bigger success? It is currently at 57% on the Tomatometer, and could potentially end up the first Rotten movie in the Potter franchise. For the adults in the room, Steve McQueen’s Widows opens, and is already Certified Fresh at 94% on the Tomatometer. Meanwhile, Instant Family features Mark Wahlberg and Rose Byrne as newly adoptive parents in a comedy that Paramount hopes to turn into a sleeper hit. The Audience Award winner at the Toronto International Film Festival, Peter Farrelly’s Green Book (93% on the Tomatometer), with Viggo Mortensen and Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali, will open in 20 markets before going wide for Thanksgiving.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;November 9-11The Grinch –&nbsp;$66 million ($66 million total)Bohemian Rhapsody –&nbsp;$30.8 million ($100 million total)Overlord –&nbsp;$10.1 million (10.1 million total)The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&nbsp;– $9.5 million ($35.2 million total)The Girl In the Spider’s Web –&nbsp;$$8.02 million (8.02 million total)A Star Is Born&nbsp;–&nbsp;$8.01 million ($178 million total)Nobody’s Fool – $6.5&nbsp;million ($24.2 million total)Venom&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.8 million ($206.2&nbsp;million total)Halloween – $3.8 ($156.8 million total)The Hate U Give–&nbsp;$2.0 million ($26.7 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Plus, classics, hollywood, free, Valentine's, Set, Geo, criterion, Tubi, social","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/11101634/Grinch-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-the-grinch-steals-a-mean-66-million-to-top-the-weekend"},{"id":"47509090580962","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet Beats The Grinch –&nbsp;But Only Just","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet Beats The Grinch –&nbsp;But Only JustPlus, A Star Is Born gets an awards-season bump and Creed II aims for the Rocky crown on the weekend of December 7-9.by Erik Childress | December 9, 2018 |  CommentsWe’re in week two of the industry’s post-Thanksgiving vacation as it gears up for what could be a really incredible finish to 2018 with Mary Poppins Returns, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and Aquaman&nbsp;opening within days of each other (the latter of those already made $93.6 million in China this weekend). That’s not to mention Holmes and Watson, Bumblebee (reviews are just now starting to trickle in)&nbsp;and whatever audiences make of Vice, The Mule, and Welcome to Marwen. But we’re not there yet.&nbsp;And this week it was – once again – all about the family films.Kings of the&nbsp;New Crop:&nbsp;Ralph&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Grinch&nbsp;In Neck-and-Neck Fight For No. 1(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)While typically there can be only one, we are going with a two-fer here. Not only was the race for the top spot neck-and-neck this weekend, but each&nbsp;is proving a definite winner for the long haul. Ralph Breaks the Internet is already documented as one of the biggest (if not the&nbsp;biggest) Thanksgiving opening for a new release. At $140.8 million on its 19th&nbsp;day, it is wedged between Big Hero 6 and Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa&nbsp;in terms of its cume at this stage in its run, which could put its final gross somewhere between $180 and $222 million, likely making it a top 5 grosser for the holiday season. At this point,&nbsp;The Grinch&nbsp;is saying “hold my beer.” With over $223 million after a full month in release, The Grinch is just a couple million off the pace of The Incredibles, which dropped 61% in its fifth weekend to make $9 million;&nbsp;The Grinch dropped just 15% and made $15 million in its fifth weekend. The Incredibles finished with over $261 million, meaning that The Grinch is headed for the Sing territory of $270 million.The Top 10 and Beyond:&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;Nudges $200 million;&nbsp;Creed II&nbsp;Aims for top of&nbsp;Rocky&nbsp;Franchise(Photo by Barry Wetcher / ©MGM)Let’s start outside of the top 10 with what was perhaps the most notable movement of the weekend:&nbsp;A Star Is Born actually increasing its audience by 32%, and ensuring it will&nbsp;shortly cross the $200 million line as it awaits several more award nominations. Its box office cousin, Bohemian Rhapsody, has now officially fallen off its pace but continues to do well – it is about the cross the $600 million mark worldwide. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald has not reached that number yet,&nbsp;and is on a pace to finish with around $165 million domestically. Its international haul will make it a minor hit for Warner Bros. The last success story in the&nbsp;top 10 this week is Creed II, which continues on pace towards a total domestic haul of $125-$130 million. Inflation notwithstanding, at $127.9 million it would pass Rocky IV to become the highest-grossing film in the Rocky franchise.Moving over to limited releases, The Favourite added 57 theaters and grossed another $1.4 million. The certain Oscar player expands further next week. Amongst newbies, Mary Queen of Scots (68% on the Tomatometer) had the best per-theater-average of the week, with $50,000 in four theaters for a total of $200,000. Ben is Back (Certified Fresh at 86%) with Julia Roberts made less than half of that with $80,972 in four venues; that’s right there with Gus Van Sant’s Don’t Worry He Won’t Get Far On Foot from this summer, which ended up with $1.4 million. Then there is Vox Lux (67%), with Natalie Portman, which grossed $162,252 in six locations, putting it in Bend It Like Beckham territory ($161,528 in 2003). Neon would love to make the $32.5 million generated by that hit, but may be headed more for the $1.9-$2.1 million of Shortbus, I Love You Philip Morris, and Shallow Grave.Finally, Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List is back in theaters for its 25th&nbsp;anniversary. Playing in 1,029 theaters, the film took in $551,000. While this may be on the low-end of re-release grosses, it is still not bad for a three-hour film about the Holocaust re-released during the holidays. Last year’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind 40th&nbsp;Anniversary release opened to $1.76 million in 901 theaters. For its&nbsp;20th&nbsp;anniversary,&nbsp;E.T. was released into over 3,000 theaters in March of 2002 and finished third at the box office with $14.2 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;Holds On, As&nbsp;The Disaster Artist&nbsp;Rockets into Top 5(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Coco&nbsp;led the box office for a third straight week with $18.4 million and was up to $135.6 million total. Wonder crossed the $100 million line and Thor: Ragnarok crossed the $300 million marker. I, Tonya opened in just four theaters, making $264,155 for a top per-theater-average of $66,039, while The Disaster Artist jumped all the way up to fourth place after expanding into 840 theaters. The top 10 films grossed just $70.6 million and averaged 53.9% on the Tomatometer; this year’s batch grossed an estimate $73.8 million and averaged 60.9%.On the vine:&nbsp;Spider-Verse&nbsp;Has Wowed Critics, Now It’s&nbsp;the Audience’s Turn(Photo by © Sony Pictures Animation)Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has actually taken critics by storm scoring a an almost-perfect 99% less than a week away from release. Will the animated film get the same attention from its fans? Clint Eastwood’s The Mule, his first starring role since 2012’s Trouble with the Curve, was primed as a potential awards player… except that Warner Bros. has done everything to hide it until its release on Friday. It is not screening for critics in most markets and reportedly will not even have any Thursday-night previews. Peter Jackson’s production of Mortal Engines (he also co-wrote the screenplay with his LOTR partners) has not been hidden from critics, and is scoring just a 38% on the Tomatometer on its way to expected low numbers. Select audiences in big cities will also finally get their first look at Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk and The Favourite will be making its first substantial expansion into over 500 theaters.The Full Top 10: December 7-9Ralph Breaks the Internet –&nbsp;$16.14 million ($140.86&nbsp;million total)The Grinch –&nbsp;$15.18 million ($223.47 million total)Creed II –&nbsp;$10.32 million ($96.47 million total)Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald –&nbsp;$6.81 million ($145.21 million total)Bohemian Rhapsody –&nbsp;$6 million ($173.57 million total)Instant Family –&nbsp;$5.6 million ($54.16 million total)Green&nbsp;Book&nbsp;–&nbsp;$3.94 million ($19.98 million total)Robin Hood –&nbsp;$3.56 million ($27.29 million total)The Possession of Hannah Grace –&nbsp;$3.18 million ($11.51 million total)Widows –&nbsp;$3.1 million ($38.16 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"to","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/09100726/Box-Office-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-ralph-breaks-the-internet-beats-the-grinch-but-only-just"},{"id":"47509090617836","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Night School‘s $28 Million Keeps Kevin Hart’s Hot Streak Going","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Night School's $28 Million Keeps Kevin Hart's Hot Streak GoingPlus, Smallfoot makes a medium-sized footprint, and The Nun tops the Conjuring Universe on the weekend of September 28-30.by Erik Childress | September 30, 2018 |  CommentsAt first glance, it wasn’t looking like the most exciting weekend at the box office for audiences. Their choices included a formula comedy with an ’80s-feeling plot (though one with plenty of star power and a director on a roll behind it), an amiable family programmer that looks a lot like Ice Age but isn’t, and a horror film releasing a month before Halloween that hasn’t exactly wowed critics.&nbsp;And yet, audiences showed up.King of the Crop: Night School Continues Big Box Office Run for Kevin Hart(Photo by Eli Joshua Ade. ©Universal Pictures)Kevin Hart’s last four (live-action narrative) films have opened between $33 and $37 million, and the star has not had a film in which he is a lead or co-lead open to less than $20 million since 2004’s Soul Plane. That&nbsp;mightily impressive run continued with Night School’s $28 million opening this weekend. And it’s not just good news for Hart. This is also the fourth straight $20 million–plus opening for director Malcolm D. Lee on a string that includes The Best Man Holiday, Barbershop: The Next Cut, and last year’s $115 million smash, Girls Trip, which launched Night School co-star, Tiffany Haddish, into the spotlight.&nbsp;Night School‘s 30% Tomatometer score&nbsp;is not quite Hart’s lowest – it beats out&nbsp;Think Like A Man Too (23%), Ride Along (19%), and Ride Along 2 (13%). Nor is it Lee’s lowest-scoring movie&nbsp;– it beats his&nbsp;Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins (23%) and Scary Movie 5 (4%).September releases with similar openings to Night School, and which&nbsp;also featured African-American leads,&nbsp;include&nbsp;The Perfect Guy (with a Tomatometer of 18% and opening weekend of $25.8 million) and No Good Deed (11% / $24.2 million), as well as the better received Tyler Perry’s I Can Do Bad All By Myself (63% / $23.4 million).&nbsp;Those three films managed low final multiples of 2.202, 2.166, and 2.206. On the other hand, 2002’s Certified Fresh&nbsp;Barbershop was a breakout hit after a start of $20.6 million, and went on to make over $75 million domestically. The average multiple of Central Intelligence, Ride Along 2, and Get Hard came to 2.94, which is likely to give Night School a first estimate range for its total earnings of between $72 and $82 million.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Hell Fest&nbsp;Might Have Arrived a Month Too Early&nbsp;(Photo by © CBS Films )Warner Bros.’ animated Smallfoot (69% on the Tomatometer) may have finished in a strong-seeming second place, but any plans for&nbsp;a sequel&nbsp;might still be put on ice. The film’s $23 million estimated opening is actually one of the lowest openings ever for a film released in&nbsp;more than 4,000 theaters. It’s not as bad as&nbsp;The Nut Job 2’s opening numbers: that movie is still the all-time champion with just $8.3 million from more that 4,000 screens.&nbsp;But&nbsp;the new movie does join the not-so-illustrious company of&nbsp;The Lego Ninjago Movie ($20.4 million), The Emoji Movie ($24.5), and The Predator ($24.6). There have been other animated features to open in late September&nbsp;with similar numbers to&nbsp;Smallfoot’s start,&nbsp;but it’s hard to use them as a gauge for the film’s likely final total as their final numbers are all over the map:&nbsp;Open Season&nbsp;opened with $23.6 million and finished with $85.1 million;&nbsp;Storks&nbsp;opened with $21.3 million and finished with $72.6 million; and&nbsp;The Lego Ninjago Movie&nbsp;opened with $20.4 and finished with&nbsp; $59.2.Also this weekend&nbsp;we have Lionsgate’s Hell Fest. The movie has a Tomatometer score of 37% and opened to just&nbsp;$5 million, with a per-theater-average of $2,209. That is the worst per-theater-average for a wide-release horror film since last year’s Entertainment Studio’s Friend Request made $2 million in 2,573 theaters for a $773 PTA.The Rest of the Top 10:&nbsp;The Nun&nbsp;Now Rules&nbsp;the Conjuring Universe(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Last week’s top-earning film, The House With A Clock In Its Walls, fell 53% to third place, earning $12.5 million and putting it on a similar path to September releases&nbsp;like&nbsp;The Visit and Black Mass. That places&nbsp;its estimated total between $65 and $70 million at this stage (though as a family-friendly offering, it could exceed those expectations).&nbsp;The movie would need roughly another $50 million to turn a profit for Warner Bros.; it has made $9 million internationally so far. The&nbsp;WB duo of The Nun and Crazy Rich Asians continues to bring in money for the studio, so far earning $330 and $218 million worldwide, respectively.&nbsp;The Nun’s $330 million total so far makes it the biggest international earner of the Conjuring franchise, beating out&nbsp;The Conjuring 2, which earned $320 globally.Meanwhile, two movies that arrived in theaters on September 14 are following very different paths.&nbsp;The Predator led that weekend but has dropped massively over the past two weeks. Shane Black’s $88 million production may barely beat 2010’s Predators domestically and, unless the international totals pick up, it is going to be Fox’s biggest loser since 2016’s Assassin’s Creed. On the other hand, Paul Feig’s A Simple Favor, which came in third on that first weekend, is&nbsp;set&nbsp;to outgross The Predator,&nbsp;possibly by next weekend.Outside of the top 10, Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 11/9 fell 62% and has grossed just $5.1 million. At this rate, it may&nbsp;earn less than his 1988 breakout debut,&nbsp;Roger &amp; Me ($6.7 million). At the other end of the political spectrum, Dinesh D’Souza’s Death of a Nation&nbsp;has grossed $5.8 million this year.In limited release, Pinnacle’s Little Women (35% on the Tomatometer) grossed $747,000 in 643 theaters. Neon’s Monsters and Men (83% on the Tomatometer) made $130,979 in just 18 theaters while&nbsp;the distributor’s&nbsp;first wide release, Assassination Nation, dropped 80.7% (and 368 theaters) from last weekend to make $202,817. Finally, Fox Searchlight launched David Lowery’s The Old Man and the Gun (Certified Fresh at 88%), starring Robert Redford in his maybe/maybe-not swan song from acting, and it grossed an estimated $150,000 in just five theaters.&nbsp;Searchlight expands its release next weekend.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Kingsman&nbsp;and&nbsp;It&nbsp;Hold Off Tom Cruise(Photo by Giles Keyte/TM and copyright ©20th Century Fox Film Corp. )At the close of last September, Doug Liman’s acclaimed&nbsp;American Made, with Tom Cruise, was beat out by Kingsman: The Golden Circle&nbsp;in its second week and It&nbsp;in its fourth. The top three movies were separated by just $159,175, but more than $10 million separated American Made from the remake of Flatliners which finished in fifth. The top 10 films grossed $80.2 million and averaged 51.1% on the Tomatometer (Til Death Do Us Part&nbsp;does not have enough reviews for a score, and was not included in the percentage). This weekend’s films grossed an estimated $92.6 million and averaged just 50.9% on the Tomatometer.On the Vine:&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;and&nbsp;Venom&nbsp;Set for ShowdownJoel MearesA powerhouse showdown is coming to the box office next weekend&nbsp;– expect one film&nbsp;to be a surefire winner for the weekend, but don’t be surprised if the other ultimately outgrosses it. Sony is going in strong with Spider-Man villain spinoff,&nbsp;Venom, starring Tom Hardy.&nbsp;Currently projected to earn&nbsp;more than&nbsp;$60 million for the weekend, the film’s reviews go live on Tuesday – if they’re strong, that number could go up. If they’re not…well. Then there is Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born with Lady Gaga. Coming off of rave reviews from film festivals,&nbsp;the movie is expected to be a hit with audiences, and potentially with Oscar voters.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;September 28-30Night School&nbsp;–&nbsp;$28 million ($28 million total)Smallfoot&nbsp;– $23.02 million ($23 million total)The House With a Clock In Its Walls&nbsp;–&nbsp;$12.51 million ($44.77 million total)A Simple Favor&nbsp;– $6.6 million ($43.07 million total)The Nun&nbsp;– $5.44 million ($109.02 million total)Hell Fest&nbsp;–&nbsp;$5.08 million ($5.08 million total)Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.15 million ($165.68 million total)The Predator&nbsp;– $3.7 million ($47.63 million total)White Boy Rick&nbsp;– $2.39 million ($21.71 million total)Peppermint&nbsp;– $1.77 million ($33.54 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"crime, Comics, books, Skip, FX, Academy, stop, Network, Access, comedy, The, star, Superheroe","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/30084307/Night-School-Rep.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-night-schools-28-million-keeps-kevin-harts-hot-streak-going"},{"id":"47509090591204","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet and Several Records — for a Film That Is Not Frozen","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Ralph Breaks the Internet and Several Records — for a Film That Is Not FrozenCreed II does its franchise proud, while Robin Hood crashes and burns.by Erik Childress | November 25, 2018 |  CommentsTurkey was gorged and Ralph Breaks the Internet knocked down some records during Thanksgiving week. Frozen remains the all-time champion over the holiday, however, even though it had already received a one-theater launch the prior Friday. Technicalities aside, it was an impressive five days as Disney kept its streak alive, the Rocky series forged its own record, and another franchise attempt is headed to become one of the biggest domestic disasters of the year.King of the Crop: Ralph Breaks The Internet, the Bank, and a Non-Frozen RecordDebbie DayFor the fourth straight Thanksgiving holiday, Disney led the way. In 2012, Wreck-It Ralph kicked off the holiday movie season in November with a $49 million opening. It went on to gross over $189 million (a 3.86 multiple) domestic and over $471 million worldwide. The sequel, Ralph Breaks the Internet, grossed $55.6 million over the weekend (the third best Thanksgiving weekend not counting Frozen) and $84.4 million since Wednesday (a five-day Thanksgiving weekend record not counting Frozen).The $10.3 million&nbsp;Ralph grossed on Thanksgiving is the highest ever for a film that had not played in a single theater yet. (Frozen made $11 million.) That beat Moana’s $9.9 million and Coco’s $8.9 million, the two films not named Frozen that were the previous champions for the five-day turkey weekend with $82 and $72.9 million. (Frozen made $93.5 million over the holiday when it expanded to 3,742 theaters from one.) The 86% Fresh animated film also made another $41.5 million overseas, and should have no problem becoming just the eighth&nbsp;Thanksgiving weekend opener to reach $200 million. Can it become the first film not named Frozen to reach the $250 million mark?Fresh Surprise: Creed II Crushes a Franchise Record(Photo by MGM, Warner Bros. Pictures)After the surprise financial ($109.7 million) and critical success (95% Tomatometer score) of 2015’s Creed with a 33-year build-up from Rocky IV ($300.5 million with inflation), and Creed II now delivers the highest live-action film opening over the Thanksgiving weekend. $35.2 million over the weekend and $55.8 million for the five-day. The latest in the Rocky franchise beat Enchanted’s $34.4 million and $49 million, respectively, back in 2007. Creed did $29.6 million and $42.1 million. The sequel, which has an 82% Tomatometer score, has a long way to go to best Mrs. Doubtfire’s $219.1 million, but it certainly has a shot to join the top five list that currently includes Three Men and a Baby ($167.7 million), 1996’s 101 Dalmatians ($136.1 million), Rocky IV ($127.8 million), and Enchanted ($127.0 million).Rotten Returns: Robin Hood Sinks to the Bottom of the ChartsDebbie DayIn opposite news, Lionsgate’s latest attempt at a franchise flailed domestically. The $90 million&nbsp;to $100 million budgeted Robin Hood made just $14.1 million in its first five days. The only Thanksgiving openers since 1990 to open between $12 million&nbsp;to $16 million over that period and surpass $40 million are Martin Scorsese’s Hugo ($73.5 million) and Casino ($42.5 million). Lionsgate is clearly hoping this international hero will help bridge that gap overseas. Ridley Scott’s 2010 43%-rated version with Russell Crowe added $216.4 million international dollars to its $105 million domestic total, while 2018’s version has made $8.7 million so far. But in terms of films in 2018 that American audiences ignored, it’s down there with Pacific Rim Uprising ($90.4 million less domestic total than production budget), The Nutcracker and the Four Realms ($64-69 million less), Skyscraper ($57.2 million less), and Early Man ($41.7 million less). The film’s 12% Tomatometer score also makes it one of the worst reviewed films ever to be released over Thanksgiving ahead of just End of Days (11%), Out Cold (8%), Deck the Halls (6%), and both Old Dogs and Christmas with the Kranks at 5%.Top 10 and Beyond: Grinch and Queen Film Cruise, While The Favourite Joins Elite Company(Photo by Universal Pictures)Last week’s No. 1, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald dropped to third place, but dropped even further behind its predecessor; Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them was up to $156 million in its tenth day, while Crimes is at just $116.3 million. The first Twilight film had $119.7 million on day 10 and finished with $192.7 million. While it is likely to join Robin Hood in the red on budget vs. domestic totals, its worldwide tally is over $439 million.We are upping last week’s estimate on The Grinch from $230 million–240 million to $250 million&nbsp;to $260 million after a $42 million five-day haul. That’s the third-best Thanksgiving holiday total for a film in its third weekend behind Skyfall ($50.5 million) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($45.7 million), which were at $220.1 million and $200.1 million after 17 days. The Grinch is at $180.4 million. Meanwhile the parallels between Bohemian Rhapsody and A Star Is Born are striking. The biopic of Queen’s Freddie Mercury is up to $152 million on its 24th day of release after a $13.8 million weekend. (It dipped just 13.6% despite losing 883 theaters.) Lady Gaga was at $148.6 million in the same period, though it grossed slightly more with $14 million. The scale may be sliding in the other direction, but Bradley Cooper’s Oscar frontrunner is now up to $191 million ($353 million worldwide) and with a lack of releases over the next two weeks could manage to cross the $200 million threshold. That Bohemian Rhapsody comes anywhere close to that is a victory nobody expected.Green Book (81%) jumped up to 1,063 theaters this weekend, though Universal certainly was hoping for a better per-theater-average of $5,120 for a $5.4 million weekend. The film’s performance may shift the studio’s focus back to First Man as a more viable awards contender despite its disappointing box office. By the same token, Jason Reitman’s The Front Runner (58%) is anything but when it comes to awards right now. Despite an expansion into 870 theaters in its third week, the film earned just an additional $630,000 for a grand total of $1.06 million. It looks like the political film will be&nbsp;the lowest grossing wide release of Hugh Jackman’s career, replacing&nbsp;Deception ($4.59 million), which may have been released in a full 2,000 theaters, but even Woody Allen’s Scoop grossed $10 million, and it never surpassed 541 theaters.In solid limited release news, Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite (95%) opened to a robust $420,000 in just four theaters. Not only is that better than The Lobster ($190,252) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer ($115,120), but that is the&nbsp;seventh best per-theater-average for a film launching in just four venues behind The Grand Budapest Hotel ($811,166), American Sniper ($633,456), Moonrise Kingdom ($522,996). Steve Jobs ($521,522), The Imitation Game $479,352), The Revenant ($474,560), and Birdman ($424,397). That pushes even Best Picture Oscar winner Moonlight ($402,075) out of that Top Ten list, eight of which went on to become Best Picture nominees. Its $105,000 average became the best of the 2018 beating Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade ($65,949). Netflix is currently not reporting the numbers for Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma, whose advance theatrical release before its streaming premiere next month have been selling out.This Time Last Year: Coco Led and Justice League’s End Was Beginning(Photo by Disney/Pixar)Pixar’s Coco led the way with $50.8 million, besting the second week of DC’s Justice League, which grossed $41 million over the holiday weekend. Remarkably, though the superhero film made just over $60 million for the five-day holiday, it grossed just an additional $57.1 million total going forward. Award contenders Call Me By Your Name and Darkest Hour each opened in four theaters and grossed $412,932 and $175,006, respectively, for the best per-theater-averages. The latter went on to gross over $56 million and win Gary Oldman the Oscar for Best Actor. The Top 10 films grossed $178.4 million from Friday to Sunday and scored 60.6% on the Tomatometer. This year’s films made $202.7 million over the three-day and averaged 68.2%On the Vine: New Releases Begin a Virtual Two-Week Vacation(Photo by Screen Gems)Screen Gems’ The Possession of Hannah Grace is the only new wide release we are getting for the next two weeks and even this one may not reach 2,000 theaters. It is also not being screened for press, so draw your own conclusions.

But what will the future hold?King of the Crop: Fantastic Beasts Wins Weekend But&nbsp;Signals Trouble Ahead(Photo by Warner Bros)Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald topped the box office this weekend easily,&nbsp;but that’s about the only domestic victory the film can claim. It can’t even boast having the best start of the 2018 holiday season so far, falling behind The Grinch’s $67.5 million last week. By the time the final estimates come out it may not even be a Top 25 November opening. (However, it’s international numbers are more than solid with a worldwide tally of $253 million just this weekend.)The $62 million opening is the lowest in the entire Harry Potter franchise. The previous low:&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them with $74.4 million. Before that it was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,&nbsp;though that posted the second-highest multiple of the series with a 3.78x.Fantastic Beasts is scheduled to be a five-part series, and critics are bailing&nbsp;on just the second movie. Will audiences? Anything less than $234 million domestic (likely) equals declining territory. And less than $200 million domestic will be a major&nbsp;disappointment for WB. So is it the international haul that truly matters? Like the Transformers and Pirates of the Caribbean franchises, American audiences may have grown weary, but as long coffers fill overseas, we will see more of them yet.Rotten Returns: Instant Family Continues&nbsp;Streak of Mark Wahlbombs(Photo by Paramount)Paramount got&nbsp;strong reviews from critics for Mark Wahlberg-starring Instant Family, but the $48 million production from Sean Anders did not have that sweet&nbsp;Daddy’s Home&nbsp;connection with Will Ferrell. Confident that audiences would be looking for a potential feel-good film for the holidays, the studio moved the film up from February into this weekend and was rewarded with just $12.5 million. Since 1990 there have been a dozen&nbsp;films that have started between $13.7-$15.7 million, and only three of them have reached $50 million: The Jackal (1997), Horrible Bosses 2, and Mel Gibson’s Hacksaw Ridge, which benefited from an awards run. If word-of-mouth cannot build Instant Family this will go down as the seventh straight film that Mark Wahlberg has headlined that has ended up on the losing side of its budget. Steve McQueen’s Widows&nbsp;seemingly is in the same boat as Instant Family with just a $12.3 million opening and $42 million budget. But as a potential awards player, there is a room for longevity.Top Ten and Beyond: Grinch Eyes Seasonal High, No Box Office Rhapsody For Adult Fare(Photo by © 20th Century Fox)Illumination’s animated adaptation of The Grinch&nbsp;finds itself in a pretty good position, pulling ahead of The Lorax (also from Illumination) with a 10-day gross of $126.5 million. That puts&nbsp;The Grinch at a total end estimate in the $230-$240 million range. Meanwhile, another box office song going on: Bohemian Rhapsody, which looks to end in&nbsp;$170 million range. It is over $384 million worldwide to date, making the film a tremendous success for Fox.Non-Grinch, not-Queen movies have less to sing about. With respective budgets of $38 and $43 million, Overlord&nbsp;and The Girl In the Spider’s Web&nbsp;are at a mere $17.7 and $13.2 million. The new Dragon Tattoo Story is only at $26 million worldwide. Overlord is not much better at $32 million, but it is safe to say we have have seen the last of Lisbeth Salander on the big screen. Disney and theaters are bailing fast on another overpriced failure: The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&nbsp;($43 million domestic, $116 million worldwide&nbsp;against a$120 million budget), which vanished from over 1,100 theaters in just its third weekend.Julian Schnabel’s At Eternity’s Gate&nbsp;had the best per-theater-average of the weekend, with $92,000 in four theaters, though it is not much of a number to crow about. Another awards hopeful, Green Book, played 25 theaters, driving up $312k before it will expand into over 1,000 on Wednesday. For the MST3kers out there, Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie opened in 26 theaters to $206k. (Enjoy the new season on Netflix this Wednesday!)&nbsp;This Time Last Year: Justice Prevailed But Wonder Was The Real Winner(Photo by Warner Bros)This time last year, Justice League&nbsp;led the way with $93 million but the film was ultimately a major failure, grossing just $229 million and presenting lingering questions about the DC Universe. The true success was the performance of Wonder, the heartwarming tale starring the great Jacob Tremblay, which opened to $27 million, going on to earn $132 million domestic and over $305 million worldwide. Its 4.8x multiple was the sixth best ever for a November release opening in over 3,000 theaters, behind The Blind Side, The Polar Express, Frozen, Elf, and National Treasure.The top 10 films last year grossed $192.8 million and averaged 59% on the Tomatometer. This year’s top 10 grossed an estimated $160.7 Million, averaging 60% on the Tomatometer.On the vine: Ralph, Creed, and Hood Hope for Thanksgiving Success(Photo by Disney)Thanksgiving is going sequel- and reboot-heavy this year. Disney is likely to win the holiday weekend for the third straight year with Ralph Breaks the Internet,&nbsp;which is on its way to being Certified Fresh. Creed II is on the bubble for the same certification.&nbsp;Then, believe it or not, we have another Robin Hood film coming, this time with Kingsman’s Taron Egerton and Jamie Foxx. Green Book and The Front Runner will also be expanding into more theaters (though the latter has made a paltry $162,169 in two weeks) and we’ll have the first numbers for Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;November 16-18Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald –&nbsp;$62.3&nbsp;million ($62.3 million total)The Grinch&nbsp;–&nbsp;$38.1 million ($126.5 million total)Bohemian Rhapsody&nbsp;–&nbsp;$15.7 million ($127.8 million total)Instant Family – $14.5 million ($35.2 million total)Widows&nbsp;–&nbsp;$12.3 million ($12.3 million total)The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&nbsp;– $4.6 million ($43.8 million total)A Star Is Born&nbsp;–&nbsp;$4.3 million ($185.8 million total)Overlord&nbsp;–&nbsp;$3.8 million ($17.7 million total)The Girl In the Spider’s Web&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.5 million ($13.2 million total)Nobody’s Fool&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.2 million ($28.8 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"horror, critic, quibi, Plus, independent, facebook, game-of-thrones, Black, boxoffice, natural","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/18105735/600crims.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-crimes-of-grindelwald-62-million-is-harry-potter-low"},{"id":"47509092082163","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: The Meg Shows Its Teeth","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: The Meg Shows Its TeethPlus, Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman beats expectations on the weekend of August 10-12.by Erik Childress | August 12, 2018 |  CommentsIt is the third straight summer we have had a shark movie. Blake Lively took one on in The Shallows in 2016. Mandy Moore and Claire Holt were also trapped by them in last year’s 47 Meters Down. Now we have Bruce the Shark times three with a Megalodon, also known as The Meg and not only has it doubled expectations of the continuing failing tracking services, it has bested the combined openings of those last two shark weekends. You can even add in a Shark Night 3D or the expansion of Open Water and The Meg still ate them up. But does that mean it will still be a Warner Bros. success?King of the Crop: The Meg Doubles Expectations, But May Still Be Eaten By Its Budget(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)Until his appearances in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Jason Statham was never in a movie that opened to $40 million. Not The Expendables ($34.8), not Spy ($29) and not even The Italian Job ($19.4). In fact, Statham’s best opening as the headliner was Transporter 2 and even that was just a $16.5 million start. The Meg has already passed Transporter 2’s total gross on $43 million. The most optimistic tracking had Jon Turtletaub’s shark film opening with $20-22 million, which was already deemed potentially disastrous. While Warner Bros. is putting out a more conservative budget estimate of $130 million, reports suggest the number could be as high as $178. Add in another $140 million for advertising and the film is looking at a break-even number for all its investors (many from China where the film is set) between $540-636 million. Is that even possible?Only eight films thus far in 2018 have even hit the half-billion mark and two of those are Operation Red Sea and Detective Chinatown 2. Starting just domestically, the 49% Tomatometer-rated film is looking at a history where every film to open over $40 million in August has at least reached the $100 million mark. Though only one of them (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) dropped less than 50 percent in their second weekend. And even that was 49.2 percent. Even if we were to be generous and apply the average opening-to-final-gross multiple of those films (3.06) and peg The Meg for a $136 million gross (I’ll take the under on that), that is still another $404 million it would have to clear with WB’s most conservative estimate. Apart from Red Sea and Chinatown 2, is The Meg really going to be in the same company with Avengers: Infinity War, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Black Panther, Incredibles 2, Ready Player One, and Deadpool 2 as the only films this year to clear that international number? Not even Dwayne Johnson could clear that number with Rampage ($326.9) or Skyscraper ($215.2), and Jason Statham’s highest international haul as a solo act was Mechanic: Resurrection’s $104.5 million. At least he has a 70- to 90-foot shark as a scene partner, but it may not matter.Fresh Surprise – Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman Hits Another Exclusive Top 10(Photo by David Lee / Focus Features)It may not seem like a huge number, but BlacKkKlansman’s $10.7 million is a decent one and did, as predicted, beat expectations. Spike Lee’s film was released by Focus Features into 1,512 theaters. If we look at launches into 1,450-1,550 theaters, you can almost see a trend with additional films about undercover work including Donnie Brasco ($11.6 million opening in 1,503 theaters) and Breach ($10.5 million&nbsp;in 1,489.) But if we go back as far as 1994, here is how Spike’s film fits into this exclusive group:Tyler Perry’s Diary of a Mad Black Woman ($21.9 million&nbsp;in 1,483), Enemy at the Gates ($13.8 million&nbsp;in 1,509), Nine Months ($12.5 million&nbsp;in 1,458), Donnie Brasco ($11.6 million&nbsp;in 1,503), Natural Born Killers ($11.16 million&nbsp;in 1,510), Something To Talk About ($11.11 million&nbsp;in 1,510), Up Close and Personal ($11.10 million&nbsp;in 1,506), BlacKkKlansman ($10.79 million in 1,512), Breach ($10.5 million&nbsp;in 1,489), The American President ($10 million in 1,508), A Walk in the Clouds ($9.5 million in 1,534 theaters), Gangs of New York ($9.4 million&nbsp;in 1,504), Baby Boy ($8.6 million&nbsp;in 1,534), Jersey Girl ($8.3 million&nbsp;in 1,520), and&nbsp;It Could Happen To You ($8.1 million&nbsp;in 1,506).BlacKkKlansman is 8th place there and is the 12th best opening for Focus ever and their best on openings under 2,000 screens.Rotten Returns – Dog Days Lives Up To Its Name(Photo by LD Entertainment)Ken Marino’s PG-rated rom-com, Dog Days, could not even make the Top 10 even if you included its total since opening on Wednesday. Despite a just-Fresh 60% on the Tomatometer, the film grossed $2.6 million this weekend and just $3.6 million for its five-day run. It was LD Entertainment’s first release since 2013’s Disconnect. Despite a 2,442-theater launch, it failed to even beat the company’s release of horror film, The Collection, in 1,403 theaters where it grossed $3.1 million the weekend after Thanksgiving in 2012.Beyond (and Within) the Top 10: Fallout Continues a Strong Pace(Photo by Paramount)Mission: Impossible – Fallout continues its path to become the highest-grossing domestic film in the franchise, growing its pace over Part II to over $15 million with $161 million. Of the films to have grossed between $156 million–166 million by its 17th day,&nbsp;Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax&nbsp;set the low bar for a final gross by ending with $214 million. Seven of the 12 films on the list grossed between $214 million-228 million (including The Bourne Ultimatum’s $227.4 million) and seems like a good bar for Fallout. The other five films were Cars ($244&nbsp;million), Men in Black ($250.6&nbsp;million), Monsters Inc. ($255.8&nbsp;million), Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl ($305.4), and, well, Titanic ($600.7 million). It has grossed over $275 million overseas and does not open in China until Aug. 31.Ant-Man and the Wasp has hit the $200 million mark, but is still staring up at the half-billion line worldwide with only $448 million. Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again has hit $100 million, though it is $13 million behind the original at this point. It has grossed over $280 million worldwide. Equalizer 2 is still hoping to squeak by the nine-digit milestone (both domestically and internationally where it stands at $99.8 million.) The first film had $93.7 million at this point, $4.1 million ahead of its sequel and it finished with $101.5 million.As horror films in August go, Slender Man’s $11.3 million finished in between Mirrors ($11.1) and Anacondas: Hunt for the Blood Orchid ($12.8). Expect the 15% Tomatometer–rated film that capitalizes off the real-life tragic Wisconsin case in which two 12-year-old girls stabbed another girl 19 times to be nearly forgotten about by next weekend. Can it best the 64.1-percent drop that The Darkest Minds had in its second weekend? Only Deadpool 2 (-65.4&nbsp;percent) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (-65.2&nbsp;percent) had bigger drops this summer, but those were from opening weekends of $125&nbsp;million and $84 million, respectively.A24 tried to boost word-of-mouth for Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade with free screenings this past Wednesday, but it still dropped 43 percent down to $1.6 million. It has grossed over $10 million making it the 10th film in the studio’s history to do so, and it is the fifth highest–grossing film from Sundance this year so far. Disney’s Christopher Robin is a little ahead of Pete’s Dragon from a few years ago suggesting a final gross in the low $80-millions. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is on the verge of passing Frozen to become the 12th highest-grossing film worldwide of all-time.This Time Last Year: Everyone Was Seeing the Origin of Annabelle(Photo by New Line Cinema)Annabelle: Creation grossed more in its opening weekend than the next four films in the top 10 combined. Dunkirk and Girls Trip were in their fourth weekends, sure, but Annabelle’s $35 million was nevertheless impressive. Much more so than Open Road attempting a sequel to its biggest hit to date with The Nut Job 2: Nutty By Nature, which started with just $8.3 million. Brie Larson’s reunion with her Short Term 12 director Destin Daniel Cretton, The Glass Castle, split critics (50% Tomatometer score), but received even less interest from audiences with $4.6 million. The top 10 films in 2017 average 54.5% on the Tomatometer and grossed $89.2 million. This week’s films averaged 65.0% on the Tomatometer and grossed an estimated $126.1 million.On the Vine: Crazy Rich Asians Looking To Best Mark Wahlberg, a Boy and His Dog(Photo by Warner Bros.)Warner Bros. goes back-to-back and gets a head start on next weekend by opening Crazy Rich Asians on Wednesday. Based on the 2013 book by Kevin Kwan, there are expectations that this could provide this solid summer with one last breakout success. With the numbers put up by The Meg, look for the studio to own the top two spots next week. Mark Wahlberg teams up with director Peter Berg for a fourth time (with a fifth on the way) in the action film Mile 22, though the real star may end up being The Raid’s Iko Uwais. Will it generate enough interest to even beat Mission: Impossible in its fourth weekend? Finally, Albert Hughes returns (without brother Allen) to the director’s chair for the first time since 2010’s The Book of Eli going from apocalyptic to prehistoric with Alpha, a survival adventure with a boy and his dog companion.The Full Top 10: August 10-August 12The Meg – $44.5 million ($44.5 million total)Mission: Impossible – Fallout&nbsp;–&nbsp;$20.0 million ($161.9 million total)Christopher Robin – $12.4 million ($50 million total)Slender Man&nbsp;–&nbsp;$11.3 million ($11.3 million total)BlacKkKlansman&nbsp;–&nbsp;$10.7 million ($10.7 million total)The Spy Who Dumped Me – $6.6 million ($24.5 million total)Mamma Mia!

And it did, with Iron Man 2 now scheduled for April 30th, 2010, although Jon Favreau is not yet locked to return as director (he probably will, though). A few weeks later, Thor, the Norse god of thunder will get his movie adaptation in full Asgardian fantasy glory, with The First Avenger: Captain America (tentative title) expected on May 6th, 2011, and all three likely to be featured in The Avengers in July, 2011 (along with other likely Avengers like Hawkeye). It’s all very exciting, and with the quality Marvel proved itself capable of deliving when it produces its own characters, we should all be in for a treat.#2 WHAT A (BIO)SHOCKLast year’s Bioshock videogame was a critical darling, hailed for its atmospheric setting and story about an underwater city called Rapture that is the remnants of a 1930s scientific/social experiment, and is now home to strange horrors. The game’s publisher, Take-Two, has set up a deal with Universal, with Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) to direct, that they hope has been structured to avoid the problems that have besieged Microsoft’s HALO movie plans. With a script being written by John Logan (The Aviator, Sweeney Todd), the director hopes to start pre-production on what should be a visual stunner as soon as the script is done.#3 I LOVE LAMP 2: I LOVE CHAIRIt’s just an off-hand comment made in an interview, but hey, that’s good enough for the Internet movie press on most days, displaying a journalistic tradition that Ron Burgundy would be proud of. The subject, of course, is Anchorman 2, which director Adam McKay says he and Will Ferrell are expecting to work on sometime in the next few years, after some other projects get taken care of. What exactly such a movie would cover is unknown, as is whether or not all of the original cast members (like, say, Steve Carell) would be able to return.#4 MISSION: RECONCILIATIONRemember all the news and hype a few years back when Viacom/Paramount’s studio boss, Sumner Redstone, showed the door to Tom Cruise, after the star did all that jumping about on Oprah’s couch, and stated his opinions on what sort of things Brooke Shields puts in her mouth? Well, apparently the sweet, sweet lure of box office gold is just too much of a monkey to get off your back, because Paramount is once again talking about maybe making more Mission: Impossible movies with Tom Cruise. There’s no director, no script, etc, but if Cruise and Paramount do actually get back together, I’m sure silly little details like those can be taken care of.#5 YET ANOTHER MOVIE CONCEPT THAT SOUTH PARK DID FIRSTWhen Eric Cartman got himself frozen and woke up hundreds of years later in an extended spoof of the late ’70s sci-fi TV series, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, I think I snorted up whatever I was drinking in laughter, at the same time wondering if younger fans of South Park even knew what Buck Rogers was. Well, apparently, the family that controls the rights to the Buck Rogers licensing empire thinks the way for it to return is another spoof as well, because that’s what they reportedly have in mind. The thing about the original show, though, was that it wasn’t itself comedic inherently. Buck Rogers took its science fiction premise quite seriously, but it also happened to feature Erin Grey in awesome skin tight outfits and an annoying little robot pal. One name that has already been mentioned (but not official or signed on) for a possible director is Frank Miller, whose adaptation of Will Eisner’s The Spirit may prove to be more comic/spoofy than Sin City would have suggested, but it’s difficult to image what Miller’s noir style would do with the jumpsuits and bright sets of the Buck Rogers TV show. Then again, maybe that’s what would make him perfect.#6 MAKING $100 MILLION OUT OF BUBBLE GUM, A BOBBY PIN AND POCKET LINTSpeaking at an event recently, Lee David Zlotoff, the creator of the classic adventure TV show, MacGyver, revealed that plans are in motion to bring the inventive secret agent to the big screen. No details other than that are known, but that shouldn’t stop anyone from speculating. As with Magnum, P.I., my own personal thoughts are that they should just stick with the original star (Richard Dean Anderson), but knowing how these things usually work out, I would guess that’s probably unlikely. Then again, I’m not quite as emotionally invested in MacGyver as in Magnum (of which I saw every episode twice, religiously, in that era when TV was pretty much the best thing going on a daily basis). MacGyver, I watched occasionally, but his gimmick seemed a lot more, you know, gimmicky. Put MacGyver in a life-threatening situation with a very bare set of materials, and he would figure out a way to overcome. It’s a cool ability, but it is very easy for the MacGyver concept to fall into either satire, or seem like one of those cable handycraft shows (“3 hours and a bucket of glue… can our expert fix the Hoover Dam in time?”).#7 ANOTHER MOVIE THAT MIGHT INSPIRE A BROADWAY SHOW THAT MIGHT INSPIRE A MOVIEJohnny Knoxville and Parker Posey have been cast as the leads in Fruitcake, the next directorial effort from Baltimore’s most successful weirdo, John Waters (his first since 2004’s A Dirty Shame). The movie gets its title from a boy named after his favorite dessert, who runs away after he and his parents are caught stealing meat, and while on the run, he meets a girl being raised by two gay men. The whole “meat stealing parents” thing has been done to death in countless other movies, OBVIOUSLY, but maybe somewhere in there, we might find some creativity from the director of Pink Flamingos.#8 BOW BEFORE YOUR BIZARRE CGI QUADRAPED MASTERS20th Century Fox has announced a release date of March 19th, 2010 for Alvin and the Chipmunks 2, which suggests that they are in fact making a sequel to the movie that CGI’ed the beloved 1960s singing chipmunks into hip hopping, rapping chipmunks. If you can’t handle the 20+ month wait until that cinematic gem hits, then at least you can spend your time today enjoying the trailer for Beverly Hills Chihuahua, which hit the web this week. I’ve never had a PCP trip, much less a bad one, but I’ve got to imagine this might be what one looks like. To repeat the point, when you see a psychiatric asylum in a TV show or a movie, and there’s poor guys slumped over with their eyes closed, that might be what they see when they open them.#9 CUCKOO, CUCKOO FOR HORROR REMAKESMaybe everyone in Hollywood should just abandon all other projects and just focus on horror remakes. All horror remakes, all the time. Who’s the the latest to devote his life to this apparently addictive trend? Breck Eisner, son of former Disney bigwig Michael Eisner, got his big screen directorial start on Sahara, and is now preparing for a remake of the early ’70s George A. Romero horror movie, The Crazies, with another remake, Universal’s The Creature from the Black Lagoon waiting in the wings afterwards. The thing is, The Crazies was sort of already remade; it was called 28 Days Later and its sequel 28 Weeks Later. As for The Creature from the Black Lagoon, the concept might work for a remake, but knowing how studios rework titles, will Universal be able to let it go out the gate intact. I smell an imminent change to Black Lagoon or maybe just The Creature. Just a hunch.#10 DONNIE DARKO 2: BACK TO THE FUTUREWith the first film’s writer and director, Richard Kelly, having no involvement, production starts soon on S. Darko, the sequel to Donnie Darko, the bizarre little sci-fi comedy that introduced most of us to Jake Gyllenhaal. This time around, the focus will be on Donnie’s little sister, several years later, as she experiences strange dreams. This one has the mild touch of “direct to video” on it, but given the fervor with which Donnie Darko fans adore the movie, I still had to make sure I covered it.You can contact Greg Dean Schmitz via a message at the RT Forums, the thread there devoted to him, or his MySpace page.","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"french, John, rotten, demand, book, Esquire, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Iron-Man-2-coming-in-2010"},{"id":"47509092091384","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Ant-Man and the Wasp Sizes Up $76M Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Ant-Man and the Wasp Sizes Up $76M DebutSorry To Bother You, Won't You Be My Neighbor?: Indies also make their markby Erik Childress | July 8, 2018 |  CommentsThree words you shouldn’t hear this weekend: comic book fatigue. With the last five films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe opening to $100+ million weekends, does the streak being broken by Ant-Man and the Wasp‘s $76 million engenders a downturn in interest for superheroes? Not quite.King&nbsp;of the Crop: &nbsp;Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp Has Healthy Marvel Bump(Photo by Marvel Studios)It is true that Ant-Man and the Wasp is in the bottom five openers for the MCU (16th out of 20) but you know what else is? Ant-Man,&nbsp;which opened to $57.2 million in July 2015. (At that point Marvel’s $100 million openings consisted of both Avengers films and the Iron Man sequels.)&nbsp;Consider the leaps that each of the Marvel films made from original-to-sequel. Iron Man and Thor had similar bumps in opening weekends with 29.9% and 30.4%, respectively. Captain America’s Winter Soldier had a 46% jump over The First Avenger and&nbsp;the second Guardians of the Galaxy had a massive 55.3% boost, aided by moving Vol. 2&nbsp;out from the original’s August frame to being&nbsp;Summer 2017’s opening film. Wasp falls right in the middle of these with a healthy 32.8% growth over original Ant-Man.Commuted skeptics can certainly look at Wasp‘s&nbsp;robust $11.2 million on Thursday night (more than Wonder Woman, Winter Soldier and Doctor Strange), and then notice that it had the lowest opening of any Friday opener that made eight digits in night-before previews. Wasp&nbsp;is establishing a path to be somewhere around $140 million through next weekend and should have no problem crossing the $200 million threshold. (Only two films – out of 95 – have failed to reach that number after an $75+ million opening:&nbsp;X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Fifty Shades of Grey.) That will make Ant-Man and the Wasp the 16th MCU film to reach the $200m milestone, while passing Solo to become the 6th highest-grossing film of 2018.Meanwhile, Incredibles 2&nbsp;has just crossed the $500 million mark with the 7th largest gross for a film after 24 days. It is just $12 million behind the pace of Marvel’s The Avengers and is targeting the $600 million mark. That means Disney would then hold six of the nine films to reach that milestone ever, and the third to do so just in 2018, after Infinity War&nbsp;and Black Panther. And in other blockbuster news, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&nbsp;has crossed the billion dollar mark worldwide, while on target to reach $400 million domestically.Fresh Surprise: Mr. Rogers Doc Enters Elite Company of Documentaries(Photo by Focus Features)This is the fifth weekend this summer that a documentary has made it into the top ten grossers. Magnolia’s RBG spent two non-consecutive weeks there and now the 99%-Tomatometer doc about Fred Rogers, Won’t You Be My Neighbor?&nbsp;is doing it for the third straight week. And it’s only getting stronger, as Focus recognizes people are showing up and adding theaters every week, including another 239 this weekend. That’s a total of 893 theaters for a $2.6 million in 9th place. Neighbor&nbsp;is&nbsp;now the 24th highest-grossing documentary ever.Documentaries spending multiple weeks in the top ten are rare feats. Those that matched Neighbors‘ three weeks are One Direction:&nbsp;This Is Us,&nbsp;Dinesh D’Souza’s&nbsp;2016: Obama’s America,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Michael Moore’s&nbsp;Sicko.&nbsp;Four-weekers include Disneynature’s&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chimpanzee,&nbsp;Michael Jackson’s&nbsp;This Is It, and&nbsp;Justin Bieber:&nbsp;Never Say Never. All-time top-grossing doc&nbsp;Fahrenheit 9/11&nbsp;spent six weeks, while second all-time grosser&nbsp;March of the Penguins is champ with a nine week residency in the top.(Less-Than) Rotten Returns: First Purge More Like Fourth Purge, But Fifth Purge Still Likely(Photo by Blumhouse/Universal)The First Purge is, well, the first Purge film to open mid-week on a Wednesday. The previous films opened to $34, $29.8 and $31.5 million, respectively.&nbsp;And each grew final returns from $64.4 to $71.9 to $79.2 million. The latest Purge&nbsp;has made $31 million in five days, well below the previous installments’ $40, $36.7 and $40.4 had during the same time frame. Diminishing returns&nbsp;are frequently moot points when it comes to Blumhouse movies, though The First Purge is the costliest film of the batch with a whopping $13 million budget. How long until a date is set for The Second Purge?Beyond the Top Ten: Sorry To Bother You Off To Great Start(Photo by Annapurna)Boots Riley’s Sorry To Bother You exploded with an estimated $717,302 this weekend for the largest per-theater-average on the chart at $44,831. All eyes will be on the film when it goes wide next week; Annapurna hopes to have one of the biggest hits out of all the Sundance acquisitions this year. Sorry’s total was just slightly higher than Neon’s documentary, Three Identical Strangers which made $717,008 and crossed the million dollar mark while upping theater count to 51. Roadside, hoping to ride the summer doc wave, just missed the Top Ten with Whitney,&nbsp;which made $1.25 million on 452 screens. Bleecker Street added 28 theaters for Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace and averaged $11,500 per screen. It’s total stands at $800,422This Time Last Year: Marvel Ruled (Surprise) And The Big Sick Expanded(Photo by Marvel Studios)Spider-Man: Homecoming was the sole opener of the weekend and started with $117 million for a $26,915 per-theater-average. A24’s A Ghost Story nearly matched that with $26,008, albeit on just four screens. But Lionsgate’s expansion of The Big Sick muscled up a $10,971 average in 326 theaters. The top ten in 2017 took in $198.3 million (with an average 66.9% on the Tomatometer) while this weekend’s haul&nbsp;was an estimated $177.3 million (with a 71.8% average.)On the Vine: Rock, Sandler &amp; Eighth Grade Hope To Be Top Of Their Classes(Photo by A24)With Skyscraper hoping to lure away the older boys and Hotel Transylvania 3 going for families, it will be a real test for the word-of-mouth on Ant-Man and the Wasp. Signs point to the animated film winning the battle of the newbies and it will require a strong 2nd-weekend hold for Marvel to retain the top spot. Also starting its run in limited release will be Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade. A24 has already had a very nice summer with Hereditary’s grosses and they are hoping to turn this into another indie hit of the season.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;July 6-July&nbsp;8Ant-Man and the Wasp – $76.0 million ($76.0 million total)Incredibles 2 – $29.0 million ($504.3 million total)Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom&nbsp;– $28.5 million ($333.3 million total)The First Purge – $17.1 million ($31.0 million total)Sicario: Day of the Soldado&nbsp;– $7.3 million ($35.3 million total)Uncle Drew&nbsp;– $6.6 million ($29.9 million total)Ocean’s 8&nbsp;– $5.2 million ($126.7 million total)Tag&nbsp;–&nbsp;$3.1 million ($48.3&nbsp;million total)Won’t You Be My Neighbor?&nbsp;–&nbsp;$2.5 million ($12.3 million total)Deadpool 2&nbsp;–&nbsp;$1.6 million ($314.5 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comics, reviews, singing, asian-american, spinoff, Amazon","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/08110540/sfasfd.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-ant-man"},{"id":"47509092084213","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Mission: Impossible – Fallout Earns Series’ Best Opening, With $61.5 Million","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Mission: Impossible - Fallout Earns Series' Best Opening, With $61.5 MillionPlus, Titans disappoints and Eighth Grade continues dream indie run on the weekend of July 27-29.by Erik Childress | July 29, 2018 |  CommentsThe word “best” has been following Mission: Impossible – Fallout&nbsp;around this week. It is the best-reviewed film of the series by critics with a 97%&nbsp;Tomatometer rating. (The previous two films each received a 93%.) It has the highest audience score in the series with a 94%, so far (but expect that to move up and down as time passes). It has now passed Mission: Impossible II’s $57.8 million&nbsp;to post the highest opening&nbsp;in the series, with $61.5 million. On top of all of that, it is the highest opening three-day total of Tom Cruise’s career –&nbsp;War of the Worlds had $57.6 million in the bank after a pre-July 4&nbsp;Wednesday opening, and made $64.8 million from Friday to Sunday. But we won’t hold that against&nbsp;M:I – 6.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Fallout Poised To Be The King Beyond This WeekendJoel MearesWord-of-mouth is going to be the best friend to Mission: Impossible – Fallout, just as it was to Ghost Protocol, which initially opened in just 425 IMAX screens nationwide and earned a robust $17 million in its first (limited) five days on its way to over $209 million domestic (second only to part 2) and over $694 million worldwide (the series’ best).&nbsp;Fallout will unquestionably become the fifth film in the franchise to cross the $180 million mark. J.J. Abrams’&nbsp;third&nbsp;Mission&nbsp;film&nbsp;is the low water mark with $134 million. That installment&nbsp;came hot on the heels of Cruise’s blowups with Matt Lauer and Oprah’s couch, though&nbsp;those events did not hurt War of the Worlds’ numbers, which remains the highest-grossing film of his career.Mission: Impossible II had $111 million in the bank after its first 10 days and Rogue Nation had $107.&nbsp;Those&nbsp;numbers will likely be left in the rearview mirror come next Sunday. Disney’s Christopher Robin will not be pulling people away from this one and if word-of-mouth holds as expected, Fallout should still have the edge to spend its second week at no. 1. This is Cruise’s fifth 90%-plus&nbsp;movie on the Tomatometer since 2000, with the last three M:I films on top followed by Minority Report and Edge of Tomorrow. The new movie’s $178 million budget (just missing the top 10 most expensive films ever produced by Paramount) hardly seems like a gamble given the near-$700 million haul of the previous two. With a $153-plus million worldwide start, Fallout has a very good shot at finally cracking the milestone for the series.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Eighth Grade Looking Ahead To Nationwide Launch(Photo by Linda Kallerus, courtesy of A24)We have been tracking the growing success of Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade over the past few weeks, and it is showing no signs of slowing down. A24 expanded the film, which has a 99% score on the Tomatometer, into an additional 125 theaters this weekend (for a total of 158) and it grossed a solid $1.31 million. By comparison, Wes Anderson’s 90%&nbsp;Isle of Dogs&nbsp;(90% currently) grossed $2.9 million when it expanded to 165 theaters in its second weekend. With a $2.9 million haul so far, Eighth Grade has grossed a little less than half of what Anderson’s film had at this point in its run, but as the film expands nationwide next weekend you can expect to see it in the Top 10.Rotten Returns: Certified Fresh&nbsp;Titans Falls Well Below Expectations(Photo by © Warner Bros. )Teen Titans Go! to the Movies had a disappointing start with just $10.5 million (some projections had it between $14-$20 million). This was despite almost universal critical acclaim – the movie sits at 90% on the Tomatometer, making it one of the year’s best animated offerings. The result backs up a trend&nbsp;that shows animated films in late summer are not&nbsp;always a winning proposition. Putting aside&nbsp;The Simpsons Movie, which opened with $74 million 11 years to the day, and The Smurfs,&nbsp;which was half-animated and made $35.6 million on the final weekend of July in 2011, no other animated film in the back half of this month has opened to more than $25 million. The Emoji Movie, Monster House, Ice Age: Collision Course, and Turbo all opened between $20-$25 million.Milestone Watch:&nbsp;Incredibles&nbsp;and&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;on the cusp of (More) History(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Incredibles 2&nbsp;is just shy of becoming the ninth film in history to reach the $600 million milestone at the domestic box office (and 7th since 2009’s Avatar), while Black Panther is just $55,000 away from $700 million; the former currently has its eye on joining the billion dollar club as it stands with $996 million worldwide. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is already there with $1.23 billion and will be crossing the $400 million mark domestically sometime this upcoming week. No film that has passed the $180 million mark by its fourth weekend has failed to reach $200 million and Ant-Man and the Wasp is there, surpassing its predecessor. Hotel Transylvania 3 has nearly reached $120 million in its third weekend.Last week’s openers each took big slides, but it wasn’t all bad news. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again slid 57% but maintained its second place slot; the good news for the ABBA musical is that no film to have $69 million after 10 days has failed to reach $100 million. Equalizer 2, on the other hand, took a&nbsp;larger 61% plunge from its surprising no. 1 opening last week. With $64 million in the bank so far, it is hoping to avoid joining an exclusive club of films which made between $60-$66 million in its first 10 days and failed to make $100 million – this club includes&nbsp;Oblivion, Sausage Party, The Scorpion King, Rampage, as well as Denzel’s The Book of Eli and Denzel/Fuqua’s The Magnificent Seven. Speaking of Dwayne Johnson, Skyscraper is currently on pace to do less than his 2014 Hercules film, which made just $72.6 million, though it is close to passing that film’s worldwide gross of $244 million. Skyscraper’s gross in China ($48.4 million) is nearly as much as its entire domestic gross to date of $59 million.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Nolan’s&nbsp;Dunkirk&nbsp;Gets a Happy Face Emoji for Its Second Week(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Last year, July ended with Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk&nbsp;on top in its second week, crossing the $100 million mark, and fending off a challenge from The Emoji Movie which opened with $24.5 million. Charlize Theron’s Cold War action thriller, Atomic Blonde, finished in fourth place with $18.2 million;&nbsp;Girls Trip&nbsp;was third,&nbsp;passing a total of $65 million in its second weekend. Annapurna Pictures put its first film into theaters with Kathryn Bigelow’s Detroit, which made $350,190 in just 20 theaters for a $17,510 per theater average. The studio is hoping that this summer’s Sorry to Bother You, which has made $13.3 million to date,&nbsp;will pass Detroit’s $16.7 million haul to become their highest-grossing film to date. We’ll have to wait and see.On the Vine: Will Families Show Up for&nbsp;Christopher Robin?(Photo by Laurie Sparham /© Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Disney’s Christopher Robin is hoping to become the last big breakout hit of the summer. Whether it can challenge the word-of-mouth of Fallout remains to be seen, but given how family audiences&nbsp;have mostly ignored&nbsp;Teen Titans, they may be waiting to take their kids to something a bit more nostalgic. Lionsgate’s The Spy Who Dumped Me is hoping to continue to reel in the female audience, before Crazy Rich Asians opens in a few weeks, while Fox is opening superhero YA film,&nbsp;The Darkest Minds. Finally, conservative commentator and recently pardoned felon, Dinesh D’Souza, is back with the documentary, Death of a Nation,&nbsp;which could find cash in conservative audiences.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;June 29-July 1Mission: Impossible – Fallout –&nbsp;$61.5 million ($61.5 million total)Mamma Mia!

Can you guess? It was that weekend Deadpool notched its second straight victory, replacing Kung Fu Panda 3, which had spent two weeks at the top, and the only week in which The Revenant finished at No. 1. That was five straight weekends atop the box office for a single studio (Fox) with three different films. This weekend, it was Warner Bros. turn. The Meg started it off on August 10. It was followed by three weeks of Crazy Rich Asians. And The Nun just took over.King of the Crop:&nbsp;The Nun Wants Your Filthy Stolen Money(Photo by Warner Bros.)When James Wan introduced the universe of The Conjuring in the summer of 2013 it opened to a huge $41 million and a total gross of $137 million. A year later, its world was expanded with a prequel to its prologue with Annabelle. It opened to $37.1 million. Two years later The Conjuring 2 opened to $40 million on its way to $100 million, and in 2017 Annabelle: Creation started with $35 million and finished with over $102 million. This is a $1.2 billion franchise for Wan and Warner Bros., and that number only grew this weekend when The Nun bested all of their starts.The Nun’s $53.5 million weekend was the second best of any film to open in September behind just last year’s It. No film has opened to $50 million or higher and failed to reach $100 million, and it would take a massive rejection of the film from here on out for it not to hit that. (Paranormal Activity 3 opened to $52 million and made just $104 million.) That would make it just the 14th R-rated horror film to pass that milestone. Only five have ever grossed $108 million or more (It, The Exorcist, Get Out, The Blair Witch Project, and The Conjuring). Despite the film getting the worst critical response with a 28% Tomatometer score (Annabelle was 29%), the film’s worldwide total stands around $124 million and we will track its progress in the record books right here over the coming weeks.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Peppermint Leaves Sour Taste In Mouths of Critics(Photo by Michael Muller/STX Entertainment)Despite a week’s worth of TV ads that you could not avoid, STX still could not get one-time buttkicker Jennifer Garner to best one-time buttkicker Bruce Willis in their respective 2018 revenge flicks. Garner’s Peppermint opened to just $13.3 million, putting it right on par with her Daredevil spin-off&nbsp;Elektra ($12.8 million) and also Bruce Willis’ Death Wish remake from this past March, which opened to $13 million.&nbsp;Director Pierre Morel’s release could not beat the 17% score of Eli Roth’s film, as Peppermint garnered just a 13%. That’s three pretty weak returns in a row for STX after Mile 22 and The Happytime Murders. Even with Peppermint’s production budget reportedly somewhere around $25 million, it is going to take some international help to have a return on its investment.Beyond the Top 10: Crazy Rich Asians Continues Pace and Fallout Becomes Franchise Leader(Photo by Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.)With another $13.6 million this weekend, Crazy Rich Asians remains about $19 million ahead of the pace of The Help, which puts its final estimate somewhere between $185 million–$190 million now. Last week’s Sundance thriller, Searching, with John Cho, held firm in the fifth place slot with just a 25% drop. It is now the fouth highest grossing film from the festival this year with its sights now on Sorry to Bother You and Won’t You Be My Neighbor next.&nbsp;Hereditary&nbsp;tops that list with $44 million.Also in big money news, Mission: Impossible – Fallout has risen to over $726.6 million worldwide and is now the highest-grossing film of the franchise. Those still holding out hope for a sequel to The Meg, the Jason Statham shark film has passed $130 million in the States and nearly $492 million worldwide. It may need a GoFundMe page from fans to grab the final $48 million needed to put it into the black.This Time Last Year: The Largest September Opening of All-Time Happened(Photo by Warner Bros. Pictures)We saw the biggest September opening of all-time on this weekend. The big-screen adaptation of Stephen King’s It opened to $123.4 million — we’re talking by nearly a full $75 million more than the previous champ (Hotel Transylvania 2’s $48.46 million). Home Again with Reese Witherspoon finished second. With $8.5 million. That is less than It grossed on its fifth weekend on its way to become the seventh highest grossing film of 2017. The Top 10 last year grossed $153 million and had an average critical score of 63.6%. This year’s total from the weekend was $105.4 million with an average of 67.4%.On the Vine: Predators, War Heroes, Drug Dealers, and a Missing Friend(Photo by Kimberley French/20th Century Fox)The first on-screen victim of The Predator, Shane Black, returns to direct and co-write (with his Monster Squad partner Fred Dekker) the next chapter.

It’s early to make a call on whether those adaptations will make it to the big screen, but with this kind of buzz and first-week returns, we’re betting on a green light.King of the Crop:&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;Gets&nbsp;$34 million start on the road to $100 million(Photo by © Warner Bros.)Since 2005, some 56 films have opened to more than $5 million on a Wednesday. Crazy Rich Asians is the latest, with $5,013,478 on its opening Wednesday, which helped add to its $34 million five-day total. That’s&nbsp;a more-than-solid start for the $30 million-budgeted film. What does this&nbsp;mean for its likely overall gross? For starters, in that same period since 2005 there have been 26 films to open on Wednesday between $4-$6 million. Only six of them managed to reach the $100 million mark:&nbsp;True Grit, David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and Passengers&nbsp;all got a&nbsp;December holiday boost; the animated Rise of the Guardians got a similar boost, opening just before Thanksgiving. That leaves only two summer films to have completed the trek: last year’s Baby Driver and, perhaps more relevant, The Help.Led by a strong female cast, The Help&nbsp;made&nbsp;$35.9 million in its first five days in August and went on to become a late summer sensation to the tune of over $169 million.&nbsp;Those are some lofty expectations to put on&nbsp;Crazy Rich Asians&nbsp;– even though word-of-mouth and critical reaction have been strong – so let’s look at the other August films on that list of $4-$6 million Wednesday openers and what they made in their first five days:&nbsp;The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 ($19.6 million), Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters ($23.2 million), Let’s Be Cops ($26.2 million), World Trade Center ($26.5 million)Crazy Rich Asians is currently ahead of all of them, and Let’s Be Cops ended up being the low point of the set with a final gross of $82.3 million. That’s&nbsp;an easy number to aim for at the moment and with a weak August still ahead, $100 million is not out of the question for CRA. Chu’s film is also just the sixth wide release of the summer to generate a Tomatometer of 90% or higher, joining Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Sorry to Bother You, Incredibles 2, and Teen Titans Go to the Movies.Rotten Returns:&nbsp;Alpha&nbsp;Meets Expectations,&nbsp;Spacey’s latest Earns Embarrassing $287(Photo by Alan Markfield /© Columbia Pictures )Sony and Studio 8 had delayed Albert Hughes’ Alpha (formerly known as The Solutrean) for nearly an entire year. This probably had less to do with its quality (it is sitting at 83% on the Tomatometer) and more to do with not knowing how to market a Paleolithic family film with zero English spoken in its runtime. The $10.5 million it made this weekend was right in line with projections, but will hardly help in recouping the budget, reportedly between $55 and $60 million. Word of mouth and those strong reviews though could give it more staying power than the first-weekend haul suggests.Have you heard of the film Billionaire Boys Club? It is available now on VOD and will be on DVD September 18, but it was also released in eight theaters this weekend. With eight reviews counted so far, it is at 13% on the Tomatometer; that’s an embarrassing figure, but nothing compared to the headline-line-grabbing $287 it made on Friday and Saturday. That’s right: $287! Roughly $36 per theater. If the title sounds familiar, you may be thinking of the 1987 film of the same name, which features Judd Nelson and Ron Silver in the roles played by&nbsp;Baby Driver co-stars Ansel Elgort and Kevin Spacey in the new movie. We’re not expecting any kind of Spacey comeback anytime soon.The Rest of the Top 10:&nbsp;Mile 22&nbsp;to Test Wahlberg’s Overseas Power(Photo by © STXfilms)Jon Turteltaub’s The Meg had 53% of its audience eaten this weekend, bringing its total to over $83 million. The lowbar final gross for a film to make that much in its first 10 days is M. Night Shyamalan’s The Village, which finished with $114 million in 2004. Every other film to make that much money in the same amount of time has grossed at least $125 million. The latest Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg collaboration, Mile 22, landed with a bit of a shrug.&nbsp;Still, its $13.6 million opening is better than the expansion of their last effort, Patriots Day, and the budget of $35 million is not exactly huge. The overseas box office will be fascinating on this one: Wahlberg, when in the lead role, has never reached $100 million at the foreign box office when he is not paired with taking Autobots, teddy bears, or apes; but the addition of co-star Iko Uwais, a martial arts superstar from his&nbsp;Raid&nbsp;films, may give this one a greater chance.&nbsp;Mile 22&nbsp;has so far has grossed $538,000 overseas.Mission: Impossible – Fallout&nbsp;is having no issues on the foreign or domestic front, hitting&nbsp;the half-billion mark this weekend (with China still on the horizon in two weeks). A $200 million domestic haul is a foregone conclusion – Christopher McQuarrie’s film has its sights set on becoming the&nbsp;fourth&nbsp;highest-grossing film of the summer and the second&nbsp;of Tom Cruise’s career, behind just War of the Worlds. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman had a very reasonable 35% drop after Focus added 276 theaters to its run. With $23 million earned so far, it is 30th on Focus’ all-time list and is currently ahead of the pace of the studio’s 2005 August release, The Constant Gardener (which is 19th&nbsp;all-time box office earner for Focus). It looks likely to become&nbsp;Lee’s third highest-grossing film ever behind Inside Man and Malcolm X.This Time Last Year: Reynolds and Jackson Take Out a Hit on Number 1 Spot(Photo by © Summit Entertainment )The Hitman’s Bodyguard led the way with $21.3 million and would become the second-highest grossing film to open in August with $75 million – Annabelle: Creation led the month with $102 million. Steven Soderbergh’s return to the big screen with another heist movie was not as successful. Logan Lucky opened in third place with $7.6 million (less than half of what Annabelle made in its second weekend) and finished with less than $28 million. The total box office of the Top 10 on this weekend in 2017 was $75.6 million with an average just-Fresh&nbsp;Tomatometer&nbsp;of 60%. This year, the Top&nbsp;10 grossed an estimated $103.8 million and the&nbsp;Tomatometer average is 65.8% .On the Vine:&nbsp;Happytime&nbsp;Looking for&nbsp;Sausage Party&nbsp;Success(Photo by Hopper Stone /© STX Entertainment)Next weekend, the son of Jim Henson brings another puppet movie to the big screen, only this time with violence, sex, and swearing. STX is hoping The Happytime Murders could be an August hit the way Sausage Party was a few years ago, and it has a legitimate shot to take the top spot. It certainly won’t be too troubled by&nbsp;A.X.L., Global Road’s latest release destined for a less-than-$10-million opening.The Full Top 10: August 17-August 19Crazy Rich Asians –&nbsp;$25.2 million ($34 million total)The Meg – $21.1 million ($83.7 million total)Mile 22 –&nbsp;$13.6 million ($13.6 million total)Alpha – $10.5 million ($10.5 million total)Mission: Impossible – Fallout – $10.5 million ($180.7 million total)Christopher Robin –&nbsp;$8.8 million ($66.8 million total)BlacKkKlansman –&nbsp;$7 million ($23 million total)Slender Man – $4.9 million ($20.7 million total)Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation – $3.6 million ($153.8 million total)Mamma Mia!

Read on for details on the smash sequel, along with new and notable movies at the box office.Best Animation Opening Weekend Ever? Parr For the Course.(Photo by © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Pixar’s Incredibles 2 generated a record-shattering $180 million opening from 4,410 locations over the weekend, as the animated mom and pop superheroes Bob and Ellen Paar – that’s Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl – showed off box office chops that’d make any of Marvel’s spandex-clad heroes proud.Incredibles 2 blew away the standard for the best opening by an animated film set by another Pixar sequel, Finding Dory, in 2016 with $135 million and further cemented the reality that superheroes will rule the 2018 summer box office.&nbsp;Two of the&nbsp;year’s top three movies domestically so far –&nbsp;Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;–&nbsp;are superhero movies from Marvel Studios, like Pixar a unit of Disney, and Incredibles 2 now appears poised to join that fast crowd. It was also the best opening ever by a PG-rated film, ahead of the $174.6 million debut of Beauty and the Beast in 2017.Incredibles 2, written and directed by Brad Bird, packed Pixar’s usual multi-generational and crowd-pleasing punch and benefitted from being the first animated wide release since Sherlock Gnomes in March. It returned the original film’s voice cast –topped by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson – and came in with a glossy 94% on the Tomatometer. Opening weekend crowds – 51% female and 40% between the ages of 18 and 24 – and gave it an 89% Audience Score and an A+ CinemaScore. &nbsp;Incredibles 2 added another $51.5 million overseas, giving it a global total of $231.5 million for the weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.Ocean’s 8, last weekend’s top film, held a respectable 53% of its audience from its opening but was barely within shouting distance with $19.5 million. The&nbsp;almost&nbsp;Fresh 56% Tomatometer rating for Tag, the Ed Helms-Jeremy Renner comedy from Warner Bros., translated to $14.6 million and a third-place debut. Its Audience Score was 74% and CinemaScore was B+. Superfly, a remake of the 1972 blaxploitation hit starring Curtis Mayfield, was similarly soft on the Tomatometer (54%), and finished seventh for the weekend with $6.3 million and has an $8.4 million total after rolling out Wednesday for Sony. That was behind holdovers Solo: A Star Wars Story ($9 million), Deadpool 2 ($8.8 million), and Hereditary ($7 million), which fell off just 48% in its second week, commendable for a horror movie.The record-shattering debut by Incredibles 2, the 20th film released by Pixar since Toy Story in 1995, is the studio’s 18th to debut at No. 1. The Good Dinosaur was runner-up to the second week of the Hunger Games franchise finale Mockingjay – Part II with $39.2 million on Thanksgiving weekend in 2015. But the first Pixar release that failed to nab the top spot was the studio’s Inside Out. That Pete Doctor-directed tale exceeded expectations with a dynamic $90 million debut that topped the 2002 opening of The Incredibles to become the biggest ever for Pixar on this weekend in 2015. But even that wasn’t enough to overcome Jurassic World, which stomped to $106 million in its second weekend. This time around Disney and Pixar wisely rolled out before the reptiles went on a box office rampage.Fine China: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Lifted to $370 Million Abroad(Photo by © Universal)One of the several ways that Steven Spielberg’s 1993 original Jurassic Park changed the game for Hollywood was that it was a true global blockbuster, the first major release to make more abroad than in the U.S. and Canada, which is the norm for big-budget “tentpole” movies today. The Universal Pictures International distribution team, under president Duncan Clark, clearly studied its history, and the proof is in this weekend’s foreign box office pudding.&nbsp;Fallen Kingdom brought in $173.6 million in its second weekend abroad and has now chomped a massive $370 million from overseas ahead of its North American debut on Friday. The global total for the five Jurassic films breezed past $4 billion on Sunday.The 1993 original took in a record $627 million from abroad and more than a $1 billion worldwide. Twenty years later, Jurassic World decimated those numbers with $1.1 billion from overseas alone, and $1.67 billion globally. Matching that would be no small feat for Fallen Kingdom, particularly since its rollout has required some careful scheduling around the World Cup soccer tournament,which began Saturday and dominates the pop culture landscape in many nations.Universal’s global marketing campaign, with a price tag at a reported $185 million, is among the largest the studio has mounted. It featured T-Rex and Raptor stunts in major cities on several continents as well as a barnstorm of the film’s staggered rollout territories that took stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, and director J.A. Bayona to Madrid, London, and Shanghai for premieres. Jurassic Park topped the $1 billion mark at the global box office thanks in part to a 2013 3D re-release that took in $32 million in China. That experience, which introduced the franchise to Chinese audiences, set the stage for the $229 million haul that made the Middle Kingdom the top foreign territory for Jurassic World, as well as the $111.9 million opening bounty scored by Fallen Kingdom in its debut in China this weekend.Beyond the Top Ten:&nbsp;Goombah&nbsp;Gotti, and RBG‘s $10 Million(Photo by © Vertical Entertainment)Two limited releases&nbsp;with very low Tomatometer ratings landed just&nbsp;outside the top ten. Gotti, the long-gestating mob saga starring John Travolta with a Tomatometer score of 0%, brought in $1.67 million, while Yash Raj’s Race 3 (13%) was at $1.63 million. Vertical had Gotti in 503 theaters, 188 more than Race was running in.Focus plans to expand Morgan Neville’s documentary on Fred Rodgers, Won’t You By My Neighbor, to more than 300 theaters next weekend after successfully widening it by 67 theaters this weekend. The film about the TV kids host,&nbsp;which has a Tomatometer rating of 99%,&nbsp; brought in $985,000 from 96 locations for a strong $10,253 per-screen average and now has a $1.69 million domestic total after two weeks.RBG, the documentary on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, crossed the $10 million mark for Magnolia Pictures in its seventh week of release.Disney pushed A Wrinkle In Time, which opened in March, over the $100 million mark domestically with a special run in 245 theaters that brought in $1.7 million.How High Will&nbsp;Jurassic&nbsp;Leap in North America?&nbsp;(Photo by © Universal)Fallen Kingdom is tracking for a domestic debut in the $145 million range, but its show of might abroad could build momentum for next weekend’s rollout. There’s only one comparable film by which to gauge the prospects for Fallen Kingdom, and that’s Jurassic World, which opened with $208 million and eventually rung up $1.2 billion worldwide. But that one came out 20 years after the debut of Spielberg’s original, and commanded the pop zeitgeist, so even those comparisons are somewhat skewed.The raptors haven’t wowed reviewers so far (61% on the Tomatometer), and neither have the weekend’s other wide openers. Damsel, the Western comedy starring Robert Pattison and Mia Wasikowska from David and Nathan Zellner has the best number (80%), ahead of Boundaries, the Christopher Plummer-Vera Farmiga father-daughter road trip comedy (60%), and the Pascal Laugier horror film,&nbsp;Incident in a Ghostland, starring Crystal Reed, Taylor Hickson and Anastasia Phillips.Also debuting this week are two well-regarded documentaries, The King (formerly The Promised Land), Jim Jarecki’s look at America through the prism of a road trip in Elvis Presley’s Rolls Royce (92% on the Tomatometer), and the as-yet unrated Spiral, Laura Fairrie’s look at anti-Semitism in France.The Full Top 10: June 15-17Incredibles 2 – $180 million ($180 million domestic total)Ocean’s 8&nbsp;– $19.5 million ($79.1 million domestic total)Tag – $14.6 million&nbsp;($14.6 million total)Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;– $9 million ($192.8 million total)Deadpool 2&nbsp;– $8.8 million&nbsp;($294.6 million total)Hereditary&nbsp;– $7 million ($27.1 million total)Superfly – $6.3 million&nbsp;($8.4 million total)Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;– $5.2 million&nbsp;($664.1 million total)Adrift&nbsp;-$2.1 million ($26.8 million)Book Club&nbsp;– $1.8 million ($62 million)[box office figures via&nbsp;Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"of, Election, frames, Animation, Family, Mirror","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/17125953/ffff.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-incredibles-2s-180-million-is-animations-best-opening-ever"},{"id":"47509093212669","title":"Weekend Box Office Results: Solo Plummets but Holds on to Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Weekend Box Office Results: Solo Plummets but Holds on to Box Office CrownMeanwhile, Infinity War continues to set records, and Adrift leads a trio of new releases on the weekend of June 1-3.by Todd Cunningham | June 3, 2018 |  CommentsSolo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;imploded in its second weekend at the box office, plunging to a disappointing $29.2 million. That was enough to hold off three new films and Deadpool 2, which wise-cracked its way to $23.3 million in its third week, to hold on to the top spot in North America. But that’s a precipitous 65% falloff from Solo‘s&nbsp;Friday–Sunday&nbsp;take during the Memorial Day holiday weekend, during which it made $84 million domestically. After two weekends Solo&nbsp;has taken in $149 million at home and $115 million abroad, giving it an&nbsp;&nbsp;underwhelming $264 million total globally for Disney, Lucasfilm and Imagine Entertainment.King&nbsp;of the Crop: Solo&nbsp;Wins Weekend, En Route to Disappointing Total(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)A final worldwide total between $330 million and $350 million seems likely for Solo&nbsp;– that would be the worst ever for a Star Wars&nbsp;live action release – so this king is dead financially. It joins the list of Mouse House megabombs that includes Mars Needs Moms&nbsp;in 2011, John Carter&nbsp;in 2012 and The Lone Ranger&nbsp;in 2013. Most of the Solo&nbsp;red ink that will splash onto Disney’s earnings report in the next few months flows from costly reshoots after directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord were dismissed and replaced by Ron Howard in June of 2017. The budget figure remains closely guarded, but reports put the production and marketing costs at more than $450 million.Long Live the King:&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War Continues to Set Records(Photo by Walt Disney Studios)Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War provided some solace for Disney, as it became the top-grossing Marvel release ever with $1.96 billion worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;In its sixth weekend, Infinity War&nbsp;was sixth domestically with $10.4 million and added another $25 million from overseas, including its fourth straight weekend at No. 1 in China. It’s now the all-time top-grossing non-Chinese film there with $356 million.Fresh surprise:&nbsp;Adrift&nbsp;Leads Trio of New Releases(Photo by Kirsty Griffin/STX Entertainment)Adrift, the lost-at-sea saga from STX starring Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin and directed by Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns), did the best of the newcomers with $11.5 million for third place. Upgrade, a a micro-budget sci-fi horror tale written and directed by Leigh Whannel (Saw, Insidious) and produced by low-budget horrormeister Jason Blum, brought in an impressive $4.4 for sixth place. Action Point, a Paramount action comedy starring Johnny Knoxville, was DOA with $2.3 million. That’s a far cry from the $32 million that Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&nbsp;debuted to in 2013.The trio of openers landed about where analysts had them pegged. In terms of critics and moviegoers,&nbsp; Adrift&nbsp;was Fresh on the Tomatometer at 71% and received significantly higher marks from audiences at 84%. Likewise,&nbsp;Upgrade&nbsp;earned 85% on the Tomatometer and received a 91% rating by moviegoers. Action Point was judged Rotten by the critics at 17%, but fans were far more forgiving at 43%.Beyond the Top 10:&nbsp;Overboard and&nbsp;RBG&nbsp;Set Studio Records(Photo by Diyah Pera/Pantelion)Overboard, the Eugenio Derbez comedy from Pantelion and Lionsgate, added $1.9 million – actually enough to sneak&nbsp;into the top 10 this week – to push its domestic total to $45.5 million. That makes it Pantelion’s top-grossing film ever, ahead of Derbez’s 2013 hit Instructions Not Included. And RBG, the documentary about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, kept rolling with $1.1 million in limited release. That ups its domestic total to $7.8 million, making it Magnolia Pictures’ all-time top earner.This Time Last Year:&nbsp;Wonder Woman&nbsp;Dominates&nbsp;in Debut(Photo by Warner Bros.)Warner Bros.

The critics favorite next week (98%), however, is the horror film Hereditary, toplined by Toni Collette. The other wide release is Hotel Artemis,&nbsp;a thriller starring Jodie Foster, Zachary Quinto and Jeff Goldblum, written and directed by Drew Pearce (Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation).

This year studios are taking the bold step in opening the biggest period at the box office with films from Eugenio Derbez, Jason Reitman and Dean Devlin. Wait, I’m sorry, what? Oh right, the summer box office got a sneak preview a week early this year and Avengers: Infinity War is still dominating&nbsp; with a $112.5 million second weekend, and will continue to do so. For, at least, one more weekend when the narrative will shift.King of the Crop: Infinity War Trying To Challenge The King(Photo by Marvel Studios)There is nothing to stop the interest in the latest Avengers film until Deadpool 2 hits theaters on May 18. Until then it has been given a clear path for everyone to wonder whether or not a new all-timer is on the horizon. Specifically in regards to Black Panther which now certainly appears to be headed for over $700 million. That journey was already $404 million in after its first ten days and was built upon with little to no challengers over the next three weeks after. This is its 12th straight week in the top ten and it has an outside chance to make it to 14, becoming the first film to achieve that since Disney’s Frozen from 2013-14. Infinity War is not going to make it that long, but it may not need to.There should be more skepticism that Infinity War will surpass Black Panther’s domestic total given that it is headed into Deadpool 2 and Solo territory at the end of the month. Not to mention Ocean’s 8, Incredibles 2 and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. (Even Action Point should best Avengers’ sixth week total.) But just looking at the numbers now it is reasonable how industry watchers could give Marvel a chance to best itself and continue its world domination. Infinity War has already reached a billion dollars worldwide (a day earlier than The Force Awakens’ 12-day record) and it does not even open in China until this Friday. It’s $1.16 billion ranks it 15th all-time.At $450 million in America it is $47 million ahead of Black Panther’s pace making it the second highest-grossing film ever after 10 days. The Force Awakens had made $540 million, so don’t start thinking it has a shot at the top spot. But after next weekend (when it will be an easy #1 again) it will likely be somewhere around $550 million (good enough for 8th best all-time) but also starting to lose a little momentum on Panther’s pace. (It did $66 million in weekend three.) At the same time, it is conceivable that by Day 17, Infinity War will have passed Panther’s worldwide gross of $1.33 millionFresh Surprise (But Not Really): Derbez’s Fans Go Overboard For RemakeDespite opening in just 1,623 theaters, the remake of&nbsp;Overboard with Eugenio Derbez and Anna Faris (taking on the roles of Goldie Hawn &amp; Kurt Russell, in that order) started with $13.1 million. Last year, Derbez’s How to Be a Latin Lover opened to $12.2 million in 1,118 theaters for a whopping $10,959 per-theater-average. The only 32%-approved Overboard’s $9,088 &nbsp;is nothing to sneeze at either, even if Infinity War’s $25,000+ average sort of does. It was still much better than Tully’s $2,355 average in 1,353 for just $3.1 million. This is a film that could still have potential for growth (with an 89% at RT,) but Focus may already have failed it despite a number of festival appearances in Miami, Cleveland, Wisconsin and Tribeca after a secret limited screening at Sundance this year. The numbers are similar to the prior Charlie Theron/Jason Reitman/Diablo Cody effort, Young Adult, which took the roadshow approach (i.e. no film festivals) to $3.4 million when it expanded to 986 theaters in 2011. That strategy may have cost Theron an Oscar nomination and it was released in December. If audiences quickly forget about this movie it could be déjà vu all over again and that is a shame.(More) Rotten Returns: Samaritan Does Not Make Good On Little PromiseDean Devlin’s Electric Entertainment has only distributed three films to date. The first, Rob Reiner’s LBJ (54% on the Tomatometer) made just $2.4 million in 659 theaters last November. Their first release, the little heard-of Blackway (20% with just five reviews) with Anthony Hopkins, Julia Stiles and Ray Liotta made $27,079 in 11 theaters. Devlin’s company is now releasing Devlin’s second directorial effort (after his long-delayed Geostorm finally came out in October to crash and burn.) Bad Samaritan, despite not screening for critics in most markets, did better with them (59%) than any narrative feature he’s been associated with since 2000’s The Patriot (61%) but with almost non-existent advertising it only made $1.7 million this weekend despite having the largest theater launch (2,007) amongst new releases this week.Beyond the Top Ten: Disobedience Continues To Find An Audience(Photo by Bleecker Street)Bleecker Street’s Disobedience expanded into 31 theaters this week and grossed another $310,000. The 89%-approved drama with Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams had the third-best PTA with $10,000 and has grossed $638,645.

May 5, 2017 WAS the official kickoff to the summer season and it was dominated by Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 which made $146.5 million. That was over $52 million more than the August 2014 release of the original. The Fate of the Furious had finally passed the $200 million mark in its fourth weekend. Derbez’s How to Be a Latin Lover dropped 58% and had grossed $20.5 million after ten days.On the Vine: Melissa McCarthy Looks For Second PlaceMelissa McCarthy reteams with husband Ben Falcone on Life of the Party, which should be a healthy #2 at the box office.

Amy Schumer’s Snatched tried to take advantage of the Mother’s Day weekend last year and made $19.5 million before dropping off sharply.

With apologies to Shakespeare – a phrase you don’t hear so often at RT – Disney and Lucasfilm&nbsp; appear to have been hoisted upon their own lightsaber, guilty of overestimating the appeal of a Han Solo origin saga and underestimating the strength of holdover hits Deadpool 2 and Marvel’s Avengers: Infinity War.King&nbsp;of the Crop: Solo For the Win, But Can It Make a Profit?Solo‘s domestic haul is the biggest Memorial Day opening since 2014, when X-Men: Days of Future Past brought in $114 million. That sounds impressive, and it is, but&nbsp;less&nbsp;so when you consider that Disney’s aggressive pre-release projections ranged as high as $150 million, and the film’s mammoth price tag, which is likely well north of $400 million for production and global marketing.(Photo by © Lucasfilm/ © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)Making matters worse is that Solo has failed to strongly connect internationally and won’t be offsetting its soft domestic debut with strong foreign performance to get into the black, as many films do. Opening in every major territory except Japan, it managed just $65 million overseas. Star Wars movies have always been far more popular in the United States than abroad, but that Solo number isn’t even half of the $135 million that the franchise’s previous anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Movie, rolled up in its overseas debut in December of 2016.The movie, loaded with costly reshoots after original directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord were dismissed last year, currently has a 70 percent Tomatometer rating — Fresh, but still the lowest for a live-action Star Wars film since the prequels. Opening weekend fans gave Solo, directed by Ron Howard, an A- in CinemaScore’s exit polling (it also currently has a&nbsp;positive Audience Score on RT). However, despite a cast that includes&nbsp;buzzy stars like Donald Glover and Thandie Newton, the film played older (64% over 25) and male (58 percent).Big competition: It’s Hard To Escape the Aftershocks of&nbsp;Deadpool 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;Infinity War(Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox )There is going to be plenty of speculation over the causes of&nbsp;Solo‘s softer-than-expected opening. Was Disney&nbsp;overly aggressive in rolling out Solo in May, rather than around the holidays in December like the last three Star Wars releases? (It would be up against its own Mary Poppins Returns&nbsp;if it had.)&nbsp;It’s been just five months since The Last Jedi came out and it remained in budget theaters until just weeks ago.Did it not give the competition&nbsp;wide enough berth? Fox’s Deadpool 2, in its second week, and Disney’s own Marvel release, Avengers: Infinity War, both targeted the same audience demographic and connected. The good news was that, driven by the top three films, the holiday weekend was up a whopping 24% from last year. The bad news, at least for Solo, might have been the impact of the overlap.Weekend&nbsp;runner-up Deadpool 2 will finish around $54 million for the four days domestically, and nearly topped Solo overseas with $57 million. It’s up to $287 million from abroad and $487 million worldwide for Fox. Avengers: Infinity War was third with a projected $21 million over the long weekend, and in the process passed 2012’s The Avengers on the all-time domestic box office list with $627 million. It’s now sixth. The $32 million it brought in overseas lifted its foreign total to $1.3 billion and its worldwide total to $1.9 billion, the fourth-best ever.Paramount’s Book Club&nbsp;was fourth with $12 million in its second weekend.&nbsp;That figure&nbsp;didn’t threaten the intergalactic smugglers and men in tights at the top of the heap, but it was a strong hold from its debut weekend, and did bring the total for the comedy starring Jane Fonda, Diane Keaton, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen to $35 million.(Photo by ©Marvel/©Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)While&nbsp;Solo has underperformed so far, Disney’s swing-for-the-fences approach has been working for its franchises. They don’t directly compare, but it’s worth noting that February’s&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;came out just over three months after Thor: Ragnarok, and that one did OK ($1.3 billion worldwide). And&nbsp;Infinity War&nbsp;followed a few months later with&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;still in theaters.It’s an overall go-for-it approach that has paid huge dividends since the Star Wars franchise was resuscitated in 2015 with The Force Awakens, and with Marvel, and&nbsp;Disney isn’t about to back off from its plans to expand the Star Wars galaxy now. There is the Rian Johnson film trilogy in the works, another trilogy from Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, as well as the Jon Favreau live-action TV series, and a Boba Fett film.Fresh surprises: A Priest and a Judge Expand, and Audiences Respond(Photo by © A24)RBG and First Reformed, two&nbsp;movies&nbsp;at the opposite end of the subject-matter spectrum&nbsp;from&nbsp;Solo, each with glossy Tomatometer ratings (94% and 98% respectively), counter-punched the space fantasy over the weekend.&nbsp;RBG, a documentary about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, directed by Betsy West and Julie Cohen, expanded by 40 to 415 theaters and cracked the top 10 domestically once again with $1.6 million for distributor Magnolia. That raised its overall total to $6.1 million after four weeks.&nbsp;First Reformed, director Paul Schrader’s intense crisis of faith drama starring Ethan Hawke, which is one of the year’s best-reviewed movies, added 25 locations and took in $282,507 for a strong $9,742 per-screen average in its second week. That lifted its domestic total to $425,469 for A24.On the Vine: Expect A Familiar-Looking Top Three(Photo by © STX Entertainment )The upcoming weekend likely will see the holiday weekend’s leaders vie for the top spot again. The new releases are the Johnny Knoxville comedy Action Point, the Shailene Woodley-Sam Claflin drama Adrift, and writer-director Lee Whanell’s thriller Upgrade. Keep an eye on the latter — RT audiences have given it a 97% Want To See score.&nbsp;Then, in two weeks time, two new films open to test the box office in two different ways. Will&nbsp;Ocean’s 8 be the all-female heist hit that some are hoping?

The opening of the glitzy heist film with the ensemble cast led by Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, and Anne Hathaway is the best, before adjusting for inflation*, of the four films that have followed the 1960 original starring Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and Dean Martin. That includes the 2001 remake starring Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, and George Clooney, who produced Ocean’s 8, written and directed by Gary Ross (The Hunger Games).Women made up a whopping 70 percent of the audience for the first female-fronted tentpole release of the summer, which was rated PG 13–rated came in with a lukewarm 67% Tomatometer score. It followed the familiar formula of the previous Ocean’s films, with Bullock as Danny Ocean’s just-out-of-jail sister, who assembles a posse of crime specialists — played by Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Awkwafina, Rihanna, and Helena Bonham Carter — to plunder the New York Met Gala.Ocean’s 8 should ultimately bring a healthy haul for Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow, since its production budget was a relatively modest $70 million. Its debut was the sixth-best of the year, just ahead of Ready Player One, and should only intensify Hollywood’s recent fascination with remakes featuring females in key roles. Ocean’s 8 added $12.2 million from a 12-market foreign debut.Fresh surprise: Hereditary&nbsp;Scares Up a Surprising Box Office(Photo by A24)The well-reviewed horror movie Hereditary translated its glossy 93% Tomatometer score into an impressive $13 million debut, the best ever for distributor A24, which acquired the film out of Sundance in January. It finished fourth, behind holdovers Solo ($15.2 million) and Deadpool 2 ($13.6 million).&nbsp;Toni Collette tops the cast of the chiller, which marked the directing debut of writer Ari Aster. Horror fans, notorious for tough grading, gave it a 63% audience rating.The weekend’s other wide opener, the action-thriller Hotel Artemis starring Jodie Foster, disappointed with $3.2 million and eighth place for Global Releasing. Jeff Goldblum, Zachary Quinto, Sofia Boutella, and Dave Bautista co-star in the feature directing debut of writer Drew Pearce (Iron Man 3). A 44% Audience Score amplified its soft 58% Tomatometer rating.Dino Might: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Roars to Life Overseas(Photo by Universal Pictures)That rumbling you heard may have been the leaping lizards of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, who stomped their way to $151 million from 48 territories for Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment in their foreign debut. It rolls out next week in China and June 22 in the U.S. and Canada, and hopes to follow in the giant footsteps of 2015’s Jurassic World and 1993’s Jurassic Park, which together generated $2.6 billion worldwide.Avengers: Infinity War will cross the $2 billion worldwide mark for Disney and Marvel, after adding $10.9 million from overseas this weekend.Beyond the Top 10: Fred Rogers Documentary Charms(Photo by Focus Features)At 99%, the highest Tomatometer rating of any release this weekend belonged to Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, and indie film fans got the word. The documentary about Fred Rogers, host of the long-running kids TV show Mister Rogers Neighborhood, brought in $470,000 from just 29 theaters for Focus Features, and generated a 96% Audience Score (as of this writing). It’s powerful $16,207 per-screen average was second only to well-reviewed specialty release Hearts Beat Loud, which has a&nbsp;92% Tomatometer score. The Nick Offerman–Kiersey Clemons father-daughter drama&nbsp;managed $74,053 from four theaters for an $18,513 per-screen average for Gunpowder and Sky.This Time Last Year: Wonder Woman Wows in Second Weekend(Photo by Warner Bros.

The top 12 films brought in $139 million.On the Vine: Pixar’s Incredibles 2 Expected to Kick Ocean’s Butt(Photo by Disney/Pixar)Look for the animated kids film from Incredibles 2, written and directed by Brad Bird, to knock the larcenous ladies of Ocean’s 8 from the top perch next week. It will be the first release from Pixar after word of the exit of studio chief John Lasseter. Disney announced Friday that he will leave at the end of the year, following sexual harassment allegations.Also making wide debuts will be the R-rated ensemble comedy Tag from Warner Bros., starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner, and the action film from India Race 3, starring Anil Kapoor and Salman Khan. The wave of indie films continues — there will be roughly 30 released this month — continues.

That’s impressive, but it’s also a number that Deadpool himself may joke about —&nbsp;with a little disappointment —&nbsp;in the next Deadpool movie.&nbsp;The figure puts the movie among the 30 best opening weekends ever, and any nine-digit figure in three days is nothing to sneeze at. But projections for opening weekend were much higher than that —&nbsp;early tracking had it in the $150-plus million range. Certainly, the $18.6 million it made on Thursday – among the 20 highest preview totals ever, and the best kick-start for an R-rated movie by a healthy $5 million – had us prepped for an even larger weekend. That doesn’t mean, however, that the movie isn’t going to break a record, eventually.King&nbsp;of the Crop:&nbsp;Deadpool 2‘s&nbsp;to taking over&nbsp;Christ(Photo by © Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Deadpool would love to catch up with —&nbsp;and surpass —&nbsp;The Passion of the Christ, the highest-grossing domestic R-rated film of all-time. He says exactly that in Deadpool 2. (Deadpool does lead the R-rated category in worldwide gross with $783 million, and that was without China.) The first film had an additional boost, opening over President’s Day weekend, which gave it a four-day total of $152 million, and it led the box office for three straight weeks. The sequel is about to get some holiday days to cash in on, but also a Memorial Day weekend during which&nbsp;Solo: A Star Wars Story is going to eat into its chances. Keep your eye on the third weekend: If Deadpool 2 can match the $285 million the first film had made by week three, it may be on track to grab another $85 million and pass Mel Gibson’s film to own both the domestic and international R-rated records.The total box office numbers for&nbsp;movies that open to more than $120 million are mightily impressive. Excluding some movies in the&nbsp;Twilight&nbsp;saga and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part 1 from the equation, most movies that open above that threshold manage to get across $300 million total. DC’s Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman are on the low-end, with $325 and $330 million totals, respectively. Deadpool 2 is in a better position than those films: Like the first film, it is critically acclaimed, currently sitting 83% on the Tomatometer, which could inform word-of-mouth and repeat viewings. Internationally, the film is already over $301 million and will more than recoup it’s $110 million budget plus prints and advertising.Fresh Surprise:&nbsp;Book Club&nbsp;Proves a Solid Superhero alternative(Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon / © Paramount Pictures)The good news is that Paramount’s Book Club met projections with a $12.5 million start —&nbsp;though to be fair, projections were all over the map. But the movie, which sits at 58% on the Tomatometer, did not match the heights of other May counterprogrammers from years past: Think Letters to Juliet, Unfaithful, and Hope Floats, amongst others, which all opened in the $13-$17 million range. There is a very healthy average multiple of 3.62 for female-led features during this time, which could put Book Club close to $45 million by the end of its run, if word-of-mouth can sustain it. Word-of-mouth is not helping McCarthy’s Life of the Party (39% on the Tomatometer and a 49% Audience Score), which dropped nearly 57% in its second weekend to earn just $7.7 million.Rotten Returns: Few show up for&nbsp;Show DogsGlobal Road, formerly known as Open Road Pictures, may have a Best Picture trophy on their mantle for Spotlight, but the studio is still yet to open a movie to more than $10 million —&nbsp;that’s what their Nightcrawler opened to in 2014 . Their new family film, Show Dogs, bowed this weekend to $6 million. The only film to open in May to less than $6 million and go on to reach the $20 million mark was Universal’s Flipper back in 1996.Beyond the Top 10: Kubrick, Schrader See Huge Per-Theater Averages(Photo by © A24)Apart from Deadpool 2 this weekend, the two best per-theater-averages belonged to a 50-year-old film and a legend who has been making films for five decades. Christopher Nolan’s new restoration of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey made $200,000 in just four theaters. Elsewhere, Paul Schrader’s First Reformed (97% on the Tomatometer) grossed $100,270 in four theaters —&nbsp;A24 will be expanding it into more theaters next weekend. Black Panther also officially dropped out of the top 10 after 13 weeks.&nbsp;Its total stands at just under $700 million domestic.This Time Last Year: Aliens Battle Guardians for Short-Lived VictoryJoel MearesAlien: Covenant managed to snatch the number 1 spot from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in &nbsp;a close $36.1 vs. $34.6 million battle. It then went on to have the second-worst multiple of last summer with a 2.05, earning just over $72 million. (The Tupac Shakur film, All Eyez On Me, had the lowest of the summer, with a 1.69 multiple.) Amy Schumer’s Snatched dropped nearly 60% after its Mother’s Day weekend opening, much like McCarthy’s Life of the Party did. The top 10 films grossed a collective $115.3 million, less than Deadpool 2’s entire three-day take, which led this weekend’s batch to a total of $197.9 million.On the Vine: A True Test for the Star Wars franchiseFive months after the release of The Last Jedi, Solo: A Star Wars Story opens over the more traditional Memorial Day weekend for the franchise. Initial ticket sales were outpacing that of Black Panther and tracking figures have it somewhere in the $170 million range for the four-day holiday. That would well surpass the record $139.8 million start for 2007’s Pirate’s of the Caribbean: At World’s End, the highest Memorial Day opening ever,&nbsp;and put it into a battle with Deadpool 2 for possibly the third-best gross of the summer. Avengers: Infinity War will be passing $600 million this week (and is over $1.81 billion worldwide) and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is still on the horizon as well.The Full Top 10:&nbsp;May&nbsp;18-20Deadpool 2 –&nbsp;$125 million ($125 million total)Avengers: Infinity War –&nbsp;$28.6 million ($595 million total)Book Club –&nbsp;$12.5 million ($12.5 million total)Life of the Party&nbsp;– $7.7 million ($31 million total)Breaking In&nbsp;– $6.4 million ($28.7 million total)Show Dogs –&nbsp;$6 million ($6 million total)Overboard –&nbsp;$4.7 million ($36.9 million total)A Quiet Place –&nbsp;$4 million ($176.1 million total)Rampage –&nbsp;$1.5 million ($92.4 million total)RBG –&nbsp;$1.2 million ($3.8 million total)Erik Childress can be heard each week evaluating box office on WGN Radio with Nick Digilio as well as on Business First AM with Angela Miles and his Movie Madness Podcast.[box office figures via Box Office Mojo]","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Quiz, Black, Ice, Hulu, Television, drama, National, Musicals","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/20110825/DeadpoolFeatured.jpg","slug":"weekend-box-office-results-deadpool-2-knocks-off-avengers-targets-passion-with-125-million"},{"id":"47509094721035","title":"Box Office: Black Panther Continues Its Reign","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Black Panther Continues Its ReignAll Hail the King! Continuing its historic run, the new face of the Marvel Cinematic Universe easily took first place this weekendby Sujit Chawla | February 25, 2018 |  CommentsAll Hail the King! Continuing its historic run, the new face of the Marvel Cinematic Universe easily took first place this weekend while three newcomers opened to so-so results.Generating the second biggest second weekend in history,&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;took in an estimated $108M, bringing its domestic total to a whopping $400M. Only&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;($149M) had a better second weekend. After only 10 days, the new King of Wakanda and his powerful team have outgrossed almost all other Marvel films, and by the end of the day tomorrow will be third behind only the two superteam Avengers films. By the end of next weekend only the original&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;film will be ahead of it and even that will likely not withstand the power of the Panther. Compared to&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;after the first 10 days, Black Panther&nbsp;is running 7% ahead and showing no signs of slowing down. At this pace&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;could easily hit $650M. Internationally, the film picked up an estimated $83.8M this weekend, bringing its total overseas to $304M and making for a worldwide total of $704M with the lucrative Chinese market still to open in a couple of weeks.Yes, there were other films still in the marketplace, even if Black Panther&nbsp;outgrossed all of them combined. Again. Debuting in second place was the R-rated Warner comedy&nbsp;Game Night&nbsp;which made an estimated $16.6M from 3,488 theaters for a per screen average of $4,759. A solid B+ from CinemaScore and largely good reviews is a good sign the movie won’t drop precipitously over the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;Peter Rabbit&nbsp;held on nicely in its third weekend, slipping 28.3% to an estimated $12.5M, bringing its total up to $71.3M.Opening in fourth was the female-led sci-fi actioner&nbsp;Annihilation&nbsp;which took in an estimated $11M from 2,012 theaters for a per screen average of $5,467. Audiences either did not like, or were confused by, the film as it garnered a very poor C grade on CinemaScore, while critics were very bullish on the latest from writer/director Alex Garland. The final chapter in the steamy romance trilogy,&nbsp;Fifty Shades Freed&nbsp;continued its rapid decline falling 60% in its third weekend to an estimated $6.9M, bringing its total to $89.5M. The first two films in the series were sitting at $147M and $103M respectively at the same point in their runs.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;continued its tremendous run falling only 28.8% from last weekend, picking up another $5.65M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to an amazing $387.3M. Clint Eastwood’s latest&nbsp;The 15:17 to Paris&nbsp;has not fared particularly well as it fell another 52.5% in its third weekend to an estimated $3.6M, bringing its total up to $32.2M.The not-so-little film that could,&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;once again had a great hold, falling 32.5% in its 10th weekend to an estimated $3.4M, bringing its total up to $160.7M, remarkable considering it opened to only $8.8M. The last debut in the top 10,&nbsp;Every Day, opened at number nine to an estimated $3.1M from 1,667 theaters for a per screen average of only $1,862. Audiences liked what they saw, giving the film a solid B+ rating on CinemaScore, but critics were not nearly as kind. Rounding out the top 10 was the animated&nbsp;Early Man&nbsp;which fell 46.7% in its second weekend to an estimated $1.7M, bringing its total up to only $6.8M. Look for a finale in the $10M range.The top ten films grossed an estimated $172.5M over the weekend which was up 66% from last year when&nbsp;Get Out&nbsp;debuted to $33.4M; and up 89% from 2016 when&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;held on to the top spot with $56.5M.Follow&nbsp;Box Office Guru on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Signature, YA, Apple, joker, Con, Us, movies, Access, TV, mockumentary, TV+, Witch","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/25131854/RT_BoxOffice_Black-Panther_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-black-panther-continues-its-reign"},{"id":"47509093239306","title":"Box Office: Black Panther Rules Oscar Weekend Nearing $900M Global","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Black Panther Rules Oscar Weekend Nearing $900M GlobalWith all eyes on the Academy Awards, Hollywood was ruled once again by the runaway blockbuster sensation Black Pantherby Gitesh Pandya | March 4, 2018 |  CommentsWith all eyes on the Academy Awards, Hollywood was ruled once again by the runaway blockbuster sensation Black Panther&nbsp;which amassed an estimated $65.7M in its third frame making more than the next seven films combined. That was the third biggest gross of all-time for any film in its third weekend of release behind only Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;($90.2M) and&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;($68.5M) which both got help from the potent New Year’s holiday at those times. The decline for T’Challa this weekend was only 41%.Panther&nbsp;watched its domestic cume crush the half-billion mark after only 17 days of release as the total soared to a stunning $501.1M. That ties it with&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;for third fastest ever to break $500M.&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;did it in 16 days this past December while&nbsp;Force Awakens&nbsp;needed just ten days. It should be noted that the two&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;films played during the lucrative Christmas holiday season while&nbsp;Jurassic World&nbsp;was in late June when most schools were closing for summer vacations.&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;has had some school breaks, but played in a more standard time of year when box office sales are historically slower.On the all-time domestic blockbuster chart, the Wakanda hit has risen to number ten and is currently sandwiched in between fellow Disney titles&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;and&nbsp;Finding Dory. In fact, seven of the top eleven blockbusters are from the Mouse House which is already planning out its box office dominance over the years ahead with an impressive calendar of titles it just announced leading into 2023. These include ten untitled Marvel films which most certainly would include one, if not two Black Panther&nbsp;sequels.Black Panther has now had smaller declines on the second and third weekends than Avengers&nbsp;did in May 2012 and the road ahead continues to look bright. By Saturday it will surpass the $533.3M of&nbsp;The Dark Knight&nbsp;and it now stands a great chance of also passing the $623.4M of&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;to become the highest grossing super hero movie of all-time in North America. The box office run and fan love for this film have exceeded all industry expectations and a domestic final in the $630-640M range is possible putting it at number five all-time.International markets are also rocking for&nbsp;Panther&nbsp;with this weekend contributing an estimated $56.2M pushing the overseas cume to $396.6M and the global haul to $897.7M. The Marvel sensation will smash the $400M international and $900M worldwide marks on Monday. Top markets continue to be the U.K. at $49.1M and South Korea at $41.4M. Russia just went nationwide this past week, Japan opened well this weekend, and the final market of China opens this coming Friday where it is expected to be a big player. The last MCU film&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;just did $112M there during the November-December period, although it opened day and date with the U.S. Worldwide, Black Panther&nbsp;looks to be on a trajectory to reach more than $1.25 billion at the global box office.Two new star-driven, gritty action films opened this weekend fighting for the number two spot and Jennifer Lawrence’s espionage vehicle&nbsp;Red Sparrow&nbsp;came out ahead debuting to an estimated $17M from 3,056 locations for a good $5,563 average. Reviews were mixed and audiences were ok on the R-rated film with the CinemaScore grade being a B. The performance was almost even with Charlize Theron’s&nbsp;Atomic Blonde&nbsp;which bowed to $18.3M last July with a nearly identical average. Demo data indicated that the audience was 53% female, 79% over 25, and 60% white.Bruce Willis saw a decent start for his new action offering&nbsp;Death Wish&nbsp;which bowed to an estimated $13M from 2,847 theaters for a $4,575 average. The R-rated revenge tale was clobbered by film critics, but paying audiences were much more pleased as the MGM release earned a good B+ grade from CinemaScore. Willis has been absent from the big screen for some time with his last major action film being the ensemble pic&nbsp;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&nbsp;in 2014 and his last time anchoring a non-sequel being&nbsp;Looper&nbsp;in 2012. Studio data showed that the crowd was 57% male, 53% over 35, and 57% white.&nbsp;Death Wish&nbsp;opened much like Liam Neeson’s recent action film&nbsp;The Commuter&nbsp;which debuted to $13.7M in January.The R-rated comedy Game Night&nbsp;held up well in its second weekend dropping 37% to an estimated $10.7M giving Warner Bros. $33.5M to date. With no new kids competition, Sony’s family comedy Peter Rabbit&nbsp;fell only 22% to an estimated $10M lifting the total to $84M on its way past the century mark.Paramount’s sci-fi pic Annihilation&nbsp;grossed an estimated $5.7M, off 49%, for a sum of $20.6M. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;kept up the great legs taking in an estimated $4.5M in its eleventh consecutive weekend in the top ten. Off a mere 20%, the Sony blockbuster has amassed $393.2M from North America and a giant $928.9M worldwide.Suffering the worst decline in the top ten was Fifty Shades Freed&nbsp;which fell 54% to an estimated $3.3M with $95.6M overall for Universal. Global is now $346.2M. Like&nbsp;Jumanji, The Greatest Showman&nbsp;has been a major crowdpleaser since Christmas and also spent its eleventh straight frame in the top ten. The Fox hit took in an estimated $2.7M, off just 22%, for a $164.6M cume putting the worldwide tally at a big $375.8M. Rounding out the top ten was Orion’s Every Day&nbsp;with an estimated $1.6M, down 48%, and only $5.3M thus far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.1M this weekend which was down 20% from last year when&nbsp;Logan&nbsp;opened at number one with $88.4M; and down 6% from 2016 when&nbsp;Zootopia&nbsp;debuted in the top spot with&nbsp;$75.1M.Follow&nbsp;Box Office Guru on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Geographic","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/04130329/RT_BoxOffice_Black-Panther-wk-3_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-black-panther-rules-oscar-weekend-nearing-900m-global"},{"id":"47509093238281","title":"Box Office: Black Panther Smashes $1 Billion with 4th Weekend at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Black Panther Smashes $1 Billion with 4th Weekend at #1The Marvel sensation shattered the $1 billion global mark thanks to continued success around the world and its opening in its final market of Chinaby Gitesh Pandya | March 11, 2018 |  CommentsBox office king Black Panther&nbsp;became the first film since all-time champ Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;to hold the number one spot for four consecutive weeks. The Marvel sensation also shattered the $1 billion global mark thanks to continued success around the world and its opening in its final market of China which was sensational.In North America,&nbsp;Panther&nbsp;declined by only 38% to an estimated $41.1M boosting the domestic haul to $562M. This was the third highest gross of all-time for any movie in its fourth weekend trailing just Avatar&nbsp;and&nbsp;Force Awakens. By comparison,&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;grossed $36.7M Friday-to-Sunday in its fourth weekend which was helped by the Memorial Day holiday. The T’Challa hit is now running 9.5% ahead of&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;after the first 24 days of release.It also jumped up two spots on the all-time domestic blockbusters chart leaping over&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;and The Dark Knight&nbsp;in the process and is now the number two super hero movie ever behind just Avengers&nbsp;which it is likely to surpass as well. A North American final in the $650M range may occur.Overseas the pressure was on for&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;to deliver in its last market of China, and boy did it. The Wakanda smash debuted to a stunning $66.5M there this weekend which was the fourth largest opening ever for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Overall, international territories added an estimated $100M to the total which climbed to $516.6M putting the global box office at $1.08 billion with more to come. Globally, Black Panther&nbsp;will soon pass&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;which is the film which first introduced the character. And if this durable run keeps going, it is possible that the $1.4 billion final of&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;will be challenged.Opening in second place was the next big-budget adventure on Disney’s slate, the fantasy kidpic&nbsp;A Wrinkle in Time&nbsp;which bowed to an estimated $33.3M from 3,980 locations for a solid $8,371 average. Reviews were mixed for the PG-rated film but starpower from Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, and Mindy Kaling helped bring in audiences.The performance was even with the $33M debut of the studio’s&nbsp;Tomorrowland&nbsp;from 2015 which also was an effects-driven fantasy aimed at families and boasting Hollywood star wattage, George Clooney in that case. That film faded fast and was seen as an expensive flop for the Mouse House. Its $190M production budget was at least 50% bigger than&nbsp;Wrinkle‘s so the new Oprah movie starts off its run in a better financial position.Still, more was hoped for from this pricey project filled with stars, based on a beloved book, and backed with a formidable marketing push. Disney’s recent March offerings coming from the fairy tale type genre include&nbsp;Cinderella&nbsp;($67.9M debut),&nbsp;Oz the Great and Powerful&nbsp;($79.1M) and of course last year’s megahit Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;($174.8M). On the other hand,&nbsp;Wrinkle&nbsp;did open better than the $26.9M of 2016’s Johnny Depp sequel&nbsp;Alice Through the Looking Glass&nbsp;which cost one pretty penny for Disney. Studio data showed that the audience was 57% female and 57% over 25 and the film earned a decent B grade from CinemaScore.This weekend saw a rare case when the top two films in the country were both directed by African-American filmmakers. Ryan Coogler did Black Panther&nbsp;while Ava Duvernay helmed Wrinkle. Last spring also saw big grosses from black directors with F. Gary Gray doing&nbsp;The Fate of the Furious&nbsp;and Jordan Peele giving moviegoers one of the year’s most profitable films,&nbsp;Get Out.The new horror entry&nbsp;Strangers: Prey at Night&nbsp;enjoyed a decent start opening in third place with an estimated $10.5M this weekend. The Aviron release averaged a respectable $4,253 from 2,464 locations. Reviews were not so good for the R-rated film but young adults responded to the frights which have been hard to find as Hollywood has not unleashed many scary movies so far in 2018.Jennifer Lawrence witnessed a 52% decline during the second weekend of release of her latest action movie Red Sparrow. The Fox title did an estimated $8.2M and boosted its cume to $31.1M. The comedy Game Night&nbsp;held up well again sliding by only 24% to an estimated $7.9M pushing the sum to $45M for Warner Bros.Dropping 32% in its fifth round was the kidpic Peter Rabbit&nbsp;with an estimated $6.8M giving Sony $93.5M to date. The Bruce Willis action remake Death Wish&nbsp;fell 49% in its sophomore session to an estimated $6.6M giving MGM $23.9M to date.Paramount’s sci-fi entry Annihilation&nbsp;dropped 44% in its third frame to an estimated $3.2M lifting the total to $26.1M. The critically panned action title&nbsp;The Hurricane Heist&nbsp;from Entertainment Studios was mostly ignored by moviegoers debuting to an estimated $3.2M from 2,402 theaters for a dismal $1,311 average. Jumanji&nbsp;did another $2.8M, according to estimates, slipping 38% and putting Sony at $397.3M.The crime comedy&nbsp;Gringo&nbsp;from Amazon debuted just below the top ten to an estimated $2.6M from 2,404 locations for a poor $1,082 average. Reviews for the R-rated film starring David Oyelowo and Charlize Theron were more on the negative side and consumer excitement never really took off.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.4M this weekend which was down 17% from last year when&nbsp;Kong: Skull Island&nbsp;opened at number one with $61M; but up 4% from 2016 when Zootopia&nbsp;held onto the top spot with&nbsp;$51.3M.Follow&nbsp;Box Office Guru on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"batman, Classic, leads, sag","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/11164137/Black-Panther-wk-4-600x314.jpg","slug":"box-office-black-panther-smashes-1-billion-with-4th-weekend-at-1"},{"id":"47509094731278","title":"Box Office: Jumanji Retakes First Place Over Super Bowl Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Jumanji Retakes First Place Over Super Bowl WeekendIt's been all golds and silvers for the entire run so farby Gitesh Pandya | February 4, 2018 |  CommentsMovie fans from Philadelphia to New England and from coast to coast mostly avoided the multiplexes as the Super Bowl frame sent box office sales plunging to their lowest levels since October. With its strong legs, the runaway action-comedy sensation Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;reclaimed the number one spot in its seventh weekend grossing an estimated $11M, off 32%. This marks the fourth time the Sony smash has held the top spot while the other three frames all saw a second place finish. It’s been all golds and silvers for the entire run so far.The cume topped the $350M mark this weekend reaching $352.6M putting&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;at number 42 on the all-time list of domestic blockbusters. It’s also a day away from becoming Dwayne Johnson’s highest grossing domestic hit ever when it surpasses the $353M of&nbsp;Furious 7&nbsp;– something nobody saw coming. A final North American gross in the $380-390M range is possible placing it in the all-time Top 30.Overseas markets have been rocking too.&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;cracked the half-billion mark in offshore sales this weekend reaching $503.1M led by China’s $74.6M which is a whopping 81% higher than what Star Wars: The Last Jedi&nbsp;has made in that country. Global is now at $855.7M with Japan still to come in April so a final in the area of $950M seems likely.Dropping from first to second was the sci-fi trilogy ender Maze Runner: The Death Cure&nbsp;with an estimated $10.2M. Fox’s action sequel fell 58% in its sophomore frame which is understandable for a threequel. Cume is $39.8M. Add in $37M from China, part of the $142.9M international total, and the global gross now stands at $182.6M. The trilogy has now amassed $839M worldwide combined.Third place went to the only new wide release of the weekend – the Helen Mirren-led horror title&nbsp;Winchester&nbsp;which debuted to an estimated $9.3M. CBS Films and Lionsgate saw a $3,730 per theater average from 2,480 locations. Studios often program female-skewing fright films onto Super Bowl weekend targeting people who might be less interested in the Big Game. Data indicated that the crowd for the PG-13 thriller was 58% female and 64% over 25. Reviews were brutal but ticket buyers were pleased as the CinemaScore was a B- which is commendable for this genre.The P.T. Barnum musical sensation The Greatest Showman&nbsp;continued to put on a great show and please the crowds taking fourth place with an estimated $7.8M, off a low 18%. The Fox film spent its seventh consecutive weekend in the top five which is something that last year’s top grossing blockbusters like&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi,&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast, and&nbsp;Wonder Woman&nbsp;could not do. The Hugh Jackman hit has taken in $137.5M and is on track to end above the $160M mark.&nbsp;Showman&nbsp;is now at $290.5M worldwide and climbing.The Western Hostiles&nbsp;dropped 46% to an estimated $5.5M in its second weekend of national play. Entertainment Studios has banked $21.2M to date. Oscar contender The Post&nbsp;fell by 43% to an estimated $5.2M putting Fox at $67.2M. Steven Spielberg has another film right around the corner with the sci-fi pic&nbsp;Ready Player One&nbsp;opening next month.Warner Bros. collected an estimated $4.7M, off 46%, for its military drama 12 Strong&nbsp;which has grossed $37.3M so far. Heist flick Den of Thieves&nbsp;also did an estimated $4.7M falling 46% for STX putting the new sum at $36.3M. Both films are in their third rounds of play.Academy Award frontrunner The Shape of Water&nbsp;slipped 27% to an estimated $4.3M giving Fox Searchlight $44.6M. Director Guillermo del Toro won the DGA prize on Saturday night and the film overall has performed well during awards season picking up the PGA trophy as well.

The hard R film grossed an estimated $38.8M this weekend from 3,768 theaters for a strong $10,299 average. It was the smallest debut of the franchise and fell 17% below last year’s&nbsp;Fifty Shades Darker&nbsp;and was down 54% from the bow of 2015’s&nbsp;Fifty Shades of Grey. All were released in February just ahead of Valentine’s Day.Studio data showed that females were by far the dominant group as with the last two installments. This time they were 75% of the crowd. 55% were under 30 and 53% were white. Reviews were quite negative but the CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+. The love holiday has always seen sales shoot up for the&nbsp;Fifty Shades&nbsp;film and this year it should be no different. Overseas markets generated a giant $98.1M debut this weekend making for a global launch of $136.9M. By Valentine’s Day, the combined worldwide gross for the trilogy will smash the $1.1 billion mark.Sony scored a hit with the new kidpic&nbsp;Peter Rabbit&nbsp;which beat industry expectations to open to an estimated $25M in the silver medal position. The PG-rated comedy averaged a solid $6,711 from 3,725 locations and earned a good A- grade from CinemaScore. Reviews were mixed, but not too important to the commercial viability for a family film like this. With no other films aimed directly at younger children for a month, and many schools having breaks around Presidents Day,&nbsp;Peter Rabbit&nbsp;has a lucrative road ahead into the spring season.Clint Eastwood’s latest directorial project&nbsp;The 15:17 to Paris&nbsp;debuted in third place with an estimated $12.6M averaging a moderate $4,142 from 3,042 locations. The PG-13 film cast the real-life heroes of a terror attack playing themselves and played to an older crowd. Studio data from Warner Bros. showed that the crowd was 86% over 25 while the gender split was even with females at 51%. Reviews were not very good and audiences were not too impressed either as the CinemaScore grade was only a B-.Following the new releases were the two most durable hits of this winter season. Sony’s adventure-comedy sensation Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle&nbsp;slipped a mere 10% in its eighth weekend to an estimated $9.8M pushing the cume to $365.7M which now ranks number 38 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing&nbsp;The Jungle Book.&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;has now collected $516.1M from international markets boosting the global gross to an incredible $881.8M with Japan yet to open. The $900M barrier should be broken next weekend.The Christmas season’s other leggy hit The Greatest Showman&nbsp;took fifth place with an estimated $6.4M, sliding only 17% in its eighth frame. Fox has banked an impressive $146.5M and is within striking distance of the $148.8M of&nbsp;Les Miserables, Hugh Jackman’s other big musical blockbuster. Global is now $314.2M.Moviegoers have been spreading fantastic word of mouth for both&nbsp;Jumanji&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;over the last two months. Now, both films have spent eight consecutive weekends in the Top Five. No other movies from 2017 were able to do that.The trilogy ender Maze Runner: The Death Cure&nbsp;dropped 43% in its third round to an estimated $6M for a new total of $49M. Worldwide stands at $229.2M. Horror entry Winchester&nbsp;fell 46% in its second weekend, a commendable decline for the genre, for an estimated $5.1M frame. With $17.2M to date, CBS Films and Lionsgate look to reach about $28M.Taking in an estimated $3.5M was the Streep-Hanks project The Post&nbsp;sliding 33% and putting Fox at $72.8M. Oscar front-runner The Shape of Water&nbsp;dropped 33% to an estimated $3M this weekend lifting its cume to $49.8M. Rounding out the top ten was the action title Den of Thieves&nbsp;with an estimated $2.9M, down 37%, and $41M overall for STX.The top ten films grossed an estimated $113.1M which was down 34% from last year when&nbsp;The LEGO Batman Movie&nbsp;opened at number one with $53M; and also down 48% from 2016 when&nbsp;Deadpool&nbsp;shattered records and debuted in the top spot with&nbsp;$132.4M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Century, fresh, YA, CMT, aapi, scorecard, hidden","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/11130843/RT_BoxOffice_Fifty-Shades-Freed_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-fifty-shades-wins-gold-peter-rabbit-takes-silver"},{"id":"47509094745621","title":"Box Office: Colossal $450M Global Launch for Last Jedi","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Colossal $450M Global Launch for Last JediSkywalker tentpole Star Wars: The Last Jedi arrived with an explosive launch delivering the second biggest opening weekend of all timeby Gitesh Pandya | December 17, 2017 |  CommentsA wildly popular box office force awakened as the much anticipated Skywalker tentpole&nbsp;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&nbsp;arrived with an explosive launch delivering the second biggest opening weekend of all-time. Disney and Lucasfilm amassed an eye-popping amount of business grossing estimated $220M in North America alone and $450M worldwide in the first weekend of play. With the Christmas holidays coming up in a week, the new space saga will demolish the billion dollar barrier within days.Averaging a scorching $51,996 per theater from 4,232 locations in the U.S. and Canada,&nbsp;Last Jedi&nbsp;connected with the massive fan base and came in only 11% behind the $248M debut of 2015’s&nbsp;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;which still stands as the all-time record holder. That film enjoyed 32 years of anticipation from fans wanting to see the beloved original characters again. Last Jedi, on the other hand, is the third Star Wars&nbsp;movie in as many years and was always expected to open lower. But retaining 89% of the opening weekend audience was incredibly good, especially since the box office has been seeing franchise fatigue hit so many major brands out there.Compared to last year’s spin-off film&nbsp;Rogue One, Last Jedi&nbsp;debuted a sturdy 42% higher. Disney has followed the James Cameron strategy by slotting Star Wars&nbsp;films in mid-December allowing them to open huge and then have Christmas help the second frame and New Years boost the third round. Titanic&nbsp;and Avatar&nbsp;began their leggy runs this way in 1997 and 2009, respectively. Seven of the eight largest opening weekends in history are now from Disney-owned films.Critics and audiences alike have been enjoying the new&nbsp;Star Wars. Reviews were extremely positive with some calling the PG-13 pic the best installment of the entire saga. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave a promising A grade. Studio data showed that the crowd was 58% male and 62% over 25. 30% of the weekend gross came from 3D formats and the film accounted for a whopping 82% of all money spent on the top ten films this weekend.The weekend kicked off with a monster $104.8M opening day gross on Friday which included $45M from Thursday night previews. Both of those figures were the second biggest of all time behind&nbsp;Force Awakens&nbsp;which did $119.1M including $57M from pre-shows. Saturday dropped 39% to $64M and the studio is estimating a 20% dip Sunday to $51.3M. A year ago,&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;fell 19% on its Sunday. Add in Coco&nbsp;and Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;and Disney is now in a position to control the number one spot over eight of the final nine weekends of 2017. The trio will probably join forces to gross over $3.3 billion worldwide and the studio has plenty of moneymakers on the calendar for next year including the next&nbsp;Avengers&nbsp;and Star Wars&nbsp;films.Where does&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;go from here with the holidays coming up? If it follows the same trajectory as Rogue One&nbsp;from last year then it ends up with $755M domestic. If it follows Force Awakens&nbsp;however, then the mighty hit will soar to a jaw-dropping $831M beating&nbsp;Avatar&nbsp;for the number two spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Outside of North America, Last Jedi&nbsp;premiered to a giant $230M from all markets except China which opens on January 5. Rogue One&nbsp;and Force Awakens&nbsp;also released there in early January. Top debuts were the U.K. at $36.7M, Germany with $23.6M and France at $18.1M. Proportionately, recent Star Wars&nbsp;movies had domestic shares that were higher than what many other Hollywood action franchises had. Force Awakens&nbsp;was at 45.3% while Rogue One&nbsp;was a very high 50.5%. 30-40% is more common for big action and sci-fi tentpoles. Still, the road ahead for&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;could see a path to the neighborhood of $1.7 billion worldwide, and that’s not counting sales from merchandise, video release, TV rights, etc.In a box office galaxy far, far away in second place was Fox’s new animated entry&nbsp;Ferdinand&nbsp;which opened to an estimated $13.3M from 3,621 locations for a mild $3,680 average. The PG-rated comedy is meant to make its cash over the long term across the holiday season and the studio positioned it to grab a seat in the marketplace just as schools around the country begin their end-of-year holiday breaks each day throughout this week ahead. Two years ago, the studio countered Force Awakens&nbsp;with the kidpic&nbsp;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip&nbsp;which bowed to a similar $14.3M before finishing at six times that amount with $85.9M.After three weeks atop the box office charts, Pixar’s Coco&nbsp;had to give up the crown to one of its Disney siblings. Down 46%, the toon grossed an estimated $10M and boosted its cume to $150.8M.&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;is now the 18th film from the animation giant to break $150M domestic. That’s every one of its movies, with the lone exception of&nbsp;The Good Dinosaur. The global tally is now $448.2M led by China’s amazing $153.9M which is even bigger than the North American take. With the holiday season still ahead, plus openings in six major overseas markets to come, there is much potential still ahead for the Mexico-set pic.Against all the high-profile blockbusters this season, Julia Roberts has quietly been building a little fortune with her new film Wonder&nbsp;which slipped 36% to an estimated $5.4M in its fifth weekend pushing the cume up to an impressive $109.3M. The Lionsgate hit is the top-grossing film that the Oscar winner has anchored since&nbsp;Erin Brockovich&nbsp;in 2000.Suffering one of the larger drops in the top ten, Justice League&nbsp;fell 57% to an estimated $4.2M as a new action tentpole seized control of audience attention. Warner Bros. has banked $219.5M to date and should be headed for a domestic final of about $235M putting it just ahead of last November’s super hero offering&nbsp;Doctor Strange&nbsp;which did $232.6M. Considering how&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;had more firepower from a collection of better known comic book characters, the studio can’t be pleased with the result. The international take is now $414.5M (a quarter of that just from China) and global is now $634M. Finishing up in the neighborhood of $675M worldwide now seems likely which would be almost identical to&nbsp;Strange.Audiences continued to flock to the comedy sequel Daddy’s Home 2&nbsp;which has displayed solid legs since debuting over a month ago. The Paramount film did an estimated $3.8M, off 36%, for a $96.6M total. Marvel sequel&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;took a stronger hit falling 53% to an estimated $3M giving Disney $306.4M domestic and $841.8M global.After a formidable nationwide expansion, James Franco’s The Disaster Artist&nbsp;stumbled falling 59% to an estimated $2.6M despite boosting its theater count by 20%. A24 sits at $12.9M to date. Fox’s Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;followed by declining 52% to an estimated $2.5M with a cume to date of $97.3M. Awards contender Lady Bird&nbsp;rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.1M, down 39%, for a $26M sum.In the shadow of Luke Skywalker, a number of smaller films generated solid results in limited release as they expanded during their journey through awards season. Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water&nbsp;grossed an estimated $1.7M from 158 locations for a $11,000 average and $3.6M total for Fox Searchlight. The Winston Churchill pic Darkest Hour&nbsp;took in an estimated $850,000 from 84 playdates for a $10,119 average for Focus which has made $2.3M so far. Both films expand next weekend into over 700 theaters nationwide a piece.The Sony Classics drama Call Me by Your Name&nbsp;played in 30 sites and collected an estimated $492,000 for a $16,400 average. Cume is $2M. I, Tonya&nbsp;featuring Margot Robbie grossed an estimated $176,000 from just five houses for an impressive $35,200 average. Neon’s cume is $554,000 with most of the release still ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $267M which was up 31% from last year when&nbsp;Rogue One&nbsp;opened at number one with $155.1M; but down 12% from 2015 when&nbsp;The Force Awakens&nbsp;debuted in the top spot with&nbsp;$248M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"archives, video, star, sequels, action","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/17135141/RT_BoxOffice_last-jedi_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-colossal-450m-global-launch-for-last-jedi"},{"id":"47509094755863","title":"Box Office: Coco Repeats at #1 Over Slow December Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Coco Repeats at #1 Over Slow December WeekendIt was a ho-hum session at the North American box office as moviegoers feasted on post-Thanksgiving leftoversby Gitesh Pandya | December 3, 2017 |  CommentsIt was a ho-hum session at the North American box office as moviegoers feasted on post-Thanksgiving leftovers with studios not releasing any major new titles. Disney and Pixar topped the charts once again with their animated hit Coco&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $26.1M in its second round dropping by a reasonable 49% from its holiday weekend launch. After 12 full days of play, the Mexican tale has banked a solid $108.7M and may be only halfway to its final destination through the holidays.A year ago, Disney also was number one with Moana&nbsp;with a slightly better weekend gross of $28.3M, though with a similar dip of 50%.&nbsp;Coco, another well-liked animated hit, may follow a similar path in the weeks ahead, although it will have to face a bigger&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;movie in&nbsp;The Last Jedi&nbsp;than last December’s&nbsp;Rogue One. A big $69M overseas weekend helped push the latest Pixar story to $280M worldwide.It was another troubling fall for the super hero epic&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;which dropped 60% in its third weekend to an estimated $16.6M suffering the worst decline of any movie in the top ten. The domestic total to date is now $197.3M which is 34% behind last year’s Batman v Superman&nbsp;at the same point in the run. Warner Bros. still looks on track to end near the $240M mark which would be the lowest level in the five-film DC Extended Universe. International markets are holding better and global is now $567.4M on its way to the $700M neighborhood.Lionsgate saw its uplifting family drama Wonder&nbsp;stay in third for a third weekend with an estimated $12.5M. The Julia Roberts hit was down a reasonable 45% and has put its cume at an impressive $88M with much of the holiday season still ahead. Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;dropped 43% to an estimated $9.7M pushing Disney’s domestic tally to $291.4M. Global now stands at $816.4M.The comedy sequel Daddy’s Home 2&nbsp;grossed an estimated $7.5M, off 43%, and has brought in $82.8M for Paramount. Fox’s mystery hit Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;fell 49% to an estimated $6.7M and has banked $84.8M to date.Fresh from its win this past week for Best Picture and Best Actress from the New York Film Critics Circle, plus Saoirse Ronan’s hosting of&nbsp;Saturday Night Live, the indie hit&nbsp;Lady Bird&nbsp;widened again and grossed an estimated $4.5M climbing up 12% from last weekend. A24 has collected $17.1M so far and has much more to go as awards season gets heated.The acclaimed arthouse hit Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&nbsp;expanded into more markets again and followed closely with an estimated $4.5M as well lifting the sum to $13.7M for Fox Searchlight.The Biblical toon The Star&nbsp;took in an estimated $4M, down only 42%, and has put Sony at $27.3M thus far. STX saw its raunchy comedy sequel&nbsp;A Bad Moms Christmas&nbsp;dip only 29% – by far the smallest drop in the top ten for films not expanding. With an estimated $3.5M this weekend, the overall sum is now $64.8M.With the arrival of December comes more critically acclaimed films getting into the Oscar race with limited debuts and this weekend saw fantastic results for two new entries. James Franco’s&nbsp;The Disaster Artist&nbsp;bowed to an estimated $1.2M from 19 theaters in a dozen different markets for a stellar $64,263 average for A24. Meanwhile in only two locations, Guillermo del Toro’s latest creation&nbsp;The Shape of Water&nbsp;opened to an estimated $167,000 for a scorching $83,500 average. Both expand in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $95.6M which was up 14% from last year when Moana&nbsp;stayed at number one with $28.3M; and up 10% from 2015 when Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2&nbsp;remained in the top spot with&nbsp;$18.9M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"20th, international, Netflix, SundanceTV, in, miniseries, Lifetime, 45, AMC, Crunchyroll, awards, natural, australia, GoT","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/03131807/RT_BoxOffice_Coco2_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-coco-repeats-at-1-over-slow-december-weekend"},{"id":"47509095967266","title":"Box Office: It Continues Box Office Domination","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: It Continues Box Office DominationThe horror juggernaut It once again out-grossed every other film in release, combinedby Sujit Chawla | September 17, 2017 |  CommentsContinuing its dominant run through the box office, the horror juggernaut It&nbsp;once again out-grossed every other film in release, combined. Two newcomers barely put a dent into the charts while remaining holdovers all held on pretty well from last weekend.Falling an extremely reasonable 51.4% from its gargantuan opening,&nbsp;It&nbsp;scared up another $60M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $218M. It was the third biggest second weekend of the year, behind only Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It has become the highest grossing film ever released in the month of September. At its current path,&nbsp;It&nbsp;should easily beat&nbsp;The Sixth Sense&nbsp;($293.5M) to become the highest grossing horror film ever. Look for&nbsp;It&nbsp;to end somewhere in the $320-330M range which would put it past notable blockbusters like&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;and&nbsp;Transformers. Overseas,&nbsp;It&nbsp;added another $60.3M bringing its international cume up to $152.6M and its global total to $371.3M.Debuting far behind in second place was the Lionsgate action-thriller&nbsp;American Assassin&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $14.8M from 3,154 theaters for a per screen average of $4,692. Reviews were overall poor as it currently stands at 35% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes while audiences liked it more giving it a B+ grade on CinemaScore. Overseas it added an estimated $6.2M from 41 markets.Paramount went wide with director Darren Aronofsky’s latest, the genre-bending religious allegory&nbsp;mother!&nbsp;which probably should have been platformed as it made only $7.5M, according to estimates, from 2,368 theaters for a per screen average of $3,167. Starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, the film had mixed reviews from critics (68% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) but was blasted by audiences as it received an F grade on CinemaScore. This was the kind of film that audiences were either going to love or hate and clearly hate was the choice here. I wouldn’t expect to see much more talk of this film other than on lists discussing biggest busts of the year. Overseas it added an estimated $6M from 16 markets.The rest of the box office dropped a couple of spots from last weekend but stayed in the same order. Fourth place belonged to Home Again&nbsp;which fell 37.7% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.3M, bringing its total up to $17M. Look for a finale in the $30M range. In fifth place was The Hitman’s Bodyguard&nbsp;which took in an additional $3.5M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $70M after five weeks.The year’s other notable horror entry landed in sixth place this weekend as Annabelle: Creation&nbsp;took in an estimated $2.6M this weekend, bringing its total to just a shade under the magical $100M mark. The Weinsteins took the next two spots with Wind River&nbsp;making an estimated $2.5M and Leap!&nbsp;taking in an estimated $2.1M. Cumes stand at $29.1M and $18.6M respectively.A couple of big blockbusters rounded out the top 10. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;added an estimated $1.87M to its totals, bringing its cume up to $330M while Dunkirk&nbsp;made an estimated $1.3M bringing its total up to $185M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $101.6M which was up 43% from last year when Sully&nbsp;remained at number one with $21.6M; and up 6% from 2015 when&nbsp;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials&nbsp;debuted in the top spot with&nbsp;$30.3M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Martial, Binge, book, Witch, A&E, ITV, slashers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/17145318/RT_BoxOffice_It-week-2_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-it-continues-box-office-domination"},{"id":"47509094763032","title":"Box Office: Pixar Tops Thanksgiving Weekend with Coco","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Pixar Tops Thanksgiving Weekend with CocoPixar and Disney brought holiday cheer to the Thanksgiving holiday with its latest hit Cocoby Gitesh Pandya | November 26, 2017 |  CommentsPixar and Disney brought holiday cheer to the Thanksgiving holiday frame with its latest hit&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;which opened at number one with an estimated $49M in three days and $71.2M over the long five-day stretch from Wednesday to Sunday. The PG-rated film averaged a sturdy $12,295 from 3,987 locations. It was the fourth biggest opening ever over the long turkey holiday weekend.Reviews were strong across the board and&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;earned a glowing A+ CinemaScore grade signaling a bright future ahead as the holidays get closer and closer and families continue to head out to the multiplexes for end-of-year entertainment.The five-day opening for&nbsp;Coco&nbsp;was only 13% behind Disney’s&nbsp;Moana&nbsp;which ruled this same holiday session one year ago. That film had a long holiday run finishing with $248.8M domestic and Coco&nbsp;has every chance of reaching past at least $200M by the end of its North American run. A true North American gross would include Mexico, and Coco&nbsp;is already the highest grossing film of all time in that country. Most key international markets are still to come so this animated hit is just getting its global run going.Following an opening weekend which fell below expectations, the highly anticipated super hero epic Justice League&nbsp;dropped a sharp 57% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $40.7M. It was by far the largest decline for any film in the top ten this weekend and was extra troubling given that Friday was a day off. Warner Bros. has grossed $171.5M after ten days. Negative buzz and mixed reviews affected the PG-13 film from day one and there were far less takers in the second weekend, despite the extra holiday time off that people had.Compared to other ten-day starts for recent comic book movies,&nbsp;Justice League&nbsp;is running 17% behind&nbsp;Wonder Woman, 19% below Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;and 34% behind last year’s Batman v Superman. At its current trajectory, Justice League&nbsp;looks to finish its domestic run in the neighborhood of $240M which would make it the lowest grossing of the five DCEU films to date ranking well behind 2013’s Man of Steel&nbsp;which did $291M. Essentially,&nbsp;Batman v Superman&nbsp;played like the first real Justice League team-up film, and the new movie this month has played more like a sequel to a not-so-liked tentpole.Overseas this weekend, Justice League&nbsp;grossed $72.2M boosting the international total to $309.8M led by China’s $83.1M. The worldwide tally to date is now $481.3M. Japan had a four-day opening of $3.8M, and holdover markets dropped by a sharp 63%.Taking third place was the Julia Roberts hit Wonder&nbsp;which slipped only 19% in its second weekend to an estimated $22.3M. The Lionsgate hit averaged $7,030 per theater and lifted its total to $69.4M. A final gross north of $150M seems likely as it continues to win over new audiences. The Marvel hit&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;placed fourth in its fourth weekend grossing $16.8M, off only 23%. Disney’s latest smash hit raised its domestic total to $277.5M while the global cume climbed to $790.1M.A pair of star-driven films followed. Daddy’s Home 2&nbsp;grossed $13.3M, down only 8%, for a new total of $72.7M after its third weekend for Paramount. Fox’s mystery Murder on the Orient Express&nbsp;did an estimated $13M, off only 6%, for a new total of $74.2M. The animated film The Star&nbsp;took in an estimated $6.9M slipping 30% in its second weekend giving Sony a new cume of $22M.Denzel Washington did not attract a large crowd for his latest film&nbsp;Roman J. Israel, Esq.&nbsp;With mixed reviews it debuted to only $4.5M from 1,669 theaters for a soft $2,705 average for Sony. Rounding out the top ten was the specialty film hit Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&nbsp;with an estimated $4.4M, quadrupling last weekend’s gross thanks to a nationwide expansion. Fox Searchlight averaged a solid $7,166 per theater and has lifted the total to $7.6M.Debuting to sensational numbers in platform release was the acclaimed drama&nbsp;Call Me By Your Name&nbsp;which grossed $405,000 from only four theaters for an incredible $101,250 average for Sony Classics. That makes it one of the best platform debuts of recent years. The film will expand to more markets in the weeks to come.The top ten films grossed an estimated $175.9M which was up 3% from last year when&nbsp;Moana&nbsp;opened at number one with $56.6M; and up 5% from 2015 when Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2&nbsp;stayed in the top spot with&nbsp;$52M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"VICE, Country, FOX, Amazon, independent, Freeform, cartoon, Yoda, quibi, Searchlight, Peacock, pirates, Superheroe, America","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/26123035/RT_BoxOffice_Coco_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-pixar-tops-thanksgiving-weekend-with-coco"},{"id":"47509095955996","title":"Box Office: Jigsaw Opens #1 Over Sluggish Pre-Halloween Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Jigsaw Opens #1 Over Sluggish Pre-Halloween WeekendThe frame before Halloween saw the franchise horror pic Jigsaw debut at number oneby Gitesh Pandya | October 29, 2017 |  CommentsThe frame before Halloween saw the franchise horror pic&nbsp;Jigsaw&nbsp;debut at number one, but that still did not stop the North American box office from slumping to its third worst level of 2017. Holiday activities and the World Series proved to be distractions – as they are every year around this time – but Hollywood also contributed to the problem by releasing films which failed to generate much moviegoer excitement. This was the calm before the&nbsp;Thor&nbsp;storm.Lionsgate launched a sequel in first place for the second straight weekend as&nbsp;Jigsaw&nbsp;debuted to an estimated $16.3M from 2,941 sites for a respectable $5,525 average. While good enough for the top spot, the figure was the second lowest for the eight-film franchise which has seen half of its installments debut in the $30M+ range.Only&nbsp;Saw VI&nbsp;opened worse with $14.1M in 2009 when&nbsp;Paranormal Activity&nbsp;took over as the hot horror story for the Halloween season. The fright crowd that showed up for&nbsp;Jigsaw&nbsp;was fairly broad as studio data indicated that it was 51% female and 52% under 25. Reviews were not too positive, as expected. The previous seven films in the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;series grossed a combined $416M domestic and were produced for under $70M total. Overseas markets and home video added plenty more to the pot for the profitable torture franchise.Tyler Perry slipped to second place with his comedy sequel&nbsp;Boo 2! A Madea Halloween&nbsp;which took in an estimated $10M, off 53% in its sophomore round. A year ago, his first&nbsp;Boo&nbsp;film slipped only 40% in its second weekend while having the same calendar. Cume to date for Lionsgate is $35.5M. A final of about $50M seems likely.The rest of the films at the box office collected scraps as all remaining movies in the top ten generated averages of below $2,000. The disaster pic Geostorm&nbsp;tumbled 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.7M for a weak total of just $23.6M. Thanks to a $34.1M opening weekend in China – which is already the action film’s top-grossing market in the world – the global tally has risen to $137M with remaining territories France and Italy debuting this Wednesday.Horror hit Happy Death Day&nbsp;dropped 46% to an estimated $5.1M giving Universal $48.4M to date. Warner Bros. saw the pricey sci-fi epic Blade Runner 2049&nbsp;fall 46% as well to an estimated $4M. The domestic cume is now $81.4M.Opening to soft results in sixth place was the soldier story&nbsp;Thank You For Your Service&nbsp;which collected an estimated $3.7M from 2,054 locations for a weak $1,802 average. The Universal release earned positive reviews but failed to generate much consumer excitement. Studio data showed that the audience was 72% white, 59% over 30, and 58% male. Those who did show up liked what they saw as the CinemaScore was an A-.Another drama about American heroes followed as Only The Brave&nbsp;declined by 43% to an estimated $3.5M putting the Sony title at $11.9M. STX was next with the actioner The Foreigner&nbsp;with an estimated $3.2M, down 45%, and a new sum of $28.8M.After being rejected by film critics, George Clooney’s latest directorial project&nbsp;Suburbicon&nbsp;was rejected by audiences too opening down in ninth place with an estimated $2.8M from 2,046 theaters for a poor $1,369 average. Adding to the bad reviews was a dismal D- grade from CinemaScore. Matt Damon led the cast for the R-rated comedy.With Halloween approaching, the biggest horror movie of them all&nbsp;It&nbsp;watched its global gross rise to $666.6M. The Stephen King tale slipped only 29% to an estimated $2.5M spending its eighth consecutive weekend in the top ten. North American audiences have spent $323.7M while overseas fans have added $342.9M to the bank. The final market of Japan opens next weekend and should help propel&nbsp;It&nbsp;past $700M by the end of the run.Debuting to good results just outside of the top ten was the faith-based drama&nbsp;Let There Be Light&nbsp;from director/star Kevin Sorbo and executive producer Sean Hannity. The Atlas release grossed an estimated $1.8M from 373 locations for a good $4,826 average and will expand in its second frame.The super hero tentpole sequel&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok&nbsp;opened overseas in 36 markets this weekend and grossed a stellar $107.6M which was 4% bigger than the launch of Marvel’s last sequel&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&nbsp;at the start of summer. Next weekend marks the debut in the rest of the world including North America, China, Russia, and Japan which should allow the worldwide cume to soar past $400M with plenty more to go.The top ten films grossed an estimated $56.6M which was down 24% from last year when Boo! A Madea Halloween&nbsp;stayed at number one with $17.2M; and down 3% from 2015 when The Martian&nbsp;remained in the top spot with&nbsp;$11.7M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Emmys, Year, New, Grant, YouTube, canceled, movies, America, Larson, Globe, 4/20, 45, anthology","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/29162536/RT_BoxOffice_Jigsaw_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-jigsaw-opens-1-over-sluggish-pre-halloween-weekend"},{"id":"47509095960094","title":"Box Office: Happy Death Day Everyone!","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Happy Death Day Everyone!As Halloween approaches, being scared was the audience choiceby Sujit Chawla | October 15, 2017 |  CommentsAs Halloween approaches, being scared was the audience choice this weekend as&nbsp;Happy Death Day&nbsp;opened strongly while most holdovers had moderate declines and debuting prestige pics faltered.Dethroning what many thought would be the movie event of the season,&nbsp;Happy Death Day&nbsp;bloodied up the box office with an estimated $26.5M from 3,149 theaters for a per screen average of $8,415. Both audiences and critics were on the positive side of mixed as it currently stands at 64% positive on Rotten Tomatoes while audiences gave the film a solid B grade on CinemaScore. The audience was 54% female with 63% under 25 and 59% non-white. Score another hit for the Blumhouse horror juggernaut.Dropping 54% from its already soft opening was last weekend’s champ Blade Runner 2049&nbsp;which took in an estimated $15.1M bringing its total up to only $60.5M. A finale in the $90-100M range is likely for the $150M production.Debuting in third place was the Jackie Chan action-thriller&nbsp;The Foreigner&nbsp;which made $12.8M, according to estimates, from 2,515 theaters for a per screen average of $5,105. Critics were mixed as its 57% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, but paying audiences liked what they saw and gave it an A- grade on CinemaScore. Its worldwide total stands at over $100M.The runaway surprise hit of the year, It, took fourth place in its sixth weekend with an estimated $6M bringing its total up to an astounding $315M. It is now sandwiched in between&nbsp;Iron Man 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&nbsp;on the all-time domestic chart.In fifth place was The Mountain Between U&nbsp;which dropped 46.5% in its second weekend and took in an estimated $5.6M, bringing its total up to $20.5M. Look for a final total in the $30M range. Sixth place belonged to Tom Cruise in&nbsp;American Made&nbsp;which took in $5.4M, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to $40M after three weeks. In seventh was Kingsman The Golden Circle&nbsp;which took in an estimated $5.3M bringing its total up to $89.6M.The LEGO Ninjago Movie fell to eighth place this weekend with an estimated $4.3M bringing its total up to $51.5M after a month. The animated My Little Pony&nbsp;fell 55% in its second weekend to an estimated $4M bringing its cume up to $15M with a final total in the $20-25M range likely. Rounding out the top 10 was the only limited release that seems to be doing any business so far this season, Victoria &amp; Abdul, which expanded to 900 theaters and made an estimated $3.1M bringing its total to $11.3M.Outside of the top 10 were some well-reviewed debuts that failed to make much of a mark with paying audiences.&nbsp;Marshall&nbsp;opened on 821 screens with an estimated $3M for a per screen average of $3,685. Then there was&nbsp;Professor Marston &amp; The Wonder Women&nbsp;which had one of the worst debuts of the year as it took in only $737,000, according to estimates, from 1,229 theaters for a per screen average of only $600. Not sure what happened here other than perhaps there wasn’t enough marketing to get people excited. Debuting on nine screens this weekend was&nbsp;Goodbye Christopher Robin&nbsp;which managed to take in only an estimated $55,800 for a per screen average of $6,200 – good for wide openings but not for films looking to win awards at the end of the year.The top ten films grossed an estimated $88.3M which up nearly 4% from last year when&nbsp;The Accountant&nbsp;opened at number one with $24.7M; and down 19% from 2015 when&nbsp;Goosebumps&nbsp;opened in the top spot with&nbsp;$23.6M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Tarantino, Arts","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/15142536/RT_BoxOffice_Happy-Death-Day_600X314.jpg","slug":"box-office-happy-death-day-everyone"},{"id":"47509097583155","title":"Box Office: Alien: Covenant Underwhelms With $36m Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Alien: Covenant Underwhelms With $36m Debutby Gitesh Pandya | May 21, 2017 |  CommentsScoring a narrow box office victory, the sci-fi sequel Alien: Covenant opened at number one with an estimated $36M leading a North American marketplace that was weaker than usual for mid-May. It was the fourth R-rated film to debut in the top spot this year and the average was a solid $9,572 from 3,761 locations with no 3D boosts.It was quite a front-loaded frame with the opening day gross accounting for 43% of the entire weekend take. Thursday pre-shows and an upfront fan base pushed sales to Friday and so-so buzz contributed to a sharp 22% fall on Saturday. Directed by Ridley Scott, Covenant opened 30% below the $51.1M of 2012’s Prometheus which marked the return of Scott for the first time since the original 1979 smash.Studio data showed that the crowd was 62% male and 66% over 25 – nothing surprising. Reviews were mostly good but the B CinemaScore grade indicated that ticket buyers were just fairly satisfied with the latest saga of space terror. Many international markets opened a week before the U.S. and the overseas gross is now $81.9M for a global cume of $117.9M. The $97M-budgeted action film still has two major Asian markets to open – China on June 16 and Japan on September 15.After its two-week reign on top, the Marvel tentpole smash Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 slipped back to a close second place finish while displaying sturdy legs for a comic book sequel. Star-Lord and company declined by 46% to an estimated $35.1M sending the cume past the triple century mark to $301.8M. That beat the third weekend drops of recent Marvel heroes in sequels which launched on the first weekend of May including last year’s Captain America: Civil War (55%), 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron (50%), 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (53%), and 2013’s Iron Man 3 (51%).The new Galaxy does have some major action competitors coming every weekend in the near future but a final domestic gross in the $375M neighborhood seems likely. The international weekend gross also fell by less than half and came in at $28M pushing the overseas total to $430.8M and the global haul to $732.6M. It will surpass the total of its 2014 predecessor next weekend. China leads all offshore markets by far with $94.2M to date.The teen romance Everything, Everything enjoyed a good debut in third place with an estimated $12M from 2,801 theaters for a respectable $4,284 average. Warner Bros. saw most of its business come from young women not interested in violent action sequels which have been filling up multiplexes over the last several weeks. Studio data showed that the audience was 82% female and 82% under 35. Reviews were not very positive, but paying moviegoers were generally happy with the PG-13 love story.The Amy Schumer-Goldie Hawn comedy Snatched tumbled by 61% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.6M for fourth place. The steep fall was due to coming off of last week’s Mother’s Day when Sunday sales rose sharply from Saturday, plus mixed word-of-mouth. The Fox release has taken in $32.8M to date.There were few takers for the comedy sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul which bowed in fifth with a weak $7.2M, according to estimates. The PG-rated film did not generate much excitement with families and tweens and the brand has become old. Fox averaged $2,281 from 3,157 locations. The first two films debuted in the $22-24M range while the threequel dropped to $14.6M.The big budget bomb King Arthur tumbled out of the top five in only its second weekend grossing an estimated $6.9M. Falling 55%, the Warner Bros. misfire has banked a measly $27.2M to date. The period adventure cost over $250M to produce and market but will end its domestic run at under $40M. $66.2M has come from overseas with Japan being the only key market left to open.Dropping 41% in its sixth lap was The Fate of the Furious with an estimated $3.2M boosting the domestic cume to $219.9M. Overseas grosses are on the verge of hitting $1 billion, currently sitting at $992.7M led by China’s enormous $386.4M for an incredible worldwide haul of $1.21M. The Boss Baby followed with an estimated $2.8M, down 38%, for $166.2M for Fox. Global is now up to $467.9M.Enjoying its tenth weekend in the top ten was Disney’s Beauty and the Beast with an estimated $2.4M, off 50%. With a mammoth $497.8M from North America, Belle has amassed $1.22 billion globally with Japan on course to surpass China and the U.K. as the blockbuster’s top international market. Lionsgate’s comedy How to be a Latin Lover fell 43% to an estimated $2.2M pushing the cume to a solid $29.5M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $115.3M which was down 10% from last year when The Angry Birds Movie opened at number one with $38.2M; and down 20% from 2015 when Tomorrowland debuted in the top spot over the Memorial Day holiday weekend with $33M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"books, Vudu, zombies, Globe, Walking, killer","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/21135548/600AlienCovenant.jpg","slug":"box-office-alien-covenant-underwhelms-with-36m-debut"},{"id":"47509097581106","title":"Box Office: Pirates Tops Worst Memorial Day Weekend in 18 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Pirates Tops Worst Memorial Day Weekend in 18 Yearsby Gitesh Pandya | May 29, 2017 |  Comments(Photo by Peter Mountain/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures)This weekend,&nbsp;audiences were not thrilled with the new offerings Hollywood had planned out for the long holiday frame, as spending on the top ten sunk to just $164.8M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday period — the worst figure for the Memorial Day session in 18 years.Johnny Depp scored his first number one hit since the last time he played Jack Sparrow six years ago as his big-budget adventure Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales captured the top spot with an estimated debut of $77M over the four-day holiday span. Though that was more than the next five films combined, the Friday-to-Sunday take of $62.6M marked the lowest opening weekend by far for any of the Pirates sequels which fell in the range of $90M to $136M. The Dead Men debut dropped 31% from the opening of the last installment, On Stranger Tides from May 2011.Reviews were fairly negative and part of the fan base has eroded over time. The Disney franchise was unstoppable at one point as the 2006 sequel Dead Man’s Chest surprised the industry in July of that year by smashing the all-time opening weekend record which had been held for over four years by 2002’s Spider-Man. Another sequel the following summer posted solid numbers too, and in the coming days, the newest chapter will send the total franchise gross past the $4 billion mark. Studio data for Dead Men showed that males made up 53% of the crowd and 63% were over 25. 3D screens accounted for 27% of the gross.But as with many aging Hollywood action franchises, the fading domestic interest was offset by sturdy international box office results. The fifth Pirates flick opened big with a hefty $208.4M from 54 markets through Sunday led by China’s $67.8M which beat out North America’s gross from the same three-day span. Also, the Russia bow broke the all-time industry record there with $18.1M. The global debut was $285.4M including the domestic Monday with Japan as the only key market still to open.The last time the four-day top ten was weaker over Memorial Day weekend was in 1999 when it hit $129.9M led by the second weekend of Star Wars Episode I with $66.9M. The average movie ticket price was 42% less back then so that weekend 18 years back actually sold more tickets than this current weekend did.Holding onto the runner-up spot was this summer’s top-grossing film to date Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 with an estimated $25.2M over the four-day holiday period. The Marvel smash displayed good legs again as the three-day portion dropped by just 40% as Baby Groot and friends pull in business from a broad audience of people looking for big-screen escapism. The cume rose to $338.5M flying past the $333.2M final of its 2014 predecessor. The Galaxy sequel watched its international total climb to $450.1M putting the worldwide total at $788.6M which also surpasses the $774M of the first Guardians. A final near $850M seems likely.Opening in third place was the action-comedy Baywatch with an estimated $23M over four days from 3,647 locations for an average of $6,307. The R-rated film starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron was based on the popular 1990s television series. Paramount opened it on Thursday to get a head start on the long holiday weekend and collected $27.6M across the five-day span. Reviews were not good but audiences were generally happy as noted by the B+ CinemaScore grade.Falling apart in its second weekend was the sci-fi sequel Alien: Covenant which saw its three-day gross tumble an alarming 71% with the four-day gross coming in at $13.2M. Fox has banked $60M from North America plus $101M from overseas for a global tally of $161M with China and Japan still to open.Young females put the romance Everything, Everything into the number five spot with an estimated $7.4M over the long weekend and $22.7M overall for Warner Bros. kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul fared well in its sophomore frame with an estimated $5.8M for a good three-day decline of only 38%. Total for Fox is still only $15M though.Amy Schumer’s comedy Snatched followed with an estimated $4.9M in its third lap putting Fox at $41.2M to date. Warner Bros. continued to see its big-budget adventure King Arthur fall apart with an estimated $4.1M and only $34.8M overall. International is at $85M, though no market has made more than $8M total. Worldwide stands at just $119.8M.A pair of leggy family hits from March once again stayed in the top ten as audiences reject so many of the newer films from recent weeks. Fox’s The Boss Baby took in an estimated $2.3M pushing the cume to $169.6M and the global haul to $476.8M.Disney’s Beauty and the Beast spent its 11th consecutive weekend in the top ten and also crossed the $500M domestic barrier in the process. The fairy tale smash grossed an estimated $1.9M lifting the cume to a dazzling $500.9M making it the eighth largest domestic hit of all-time. Overseas markets have contributed $732M with most of the current sales coming from the durable run in Japan where the local total of $86.8M made it surpass China to become the film’s second biggest international market. It will then pass the U.K. by next week for the top spot. Beauty has taken in $1.23 billion to date and is the year’s highest grossing film worldwide.Just an inch outside of the top ten, but still making box office news, was the action sequel The Fate of the Furious with an estimated $1.8M putting the domestic sum at $223M. The overseas total this weekend cracked the magical $1 billion mark, only the sixth film in history to reach this milestone with Furious 7 being one of them. 82% of the $1.22 billion global haul for Universal has come from outside of North America rising above the 77% for F7.The top ten films grossed an estimated $164.8M over the four-day weekend which was down 16% from last year when X-Men: Apocalypse opened at number one with $79.8M; and down 10% from 2015’s holiday when Tomorrowland debuted in the top spot with $42.7M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"scene, festival, Fox, Tyler, binge, USA, Christmas, Exclusive, TV, all-time, animated, Guide, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/29145112/Pirates-Dead-Men-BO1.jpg","slug":"box-office-pirates-tops-worst-memorial-day-weekend-in-18-years"},{"id":"47509097570861","title":"Box Office: Despicable Me 3 Wins the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Despicable Me 3 Wins the WeekendBaby Driver rolls into second, while Transformers takes a tumble to third.by Gitesh Pandya | July 2, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;Gru was back again, stealing the number one spot, but his box office star faded. Universal’s toon threequel Despicable Me 3 launched to an estimated $75.4M grossing, more than the next five films combined. However, franchise fatigue kicked in, as the figure fell from the openings of the last two movies from this series. The average was $16,651 from an all-time industry high of 4,529 theaters.DM3 opened a troubling 35% below the $115.7M of the spinoff Minions from July 2015, which did not even feature Steve Carell as Gru. Despicable Me 2 bowed to $143.1M over its five-day launch over the Fourth of July holiday in 2013, and the new chapter will likely drop 25-30% from that figure in its first five days. Even last July’s animated entry from Universal and Illumination, The Secret Life of Pets, did much better, premiering to $103.2M in three days.Reviews were mixed for the film and the CinemaScore was a good A-. The $100M mark should be crossed on the Fourth of July holiday this Tuesday. After that, Spider-Man: Homecoming kicks off on Thursday night and may act like a buzzsaw, cutting into part of DM3‘s audience. Luckily, there is not much else for younger kids all month until The Emoji Movie opens at the very end of July.Despicable Me 3 went out into 46 new international markets this weekend, grossing an estimated $95.6M boosting the overseas cume to $116.9M, including some markets that&nbsp;bowed earlier. The worldwide total stands at $192.3M to date with plenty of top territories still to open, including China, Korea, Japan, France, and Germany.Making a big splash in second place was the action thriller Baby Driver from writer/director Edgar Wright, which debuted to an estimated $21M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a stellar $30M since debuting on Tuesday night with pre-shows. The R-rated film starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, and Jamie Foxx earned rave reviews across the board, which helped to spark interest from moviegoers. That was key, since this is an original movie competing in a marketplace flooded with known brands. The mid-week launch also got word-of-mouth going which helped convince many more to go out and see it by the time the weekend rolled around.Sony research showed that the crowd was 55% male and 61% 25 and older. Budgeted at $34M, Baby Driver was expected to post a solid debut but these numbers exceeded industry expectations. The A- grade from CinemaScore showed that ticket buyers liked what they paid for and the road ahead is promising, thanks to the great reviews and buzz. Joining Get Out and Split, Baby Driver has shown again that audiences this year are coming out in large numbers for quality original films from talented writer/directors. Those three films cost less than $50M combined, but will gross over $600M worldwide.Tumbling down from first to third place this weekend was Michael Bay’s fifth Transformers movie The Last Knight with an estimated $17M, down 62% from its opening weekend. Paramount has collected $102.1M to date for the pricey sequel, which should end its domestic run in the vicinity of $130M, a big drop from the $245.4M of the last installment Age of Extinction, and by far the lowest ever for the whole franchise. Overseas, the top global market of China also saw a fast fade with a 76% nosedive in the second weekend. Total there is $193.5M, the international cume is $327.8M, and the worldwide tally so far is $429.9M. The global final may be headed for the neighborhood of $650M for a sizable 40% fall from the $1.1 billion of the last chapter.Leggy comic book smash Wonder Woman declined by only 38% to an estimated $15.6M, pushing the domestic total to a robust $346.1M. That ranks number four all-time for the fifth weekend gross of a super hero film after only Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Dark Knight. Diana has climbed to number 42 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters replacing last year’s Zootopia. With good stamina and the holiday week ahead, Wonder Woman still looks set to finish its North American run in the area of $390M.International grosses rose to $361.8M for a new global take of $707.9M surpassing Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and Doctor Strange. The next challenge for the DC hit will be to face competition from a pair of promising franchise tentpoles opening over the next two weeks that were screened for press early and have already earned stellar reviews – Spider-Man: Homecoming and War for the Planet of the Apes.This summer has seen many sequels fall below their predecessors, and Cars 3 from Disney and Pixar is no different. The G-rated toon fell a sharp 62% to an estimated $9.5M for a cume of $120.7M. Enthusiasm around this title has only been moderate. Cars 3 is set to finish as the second lowest grossing Pixar movie ever beating only The Good Dinosaur.Will Ferrell also suffered from audience rejection with his latest comedy The House which opened poorly to an estimated $9M from 3,134 locations for a weak $2,872 average. The R-rated pic from Warner Bros. co-starring Amy Poehler generated little excitement with audiences and follows a trend of R-rated comedy misfires coming out of Hollywood recently. Next up for the genre is Girls Trip hoping to shake things up on July 21.Shark thriller 47 Meters Down fell 34% to an estimated $4.7M putting Entertainment Studios at $32.6M. The Civil War period drama The Beguiled expanded nationwide after a strong platform start and grossed an estimated $3.3M for eighth place. Focus averaged a respectable $4,837 from 674 locations for a cume of $3.6M.Tom Cruise’s actioner The Mummy dropped 54% to an estimated $2.8M lifting the domestic total to $74.5M. Universal has banked $369.9M worldwide to date. Another pricey star-driven Hollywood tentpole underperforming domestically followed with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales at an estimated $2.4M, down 55%, for a $165.5M cume for Disney and $708.7M worldwide. China is the top-grossing market on both films beating North America with $90.9M and $172.3M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $160.6M which was off 11% from last year when Finding Dory stayed at number one with $41.8M; but up 26% from 2015 when Inside Out climbed into the top spot with $29.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"spain, Disney, Year, Lucasfilm, Plus, Shondaland, Spring, 99%, canceled, History, TruTV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/02142004/Despicable-Me3-BO1.jpg","slug":"box-office-despicable-me-3-wins-the-weekend"},{"id":"47509097559593","title":"Box Office: Dunkirk Remains in Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Dunkirk Remains in Top SpotTwo new wide releases couldn't take down Dunkirk but both opened to decent resultsby Sujit Chawla | July 30, 2017 |  CommentsWith strong critical reviews and tremendous audience support, Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk&nbsp;took the top spot for a second straight weekend, dropping a reasonable 44% to an estimated $28M. Its total now stands at $102.8M and looks headed to at least $200M if not more. Internationally it added an estimated $45.6M bringing its total to $131.3M and a worldwide cume of $234.1M.The two debuting films both got a B Cinemascore, but were on complete opposite ends of the critics scale. In second place was&nbsp;The Emoji Movie&nbsp;which made an estimated $25.6M from 4,075 theaters for a per screen average of $6,294. It currently stands at a whopping 9% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, proving that poop sells to kids. How well it does over the next few weeks is up in the air but with a $50M budget, it’ll likely recoup its costs and who knows, maybe there will be a sequel?At 75% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, the other wide debut this weekend was Charlize Theron’s action-thriller,&nbsp;Atomic Blonde&nbsp;which opened to an estimated $18.5M from 3,304 theaters for a per screen average of $5,616. If you take out the pre-release hype, this is a good opening for this type of film. I think expectations started to run a little high in the days leading up to the weekend. It’ll recoup its $30M budget easily and once again, a sequel could be in play.Sandwiched in thrid place between the new releases was Universal’s&nbsp;Girls Trip&nbsp;which fell only 35.6% in its second go-around to an estimated $20.1M bringing its total up to $65M. Already after two weeks its the highest grossing comedy of the year. A total of $125 or more is likely.Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;swung into fifth place this weekend with an estimated $13.5M, bringing its total up to $278M after four weeks. Fox’s&nbsp;War for the Planet of the Apes&nbsp;dipped 50% in its third weekend to an estimated $10M, bringing its total up to $118M. Universal’s threequel&nbsp;Despicable Me 3&nbsp;fell 40% to an estimated $7.7M bringing its total after five weeks up to $230M.Luc Besson’s expensive sci-fi epic&nbsp;Valerian&nbsp;crashed and burned in its second weekend, falling 60% to an estimated $6.8M, bringing its total up to only $30M. Hitting even $50M domestically will be a stretch for the $175M production.In ninth place was an actual pleasant surprise this summer,&nbsp;Baby Driver, which continued its strong run dipping only 33% in its fifth weekend to an estimated $4M, bringing its total up to $92M. And rounding out the top 10 was the #1 movie of the summer,&nbsp;Wonder Woman, which made an estimated $3.5M in its ninth weekend, bringing its total to an outstanding $395M.A couple of heavyweight filmmakers opened movies in limited release this weekend. Oscar Winner Kathryn Bigelow’s&nbsp;Detroit&nbsp;brought in an estimated $365,455 from 20 theaters for a per screen average of $18,273 which is good, but probably a little bit below what the studio was hoping for before the film goes wide next weekend. And Al Gore’s timely&nbsp;An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power&nbsp;opened in four theaters with an estimated $130,000 for a per theater average of $32,500.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.3M which was off 21% from last year when&nbsp;Jason Bourne&nbsp;opened at number one with $59.2M; but up 1.6% from 2015 when&nbsp;Mission: Impossible – Rouge Nation&nbsp;debuted in the top spot with $55.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Action, 2017, Tumblr, First, worst, Walking, Ghostbusters, Oscars, talk, Countdown, Mindy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/10110542/Dunkirk-Social-Reaction1.jpg","slug":"box-office-dunkirk-remains-in-top-spot"},{"id":"47509097565739","title":"Box Office: War for the Planet of the Apes Draws Decent $56M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: War for the Planet of the Apes Draws Decent $56M Openingby Gitesh Pandya | July 16, 2017 |  CommentsAudiences showed up for battle as the summer’s latest threequel, War for the Planet of the Apes, opened at number one at the North American box office. The Fox release grossed an estimated $56.5M from 4,022 locations for a strong $14,048 average. The latest Caesar adventure debuted 22% below the last one which was Dawn of the Planet of the Apes which premiered to $72.6M this same month in 2014. War opened just 3% higher than the first film of this trilogy, 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Reviews were fantastic for War with many critics calling it the best of the three with wonderful use of technology to advance the art of storytelling. Ticket buyers were also very pleased with the film as the CinemaScore grade was an A-. Studio data showed that the crowd was 57% male, 63% over 25, and 52% non-white. War cost $150M to produce. It rolled out in parts of the world day and date with domestic and the weekend opening was $46M for a global launch of $102.5M. However, most key overseas territories will be debuting in the weeks to come.Slipping from first to second place was the summer’s latest super hero tentpole Spider-Man: Homecoming which declined by 61% in its sophomore session to an estimated $45.2M. The drop was sizable, but not unexpected for the sixth film from a comic book franchise since fan turnout is intense upfront most of the times. Spider-Man 3 dropped by 62% in its second weekend in 2007 and there were no Thursday pre-shows back then to boost opening weekend numbers. The Homecoming fall was also in line with the 60% of last year’s Captain America: Civil War which introduced Tom Holland as the new Peter Parker and did not face any major competition from new releases.Sony’s cume rose on the latest Spidey pic to $208.3M after ten full days which is already bigger than the $202.9M of the last film, 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Homecoming is on track to break the $300M domestic mark in the coming weeks. Overseas markets collected an additional $72.3M this weekend boosting the international take to $261.1M and the worldwide tally to $469.4M.Taking third place and dropping a reasonable 44% was the toon threequel Despicable Me 3 with an estimated $18.9M. Universal has banked $188M to date which is off 28% from Minions and down 27% from DM2 which were both north of $250M at this same point. DM3 may finish its domestic run just shy of that mark. But overseas audiences are still turning out in healthy numbers for Gru with the international cume now up to $431.4M (led by China’s $113.6M) and global at a solid $619.4M on its way to at least $850M.For the fifth consecutive weekend, the box office was led by a tentpole that is film number three or beyond from a big-budget franchise. The current top three were preceded by Transformers and Cars sequels. All five debuted at number one, however three, or possibly four, will end their domestic runs at new franchise lows. Plus the latest Pirates movie from May can be added into this crop too.Following these franchise flicks were original films that have been enjoying prolonged runs thanks to excellent word of mouth. Sony’s Baby Driver eased only 33% in its third lap for an estimated $8.8M pushing the cume to $73.2M. Amazon and Lionsgate went nationwide with the Sundance hit The Big Sick which jumped into the top five with an estimated $7.6M lifting the total to $16M.Super hero sensation Wonder Woman posted its fifth straight weekend with a decline in the low 30-40% range by slipping only 30% to an estimated $6.9M in its seventh frame. Cume is up to $380.7M and the DC star has climbed up to number 30 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. $400M seems likely. Overseas markets have contributed $384.2M for a new global tally of $764.9M on its way into the $800M club.The horror film Wish Upon was a blip on the summer movie radar opening poorly in seventh place with an estimated $5.6M. Broad Green averaged a weak $2,483 from 2,250 locations from just the U.S. as Canada did not open this weekend. Reviews were mostly bad and buzz was never strong.More sequels followed with Cars 3 taking in an estimated $3.2M, off 41%, for a $140M sum for Disney. It will end as the second lowest grossing Pixar movie ever with even 1998’s A Bug’s Life making more. Paramount’s Transformers: The Last Knight fell 56% to an estimated $2.8M for $124.9M to date. This is by far a franchise low. Global is $517.3M led by China’s $225M. Rounding out the top ten was the comedy flop The House with an estimated $1.8M, down 62%, and $23.1M overall for Warner Bros.The top ten films grossed an estimated $157.2M which was up 4% from last year when The Secret Life of Pets stayed at number one with $50.8M; but down 12% from 2015 when Ant-Man debuted in the top spot with $57.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"drama, IFC, rings, Election, Peacock, The, lee, Podcast, Paramount, witnail, Pop, women","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/16200837/600Apes21.jpg","slug":"box-office-war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-draws-decent-56m-opening"},{"id":"47509097573934","title":"Box Office: Transformers: Last Knight Is Franchise’s Weakest Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Transformers: Last Knight Is Franchise's Weakest Debutby Gitesh Pandya | June 25, 2017 |  CommentsMichael Bay’s fifth Transformers movie, The Last Knight, opened at number one in North America just like all its predecessors, however grosses sank sharply to franchise lows. Following two sequels which grossed over $1 billion each, the newest PG-13 action tentpole debuted to an estimated $45.3M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $69.1M overall since its launch on Tuesday night with pre-shows. That represented a 43% fall from the five-day start of the last Transformers movie Age of Extinction which also opened in late June.The five-day cume for Knight was only somewhat more than the opening day of 2009’s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen which banked $62M on a Wednesday in late June of that year ahead of a mammoth $200.1M five-day debut. Paramount data showed that the audience was 57% male and 51% over 25. Reviews were dreadful, but that is always the case for Transformers sequels. Paying moviegoers were generally pleased as the CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. The road ahead could lead to a final domestic tally in the $130M area which would be less than what low-cost films Get Out, Split, and Hidden Figures grossed earlier this year.Like so many aging action movie franchises, domestic grosses are hitting series lows as audience interest erodes over time. But international markets are where numbers are still strong and that was once again the case here. Last Knight took in an estimated $196.2M this weekend from overseas markets led by China’s terrific $123.4M over three days. In fact its five-day gross there is likely to surpass its entire run in North America. China is the key market for this franchise and the new film debuted 35% bigger than the last one indicating growth is still out there for the Autobots.Worldwide, the new Transformers banked $265.3M this weekend with 74% coming from overseas markets. And these numbers were achieved without five major markets which will still open in the coming weeks – France, Brazil, Mexico, Japan, and Spain. Budgeted at a hefty $217M, Transformers: The Last Knight has the potential to gross $750M or more worldwide and the next film is already on the calendar opening 50 weeks from now.Two big films reported the exact same weekend estimate and tied for second place with finals counted on Monday set to determine the final order. But the leggy super hero smash Wonder Woman held up well against the new action tentpole competition dropping 39% to an estimated $25.2M. The Warner Bros. hit is only the tenth movie in history to break $25M on the fourth weekend of play, and the first one since Star Wars: The Force Awakens did it.The domestic total for Wonder Woman vaulted past the triple century mark on Friday ending at $318.4M matching Iron Man from 2008. Later this week, Diana will race past Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman to become the top-grossing film from the DC Extended Universe entering the all-time Top 50 in the process. A domestic final of about $390M is possible, but $400M can’t be ruled out just yet.With Transformers making more of a dent in overseas markets this weekend, Wonder Woman saw more erosion dropping 49% there to $20.5M. The offshore cume is now $334.5M with global sitting at $652.9M. The Gal Gadot film will break $700M next week and will try to make it to $800M with its final market of Japan which opens on August 25.Also claiming the runner-up spot this weekend with an estimated gross of $25.2M was the Pixar sequel Cars 3 which decelerated by a sharp 53%. That’s a bigger sophomore drop than for the studio’s last few summer offerings like Finding Dory, Inside Out, and Monsters University which all declined within the 42-46% range. However, Cars 2 did tumble 60% in its second lap in 2011. Cume for part 3 is $99.9M and things get worse next weekend with the arrival of rival toon threequel Despicable Me 3.The shark thriller 47 Meters Down held up well in its second weekend slipping only 34% to an estimated $7.4M giving Entertainment Studios $24.3M to date. On the other hand, fellow sophomore All Eyez On Me took a shocking 78% nosedive to an estimated $5.9M after a strong debut. Lionsgate has banked $38.6M.Though a disappointment at home, Tom Cruise’s monster movie The Mummy is still on its way to over $400M worldwide. The Universal thriller grossed an estimated $5.8M, dropping 60%, putting the studio at $68.5M domestic. But international markets have kicked in $273.6M to date led by China where the local total of $89.3M has surpassed Wonder Woman. Worldwide to date is $342.1M.As with the fifth Transformers, Johnny Depp’s fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie is sinking to new franchise lows in North America, but seeing much bigger numbers overseas. Dead Men Tell No Tales declined by 42% to an estimated $5.2M giving Disney $160M. Add in a big $517.8M from international and the worldwide sum stands at $677.8M – 76% from foreign.Falling 41% in its second weekend was Sony’s dark comedy Rough Night with $4.7M and a ten-day tally of $16.6M. The DreamWorks Animation comedy Captain Underpants dropped 40% to an estimated $4.3M giving Fox $65.7M to date.The Marvel sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is still the top-grossing summer movie – for now – and collected an estimated $3M, off 41%. New totals are $380.2M domestic and $851.2M worldwide.In platform release, the critically acclaimed comedy The Big Sick debuted to an estimated $435,000 from only five locations in New York and Los Angeles generating the best opening weekend average of the year with $87,000. Amazon Studios and Lionsgate will expand to more major cities next weekend and will be national by July 14.Focus launched its period drama The Beguiled in four NY/LA houses and collected an estimated $241,000 for an average of $60,250. Next weekend sees an expansion into 500 sites.The top ten films grossed an estimated $132.6M which was off 25% from last year when Finding Dory remained at number one with $73M; and down 24% from 2015 when Jurassic World stayed in the top spot for a third time with $54.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"supernatural, women, Election, Sony, Marvel","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/25145718/600Transformers2.jpg","slug":"box-office-transformers-last-knight-is-franchises-weakest-debut"},{"id":"47509097577008","title":"Box Office: Mummy Unravels as Wonder Woman Retains #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Mummy Unravels as Wonder Woman Retains #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | June 11, 2017 |  CommentsThe super hero blockbuster Wonder Woman easily fended off competition from The Mummy to reign as box office queen for a second straight time and displayed exceptional stamina in the process. Warner Bros. collected an incredible estimate of $57.2M for a second weekend decline of only 45% which is among the best all-time for any comic book movie ever. Cume stands at a sturdy $205M with plenty more to come.Strong word-of-mouth and repeat business are driving people to see Wonder Woman and some who didn’t want to see the film a week or two ago are now joining the movement. Diana generated the smallest second weekend drop and the largest sophomore session gross among all four films in the current DC Extended Universe beating Man of Steel (65%/$41.3M), Batman v Superman (69%/$51.3M), and Suicide Squad (67%/$43.5M). All three of those super hero movies opened bigger than Wonder Woman, but had weaker legs.Should it keep up this momentum over the weeks to come, Wonder Woman will be able to end its domestic run higher than all those DCEU films with a possible finish in the $350M neighborhood. This also bodes well for the next film Justice League which opens in November and, of course, features Wonder Woman in it.For all DC movies in history, this is the third biggest gross on the second weekend after only The Dark Knight ($75.2M) and The Dark Knight Rises ($62.1M). The road ahead for Wonder Woman looks promising. Next weekend sees no major action competition. The fifth Transformers movie is the next action tentpole and arrives on June 21 but the lucrative Fourth of July holiday period will have enough room for Diana to carve out a nice slice of the pie.Overseas, the top market of China saw the Mummy debut deliver a much bigger impact as Wonder Woman fell a sharp 67% in its second round there. The overall international weekend gross fell 54% to $58.1M. New totals stand at $230.2M overseas and $435.2M global. With Germany and Spain opening later this month and then Japan in August, Wonder Woman should reach at least $750M worldwide by the end of its run.With such intense action competition to deal with, the Universal monster reboot The Mummy was no match and settled for second place opening to an estimated $32.2M. The PG-13 adventure anchored by Tom Cruise landed in 4,035 theaters and averaged $7,980. Reviews were harsh, interest in this property was only so much to begin with, and action fans were feeling much more natural excitement for Wonder Woman this weekend.The studio is building a cinematic universe of monster movies, not unlike what Marvel has brilliantly executed with its characters. The Mummy is the first film for the new Dark Universe brand and this stumble will not deter other films from making their way into the marketplace including Bride of Frankenstein in 2019 plus The Invisible Man with Johnny Depp and a Frankenstein film starring Javier Bardem. More focus may be put on making a quality film, though.As for The Mummy, it opened worse than all three Mummy films starring Brendan Fraser from 1999 to 2008. Each of those broke $40M in the first weekend. Studio data showed that the new big-budget movie skewed 54% male, 58% over 25, and 51% non-white. Paying audiences were not too satisfied as the CinemaScore grade was a disappointing B-.International results were significantly better for The Mummy as the opening weekend delivered a stellar $141.8M from 63 markets for a worldwide debut of $174M. A whopping 82% of that figure came from overseas territories where Cruise’s star wattage is brighter. China easily led all countries in the world with a solid $52.2M launch over three days beating Logan‘s $48.8M and the $48M of Guardians 2 earlier this year.Younger kids kept seeing the DreamWorks Animation comedy Captain Underpants which dropped 48% in its second weekend holding nicely. Fox grossed an estimated $12.3M boosting the total to $44.6M with schools across the country closing for summer in the days and weeks ahead. Direct competition comes next weekend when Pixar’s Cars 3 arrives.Falling 52% in its third round was Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales with an estimated $10.7M putting Disney at $135.8M domestic – by far the lowest of the five-film series. But international markets are going well led by China’s $161.2M putting the worldwide gross at $600.2M with Japan to open on July 1. A global finish of $725-750M may result. The last three chapters all broke $900M.Spending its sixth weekend in the top five was the summer kickoff film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 with an estimated $6.2M, down just 37%. The Disney release has amassed $366.4M so far and surpassed last year’s Deadpool and The Jungle Book to reach number 35 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters on its way to finish in the Top 30. Guardians now sits at $833.2M worldwide.The horror film It Comes at Night opened poorly in sixth place with an estimated $6M from 2,533 runs for a weak $2,369 average. The R-rated chiller from A24 earned vastly different reactions from film critics and audiences as reviews were mostly good while the CinemaScore grade was a dreadful D which is poor even by fright film standards. The budget was just under $5M. The action-comedy Baywatch followed with an estimated $4.6M, down 47%, for a new total of $51.1M for Paramount.The soldier story Megan Leavey had a soft debut grossing an estimated $3.8M from 1,956 locations for an average of only $1,926. Bleecker Street saw very positive feedback from critics and ticket buyers alike. Falling 56% to an estimated $1.8M was Alien: Covenant which has banked $71.2M to date for Fox. Global is $181.6M with China set to open on Friday.Warner Bros. rounded out the top ten with the romance Everything, Everything which grossed an estimated $1.6M, off 51%, for a $31.7M sum. The film is one of three in the top ten to be directed by women joining Megan Leavey and of course the reigning box office queen Wonder Woman.The top ten films grossed an estimated $136.4M which was off 2% from last year when The Conjuring 2 opened at number one with $40.4M; and down 49% from 2015 when Jurassic World debuted in the top spot with a record $208.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"winner, cars, Emmy, street, Extras, Wars, TCM, screenings, Tumblr, Witch, renewals, nbcuniversal","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11142545/600WonderWoman2.jpg","slug":"box-office-mummy-unravels-as-wonder-woman-retains-1-spot"},{"id":"47509098877499","title":"Box Office: Power Rangers Take on the Beast","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Power Rangers Take on the BeastKong and Life Come in Third and Fourth behind Two Nostalgic Reboots..by Gitesh Pandya | March 26, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, the blockbuster Disney tale Beauty and the Beast easily ruled the box office once again in its second round grossing an estimated $88.3M more than doubling its closest competitor. That was the fourth biggest gross of all-time for any film’s sophomore weekend and the decline of 49% was remarkable given that massive openings are often met with drops closer to the 60% area. Cume to date through the second weekend is now an eye-popping $317M on course for a possible finish in the lofty $475-500M range.Only three other movies have ever grossed more through their first ten days at the box office. All-time champ Star Wars: The Force Awakens did $540.1M with help from Christmas, Jurassic World banked $402.8M during its summer run, and The Avengers amassed $373.1M in early May 2012. All ended their domestic runs over the $600M mark.So far, Beauty is playing like a much stronger version of the studio’s 2015 fairy tale hit Cinderella. Both opened big in mid-March and took advantage of various spring breaks that schools take throughout the month. Cinderella had an identical 49% second weekend drop and its ten-day cume represented 61% of its eventual $201.2M final. If Beast stays on the exact same course in the weeks ahead that would lead to a $515M finish. Faster erosion would still get it close to the half-billion mark which would put it in the Top 10 list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Disney would then contribute six films to the all-time Top 50 list over the past 13 months with all its divisions delivering monster hits.Overseas audiences are in love with Belle too as the mega-hit captured a stunning $119.2M this weekend to boost the international sum to $373.3M led by China’s $73.4M. That puts the worldwide total at a spectacular $690.3M in under two weeks of play on its way to the billion dollar club for sure.The big-budget reboot of Power Rangers&nbsp;landed in second place with a strong opening weekend of $40.5M from 3,693 locations delivering a muscular $10,967 average. The long-lasting brand allowed moviegoers of a wide age group to take interest and come out for a big-screen adventure filled with special effects that were beyond what the old TV series featured.Not surprisingly, reviews for the PG-13 actioner were not very good but Power Rangers sold itself more on the brand plus nostalgia. Ticket buyers polled by CinemaScore gave an A grade. The red hot March box office has now generated $40M+ openings over four consecutive weekends which means an awful lot of people have been seeing trailers for this summer’s upcoming menu of blockbuster offerings.Taking third place in its third weekend was another expensive summer-like tentpole, Kong: Skull Island, which grossed an estimated $14.4M. Down 48%, the Warner Bros. film has amassed $133.5M domestic. With a massive $72.1M opening weekend in China, the monster movie grabbed another $93M overseas this weekend pushing the international cume to $258.6M and the global haul to $392.1M.The sci-fi thriller Life opened in fourth place with an estimated $12.6M from 3,146 locations for a respectable $4,005 average. The R-rated space pic attracted mixed reviews from film critics and only a C+ grade from CinemaScore. Jake Gyllenhaal and Ryan Reynolds star in the Sony release.Breaking through the double century mark was Fox’s Logan which grossed an estimated $10.1M, down 43%, for a new cume of $201.5M with global now up to $565.5M. The smash thriller Get Out just kept on posting good holds with a 35% decline in the fifth weekend to an estimated $8.7M lifting Universal’s total to an incredible $147.5M.From TV series to flop movie, CHiPs debuted poorly in seventh place with an estimated $7.6M from 2,464 locations for a mild $3,084 average. The R-rated comedy from Warner Bros. earned bad reviews and was adapted from a brand that was not very exciting to begin with. Competition was fierce too and the marketplace had little need for this entry right now.Off only 37% in its fourth weekend, the drama The Shack followed with an estimated $3.8M giving Lionsgate a solid $49.1M to date. The LEGO Batman Movie tumbled 57% to an estimated $2M putting Warner Bros. at $170.8M. Horror pic The Belko Experiment rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.8M, off 56%, and a total of $7.6M for Orion and BH Tilt.The top ten films grossed an estimated $189.9M which was down 22% from last year when Batman v Superman opened at number one over the Easter holiday weekend with a March record $166M; but up 36% from 2015 when Home debuted in the top spot with $52.1M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;Related NewsRank Ryan Reynolds’ 10 Best MoviesRanking 26 Giant Robots From Film and TVHow Family-Friendly Is Despicable Me 3?More Related News More Weekend Box OfficeWeekend Box Office Results: A Quiet Place Part II Upsets In the Heights To Top Weekend And Pass $100 MillionWeekend Box Office Results: The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It Scores $24 Million Win As Horror Revives the Box OfficeWeekend Box Office Results: A Quiet Place Part II Shatters Expectations With $57 Million Memorial Day HaulMore Weekend Box Office","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Games, History, nightmare, OWN, thriller, 93rd, Day, adaptation","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/26121928/beauty-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-power-rangers-take-on-the-beast"},{"id":"47509097592373","title":"Box Office: Guardians Vol. 2 Gives Marvel Its 15th Straight #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Guardians Vol. 2 Gives Marvel Its 15th Straight #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | May 7, 2017 |  CommentsWalt Disney StudiosThis weekend&nbsp;the Marvel Cinematic Universe scored its 15th consecutive number one opening as the ensemble sequel Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 kicked off the summer movie season with a thunderous start, grossing an estimated $145M. The PG-13 release from Disney averaged a sturdy $33,368 from 4,347 locations and will likely find its way north of the triple century mark.Star-Lord and pals posted a debut that was a hefty 54% bigger than the $94.3M bow of the first Guardians from August 2014, which exceeded industry expectations at the time. That’s more growth from part one to part two than seen by past Marvel sequels like Iron Man 2 (+30%), Thor: The Dark World (+31%), and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (+46%). The first GOTG was a leggy summer hit that grew its fan base over time and the studio’s move to the potent first weekend of May helped the sequel to absorb more business in the first weekend.Volume 2 kicked off the weekend with $56.3M on Friday, including $17M from Thursday pre-shows. While recent Marvel summer kickoff films saw Saturday falls of 19% (Captain America: Civil War) and 33% (Avengers: Age of Ultron), GOTG2&nbsp;slipped only 9% to $51.1M, showing good buzz and less of an upfront rush.Though a muscular start, the new Guardians did not rank among the top five May openings of all-time. Those include Avengers ($207.4M), Ultron ($191.3M), Civil War ($179.1M), Iron Man 3 ($174.1M), and Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M). It does rank as the second biggest May debut without Iron Man in it. Overall, GOTG2 scored the 17th largest opening weekend in box office history, tenth best for any summer film and ninth biggest for a comic book movie. Studio data showed that the audience was 56% male and 60% 25 and older. Reviews were positive and the A grade from CinemaScore indicates ticket buyers liked what they paid for.With the global run of GOTG2, the MCU has now smashed through an astounding $11 billion in combined worldwide box office from 15 films spanning a period of nine years that started with 2008’s Iron Man. Home video, TV rights, and merchandising have brought in billions more in revenue. The grand plan has paid off handsomely as there have been no flops for this bulletproof brand. Plus there is much more to come with this July’s Spider-Man: Homecoming, a reboot of sorts with box office gold Iron Man as part of the story. Then November sees Thor: Ragnarok which features the Incredible Hulk. Marvel already has the first weekends of May locked up in 2018 with Avengers: Infinity War, 2019 with another Avengers film, and 2020 with an untitled movie. A dozen films are on the calendar just from the MCU with more to come down the road.In overseas markets, Galaxy grossed an estimated $123.8M in its second weekend, including a $48M debut in China, which was 75% bigger than its predecessor. The international total from 55 markets is now $282.6M, putting the global haul at $427.6M and rising fast. Japan, its final market, opens next weekend. In another week or so, the sequel will beat the $774M of the first Guardians and should certainly find its way north of $900M by the end of its run.With Guardians hogging up 79% of all ticket sales for the top ten, the rest of the list featured spring leftovers picking up small slices. Three-time chart-topper The Fate of the Furious settled for second place, decelerating by 57% to an estimated $8.5M and putting Universal at $207.1M to date from North America. The overseas haul has climbed to an eye-popping $951.2M, allowing F8 to surpass both Avengers movies to become number seven all-time at the international box office. The global gross is now a staggering $1.16 billion and counting.Spending its sixth weekend in the top five was Alec Baldwin’s The Boss Baby, which slipped only 34% to an estimated $6.2M as the DreamWorks Animation hit continues to show good legs with family audiences. It’s&nbsp;banked $156.7M to date with the worldwide total now up to $434.9M. Tumbling 57% in its second weekend, How to be a Latin Lover grossed an estimated $5.3M, pushing the cume to $20.7M for Lionsgate.Holding up well against recent testosterone tentpoles was Beauty and the Beast, which took fifth place in its eighth weekend of play with an estimated $4.9M. With a towering $487.6M to date, the Disney smash has now passed Pixar’s Finding Dory to take the number eight spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters with the half-billion mark within reach. Beauty‘s worldwide tally now sits at a stunning $1.19 billion.The star-driven flop The Circle fell sharply to an estimated $4M, off 56%. Total is only $15.7M for STX. The Indian blockbuster Baahubali 2 tumbled 69% from its record opening weekend to an estimated $3.2M, boosting the sum to $16.2M. That is more than any Bollywood film has ever made in North America.Fox Searchlight’s leggy hit Gifted kept itself in the top ten once again with an estimated $2.1M, off 39%, for a $19.2M total. It’s the top-grossing specialty release of 2017 so far. Dropping 47% was the comedy Going in Style with an estimated $1.9M for Warner Bros. while Sony’s Smurfs: The Lost Village fell 49% to an estimated $1.8M. Totals are $40.6M a piece.The top ten films grossed an estimated $183M, which was down 21% from last year when Captain America: Civil War opened at number one with $179.1M; but up 53% from 2015 when Avengers: Age of Ultron held the top spot in its second weekend with $77.7M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Kaling, league, christmas, TCA, AMC, Day, Awards, show, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/07140449/GOTG-Vol2-BO.jpg","slug":"box-office-guardians-vol-2gives-marvel-its-15th-straight-1-opening"},{"id":"47509098908226","title":"Box Office: Third Weekend at #1 for Split","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Third Weekend at #1 for Splitby Gitesh Pandya | February 5, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, the Super Bowl frame was as slow as usual at North American multiplexes and the suspense thriller Split&nbsp;topped the chart for the third straight time. Universal’s sleeper hit grossed an estimated $14.6M slipping only 43% and came within striking distance of the century mark with a new total of $98.7M.Split&nbsp;marks only the second film ever for director M. Night Shyamalan to spend its first three weekends at number one after the 1999 smash The Sixth Sense&nbsp;which held the lead during its first five sessions. His 2002 blockbuster Signs&nbsp;held the top spot for three non-consecutive weekends. Split&nbsp;should crack $100M by Tuesday and could find its way to around $135M by the end of its domestic run – an amazing result for a film that cost under $10M to produce.On Saturday, Split&nbsp;surpassed the $95M of 2000’s Unbreakable&nbsp;to become the fifth biggest film all-time for Shyamalan and should be able to pass The Village and The Last Airbender next. International grosses for the James McAvoy hit climbed to $44M on a trajectory towards the $100M mark from overseas territories.The franchise horror film Rings&nbsp;debuted in second place with an estimated $13M from 2,931 locations for a decent $4,435 average. Critics gave an across-the-board thumbs down to the PG-13 chiller and paying audiences agreed as the CinemaScore grade was a C-. 2002’s The Ring, a remake of the Japanese hit, opened to $15M and a $7,580 average when ticket prices were much lower and had exceptional legs finishing with a robust $129.1M. The 2005 sequel The Ring Two debuted bigger with $35.1M, but much of the excitement for this brand has since eroded. Competition from the red hot Split&nbsp;was a contributing factor too. Paramount saw good results from international markets this weekend where Rings&nbsp;is outperforming other recent horror films.The controversial drama A Dog’s Purpose enjoyed a reasonably good second weekend hold declining by 41% to an estimated $10.8M taking third place. Universal has grossed $32.9M thus far and may end up in the $55-60M range.Two Academy Award contenders for Best Picture followed which are both among the highest grossing films so far in 2017. The only movie in the top ten this weekend to drop by less than 30% was Hidden Figures with an estimated $10.1M, off only 28%. Winning the SAG award for Best Cast last week helped keep the momentum and attention going for the Fox release which has grossed an extraordinary $119.4M to date. Breaking $150M seems likely for the $25M-budgeted film. Dropping 39% was the musical La La Land with an estimated $7.5M pushing the cume for Lionsgate to $118.3M. The international take rose to $150M putting the global tally at $268.3M with China opening on Valentine’s Day.Low-cost original movies have attracted huge audiences so far in 2017. The combined production budgets for top-grossers Hidden Figures, La La Land, and Split&nbsp;amount to $65M yet the three hits are on course to gross together over $800M worldwide.Crashing 67% in its second weekend was the zombie sequel Resident Evil: The Final Chapter which took in an estimated $4.5M for a cume of $21.9M. The worldwide take sits at $115M so far for Sony.Animation sensation Sing&nbsp;followed with an estimated $4.1M, down 36%, for a hefty new total of $262.9M for Universal. Global sits at $487M with solid numbers coming in from Europe where it is still new while China, Russia, and Japan are still to come. Close behind was Best Picture Oscar nominee Lion&nbsp;which expanded to its widest point yet and grossed an estimated $4M this weekend from 1,405 locations. The Weinstein Co. has banked $24.7M to date.There were very few takers for the new boy-from-Mars drama The Space Between Us which flopped with an opening of an estimated $3.8M from 2,812 locations for a dismal $1,358 average for STX. Rounding out the top ten was Paramount’s action sequel xXx: Return of Xander Cage with an estimated $3.7M, down 57%, for a sum of $40M with global now at $152.4M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.1M which was up a scant 1% from last year when Kung Fu Panda 3 stayed at number one with $21.2M; but down 43% from 2015 when the Super Bowl was a week earlier and The Spongebob Movie opened in the top spot with $55.4M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"harry","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/05163456/550Split.jpg","slug":"box-office-third-weekend-at-1-for-split"},{"id":"47509098879548","title":"Box Office: Beauty and the Beast Has a Record-Breaking Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Beauty and the Beast Has a Record-Breaking WeekendKong: Skull Island and Logan round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 19, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;Disney demolished the box office with a colossal debut for its fairy tale tentpole Beauty and the Beast which soared to a scorching $170M, according to estimates, generating the seventh largest opening weekend in history beating all Batman, Spider-Man, Hunger Games, and Harry Potter movies in the process. The big-budget epic also set new box office records for the biggest debuts ever for both March releases and PG-rated movies.The jaw-dropping sales figure came from 4,120 locations delivering a scorching per-theater average of $40,380. 19% of the gross came from IMAX and PLF screens as many movie fans felt this highly anticipated motion picture was worth paying extra for.Buzz has been building since Disney first announced it was making a live-action version of the beloved 1991 Oscar-winning animated film. The casting of Emma Watson which was announced over two years ago only added to the excitement. Advance ticket sales ran at record levels for a family film and huge grosses were expected, but Beast came in on the top end of expectations.The studio has made a fortune using its strategy of taking fairy tale stories and making them into event films. After all, this strategy has been used for decades on comic book characters. The four films ahead of Belle on the all-time opening weekend list all feature Iron Man. But Beauty and the Beast took its genre to new heights with a launch that was much bigger than the openings for Cinderella and Maleficent – combined. The studio fully expects cash to keep coming in over the years ahead with live-action versions of Aladdin, Mulan and others currently in development.Studio data showed that Beauty skewed 60% female this weekend and broad appeal was there as half of the audience was non-family. 26% of the gross came from the various 3D formats. Reviews were generally positive for the musical and an A grade from CinemaScore indicates that ticket buyers were satisfied with what they got.How front-loaded the film is remains a question. Friday kicked off with a stellar $63.8M which included $16.3M from Thursday night pre-shows beginning at 6pm. While past March fairy tale films rose on Saturday, Beast dipped 2% to $62.7M. Intense demand certainly pushed much of the business upfront. Sunday is estimated to drop 31%. Still, with many schools having spring break school closures in March, there is plenty of upside still to come and next weekend’s competition is not too direct. Breaking $400M domestic seems very likely.A mammoth $180M opening weekend from international markets made for a giant $350M global premiere for Beauty and the Beast. China led with a $44.8M start while the U.K. followed with $22.8M. With France, Australia, and Japan still to open, we could very well be looking at a billion dollar Belle.After its mighty opening weekend, the monster movie Kong: Skull Island dropped a reasonable 53% in its sophomore session and grossed an estimated $28.9M. That gave Warner Bros. a cume of $110.1M through the second weekend on its way to a domestic final of about $170M. The big-budget Kong has racked up $149.2M overseas and currently stands at a worldwide haul of $259.3M. Next weekend’s openings in China and Japan will take it much higher.Logan, 2017’s top-grossing film – for now – followed in third place as Fox’s Logan dropped 54% to an estimated $17.5M after its third weekend of play. The Hugh Jackman hit has grossed $184M making it now the biggest of the three stand-alone Wolverine pics. The worldwide tally now sits at $524M on its way to nearly $700M.Horror hit Get Out once again showed stamina in its fourth weekend grossing an estimated $13.2M, off 36%. Universal has banked an incredible $133.1M thus far and will soon surpass the $136.9M of Split, the studio’s other low-cost fright smash from this year in its partnership with Blumhouse. The dynamic duo should end with over $300M in combined domestic grosses and cost a mere $14M together to produce.Off 39% in its third weekend was the faith-based drama The Shack with an estimated $6.1M and a nice new sum of $42.6M for Lionsgate. Despite the arrival of a Disney behemoth, the animated adventure comedy The LEGO Batman Movie still held up nicely falling only 38% to an estimated $4.7M in its sixth round. With $167.4M to date, the Warner Bros. hit has already surpassed the grosses of some of last year’s high-profile toons like Trolls, Kung Fu Panda 3, and The Angry Birds Movie. Global for LEGO Batman now stands at $287.4M.The new horror film The Belko Experiment opened to soft results in seventh place with an estimated $4.1M from 1,341 locations for a mild $3,035 average. Earning mixed reviews, the low-budget R-rated thriller from Orion and BH Tilt failed to stand out as a must-see genre pic during a year when many other films have already given audiences plenty of scares for their money.Fox’s runaway hit Hidden Figures followed with an estimated $1.5M, down 46%, with a stellar $165.6M to date. The highest grossing film for Keanu Reeves in 13 years, John Wick: Chapter Two, fell 55% to an estimated $1.2M for a $89.8M cume for Lionsgate. Tumbling 66% was the teen flop Before I Fall with an estimated $1M putting Open Road at only $11.3M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $248.2M which was up a staggering 114% from last year when Zootopia stayed at number one with $37.2M; and up a mighty 112% from 2015 when The Divergent Series: Insurgent debuted in the top spot with $52.3M.

The Fox release averaged a sturdy $12,987 from 3,773 locations and delivered the sixth biggest opening weekend ever for an animated film in the March-April corridor which is a prime period for kidpics because of Easter holidays.Boss Baby earned mixed reviews and beat out expectations coming very close to the $52.1M bow of the animation studio’s Home from two years ago this same time of year. It finished its run with $177.4M. Voiced by Alec Baldwin who has gained prominence over the last six months for his portrayal of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, the PG-rated Baby earned a good A- CinemaScore grade and plans to take advantage of school holidays in the coming weeks to keep the cash coming in. Overseas markets have taken in $59M so far for a worldwide take of $108M.Settling for second place in its third frame was the box office juggernaut Beauty and the Beast which grossed an estimated $47.5M. Looking at third weekend grosses for films not helped by the New Year’s Day holiday, Beast ranks third best all time after The Avengers and Jurassic World which each did roughly $55M during their summer runs. The Disney behemoth now stands at $395.5M climbing up to number 26 on the all-time domestic chart with a good shot at reaching $525M or more.International markets brought in another $66.5M this weekend boosting the offshore total to $480.8M and the global gross to an eye-popping $876.3M. Belle should cross the $900M mark by Wednesday and then smash the billion dollar barrier before Easter.Scarlett Johansson opened her new sci-fi entry Ghost in the Shell to an estimated $19M from 3,440 theaters for a $5,523 average. The PG-13 film came in with less than half of the $43.9M that the star’s Lucy generated on its opening weekend in 2014. Paramount saw a lot of competition in the marketplace going after the same action crowd. Reviews were mixed. Ghost also launched in 52 international markets this weekend collecting another $40.1M for a $59.1M global launch. It still has major markets China and Japan to come.Suffering the biggest drop in the top ten was the brand-driven action pic Power Rangers which grossed an estimated $14.5M tumbling a sharp 64% from its debut frame. With $65.1M to date, Lionsgate looks to end its domestic run near the $90M mark.Holding up well in its fourth weekend despite a crowded marketplace of competitors was Kong: Skull Island which slipped 40% to an estimated $8.8M. Warner Bros. has taken in $147.8M so far from North America. In China, Kong is now the studio’s highest grossing film of all-time with a stellar $124M contributing to a new overseas tally of $329.5M putting the global haul at $477.3M. It should crack the half-billion mark next weekend.Hugh Jackman’s reported last turn as Wolverine followed as Logan dropped 40% to an estimated $6.2M for a new cume of $211.9M for Fox with global now up to $585.5M. Low budget thriller Get Out slipped 35% to an estimated $5.8M and boosted Universal’s amazing total to $156.9M which is a stunning 35 times its production cost.Falling 55% in its second weekend was the sci-fi thriller Life which banked an estimated $5.6M putting the cume at just $22.4M. Collecting an estimated $4.1M was the comedy CHiPs which slipped 48% giving Warner Bros. $14.4M to date.Rounding out the top ten was the new drama The Zookeeper’s Wife with an estimated $3.3M from 541 locations for a solid $6,190 average. The Jessica Chastain starrer earned mixed reviews for Focus but the audience of mature women have been more pleased than critics. It will add more theaters next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $163.9M which was up 38% from last year when Batman v Superman stayed at number one with $51.3M; but down 24% from 2015 when Furious 7 debuted in the top spot with an April record $147.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Guide, trailers","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/02143749/boss-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-boss-baby-bumps-beast-from-number-one"},{"id":"47509097598518","title":"Box Office: Latin Lover and Baahubali 2‘s Big Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Latin Lover and Baahubali 2's Big Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | April 30, 2017 |  CommentsThe month’s biggest blockbuster remained the top movie in North America and raced past the $1 billion mark at the global box office as well. Universal’s unstoppable smash The Fate of the Furious grossed an estimated $19.4M in its third weekend, dropping an understandable 50% in the process, and lifted its domestic tally to $192.7M.But overseas is where the magic is for this action franchise. 69 markets delivered an estimated $68.4M this weekend pushing the offshore total to a stunning $867.6M. China leads the way with an incredible $361M which is second best all-time among Hollywood films there behind the $390.5M of Furious 7. But in local currency, F8 surpassed F7 this weekend ranking number one all-time among US films. The global tally now stands at a towering $1.06 billion (82% from international markets) on its way to a possible finish of $1.3 billion which will put it among the top ten worldwide blockbusters of all-time.The second and third spots at the box office this weekend were taken by new films that surged past expectations and saw sales driven primarily from ethnic groups across America. The Lionsgate comedy How to be a Latin Lover delivered a terrific debut opening to an estimated $12M from 1,118 locations for a sizzling $10,750 average. 89% of the audience was Latino and actor Eugenio Derbez provided the starpower. Reviews were mixed but did not seem to factor much into attendance.Generating the biggest opening weekend of all-time for an Indian film in North America, the effects-driven adventure sequel Baahubali 2 bowed in third place with an estimated $10.1M from 425 locations for a muscular $23,765 average. Released by Great India Films, the epic saga was the concluding chapter following the 2015 predecessor which was a box office sensation around the world. No Indian film has ever opened this high on the U.S. box office chart before.The weekend gross for Baahubali 2 includes over $2M from previews which began on Thursday afternoon which were rolled into Friday’s figure. As an event film with impressive visuals and a built-in fan base, 45 IMAX screens were booked and contributed $1.8M over the weekend for an amazing average of $40,000 per screen. The Telugu language film also offered versions in other Indian languages such as Tamil and Hindi to appeal to various segments of the overall Indian-American moviegoing crowd. Ticket prices were extra high, often ranging between $25 to $30, though premium seating like IMAX featured some tickets that cost more than $42.Higher pricing helped, but that does not take away from what a remarkable box office achievement this was. Baahubali 2 is not a Bollywood film, but that genre’s biggest opening weekend ever in North America was $3.6M for 2014’s PK from 272 locations across its Friday-to-Sunday debut period. That film had standard ticket prices and no IMAX option. Overall, foreign-language films from any country almost never reach the $10M neighborhood on opening weekend.Emma Watson and Tom Hanks saw their new critically panned thriller The Circle debut in fourth place to soft results with an estimated $9.3M. The PG-13 film averaged a mild $2,947 from 3,163 locations and those who did show up hated the film. It earned a rare D+ grade from CinemaScore polls. Studio data from STX indicated that it was more of a Watson crowd with 62% being female and 44% being ages 18 to 34.Big family blockbusters nicknamed BB followed. The Fox toon The Boss Baby dropped 29% to an estimated $9.1M for a new domestic tally of $148.5M. Global sits at $396.6M. Disney’s mammoth hit Beauty and the Beast fell 34% to an estimated $6.4M lifting the cume to $480.1M from North America with the worldwide haul now $1.14 billion.The comedy Going in Style was down 27% with an estimated $3.6M weekend while Sony’s toon Smurfs: The Lost Village collected an estimated $3.3M, off 32%. Totals are now $37.3M and $37.7M, respectively. The Fox Searchlight hit Gifted ranked ninth with an estimated $3.3M, down 28%, for a $15.8M sum. Rounding out the top ten was the Warner Bros. flop Unforgettable which dropped 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.3M making for a wimpy $8.9M in ten days.The top ten films grossed an estimated $78.8M which was down 19% from last year when The Jungle Book stayed at number one with $43.7M; and down 65% from 2015 when Avengers: Age of Ultron kicked off the summer season in the top spot with $191.3M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com&nbsp;on&nbsp;Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Classic, Opinion, Mudbound, BBC, BBC, scene, actors, nbcuniversal, reviews","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/30135517/600LatinLover.jpg","slug":"box-office-latin-lover-and-baahubali-2s-big-weekend"},{"id":"47509100561998","title":"Box Office: The Doctor Is Still In","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: The Doctor Is Still InDenis Villeneuve Sci-Fi Film Arrives at Third.by Sujit Chawla | November 13, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, with Oscar season heating up, a couple of new arrivals did well, while a doctor and some trolls hung out in the top spots together again this weekend.Staying at number one for a second weekend was the Marvel smash Doctor Strange which dipped a reasonable 49% from last weekend to an estimated $43M, bringing its domestic total up to $153M. Internationally the film brought in an additional $60M bringing its worldwide total to an astounding $492M. It stands a good chance of hitting the $240M mark domestically, which would vault it past every other solo introduction of a Marvel character except Iron Man. It really does seem as if Marvel can do no wrong.Falling a slim 25% and ending up in second for a second straight weekend was the animated Trolls which took in an estimated $35M, bringing its cume to $94M. It could end its run with around $175M, depending on how much of an impact Disney’s Moana has in 10 days, and if it does Trolls would improbably be a top five animated film this year.In third place was the debut of Arrival from acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve. Opening in 2,317 theaters, the sci-fi film brought in $24M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $10,358. Interestingly enough, while the film has a 93% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes, its CinemaScore of a B means that critics loved it while your average moviegoer isn’t connecting with it. Unfortunately this likely means the film will drop hard over the next few weeks.Almost Christmas opened this weekend in fourth place with an estimated $15.5M from 2,376 theaters for a per screen average of $6,551. In a reversal from Arrival, critics haven’t enjoyed it (only 44% on Rotten Tomatoes) but audiences have been digging it, giving it an A- on CinemaScore. While its opening is nearly $10 less than Arrival, it’ll be fun to see if in the long run Almost Christmas ends up making more money.Mel Gibson’s return to the directing chair, Hacksaw Ridge fell 29% in its second weekend to an estimated $10.8M, bringing its total to $32.3M. Look for a finale in the $55-60M range. Fellow Oscar winner Ben Affleck’s The Accountant fell only 22% to an estimated $4.6M in its fifth weekend, bringing its total up to $77M.Horror entry Shut In debuted to an estimated $3.7M from 2,058 theaters for a per screen average of only $1,798. Shut In was shut out by critics as it currently has 0% on Rotten Tomatoes and audiences hated it too as it has a C CinemaScore. I expect this to be in whatever the digital equivalent of a bargain bin is these days, within the next few weeks.Two-time box office champ Boo! A Madea Halloween fell 54% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $3.55M, bringing its total up to $70.4M. It is now the second highest Madea film behind only 2009’s Madea Goes to Jail which ended with $90M.A couple of huge Hollywood Tom sequels rounded out the top 10. In ninth place was Tom Cruise with Jack Reacher: Never Go Back which took in an estimated $3.3M this weekend bringing its total up to $54.6M, which puts it about 25% behind the original Jack Reacher at the same point in its run. And in 10th place was Tom Hanks with Inferno which took in an estimated $3.2M bringing its total up to a disappointing $31.5M. This may be the last we see of Robert Langdon in theaters for a long time.Outside of the top 10, Ang Lee’s highly anticipated Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk opened on 2 screens with an estimated $120,000. While normally those would be positive numbers, a current 49% on Rotten Tomatoes is a bit ominous.The top ten films grossed an estimated $146.8M which was up 57% from last year when Spectre&nbsp;held on to the top spot for a second weekend with $33.6M; and up 17% from 2014 when Dumb and Dumber To opened at number one with $36.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"The, TCA, Crackle, police, Starz, News, star, indie, live, Society, Ovation, award, Fox, festivals, Pixar","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/13125006/strange-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-the-doctor-is-still-in"},{"id":"47509100564047","title":"Box Office: Explosive #1 Debut for Doctor Strange","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Explosive #1 Debut for Doctor StrangeTrolls plays well to family audiencesby Gitesh Pandya | November 6, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;This weekend, moviegoers nationwide escaped the anxiety-inducing drama of the final days of the presidential election by flooding multiplexes and spending over $145M on a trio of new releases which pumped well-needed energy into the box office.Opening at number one in spectacular fashion was the Marvel super hero film Doctor Strange which launched with an estimated $85M from 3,882 theaters for a scorching $21,893 average. Over half of the sales came from premium-priced options like IMAX, PLF, and 3D as fans felt it was worth it to spend more for an enhanced experience. The film’s dazzling visual effects drove the extra spending and Marvel has enjoyed number one openings for all 14 of their films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe dating back to 2008’s Iron&nbsp;Man.Strange delivered one of the best performances ever for a super hero origin story beating the first films of Captain America, Thor, Ant-Man, Hulk and others. That’s remarkable given how the character is not as well-known as most of those others. Reviews were fantastic and the Benedict Cumberbatch hit earned a glowing A CinemaScore grade, as did the other two new releases this weekend.Studio data showed that the sorcery pic attracted an audience that was 58% male and 67% over 25. The weekend began with an opening day Friday of $32.6M including $9.4M from Thursday night pre-shows. Saturday dipped by a remarkably low 4% to $31.2M. Sunday is projected to fall 32% to $21.2M. The daily flow was similar to 2013’s Thor: The Dark World which also bowed in early November capturing a similar $85.7M over three days. For Doctor Strange to be in the same neighborhood as a sequel from the established Avengers team is incredible.Strange began its worldwide roll-out a week earlier and this weekend’s international gross came in at a robust $118.7M from 53 markets including a stellar $44.4M opening weekend in China. That puts the offshore cume at $240.4M with the top holdover being Korea at $30.4M. Overall, European and Asian markets saw second weekend drops that were a little lower than for past super hero movies as word of mouth is quite good. With global at $325.4M and rising quickly, a final north of at least $700M seems likely.Playing well to family audiences was the DreamWorks Animation comedy Trolls&nbsp;which bowed to an estimated $45.6M from 4,060 sites for a solid $11,232 average. The PG-rated pic debuted better than the last offering from the animation studio, Kung Fu Panda 3, which launched with $41.3M. Toons opening in early November usually finish with three to four times their opening weekend gross and with high audience scores, the road ahead looks promising.The marketing push from Fox and brand partners has been in high gear and kids responded to the humor, color, and music. October saw no new animated films enter the marketplace so the target audience was ready for an event film of this genre. More international markets launched in its third round with the offshore cume hitting $104M for a global tally to date of near $150M.Mel Gibson was back in the top ten with his directorial project Hacksaw Ridge which enjoyed a good opening with an estimated $14.8M from 2,886 locations for a $5,111 average. Lionsgate earned good reviews for the R-rated military story which is playing as counter-programming for more serious-minded adults not interested in cartoons or super heroes. Audience feedback has been very positive. It’s been 14 years since Gibson has anchored a number one hit as an actor. That film was 2002’s Signs.Two-time champ Boo! A Madea Halloween fell a sharp 55% to an estimated $7.8M now that the holiday has passed. Lionsgate has banked $65M to date and later this week the comedy will become the second highest grossing film all-time for director Tyler Perry after Madea Goes To Jail. His top four career hits are all Madea flicks.Tom Hanks saw his latest film Inferno follow its lackluster debut with a steep second weekend tumble. The Sony release declined by 58% to an estimated $6.3M for a weak cume of $26.1M. Compared to the previous films in the franchise, Inferno is running a troubling 68% behind 2009’s Angels &amp; Demons and a staggering 81% behind 2006’s The Da Vinci Code. Inferno should end at about $40M and will become the first 3,000+ theater release ever for Hanks to not break the $100M mark.Warner Bros. followed with The Accountant with an estimated $6M, off only 30%, for a $70.9M cume. Tom Cruise saw a 42% drop for his action sequel&nbsp;Jack Reacher: Never Go Back with an estimated $5.6M and a $49.2M cume.Ouija: Origin of Evil grossed an estimated $4M, down 44%, for a $31.4M total. Universal’s other title The Girl on the Train fell 37% to an estimated $2.8M for $70.7M to date. Miss Peregrine rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.1M, down 48%, putting Fox at $83.3M.Just outside the top ten was indie sensation Moonlight which has fared incredibly well during its expansion over the last three weeks. Widening to 83 locations, the A24 film took in an estimated $1.3M for a solid $16,048 average. Reviews and word of mouth have been exceptional and while many indies fizzle out when expanding across the country, Moonlight has been holding its own with $3.1M to date and much more to go as it keeps adding more theaters. Platforming to terrific results in four locations was the inter-racial drama Loving with an estimated $169,000 for a strong $42,250 average. Reviews have been very positive and Focus will expand in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $179.8M which was up 21% from last year when Spectre&nbsp;debuted at number one with $70.4M; and up 26% from 2014 when Big Hero 6 opened in the top spot with $56.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Universe, in, Esquire, watch, Black, franchise","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/06133306/doctor_strange600x262.jpg","slug":"box-office-explosive-1-debut-for-doctor-strange"},{"id":"47509100553803","title":"Box Office: Moana &amp; Beasts Repeat as Top 2","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Moana &amp; Beasts Repeat as Top 2by Sujit Chawla | December 4, 2016 |  CommentsThe annual post-turkey blues kicked in with the box office being sliced in half from last weekend, but the top two films remained strong making the box office even with last year and substantially ahead of 2014.Disney’s latest blockbuster Moana&nbsp;fell just under 50% this weekend, a great hold considering the last two years the top film (both in the Hunger Games franchise) fell over 60%. Adding an estimated $28.4M to its treasure chest, the tale of Maui and pals has taken in $120M so far, with a lot more left in the tank. Overseas the film has taken in $57.5M for a worldwide total of $177.5M to date.In second place was Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them which took in an estimated $18.5M, a steep drop of 59% from last weekend – the worst drop in the top 10 – and yet not too bad considering its the weekend after Thanksgiving. Its total now stands at $183.5M. Internationally the tale of Newt and his beasts has taken in $424M bringing its worldwide total to just over $600M.Paramount, which has had a pretty dismal year all things considered, had the next couple of films with Arrival and Allied separated by a slim margin. The sci-fi thriller Arrival had the best hold in the top 10 falling only 36% to an estimated $7.3M bringing its total up to $73M. The $100M club is well within range, especially if there are significant Oscar nomination in its future. Brad Pitt’s WWII thriller Allied took in an estimated $7M bringing its total to $29M after two weeks. It could end its run in the $50M range.Marvel’s Doctor Strange kept right on trucking taking in an estimated $6.5M this weekend, bringing its cume up to $215M, which places it solidly in ninth place in the MCU pecking order, where it will likely stay. The animated Trolls brought in another $4.6M, according to estimates, taking its total up to $141M after five weeks.Mel Gibson’s return to the directing chair, Hacksaw Ridge, continued its impressive run falling only 38% from last weekend to an estimated $3.4M, bringing its total up to $57M. Billy Bob Thornton’s return to his Santa suit isn’t living up to audience expectations as Bad Santa 2 fell 47% in its second weekend to $3.2M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to only $14.3M. It likely won’t even hit $20M when all is said and done. The original film was at $27M after its second weekend, and that was in 2003.In ninth place was the one wide new release this weekend, the horror film Incarnate. Unfortunately moviegoers rejected the film as it took in only $2.65M, according to estimates. With a Rotten Tomatoes score of 21% and a C- from CinemaScore, this one will be in the theatrical dustbin soon enough. Rounding out the top 10 was the holiday dramedy Almost Christmas which made an estimated $2.5M bringing it total up to $38M.Just outside of the top 10 was awards hopeful Manchester by the Sea which took in an estimated $2.6M for a per screen average of $15,151. Its cume now stands at $4.4M after three weeks. Another Oscar hopeful opened on five screens this weekend as Natalie Portman’s Jackie took in an estimated $275,000 for a $55,000 per screen average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $84.2M which was down 3% from last year when The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 stayed at number one with $18.8M; and up 23.6% from 2014 when Mockingjay Part 1 remained in the top spot with $22M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Central, Song, romantic, sequel, Family, of, serial, story, of, Crunchyroll","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/04152706/600Moana.jpg","slug":"box-office-moana-beasts-repeat-as-top-2"},{"id":"47509098914373","title":"Box Office: Hidden Figures Tops MLK Weekend Heading to $100M+","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Hidden Figures Tops MLK Weekend Heading to $100M+by Gitesh Pandya | January 16, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, it was ladies first as the NASA scientists of the runaway hit blockbuster Hidden Figures ruled over the four-day Martin Luther King holiday session holding onto the number one spot for a second straight week. The uplifting Fox drama grossed an estimated $26M over the Friday-to-Monday span lifting the total gross to $60.4M with much more to come. After strong reviews and glowing word of mouth, the studio expanded the film this weekend into 815 additional locations across the country. The four-day average was a sturdy $7,912 from 3,286 locations. The three-day gross of $20.8M dipped only 9% from last weekend while the three-day average dropped just 31%.Hidden Figures marks the first holdover to rule MLK weekend since Avatar in 2010. Studios routinely use the year’s first long holiday weekend to program in big new releases or nationwide expansions for high profile films. That happened again this weekend, but dollars were spread across those numerous movies while audiences clearly chose to see uplifting, feel-good entertainment in the form of Hidden Figures which could be on track to end up with around $125M which would be five times its production cost.Universal’s smash toon hit Sing climbed back up one notch thanks to Monday’s school holiday and took in an estimated $19.2M over the four-day span. That boosted the mighty domestic haul to $238.4M while the global tally shot up to $402.7M with plenty more to go.After sweeping the Golden Globes last weekend taking a record-setting seven trophies including Best Picture – Comedy or Musical, La La Land seized the opportunity by expanding again and seeing its weekend collections rise for the sixth consecutive weekend. The Lionsgate hit took in an estimated $17.5M over the long four-day span and averaged a spectacular $9,470 from 1,848 locations. It was the best average of any film in wide release. Cume to date is $77.1M and the $100M mark should be crossed the weekend after Oscar nominations are announced next week. An additional $54.8M has been grossed overseas led by Korea’s $20.9M plus many major markets are still to come including China which opens the film on Valentine’s Day.Three-time box office champ Rogue One fell to fourth place but crashed through the $500M domestic mark in the process. The feisty rebels collected an estimated $17.1M over the long weekend and boosted the cume for Disney up to $502.2M. Rogue One now sits at number seven on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and has surpassed Finding Dory to become North America’s highest grossing film from 2016. The current trajectory still puts Rogue One on course to finish in the area of $530M.Worldwide, the latest Star Wars saga is less than a week away from breaking the billion dollar mark. A $21.9M international weekend over the Friday-to-Sunday period put the overseas take at $481.1M pushing the global tally to $983.3M. This Friday could be the day it enters ten-digit territory.The weekend’s biggest overachiever was the low-budget horror title The Bye Bye Man which opened to an impressive $15.3M over four days, according to estimates. Produced for under $8M, the PG-13 chiller averaged a solid $6,896 from 2,220 locations for STX. Fright films historically do well in January as the cheery Christmas holidays pass and genre fans return to demanding dark and sinister stories. This month included a Friday the 13th which Bye Bye used to kick off its release, excite audiences, and deliver the best weekend gross among the many new releases opening or expanding nationwide this weekend. And those other films had bigger, if not massively bigger, production budgets and marketing spends.Studio data showed that young women led the way as 61% of the audience was female and a very high 75% were under 25. Hollywood is offering very little for this demo right now so they rallied behind this new spooky film. Reviews were more on the negative side so ticket buyers responded more to the ads and marketing than to what critics had to say. The CinemaScore grade was a C which is decent for this genre.Paramount’s PG-rated action-comedy Monster Trucks followed close behind playing to kids and families opening to an estimated $15M. Averaging $4,809 from 3,119 sites, the effects-filled pic was met with bad reviews from film critics but earned an A from audiences polled by CinemaScore. Trucks skewed 53% male and 60% under 25 according to studio data.After three weeks of platform play, Mark Wahlberg’s drama Patriots Day expanded nationwide into 3,120 locations and grossed an estimated $13.6M for a $4,359 average. The Boston Marathon bombing pic generated good reviews from critics and earned a rare A+ CinemaScore grade which bodes well for the weeks ahead. Cume is $14.5M for CBS Films and Lionsgate.The Jamie Foxx action entry Sleepless debuted in eighth place with little fanfare grossing an estimated $9.9M over the long weekend for a decent four-day average of $5,487 from 1,803 locations. The R-rated undercover cop flick earned mostly negative reviews for Open Road and carried little buzz into the marketplace.Sony rounded out the top ten with a pair of action holdovers. The star-driven sci-fi pic Passengers grossed an estimated $6.8M lifting the total to date to $91.2M and hopes to join the century club. Underworld: Blood Wars fell to an estimated $6.8M as well in its second weekend boosting the cume to $24.9M. The three-day portion fell 58% which is normal for an action/horror sequel like this.Awards hopefuls expanded this weekend and were met with mixed results over a very crowded frame filled with numerous viable options for adult moviegoers. Ben Affleck failed to attract a crowd to his new film Live By Night which went fully nationwide into 2,822 locations grossing an estimated $6.1M over four days for a lousy $2,162 average over the long weekend for Warner Bros. Martin Scorsese’s new Japan-set period piece Silence widened to 747 taking in an estimated $2.3M for a $3,133 average for Paramount. After winning the biggest prize at last week’s Golden Globes, Best Picture – Drama, A24’s Moonlight&nbsp;went back out into national play with 582 theaters and grossed an estimated $1.4M&nbsp;in its 13th weekend. Cume is $14.9M for the hit indie which is soon expected to earn several Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.The top ten films grossed an estimated $147.2M over four days which was down 16% from last year when Ride Along 2 opened at number one with $41M; and down 33% from 2015 when American Sniper expanded nationwide into the top spot with a record $107.2M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"and, stop, OWN, 72, comedies","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/16155835/hidden-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-hidden-figures-tops-mlk-weekend-heading-to-100m"},{"id":"47509098912324","title":"Box Office: Split Soars to $40M+ Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Split Soars to $40M+ DebutM. Night Shyamalan Return Leads Inauguration Weekend while Rogue Breaks the $1 Billion Global Mark.by Gitesh Pandya | January 22, 2017 |  CommentsThis weekend, director M. Night Shyamalan scored his first number one opening in over a dozen years with his new suspense thriller Split which rocketed to the top spot with an debut of an estimated $40.2M from 3,038 locations for a sturdy $13,227 average. It was the fourth biggest January opening weekend of all-time and came in well ahead of expectations. To put this performance into perspective, the biggest horror opening of last year came from The Conjuring 2 which bowed to a similar $40.4M but was the sequel to one of the highest-grossing fright films ever.Reviews were very strong for the James McAvoy starrer and paying audiences were happy too as evidenced by the B+ CinemaScore grade which is on the high end of where films of this genre end up. Broad appeal helped the PG-13 Split pull in the numbers. Studio data from Universal showed that the crowd was 52% female, 52% under 25, and was split evenly 50/50 between white and non-white ticket buyers.Opening in second was the Vin Diesel action vehicle xXx: Return of Xander Cage with an estimated $20M from 3,651 locations for a $5,478 average. A roll-out in 53 international markets resulted in a $70.5M global debut making it the world’s number one movie this weekend. Cage comes more than 14 years after Diesel’s previous film in this franchise (2002’s XXX) and was met with mixed review from critics, but good buzz from audiences as the CinemaScore grade was an A-.The crowd for the PG-13 film was 53% male and 62% over 25 according to studio data from Paramount. With an international cast, Xander Cage debuted at number one this weekend in markets such as Russia, France, Germany, Mexico, Australia, and Brazil and still has openings coming in February in key markets like Korea, China, and Japan.After two weeks at number one, the sleeper hit Hidden Figures dropped to third place but still posted a great hold. The Fox release dipped by only 22% to an estimated $16.3M and raised its incredible total to $84.2M. Look for the $100M mark to be broken before January is over on its way to a final in the neighborhood of $125M which would be five times its production cost.Universal got to within striking distance of the quarter-billion mark with its hit toon Sing which followed with an estimated $9M, off 37%, for a cume to date of $249.4M. Global sits at $428M. Days ahead of what should be a large number of Academy Award nominations, La La Land grossed an estimated $8.4M, down 43%, for a new total of $89.7M for Lionsgate.Rogue One broke the $1 billion global box office mark this weekend as domestic took in an estimated $7M sliding by 48%. Cume is $512.2M and is still on a trajectory to finish at about $530M. International sales rose to $499M. Tied for sixth place was Paramount’s Monster Trucks which slipped a reasonable 36% to an estimated $7M for a total of $22.6M after its second weekend. Off 48% was Patriots Day with an estimated $6M giving CBS Films and Lionsgate $23.6M so far.The Michael Keaton film The Founder debuted in ninth place with an estimated $3.8M from 1,115 locations for a mild $3,370 average. The Weinstein Co. release earned good reviews. Jamie Foxx rounded out the top ten with his action pic Sleepless which fell 56% in its sophomore outing to an estimated $3.7M putting Open Road at $15.2M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121.3M which was up 27% from last year when The Revenant climbed into number one with $16M; but down 11% from 2015 when American Sniper held onto the top spot with $64.6M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"razzies, Yoda","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/22130218/split-fea.jpg","slug":"box-office-split-soars-to-40m-debut"},{"id":"47509100548681","title":"Box Office: Rogue One Launches with $290M Global Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Rogue One Launches with $290M Global Debutby Gitesh Pandya | December 18, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, legions of Star Wars fans flooded the multiplexes and powered the new franchise film Rogue One to number one with a colossal $155M opening in North America and $290.5M worldwide, according to estimates. The Disney release attacked 4,157 domestic theaters and averaged a stellar $37,287 per site.The debut was down 38% from the record-breaking $248M launch for Star Wars: The Force Awakens from this same weekend a year ago. As the first spin-off film in the series, Rogue One was always expected to be smaller as TFA had more anticipation built up around it. For 2016, the new Death Star flick scored the third best opening weekend of the year behind Captain America: Civil War ($179.1M) and Batman v Superman ($166M). Overall, Rogue One‘s opening weekend ranks number 12 on the all-time list and second best ever for December after TFA.The frame began with an opening day Friday of $71.1M which included $29M from Thursday night pre-shows starting at 7pm. Saturday dropped by 35% to $46.4M. That was a smaller dip than TFA‘s 43% from last year. Then Sunday is estimated to decline by 19% to $37.6M. TFA dipped 11% on its Sunday, however there were more schools closed on Monday at that time which helped Sunday traffic. Deadly winter snowstorms hit some regions of the country this weekend and some of the lost business is expected to be picked up in the coming days.Critics and audiences alike have been very happy with Rogue One. Reviews were mostly positive and ticket buyers polled by CinemaScore gave an A grade, same as Force Awakens. 59% of the audience was male, almost identical to TFA‘s 58%. The share of the gross from 3D screens went down, however, to 38% from TFA‘s 47%.With very few characters from past Star Wars movies, Rogue One entered the marketplace a little more like an original sci-fi film. That means upfront demand may not have been as strong as it was for TFA which returned beloved characters like Han Solo back into the fold for the first time in over three decades. If more of the Rogue One audience is fine with seeing the film later it could end up with better legs than TFA which went on to finish its domestic run with 3.8 times its opening weekend gross at $936.7M. A similar path forward would lead to a final domestic gross of around $580M since the holidays will be lucrative. Last year, TFA amassed nearly $300M from just the eight-day period of Christmas to New Years.Marketing on Rogue One was strong. After seven episodes from the main Star Wars storyline, this was the first attempt at an offshoot with a story that took place around the same time period as the first film from nearly 40 years ago. Being darker and more serious, it has less kid appeal and also the mainstream appeal from general audiences is seen as less too. But the Jyn Erso film does hope to win over more moviegoers by having a good product and generating hot buzz.Rogue One took off in all international markets except China and Korea this weekend and generated $135.5M led the $21M from the U.K. Last year, TFA saw a 55/45 split between international and domestic as the brand does play extra well in America. Action tentpoles often do 60-70% of their global business from foreign markets.With the holidays ahead, Rogue One looks on track to become the highest-grossing film of 2016 both domestically and globally. Current records are held by Finding Dory with $486.3M domestic and Captain America: Civil War with $1.15B worldwide. In North America, the top three hits of the year should end up being Lucasfilm’s Rogue One, Pixar’s Dory, and Marvel’s Civil War. All are owned by Disney which is capping off another spectacular year at the box office and once again has set up a promising slate for 2017.The mighty Disney empire also took second place with the animated hit Moana taking in an estimated $11.7M for a commendable 37% decline against the opening of a massive tentpole. To date the toon has grossed $161.9M domestic and $280.3M worldwide. Falling 50% in its sophomore session was the comedy Office Christmas Party with an estimated $8.5M giving Paramount $31.5M to date.Will Smith suffered the worst wide release opening of his career with his latest film Collateral Beauty which was dead on arrival grossing only $7M this weekend, according to estimates. Averaging a puny $2,312 from 3,028 locations, the PG-13 film was panned by critics and never generated much interest to begin with. Earlier this year, Smith starred in the ensemble smash Suicide Squad which became the highest grossing film of his career with $325.1M.Dropping to fifth place in its fifth weekend was Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them with an estimated $5M, off 52%, for a new domestic cume of $207.7M. Warner Bros. smashed the half-billion mark overseas this weekend as the international tally climbed to $509.8M putting the global haul at $717.5M. The wizard film may be able to cross the $800M mark over the holidays.Some major awards contenders followed after expanding their releases. The critically acclaimed Manchester By The Sea went from 366 to 1,208 locations and grossed an estimated $4.2M for a decent $3,440 average. The musical La La Land took its first big leap into broader release widening from five to 200 sites and collected an estimated $4M for a dazzling $20,100 average. Totals are $14M and $5.3M, respectively. Both earned Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture.The sci-fi drama Arrival fell 50% to an estimated $2.8M giving Paramount a stellar $86.5M. Doctor Strange took in an estimated $2M, down 55%, for a new cume of $226.1M for Disney. Rounding out the top ten was the dark thriller Nocturnal Animals which dropped 56% to an estimated $1.4M. Focus has banked $8.8M.Paramount platformed Denzel Washington’s new film Fences in four theaters and saw strong business grossing an estimated $128,000 for a solid $32,000 average. Reviews have been positive all around and the studio will go nationwide on Christmas Day.The top ten films grossed an estimated $201.5M which was down 33% from last year when Star Wars: The Force Awakens debuted at number one with an industry record $248M; but up 65% from 2014 when The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies opened in the top spot with $54.7M.Follow BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TIFF","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/18134202/rogueone5-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-rogue-one-launches-with-290m-global-debut"},{"id":"47509100541511","title":"Box Office: Rogue One Rings in 2017 at #1 Nearing $800M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Rogue One Rings in 2017 at #1 Nearing $800Mby Gitesh Pandya | January 2, 2017 |  CommentsFor the second straight time, the new year was kicked off with a Star Wars movie holding onto the number one spot in its third round of play. This time it was Rogue One which ruled the New Year’s holiday frame by grossing an estimated $64.3M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday span. The Disney smash hit dropped 33% from its four-day Christmas weekend gross and suffered the worst decline of any movie in the top ten this weekend.After 18 full days of release, Rogue One has amassed a stellar $439.7M making it the second largest domestic blockbuster from 2016 trailing only Disney stablemate Finding Dory which did $486.3M. The Death Star adventure was never expected to come close to the numbers posted by Star Wars: The Force Awakens from a year ago, but it did see more of a slowdown during the holiday season after the initial rush from opening weekend. Rogue One’s first frame was 38% lower than TFA’s but after 18 days of holiday play, the cume is now down 41% from the $750.2M that last year’s pic banked at the same point following the Christmas and New Year’s periods.With people heading back to work and school this week, grosses for all films will fall back to normal levels although many college students will still be off. The road ahead should see Rogue One get to around $480M after the coming weekend allowing it to surpass the $474.5M lifetime tally of 1999’s Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace which includes re-releases. It would then pass Dory to become the biggest North American movie from 2016 and end its run in the neighborhood of $550M which would be number six on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. A fantastic result for a spinoff film with mostly new characters.Overseas this weekend, Rogue One collected an estimated $45.8M through Sunday boosting the international total to $350M and the worldwide gross to $789.7M to date. Korea opened this weekend to $5.6M over five days which was a far cry from the $14.2M five-day launch in November for Fantastic Beasts. Rogue One‘s final market is China which opens this Friday. Force Awakens similarly opened there over the same January weekend a year ago on its way to a $124.2M take from that lucrative market. The final worldwide gross for Rogue looks to be on track for about $1.1 billion, or maybe a little more.As with the Christmas holiday session it was a two-picture marketplace, but this time the animated film Sing was only a small distance behind the latest Star Wars saga. Inching up 3% from a week ago, the Universal hit grossed an estimated haul of $56.4M which propelled the cume to a stunning $180M after only 13 days. A final in the area of $240M could result making it the fifth 2016 toon to break the $200M mark. Global stands at $277.8M.The Jennifer Lawrence-Chris Pratt space adventure Passengers remained in third place with an estimated $20.7M over four days dipping 9% from last weekend. Sony has banked $66M from North America and nearly $126M worldwide.Cracking the $400M global mark, Disney’s Moana rose up to fourth place in its sixth weekend with an estimated $14.3M rising 14% from its Christmas frame take. The island toon joined the double century mark and saw its domestic gross climb to $213.4M while $189.1M from overseas markets put the worldwide figure at $402.5M. Brazil and Korea open this month while Disney-loving Japan gets Moana in March. The worldwide tally should be able to go north of $600M.Fox finished fifth with the R-rated comedy Why Him? which fell 16% to an estimated $13M in its second weekend. Cume is $37.6M. Denzel Washington followed with his directorial and acting project Fences which took in an estimated $12.7M giving Paramount $32.4M to date. The four-day take was up 10% from last weekend, however it was only in wide release for two of the four days from the yuletide frame making for an unfair comparison.The high-profile awards contender La La Land grossed an estimated $12.3M from 750 locations and posted the best average in the top ten with $16,440. Lionsgate sits at $37M thus far with plenty more to go with Golden Globes being awarded this Sunday followed by Oscar nominations being announced in three weeks. Hitting $100M cannot be ruled out.Dropping 27% from its opening weekend was the action entry Assassin’s Creed with an estimated $10.9M over the long weekend. Fox has captured $41.9M to date. Audiences continued to sample the Oscar hopeful Manchester By The Sea which jumped up 27% to an estimated $5.5M with no addition of screens. Cume is $29.9M for Roadside Attractions which had a record high box office year in 2016 with this plus other indie hits.Rounding out the top ten was Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them which collected an estimated $5.4M, up 17%, for a new domestic cume of $225.4M. Overseas markets have contributed an extra $551.4M putting the wizarding pic at a towering $776.8M worldwide for the year, 71% from overseas, on its way past $800M with four more installments in the series still to come.Many awards contenders did solid business in limited or moderate release below the top ten. The Weinstein Co. saw Lion gross an estimated $2.9M from 525 sites for a $5,610 average and $6.8M total. Natalie Portman’s Jackie did an estimated $2M from 359 locations for a $5,571 average giving Fox Searchlight $7.5M so far. Fox’s NASA scientist pic Hidden Figures enjoyed the best average with an estimated $1.1M from only 25 locations for a sizzling $45,800 average and $2.6M overall ahead of its promising nationwide expansion this Friday into 2,300 locations.In platform release, the Mark Wahlberg starrer Patriots Day did an estimated $200,000 averaging a solid $28,571 from seven theaters for CBS Films and Lionsgate. A24 watched the Annette Bening film 20th Century Women debut to an estimated $146,000 from four houses for a potent $36,500 average. Silence from director Martin Scorsese grossed an estimated $110,000 from four locations for a $27,500 average for Paramount. All will expand this month.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pixar, LGBT, Christmas, Premiere, Out","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/02145304/600RogueOne4.jpg","slug":"box-office-rogue-one-2017"},{"id":"47509100559949","title":"Box Office: Fantastic Beasts Finds Its Way to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Fantastic Beasts Finds Its Way to #1Doctor Strange drops a notch, while coming-of-age comedy The Edge of Seventeen and boxing drama Bleed for This debut at #7 and #8.by Gitesh Pandya | November 20, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, Warner Bros. kicked off its new spinoff franchise with a large opening for the big-budget fantasy adventure Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them at number one, but also did not reach the heights of any of its previous Harry Potter films from the same Wizarding World universe. The new PG-13 film starring Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne debuted to an estimated $75M weekend from an ultrawide 4,144 theaters for a strong $18,098 average.The book that the new movie was based on was not as popular as the Potter series but did come from the same author, J.K. Rowling, and played as a prequel of sorts. So it was not expected to pull in every single fan of the Potter movies, but was looked at as being capable to attracting a substantial number of them. The first Potter opened this very same weekend 15 years ago and broke the all-time opening weekend record at the time with $90.3M on its way to $317.6M. Factor in the change in ticket prices since 2001, plus Beasts having 3D and IMAX options, and the new film sold roughly 45% fewer tickets in its first weekend. It also sold about 10% fewer opening weekend stubs as the first Twilight film from this same weekend eight years ago.For the last seven consecutive years, this weekend before Thanksgiving was used by studios to launch major literary sequels from the Potter, Twilight, and Hunger Games franchises, and all of them opened north of $100M. But by not being a true sequel, Fantastic Beasts may have better legs, as Warner hopes that many will find this film over the long holiday session. The studio has already planted its flags on this frame next year for its Justice League film and in 2018 for the next Fantastic Beasts film.Reviews have been terrific and the A grade from CinemaScore bodes well for positive buzz ahead. Studio data indicated that the audience for the 1920s-set pic was 55% female and 55% over 35. 11% of the gross came from its 388 IMAX screens.Beasts launched in most of the world this weekend and international saw a towering $143.3M debut from 63 markets putting the global opening at $218.3M. Leading the way were the U.K. with $18.3M over three days and Korea with $14.1M across five days. Next weekend will see big launches in the key markets of China and Japan. With a large production cost of $180M, plus a pretty penny for global marketing, a trajectory towards the $800M mark seems possible if it holds up moderately well in coming weeks.Doctor Strange dropped a spot to second place and declined by a steep 59% to an estimated $17.7M giving Disney $181.5M. The Benedict Cumberbatch hit has now grossed more than the Captain America, Thor, and Ant-Man origin films which all finished in the range of $176-181M domestic. Strange still has the turkey holiday week ahead so it may end its run with $225M or more which would beat the $206.4M of Thor: The Dark World which also had an early November launch.Overseas, Doctor Strange has boosted its total to $390M for a global gross of $571.5M. The last major market is Japan which opens in January so a final worldwide take of $700M+ may result. Leading all overseas markets is China which now stands at $103.2M which is more than what Batman v Superman did there earlier this year.Toon offering Trolls followed with an estimated $17.5M, down 50%, putting Fox and DreamWorks Animation at $116.2M to date. With $145.1M from overseas territories, the music-filled kidpic now has grossed $261.3M worldwide with major markets like Korea, Japan, and Australia still to open.The acclaimed sci-fi drama Arrival fell 51% to an estimated $11.8M putting Paramount at $43.4M to date for the $47M-budgeted film. A final of around $75M may result. Universal’s comedy Almost Christmas took in an estimated $7M, off 54%, for a $25.4M cume. War drama Hacksaw Ridge dropped 37% to an estimated $6.8M leaving Lionsgate at $42.9M.Strong reviews did little for the teen angst comedy The Edge of Seventeen which opened softly in seventh place with an estimated $4.8M from 1,945 locations for a mild $2,481 average. STX is hoping that good buzz from young adults will help the R-rated pic find its audience over the long holiday weekend ahead.Faring even worse in its opening weekend was the boxing pic Bleed for This which generated no interest from paying audiences. The R-rated film bowed to an estimated $2.4M from 1,549 sites for a weak $1,522 average. Reviews were mixed for the Open Road release.Sleeper hit The Accountant fell 52% to an estimated $2.1M for a cume to date of $81.3M for Warner Bros. Tied for tenth place with an estimated $1.6M a piece were the horror pic Shut In (off 56%) and indie darling Moonlight which expanded from 176 to 650 locations and averaged a mild $2,435. Totals now stands at $6M for EuropaCorp and $6.7M for A24.Some new players trying to establish themselves during awards season saw mixed results over the weekend. Sony expanded Ang Lee’s new film Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk from two exclusive engagements to 1,176 theaters nationwide but was met with indifference grossing an estimated $930,000 for a dismal average of $791. Reviews were not too positive.Focus debuted the Amy Adams-Jake Gyllenhaal film Nocturnal Animals in 37 theaters grossing an estimated $494,000 for a solid average of $13,351. The road ahead for the violent R-rated thriller includes an expansion Wednesday to 200 theaters for Thanksgiving and a nationwide roll-out on December 9. Reviews were generally good.After earning acclaim across the board from film critics, the Casey Affleck-Michelle Williams drama Manchester By The Sea debuted to spectacular results in its platform bow collecting an estimated $241,000 from four houses for a scorching $60,308 average. From Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions, the R-rated film scored the fourth biggest per-screen debut of 2016 helped in part by live Q&amp;As in L.A. by producer Matt Damon. Positive word-of-mouth, stellar reviews, and awards buzz are expected to keep this one going in the weeks ahead as it expands.The top ten films grossed an estimated $146.7M which was down 10% from last year when The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 debuted at number one with $102.7M; and down 21% from 2014 when The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 opened in the top spot with $121.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comedy, your, 21st, TV, universe, doctor, Emmys, Holidays, Television, Family, Countdown, worst, Netflix","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/20142543/Fantastic-Beasts-BO-Featured.jpg","slug":"box-office-fantastic-beasts-finds-its-way-to-1"},{"id":"47509102060127","title":"Box Office: Pets Overwhelms Ghostbusters to Retain Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Pets Overwhelms Ghostbusters to Retain Top SpotThe animated hit edged out the classic reboot by a little, and Bryan Cranston's new thriller slid into the eighth slot.by Gitesh Pandya | July 17, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;for the fifth straight week, an animated film topped the North American box office as Universal’s new blockbuster The Secret Life of Pets led all films in its sophomore frame with an estimated $50.6M. Down 52% from its massive debut, the PG-rated comedy has now banked a stellar $203.2M and is well on its way past the triple century mark. With summer playability, Pets even has a chance at finishing near the $341M of Disney’s spring smash Zootopia.The much-hyped reboot of Ghostbusters opened in second place but posted good results with an estimated $46M weekend from 3,963 theaters for a sturdy $11,607 average. It was the best opening of 2016 for a live-action comedy. Then again, most comedies do not carry budgets of $144M. The effects-driven pic headlined by Melissa McCarthy and Kristin Wiig saw new career highs for each in a lead role.Reviews were generally upbeat for the Sony adventure and audiences found it to be good, though not great. The CinemaScore was a B+. The film was met with plenty of criticism both when the project was announced and again when trailers debuted as many moviegoers did not like the idea of a new Ghostbusters with four women leading the way instead of four men.But looking at how the box office has performed this year, the performance was encouraging. Of the top ten opening weekends of 2016, only two are not cartoons or comic book movies. Those would be The Jungle Book at $103.3M and now Ghostbusters. In fact, breaking $40M on opening weekend has been very difficult all year for live-action movies outside of super hero flicks. Ten films did it at this point last year versus seven this year, plus Jungle Book, which is nearly all computer generated.Ghostbusters enjoyed only a 5% dip from Friday to Saturday which is better than what similar films see at this time of year. Business with kids kicked in despite intense competition for that age group this summer. Midweek playability could allow Ghostbusters to finish with a domestic gross that comes close to its production cost. International success would be needed to keep the franchise going with future installments. Ghostbusters rolled out overseas with $19.1M from a few major markets including $6.1M over seven days in the UK. Seven more top territories open across July and August.Reaching a milestone this weekend was the adventure film The Legend of Tarzan, which joined the century club after a weekend take of an estimated $11.1M, pushing the total to $103.1M. For Warner Bros. it is its third straight $100M+ grosser after The Conjuring 2 and Central Intelligence which comes as good news for the studio after so many misfires over the past 12 months.2016’s biggest domestic hit followed in fourth place. Pixar’s all-time top grosser Finding Dory fell 47% in its fifth lap to an estimated $11M pushing the cume to a sturdy $445.5M allowing it to break the twelve-year-old record for highest grossing animated film of all-time. Shrek 2 from DreamWorks Animation had held that milestone since 2004. Dory now is at number 11 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters while worldwide has vaulted to $721.7M.The raunchy comedy Mike &amp; Dave Need Wedding Dates failed to post a good sophomore hold, dropping 55% to an estimated $7.5M giving Fox just $31.3M to date. A $45-50M final may result. On the other hand, The Purge: Election Year is about to become the top-grossing installment in the three-film series. Universal saw an estimated $6.1M this weekend, down 51%, for a new sum of $71M, which is more than the $64.5M of The Purge, and it’s only days away from beating the $72M of The Purge: Anarchy.The top-grossing live-action comedy of the year so far, Central Intelligence, followed with an estimated $5.3M, giving Warner Bros. $117.5M to date. Bryan Cranston’s drug thriller The Infiltrator had a modest opening in eighth place with an estimated $5.3M from 1,600 locations for a $3,304 average. Cume for the Broad Green feature is $6.7M since the Wednesday start.The Steven Spielberg dud The BFG took ninth with an estimated $3.7M, off 52%, putting Disney at a troubling $47.3M. A finish well below the $77.6M of the director’s The Adventures of Tintin is assured. Independence Day: Resurgence rounded out the top ten tumbling 56% to an estimated $3.5M. After its fourth weekend, the sci-fi sequel still could not get over the $100M mark and sits at $98.5M which is less than what its predecessor grossed in its first full week of play twenty years ago.Woody Allen’s 1930s-set comedy Cafe Society opened to strong results in platform play grossing an estimated $355,000 from only five houses in New York and Los Angeles for a sparkling $71,000 average marking the best opening weekend average of 2016. That’s a big step up from his last film, Irrational Man, which averaged $25,045 in its limited debut on its way to a disappointing $4M final. It was the last of seven straight Allen films released by Sony Classics, as Cafe is being handled by Lionsgate and Amazon Studios. Next weekend, the well-reviewed film expands to 11 more markets before going nationwide on July 29 as it targets mature adults in a summer dominated by cartoons and super heroes.The top ten films grossed an estimated $150.1M which was down 16% from last year when Ant-Man opened at number one with $57.2M; but up 16% from 2014 when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes remained in the top spot with $36.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Land, Peek, Schedule, Network, Avengers, News, Rey, movies, dc, Paramount, HBO, high, comics","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/17162624/Secret-Life-Pets-BO.jpg","slug":"box-office-pets-overwhelms-ghostbusters-to-retain-top-spot"},{"id":"47509100574292","title":"Box Office: Miss Peregrine at Head of the Class","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Miss Peregrine at Head of the Classby Gitesh Pandya | October 2, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, director Tim Burton scored his first number one opening in over six years with the fantasy adventure Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children which debuted on top with an estimated $28.5M. The PG-13 film from Fox averaged a sturdy $8,092 from 3,522 theaters. Reviews were decent and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave a satisfactory B+ grade.Based on the best-selling novel, Miss Peregrine played to a more female audience at 59% while the split between those over and under 25 was even. With a production cost of over $100M, the adventure film posted a global debut weekend of $65M including a $36.5M international bow from 59 markets. Leading the way were Korea at $5.2M and the U.K. at $4.6M. 20 more markets are still to come next weekend including France, Russia, and Germany.Another new expensive film followed in second place. The disaster drama Deepwater Horizon opened to an estimated $20.6M from 3,259 theaters for a good $6,321 average. Lionsgate’s PG-13 pic anchored by Mark Wahlberg earned strong reviews from critics and did well with paying audiences too taking an A- grade from CinemaScore. The production cost was north of $110M.Like the recent hit Sully, Horizon takes a recent real-life American disaster from 6-7 years ago and turns it into a well-reviewed motion picture event anchored by a big Hollywood star as the hero who fights to overcome the odds and save lives. But the Tom Hanks pic performed much better opening to $35M. For Wahlberg, this was not even among his top ten career openings. Deepwater Horizon rolled out in a handful of international markets grossing an additional $12.4M including debuts in the U.K., Russia and Mexico.Following its top spot debut, The Magnificent Seven tumbled 55% to an estimated $15.7M boosting Sony’s cume to $61.6M. That was a larger drop than the 45% of Denzel Washington’s last film, The Equalizer, which the studio also released during the end of September. Seven should finish at or just below $100M domestic.The baby-delivery toon Storks enjoyed an encouraging 35% sophomore decline to an estimated $13.8M playing as the main option for younger children this weekend. With $38.8M in the bank for Warner Bros., a final of around $75M may result. Tom Hanks scored the 19th $100M+ domestic blockbuster of his career this weekend as Sully took in an estimated $8.4M, down 38%, for a $105.4M cume to date. The double Oscar winner has delivered such hits across four consecutive decades now starting with his first which was 1988’s Big.Crashing into sixth place was the new comedy Masterminds which was rejected by moviegoers opening to only $6.6M, according to estimates, from 3,042 locations for a weak $2,170 average. Relativity had this one bouncing around the calendar and the many delays did nothing to excite ticket buyers. Reviews were mostly negative for the PG-13 pic.Critics were all cheers for the chess drama Queen of Katwe but audiences spent an estimated $2.6M this weekend for its national expansion resulting in a soft $2,100 average from 1,242 theaters for Disney. Total is $3M. The horror hit Don’t Breathe kept on rocking slipping 37% in its sixth weekend in the top ten – a rare feat for a fright film. Sony collected an estimated $3.4M, pushing the sum to $84.7M, and could be headed for $90M.A couple of underperformers rounded out the top ten with drops of 50% each. Bridget Jones’s Baby grossed an estimated $2.3M for Universal while Open Road’s Snowden took in an estimated $2M. Disappointing cumes are $21M and $18.7M, respectively.In limited release, the new legal drama Denial got off to a nice start averaging $20,420 from five New York and Los Angeles theaters for a $102,000 weekend estimate. Bleecker Street will widen the PG-13 film starring Rachel Weisz next weekend into ten more markets. The critically-acclaimed teen drama American Honey delivered a good result in its platform debut averaging $18,843 from four locations in NY/LA. The R-rated film expands Friday into more cities before going national on October 14.The top ten films grossed an estimated $102.9M which was down 26% from last year when The Martian debuted at number one with $54.3M; and down 24% from 2014 when Gone Girl opened in the top spot with $37.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"police, women, Games, Certified, Acorn, OneApp, series","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/02152642/pere-rwep.jpg","slug":"box-office-miss-peregrine-at-head-of-the-class"},{"id":"47509102043735","title":"Box Office: Sully Soars to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Sully Soars to #1by Gitesh Pandya | September 11, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers were in the mood for an inspiring movie about an American hero starring one of the country’s most beloved actors as the Tom Hanks film Sully opened at number one with a terrific $35.5M, according to estimates. Directed by Clint Eastwood in his follow-up to the record-shattering American Sniper, the PG-13 film delivered the third best live-action debut ever in the month of September trailing just Insidious Chapter 2 and Sweet Home Alabama.Older moviegoers powered the success as studio data from Warner Bros. showed that the crowd was 80% over 35. Females made up 56% of the audience. Averaging a muscular $10,072 from 3,525 theaters including 375 IMAX runs, Sully powered ahead of the $25.7M debut of Captain Phillips from just three years ago. That was also a fall release about a likable American man in peril and legged its way to a $107.1M final which was over four times its opening weekend tally.Hanks also reached a new career milestone this weekend. With Sully, the double Oscar winner has now anchored number-one openings with his live-action movies across four straight decades. His only trip to the top so far this decade was with 2010’s Toy Story 3 and some of his big Hollywood offerings were misfires at the box office in recent years. This new film put on display the Hanks box office muscles of old.More awards contenders and star-driven films for adults will continue to roll out over the weeks ahead, but the road still looks bright for Sully. Reviews were fantastic and audiences agreed with critics giving the drama an A grade from CinemaScore. Plus older patrons do not rush out right away so there are plenty of people to still reach throughout this month.The thriller When the Bough Breaks debuted in second place with an estimated $15M from 2,246 locations for a solid $6,679 average. It was a strong performance for the $10M-budgeted film, but below the levels of past offerings Sony released recently on this same weekend targeting the same audience of African-American adults. Last year, The Perfect Guy bowed to $25.9M while No Good Deed debuted to $24.3M a year earlier. Both opened at number one. Studio data indicated that the crowd was 62% female and 61% over 25. Reviews for the PG-13 film came out after the film released and were dreadful.Scary movie sensation Don’t Breathe was bumped from the number one spot after a two-week reign but still held up pretty well considering it was coming off of a holiday frame. The Sony hit fell 48% to an estimated $8.2M lifting the incredible cume to $66.8M. A domestic final in the $80-85M range seems likely for the low-cost $10M production.After a stellar five-week run in the top two positions, Suicide Squad dropped to fourth with an estimated $5.7M. Off 43%, the DC bad guys raised the total up to $307.4M for Warner Bros on its way to a likely domestic final of roughly $320M.Squad opened in its final international market this weekend with a $3.6M two-day Saturday-Sunday launch in Japan. That was 65% higher than the $2.1M two-day debut of Guardians of the Galaxy this same weekend two years ago. The studio also reported that the Squad debut was roughly on par with both Deadpool and Batman v Superman there. However, those films opened on a Wednesday and a Friday respectively so it would not be apples-to-apples comparisons. Still, Suicide Squad has banked $392M overseas and a sturdy $699.4M worldwide and should shatter the $700M global mark on Monday – with $0 from China.Picking up just a few morsels from the back-to-school crowd, the new animated adventure The Wild Life failed to make a dent debuting to an estimated $3.4M from 2,493 locations for a weak $1,364 average. Reviews were lousy and consumer interest was never there for the Lionsgate release.More kidpics followed. Kubo and the Two Strings fell 49% to an estimated $3.2M pushing the cume to $40.8M for Focus. Disney’s Pete’s Dragon grossed an estimated $2.9M, off 54%, for a new sum of $70M.Films for grown-ups rounded out the top ten. STX’s sleeper comedy hit Bad Moms slipped 41% to an estimated $2.8M giving the raunchy ladies $107.5M to date. Dropping the same percentage was Hell or High Water with an estimated $2.6M and $19.8M to date. Sausage Party declined by 56% to an estimated $2.3M for a cume of $93.2M.No jokes need to be made about the title of the new horror film The Disappointments Room and its box office performance. The low-profile release from Relativity saw an estimated $1.4M this weekend from 1,554 locations for a dismal $901 average. It followed a summer full of scary movie hits.The top ten films grossed an estimated $81.7M which was identical to last year when The Perfect Guy debuted at number one with $25.9M; and up 11% from 2014 when No Good Deed opened in the top spot with $24.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Sneak, of, King, Paramount, black, VICE, song, worst, animated, TV, game, 2020, E!","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/11224510/Sully-BO.jpg","slug":"box-office-sully-soars-to-1"},{"id":"47509102052956","title":"Box Office: Bad Sells as Squad Sets Records","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Bad Sells as Squad Sets RecordsNine Lives Opens in Sixth Place.by Gitesh Pandya | August 7, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, audiences were craving bad guys (and gals) as the comic book film Suicide Squad shattered August box office records with a towering number one debut grossing an estimated $135.1M in its first frame. Warner Bros. rolled out its latest adventure from DC Comics into 4,255 theaters and averaged a scorching $31,752 per site.The opening began with $20.5M from Thursday night pre-shows starting at 6pm which led to a full opening day gross of $65.3M. Both soared past the old August records held by Guardians of the Galaxy of $11.2M and $37.8M, respectively. The Marvel anti-hero team also launched on the first weekend of August two years ago and hauled in $94.3M. It also held the old records for this month for biggest opening weekend and theater count. Suicide Squad broke those records too. This record weekend take was a healthy 43% higher than Guardians.Suicide Squad generated the third best opening weekend for all of 2016 behind fellow comic smashes Captain America: Civil War ($179.1M) and Batman v Superman ($166M) and edged out the $132.4M debut of Deadpool, another darker and more violent super hero blockbuster. Final grosses are to be released on Monday.Reviews were mostly negative for Suicide Squad but that did not stop fans from rushing out to see the newest story in the extended universe. Like with soap operas, DC and Marvel are making interlocking movies so fans need to see each film in order to enjoy the ongoing cinematic story. Next year will see Warners release Wonder Woman in June and Justice League in November before continuing with more solo films for various characters in the years ahead at a pace of two per year.It was an extremely front-loaded weekend for Squad. Saturday tumbled 41% to $38.8M while Sunday is projected by the studio to drop another 20% to $31M. The Saturday fall was even larger than the 38% for BvS which had the added benefit of having the Good Friday holiday on its opening day. Both DC films were met with weak reviews and started with 6pm Thursday pre-shows, though BvS had more well-known characters in it.Batman v Superman had a thunderous opening weekend but then collapsed in the following weeks. Its first frame represented a very high 50% of its final.&nbsp;Suicide Squad is playing out in similar fashion and winning the same kind of feedback from moviegoers, however its August play period should lead to better mid-week grosses since all schools are out. So a final domestic haul in the $275-300M range is possible which is still incredible. The production budget was about $175M.Comic book films have a built-in fan base that show up in theaters. But also contributing to the runaway success of Squad was the diversity of the cast which featured many women and actors of several ethnic backgrounds helping to create broad appeal. Studio data showed that females made up 46% of the crowd which is extraordinarily high for a comic book movie. 35-40% is the norm.For Will Smith, the former number one movie star on the planet, it was a new career best opening by far zooming ahead of the $77.2M of I Am Legend. In the eight years since Hancock (another super hero flick), Smith has struggled at the box office.Harley Quinn and pals earned a B+ CinemaScore grade which was relatively good. It was a notch above the B that BvS earned but below the A- of X-Men: Apocalypse. The marketing campaign executed by Warners was nothing short of brilliant. It did the impossible and made the teen and young adult crowd excited for its arrival. The 18-35 age group represented a stunning 48% of the audience.Suicide also ruled the international box office too despite going head-to-head with the start of the Rio Olympics. 57 markets tallied up a sturdy $132M making the global launch a sizable $267.1M with three major territories still to come. China has not given a greenlight yet for a release there, and it is possible that like&nbsp;Deadpool, it will not get to play there due to its harsh content not being allowed in.Matt Damon’s The Legend of Bagger Vance co-star stole away action audiences this weekend which prompted Jason Bourne to freefall by 62% in its second frame to an estimated $22.7M. Universal’s fifth installment of its lucrative spy series has grossed $103.4M to date and looks headed for a domestic final of around $160M. Global tally is now $195.3M.Suicide Squad’s weakest quadrant was older females and that demo still responded favorably to the comedy Bad Moms which enjoyed a great second weekend dipping only 40% to an estimated $14.2M. The $20M production has already grossed $51.1M and may end its run in the $80-90M range for STX.Animated sensation The Secret Life of Pets enjoyed a good hold declining by 39% to an estimated $11.6M in its fifth weekend. Universal has banked a superb $319.6M so far putting Pets at number 48 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Global broke the half-billion mark and rose to $502.2M.Sci-fi threequel Star Trek Beyond fell a sharp 59% as action fans left this weekend. The Paramount pic grossed an estimated $10.2M for a new cume of $127.9M as worldwide climbed to $194.4M.A blip on the radar came from new family comedy The Movie Where Kevin Spacey Turns Into A Cat&nbsp;which opened in sixth place with an estimated $6.5M from 2,264 locations for a mild $2,871 average. The PG-rated tale featuring Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Garner generated very little interest for EuropaCorp and was never expected to draw in much of a crowd.Off 44% to an estimated $6M was the horror pic Lights Out which has collected a sturdy $54.7M for Warner Bros. The teen thriller Nerve dipped 48% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.9M. Total for Lionsgate is $26.9M on its way to a $35-40M finish.Sony’s Ghostbusters fell 53% to an estimated $4.8M in its fourth round and has banked $116.7M to date from North America and $179.5M worldwide. The $250-300M range is where it may end up. The toon sequel Ice Age: Collision Course tumbled 61% to an estimated $4.3M putting Fox at a weak $53.5M so far. $288.1M is the worldwide gross with 81% coming from overseas markets and China still to come.The top ten films grossed an estimated $220.3M which was up 95% from last year when Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation stayed at number one with $28.5M; and up 30% from 2014 when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened in the top spot with $65.6M.Compared to projections, Suicide Squad opened somewhat higher than my $128M forecast while Nine Lives was on target with my $6M prediction.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Apple, kids, black, The, of, Watching, strong, CBS, Creative, BBC","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/08115258/ss-600.jpg","slug":"box-office-bad-sells-as-squad-sets-records"},{"id":"47509102048858","title":"Box Office: Suicide Squad Threepeats","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Suicide Squad ThreepeatsOf the Three New Wide Releases, Dogs Exceeds Expectations While Kubo and Ben-Hur Fail to Compete.by Sujit Chawla | August 21, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;Suicide Squad became the fifth film to take the top spot three weeks in a row this year, while a trio of new films met with decent to mediocre openings.The top two positions were a repeat from last weekend, with the Warner Bros. collection of misfit toys, Suicide Squad, remaining at number one for a third straight week shooting up an estimated $20.7M, bringing its cume to $262.3M. Internationally it has raised $310.4M for a worldwide total of $572.7M to date. The anthropomorphic grocery store saga Sausage Party ate up an estimated $15.3M in its second weekend, a drop of 55%, bringing its cume up to $65M on a budget of around $20M which means a sequel should be right around the corner. It has an outside shot of hitting $100M but will likely fall just a bit short.Three new opening films took spots three through five and while they were within three million dollars of each other, one of them was hugely disappointing. In third place was War Dogs, starring Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, which took in an estimated $14.3M from 3,256 theaters for a per screen average of $4,389. With a CinemaScore of a B and middling reviews, don’t look for this one to last very long.Fourth place belonged to the animated Kubo and the Two Strings which took in an estimated $12.6M from 3,260 theaters for a per screen average of $3,868. Reviews have been amongst the best of the year, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 96% positive, and a CinemaScore of an A, which means critics and audiences are digging what they’re seeing. This one may have some legs over the next few weeks.In fifth place was the critically maligned remake of a 1959 classic, Ben-Hur, which took in $11.35M this weekend, according to estimates, from 3,084 theaters for a per screen average of $3,680. Considering its estimated budget is $100M, this has to be considered a massive flop for Paramount, which they should be getting used to this year. CinemaScore was a solid A- so the people who went to see it liked it, just not enough of them were interested in going to the theaters.Sixth place belonged to Pete’s Dragon which slipped 47% in its second go around, picking up an additional $11.33M this weekend, according to estimates. Its total now stands at $43M, a rare misstep for the Disney juggernaut this year, though with four films making over $900M worldwide this year, don’t feel too bad for them. Look for a final total in the $70M range.A few Bad Moms took seventh place, dropping a very slim 29% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $8M, bringing its total up to a robust $85.8M. Eighth place belonged to Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne which took in an estimated $8M, bringing its cume up to $140.9M after four weeks.The runaway hit of the back half of the summer has been The Secret Life of Pets which landed in ninth place this weekend with an estimated $5.7M, bringing its total up to an astounding $346M, surpassing Disney’s Zootopia to become the fifth highest grossing film of the year domestically. Rounding out the top 10 was Florence Foster Jenkins which fell a reasonable 35% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.3M, bringing its cume up to $14.4M.The top 10 films grossed an estimated $111.7M, which was up 31% from 2015 when Straight Outta Compton remained at number one with $26.3M; and up 15% from 2014 when Guardians of the Galaxy jumped back into the top spot in its fourth weekend with $17.2M.Compared to projections, War Dogs came in above Gitesh’s $9M projection while Kubo and the Two Strings and Ben-Hur came in below his $16M and $10M respective forecasts.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"talk, El, harry, Vudu, Wars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/21120201/suic-new-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-suicide-squad-threepeats"},{"id":"47509102058078","title":"Box Office: Star Trek Warps Into #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Star Trek Warps Into #1 SpotChiller Lights Out Exceeds Box Office Expectationsby Gitesh Pandya | July 24, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;50 years later and audiences are still lining up to see the Kirk-Spock bromance. Paramount topped the North American box office with this summer’s latest sequel Star Trek Beyond, the 13th film in the decades-old sci-fi franchise. The PG-13 adventure took in an estimated $59.6M over the weekend which fell below the marks of its two predecessors. IMAX screens represented a sturdy 14% of the gross. 2009’s reboot Star Trek debuted to $79.2M while the follow-up Into Darkness opened to $70.2M. Both were directed by J.J. Abrams who then left to direct the last Star Wars movie. Justin Lin, following four chapters of the Fast &amp; Furious series, came in to helm Beyond.With most big sequels seeing audience erosion this year, the drop seen by Beyond is not too bad. Saturday saw only a 7% dip from opening day. That is an encouraging figure for a sci-fi threequel opening in summer as the business is generally frontloaded. Plus an A- CinemaScore shows that fans are generally pleased with the latest saga. Reviews were quite positive too. Paramount has given a strong marketing push and has tied into the promotional hype for the 50th anniversary of the franchise. The iconic TV series began airing in 1966.With three of the four months of the summer movie season almost over, Star Trek Beyond has posted the third best opening weekend for any live-action film this entire season. The only bigger ones were from the comic book movies Captain America: Civil War ($179.1M) and X-Men: Apocalypse ($65.8M). Many high-profile summer offerings have underperformed this year and these three films are the only ones to break $50M on opening weekend, for live-action pictures. The “can’t-miss” factor has been missing from so many films this summer. A rebound could be coming with next weekend’s Jason Bourne followed a week later by the buzzworthy Suicide Squad which is generating tremendous heat.Star Trek Beyond opened to $30M from 37 international markets representing a 14% drop from Into Darkness in the same territories. Most major markets which did not open this frame will launch around when the Summer Olympics end, or beyond.Universal settled for second place with its hit toon The Secret Life of Pets which collected an estimated $29.3M in its third weekend, off a moderate 42%. The cume rose to $260.7M surpassing both Despicable Me and The LEGO Movie and will soon join the triple century club. Worldwide is at $323.7M now.This summer’s string of horror hits continued with the new chiller Lights Out which exceeded expectations to open with an estimated $21.6M from 2,818 locations for a strong $7,665 average. The PG-13 pic earned very good reviews and was powered by young women at the box office. Studio data from Warner Bros. shows that 54% were female and 74% were under 35 including 37% under 18. The CinemaScore grade was a B which was good for this genre indicating customers were pretty happy with what they paid for. With a small $5M budget, Lights Out may end its domestic run at over ten times its production cost.The much-talked-about reboot Ghostbusters fell 53% in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $21.6M. That was a normal decline for a sci-fi summer pic in its sophomore frame with another new sci-fi franchise flick opening against it. Sony has banked $86.9M to date and looks to end in the $140M range. Given the $144M production cost plus the marketing push, a healthy run internationally is what the studio hopes for.Ice Age: Collision Course, the fifth installment in the 14-year-old toon franchise, showed its age with an opening weekend of an estimated $21M. It was the first time that the series did not break $40M in the first weekend. The last chapter, Continental Drift, also launched in mid-July but saw a stronger $46.6M opening weekend in 2012. Collision averaged just $5,450 from 3,963 locations and earned terrible reviews. With domestic audiences spending a towering $721M over the past six weeks on Pets and Finding Dory, only few needed another toon to see.But North America has been a lesser priority for this franchise as global sales have been spectacular over the years and that is what prompted another film.&nbsp;Drift grossed an eye-popping $718M from international markets which accounted for a whopping 82% of the worldwide tally. With earlier openings around the world, Collision now sits at $200M worldwide with only 11% coming from North America, plus China is still to come.Finding Dory climbed its way into the all-time domestic top ten this weekend after grossing an estimated $7.2M in its sixth frame, off only 36%, for a new total of $460.2M. The Pixar smash surpassed Disney stablemate Avengers: Age of Ultron to take the number nine spot all-time. A finish in the $485-500M range seems likely. Global stands at $781.7M.The Legend of Tarzan dropped 44% to an estimated $6.4M for $115.8M to date for Warner Bros. Fox’s comedy Mike &amp; Dave Need Wedding Dates slipped 43% to an estimated $4.4M taking in just $40.4M overall.The documentary Hillary’s America expanded nationwide after its platform bow a week ago and jumped into the top ten with an estimated $3.7M from 1,217 locations for a mild $3,040 average. Rounding out the top ten was the Bryan Cranston film The Infiltrator with an estimated $3.3M, down only 38%, for a new cume of $12.2M for Broad Green.The top ten films grossed an estimated $178.2M which was up 29% from last year when Ant-Man stayed at number one with $24.9M; and up 35% from 2014 when Lucy opened in the top spot with $43.9M.Compared to projections, Star Trek and Ice Age came in below my respective predictions of $66M and $32M while Lights Out opened well ahead of my forecast of $12M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"elevated, TruTV, singing, Disney, TV, Shudder, scary, e., Comic-Con, Musical, Wars","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/24133540/star-trek-1400-1-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-star-trek-warps-into-1-spot"},{"id":"47509102062176","title":"Box Office: Pets Jets Past $100M on Opening Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Pets Jets Past $100M on Opening Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | July 10, 2016 |  CommentsPeople sure do love pets. Universal clobbered the North American box office with the colossal opening for its new animated comedy&nbsp;The Secret Life of Pets which exceeded industry expectations to capture an estimated $103.2M over the weekend. It was the sixth largest debut of all-time for an animated film, and the best ever for an original toon beating the $90.4M of last summer’s Inside Out.Led by a stellar voice cast that includes stand-up superstars Louis C.K. and Kevin Hart, the PG-rated smash from Universal averaged a muscular $23,609 from an ultrawide 4,370 theaters. Reviews were upbeat and the opening weekend came in well ahead of the $75.1M of Disney’s original animated animal hit&nbsp;Zootopia from March. Pets also accounted for nearly half of all box office sales for this entire weekend.Word-of-mouth is good which should lead to a bright road ahead over the summer weeks to come when kids are out of school and need something to do seven days a week. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A- and the Friday-to-Saturday dip was only 4%. That compares with the 16% this same weekend last year for the spinoff Minions and the 10% for Inside Out. The studio is projecting a 24% decline on Sunday which is in line with how these films may perform at this time of year.Universal put a giant marketing push behind Pets hitting up families and non-families alike for months. It reminded audiences that this new offering was from one of the directors of the first two Despicable Me movies which were both runaway successes. The studio went through the entire first half of the year without a single $100M+ grosser, but now finally got one after just a single weekend. And with a $75M budget, Pets will certainly be one of the more profitable films among the year’s biggest titles. Becoming the seventh film this year to break $300M domestic is certainly possible.Overseas, Pets has grossed over $30M in the U.K. after its third weekend for an international cume of $42.6M from a few markets. 57 more territories are still to open over the next three months and in most places it will release after Ice Age: Collision Course which has already begun its global roll-out with $57.7M to date.The big-budget adventure film The Legend of Tarzan held up well in its second swing and stayed in the number two spot with an estimated $20.6M. Off a reasonable 47% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last week’s holiday opening, the Warner Bros. release has banked a solid $81.4M to date. A healthy domestic final of $140-150M may result. The global total is $135.4M with a handful of major markets still to open including China next week on July 19.After three weeks on top with muscular numbers, Finding Dory slipped to third place and took a 51% hit thanks to families shifting their attention to some new talking animated creatures. The fish sequel took in an estimated $20.4M to boost its domestic cume to a robust $422.6M making it the highest-grossing film in North America this year soaring past the $406.2M of Disney stablemate Captain America: Civil War.Dory has also beaten the $415M of Toy Story 3 to become Pixar’s all-time number one champ. The computer animation pioneer will stick with its formula of mid-June sequels with Cars 3 next summer, Toy Story 4 the following year, and The Incredibles 2 in 2019. It has even staked out a June 2020 weekend for an untitled film. Currently, Finding Dory sits at number 16 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Another $29.7M was captured overseas this weekend for Dory boosting the offshore total to $220.2M and the global gross to $642.8M. Korea opened well to $7.1M marking the best debut ever there for any Pixar film. Many key territories have yet to open including Mexico, Japan, and the U.K. which all launch later this month plus Italy and Germany which bow in September. Finding Dory is still on course to break $1 billion worldwide. Notably, its China gross is at $38.1M after its fourth weekend which is substantially below the mammoth $235.6M that Disney grossed there with Zootopia a couple of months ago.The raunchy comedy Mike &amp; Dave Need Wedding Dates debuted to moderate results in fourth place with an estimated $16.6M opening weekend from 2,982 locations for a $5,567 average. Fox’s R-rated pic starring Zac Efron and Anna Kendrick earned mixed reviews and played to a young adult crowd. Moviegoers are liking, but not loving the film. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B while audience demos show females leading with 52% and the split being even between those under and over age 25.Bucking the trend for most sequels this year, The Purge: Election Year has amassed a higher gross after its second weekend than its predecessors. The R-rated thriller fell a sharp 63% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $11.7M pushing its cume to $58.1M. Both previous Purge films were at just under $52M after their second weekends. The low-cost $10M production should reach about $80M by the end of its North American run and spawn another chapter for Universal.Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson crossed the $100M mark with Central Intelligence which grossed an estimated $8.1M, off just 35%, for a $108.3M total for Warner Bros. Still struggling to reach that milestone after its third weekend was Independence Day: Resurgence which fell 54% to an estimated $7.7M for $91.5M to date. Worldwide, IDR is now at $305.8M with 70% coming from international markets.Steven Spielberg’s fantasy epic The BFG got hammered at the box office tumbling 60% from its disappointing opening weekend. The Disney release grossed an estimated $7.6M and has banked a mere $38.7M to date heading for a final of $55-60M. Among wide releases that play in 1,500+ theaters, that would be the lowest gross of his entire illustrious career and follows the $72.3M of last fall’s Bridge of Spies which also ranked among the lowest ever for his career. BFG&nbsp;failed to find a place in the market this summer with kids flocking to Dory and Pets while older children went for Tarzan.The shark attack thriller The Shallows followed with an estimated $4.8M, down 45%, for a $45.8M cume for Sony. Salman Khan’s Sultan scored the biggest Bollywood opening of this year and landed in tenth place with an estimated $2.2M from 283 locations for a solid $7,830 average. The cume for Yash Raj since its Wednesday launch is $3.2M.Among notable summer sequels below the top ten, The Conjuring 2 is about to join the $100M club with $99.4M to date and will cross the triple-century mark worldwide soon with $292M global so far. The horror sequel cost only $40M to produce. X-Men: Apocalypse is closing out its run and sits now at $154.5M after its sixth weekend which is still less than the $157.3M of the first X-Men from the summer of 2000 when tickets cost much less. Captain America: Civil War is now up to $406.2M and should finish just behind the $409M of Iron Man 3, but well ahead of the $259.8M of The Winter Soldier.The top ten films grossed an estimated $202.9M which was dead even with last year when Minions opened at number one with $115.7M; and up a sharp 52% from 2014 when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes debuted in the top spot with $72.6M.Compared to projections, The Secret Life of Pets opened well ahead of my $72M forecast and Mike &amp; Dave Need Wedding Dates debuted close to my $18M prediction.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Fresh, Polls, Originals","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10143225/pets-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-pets-jets-past-100m-on-opening-weekend"},{"id":"47509103599206","title":"Box Office: X-Men Tops, Alice Flops Over Sluggish Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: X-Men Tops, Alice Flops Over Sluggish Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | May 30, 2016 |  CommentsHollywood studios programmed two big-budget sequels over the Memorial Day holiday frame and audiences responded with smaller spending than for the films’ predecessors.Opening at number one was the super hero epic X-Men: Apocalypse&nbsp;with an estimated $80M over the long Friday-to-Monday holiday session averaging $19,277 over four days from 4,150 locations. While easily enough to win the weekend, it was 28% below the opening performance of the last film in the X-Men series – Days of Future Past which bowed to $110.6M over the same four-day holiday weekend two years ago. That film featured both old and new casts together and brought back original director Bryan Singer after a decade-long absence. Apocalypse was more of a stand-alone adventure that was typical for the genre.The Friday-to-Sunday portion was $65.3M. Looking at the nine-film mutant franchise that Fox has had over the past 16 years, Apocalypse had the sixth best opening weekend. In terms of actual tickets sold, it ranks seventh out of nine. The new PG-13 film sold approximately 25% fewer tickets on opening weekend than the first X-Men in July of 2000.Reviews for the new mutant saga were not too strong and were a far cry from the raves received by DOFP. Also, movie fans have already spent over $1 billion on a trio of comic book movies this year so some may not have felt the need for a fourth one in under five months. Studio data showed that the audience was 62% male and 55% over 25. Despite five major roles for women in the cast, the female share of the crowd was relatively low. The CinemaScore grade was a good A-.Given how front-loaded a super hero sequel launching over a holiday weekend can be, the final domestic haul may reach the neighborhood of $170M. That would be less than what Deadpool&nbsp;made in its first six days and less than what Captain America: Civil War grossed in its first three.Overseas markets, as usual, are being counted on to deliver healthy returns. X-Men: Apocalypse launched a week ago in many markets and debuted in a new key one this time. A total of 79 territories delivered $55.3M this weekend led by Korea’s $12.1M opening. The U.K. is the top grosser with $17.5M to date after its sophomore frame. The overseas cume is now $185.8M and global stands at $266M with China opening next weekend and Japan coming in August.&nbsp;Apocalypse reportedly cost $178M to produce and a final global take of $550-600M is possible. Next up, another Wolverine film is on the calendar for March 3 next year.Johnny Depp’s career met with another setback this weekend with the disastrous performance of his latest big-paycheck project Alice Through the Looking Glass which bowed to only $34.2M over four days, according to estimates. The three-day portion of $27M represents a staggering 77% plunge from the $116.1M opening weekend of 2010’s Alice in Wonderland which was a monster 3D hit grossing over $1 billion globally prompting those involved to get another installment made. Audiences were not part of that discussion as consumer interest was never very high for this new chapter despite a pricey marketing push over the last several weeks.If there is any studio that can shake off a bomb right now it’s Disney which has already grossed over $1 billion domestic from a trio of hits that are all still in the top ten right now. Looking Glass is on track for a final domestic total of near $80M. That would be even below the studio’s past big-budget summer bombs&nbsp;The Lone Ranger&nbsp;starring Depp, Prince of Persia, and George Clooney’s Tomorrowland&nbsp;which bowed this same weekend last year to $42.7M over four days. Finals were $89.3M, $90.8M and $93.4M, respectively.With a reported budget of over $170M, the new Alice had a demo breakdown of 57% female and 56% over 25. 41% of the gross came from 3D screens. 43 international territories delivered a $65M opening weekend overseas for a global launch of $93.1M through Sunday. China led the field with a strong $27.1M but all others posted openings of $5M or less. France, Japan, and Korea are the key markets that have not yet opened.Reviews were mostly negative for this new Alice. The novelty of a fairy tale coming to the big screen, plus 3D technology, helped Alice in Wonderland score the sixth biggest opening weekend of all-time back in March of 2010 – and highest ever for a non-sequel. Tim Burton directed and Depp acted and that combo was a huge draw.But since then numerous fairy tales have been turned into live-action films and the recent sequel The Huntsman: Winter’s War has been a major underperformer generating no interest. Depp has also had many flops in recent years and is not the exciting star he once was. Add in news breaking on the film’s opening day of his alleged domestic abuse and there was little reason for large crowds to come out. On the bright side, those who did come out were fairly pleased with the film. It earned an A- CinemaScore grade.Following red hot box office attendance this year from January through April, May is now closing up as a month when most films performed below industry expectations. Studios are crossing their fingers hoping that June titles excite moviegoers just as kids start getting out of school for summer vacations. That will be vital to having ticket buyers see trailers and posters for this year’s upcoming movies.The game-inspired toon The Angry Birds Movie suffered a steep decline in the second weekend falling to an estimated $24.5M giving Sony $72.2M to date. The three-day portion saw a hefty 51% drop. The last major animated film to open this same way was Shrek Forever After in 2010 which dropped 39% on its sophomore frame which was Memorial Day weekend.Captain America: Civil War eroded to an estimated $19.7M over the long weekend pushing the domestic haul to $377.2M allowing the jumbo pack of super heroes to surpass Deadpool to become the highest-grossing film in North America in 2016. Civil War is now running 8% behind the pace of Avengers: Age of Ultron and only 1% ahead of Iron Man 3 which ended its run at $409M. International for the new Cap rose to $730.7M for a new global take of $1.1 billion.The comedy sequel Neighbors 2 fell sharply in its second round to an estimated $11.2M putting Universal at $40.4M. Disney’s smash hit The Jungle Book&nbsp;fell to an estimated $9.2M for a new total of $340.7M. It stands at $880M worldwide now.Disappointing star-driven films aimed at mature adults followed. The Nice Guys dropped to an estimated $8.1M for a new cume of $23.5M for Warner Bros. Sony’s Money Monster grossed an estimated $5.4M for a cume to date of $35M.The critically acclaimed Jane Austen costume drama Love &amp; Friendship rose to ninth place with an estimated $3.1M expanding to 493 theaters for a good $6,288 average across four days. Cume is $4.1M for Roadside Attractions. Still in the top ten for a 13th weekend in a row was the Disney toon hit Zootopia&nbsp;with an estimated $1.1M.

Even when they’re fighting amongst themselves. The summer blockbuster season kicked off in style with the thunderous debut of Marvel’s Captain America: Civil War which grossed an estimated $181.8M making it the fifth largest opening weekend in box office history. Disney’s latest moneymaker averaged a spectacular $43,017 from 4,226 locations.Compared to past Captain America films, Civil War nearly doubled the $95M debut weekend for the last installment, 2014’s The Winter Soldier, and nearly tripled the $65.1M bow of 2011’s The First Avenger. This new film was different as it brought together numerous heroes under one roof making it feel more like an Avengers sequel than a Captain America one. Civil War features the super soldier at odds against Iron Man with the rest of the characters taking sides leading to an epic six-on-six battle. The third movie incarnation of Spider-Man was introduced which was a first since that character had only been in separate films from Sony before.The super hero team just had their own film 52 weeks ago. Avengers: Age of Ultron opened this very weekend last year to kickoff Summer 2015 and bowed to a humongous $191.3M which at the time was the second best of all-time behind the $207.4M of the first Avengers from 2012. Four of the five biggest opening weekends ever have come within the past 12 months. They are Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($248M), Jurassic World ($208.8M), Avengers, Ultron, and Civil War. Bumped down to sixth is Iron Man 3 with $174.1M in 2013. Given three years of ticket price increases, Civil War and Iron Man 3 both sold the same number of tickets on opening weekend – roughly 21 million. Compared to Ultron, Civil War opened 5% lower.For Captain America: Civil War‘s weekend, things kicked off on Friday with $75.3M including $25M from Thursday pre-shows beginning at 7pm. It was the eighth biggest opening day ever. Saturday slipped 19% to $61.1M while Mother’s Day Sunday is projected by the studio to drop another 26% to about $45.4M. Sunday drops for the last times that Mother’s Day fell on the summer kickoff weekend when Marvel was opening a new super hero flick include 28% for 2011’s Thor and 32% for 2010’s Iron Man 2.Disney reported audience data which showed a predictable crowd for a comic book movie. The PG-13 pic attracted an audience that was 59% male and 57% over 25. A terrific A grade from CinemaScore indicated that paying moviegoers enjoyed what they got. Both Ultron and Winter Soldier earned the same grade. The next two weekends do not see any similar action offerings coming so the road ahead should be good, though movies this deep into a franchise tend to draw in their fan base upfront.Super hero movies have been on fire this year. Civil War opened bigger than February’s Deadpool ($132.4M) and March’s rival smackdown epic Batman v Superman from DC Comics ($166M). Next up is Fox’s X-Men: Apocalypse over Memorial Day weekend this month followed by DC’s Suicide Squad on August 5 and Marvel’s Doctor Strange on November 4.This is the tenth straight year that Marvel super heroes dominated the first weekend of May. Since 2007’s Spider-Man 3, the comic giant has seen its characters kickoff summer on this lucrative weekend with films released by Sony, Fox, Paramount, and Disney. Marvel has no intention of giving up this prime real estate having already planted its heroic flag on 2017 with Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 followed by Avengers: Infinity War Part I in 2018, then Part II in 2019, and an untitled movie for 2020 which is just on the calendar to scare away competitors. You can guess who will eventually claim 2021.IMAX theaters grossed a hefty $31.3M globally pushing the cume from those screens to $45M. North America captured $16M from 380 sites while China amassed $10M from 283.Civil War broke out all over the world as the rest of the major markets opened this weekend along with the U.S. The whole weekend brought in $220M from international markets boosting the offshore total to $496.6M and the global gross to a stunning $678.4M on its way past the $1 billion mark, possibly next weekend. China led the way with an explosive $95.8M opening weekend which already makes it the top overseas market for the film by far.Disney wasn’t satisfied with number one and held the number two spot as well with its adventure hit The Jungle Book which fell an understandably large 50% to an estimated $21.9M in its fourth weekend. Captain America attracted kids of all ages so the PG-rated pic from Iron Man director Jon Favreau saw its biggest decline to date, but still watched its cume soar to an incredible $285M. With an additional $491.2M from overseas markets, Jungle Book has now taken in a stellar $776.2M across the world.Open Road is projecting a Mother’s Day uptick on Sunday for Mother’s Day. The all-star pic will gross an estimated $9M for the weekend, up 8% thanks to the holiday, for a cume of $20.7M. A final gross of around $35M seems likely for the comedy starring Lancôme brand ambassador Julia Roberts, Almay pitchwoman Kate Hudson, and Aveeno and Emirates brand ambassador Jennifer Aniston.Scraps filled up the rest of the top ten with under $4M each. Universal’s big-budget bomb The Huntsman: Winter’s War tumbled 63% to an estimated $3.6M for $40.4M to date and $146.3M global. The kitten comedy Keanu fell 67% in its sophomore outing to an estimated $3.1M as its adult male audience was stolen away giving Warner Bros. $15.1M.Zootopia was one of the only holdovers in the top ten to not freefall. The Disney smash collected an estimated $2.7M in its tenth weekend, down 50%, for a new domestic haul of $327.6M passing Batman v Superman for number 42 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Worldwide, the bunny flick has amassed a giant $956.4M.More steep drops followed. Barbershop: The Next Cut fell 56% to an estimated $2.7M for Warner Bros. while fellow comedy The Boss stumbled 59% to an estimated $1.8M for Universal. Cumes are $48.8M and $59.1M, respectively.Destroyed in its second weekend, the animated flop Ratchet &amp; Clank dropped a sharp 70% to an estimated $1.5M giving Focus a dismal $7.1M to date. With comic book fans abandoning it, Batman v Superman tumbled 73% to an estimated $1M for a cume of $327.3M putting it at number 43 on the all-time domestic list. Worldwide, Dawn of Justice sits at a sturdy $865M.On the specialty scene, the adult comedy A Bigger Splash enjoyed a good debut, with an estimated $110,000 from just five locations for a solid $22,000 average for Fox Searchlight. Starring Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, and Dakota Johnson, the R-rated pic earned positive reviews and will expand to five more markets this Friday. Cume since the Wednesday opening is $134,000.The top ten films grossed an estimated $229M which was up 2% from last year’s summer kickoff weekend when Avengers: Age of Ultron opened at number one with $191.3M; and up 62% from 2014’s kickoff when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 debuted in the top spot with $91M.Follow&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com on twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Films, cops, books","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/08160418/civil-war1.jpg","slug":"box-office-all-roads-lead-to-civil-war"},{"id":"47509103597157","title":"Box Office: Mutant Ninja Turtles Bump Marvel Muties For #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Mutant Ninja Turtles Bump Marvel Muties For #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | June 5, 2016 |  CommentsTurtle Power was back as the adventure sequel Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows claimed the number one spot with an opening of an estimated $35.3M. The long-running franchise has had a total of six films open across 26 years and every one debuted in the top spot.The newest PG-13 movie opened 46% below the opening weekend of its 2014 predecessor which rebooted the property for Paramount. It’s the latest of four major summer sequels over the last three weeks to open significantly behind its previous installment. Next weekend sees The Conjuring 2 and Now You See Me 2 possibly joining that list.TMNT2 posted a solid $8,659 average from 4,071 locations this weekend including IMAX and 3D screens. Reviews were negative, but that has usually been the case for this brand. Studio data showed that the crowd was 54% male and 52% under 25. The production budget was a reported $135M.Overseas, it launched to $34M from 40 markets including only three of the majors. Other key territories are sprinkled across the summer including Korea and Brazil later this month, China and Italy in July, and Germany and Japan in August. Reaching a global gross that triples its production budget remains possible.The non-turtle mutant sequel X-Men: Apocalypse got punished in its second weekend tumbling a steep 66% to an estimated $22.3M giving Fox $116.5M. While a sharp fall, it fits into the range this franchise has seen in the past when sequels were launched over the Memorial Day holiday frame. 2014’s Days of Future Past (which earned terrific reviews) dropped 64% while 2006’s The Last Stand crashed 67%.But the ten-day start puts Apocalypse 28% behind the pace of DOFP and 34% behind Last Stand which both ended up with roughly $234M in North America. Given the road ahead, the new X-Men looks to finish at roughly $160M domestic which would be less than what Batman v Superman collected in just its opening weekend. Also, that would only be marginally above the $157.3M of the first X-Men film from 16 years ago when ticket prices were significantly less and no 3D or premium-large-format options were available to boost grosses.International markets brought good news for Apocalypse which collected an estimated $84.4M this weekend including a huge $59M opening weekend from China. Holdover markets fell by 52% which is reasonable for a super hero threequel. Overseas markets have grossed $286M with worldwide sitting at $402.5M now. The global gross should find its way north of $600M.Women not interested in seeing fighting mutants (in turtle or human form) turned out in impressive numbers for the romance Me Before You which enjoyed a healthy opening weekend with an estimated $18.3M from 2,704 theaters for a sturdy $6,757 average. Based on the best-selling novel, the PG-13 film earned lackluster reviews but instead excited its target audience with, among other things, a great trailer that sparked interest.Warner Bros. research showed that the audience was overwhelmingly female at 81%. 53% were under 35. Me Before You scored a very good A grade from CinemaScore and is generating positive word-of-mouth with moviegoers. With little direct competition in the weeks ahead, this one could sail on to find very encouraging sales this summer.Following its dismal debut, the Johnny Depp sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass fell sharply in its second weekend dropping 60% to an estimated $10.7M. The big-budget Disney project has grossed only $50.8M which is a whopping 76% below the $209.3M of 2010’s Alice in Wonderland after its second weekend. Don’t expect any more Mad Hatter pics. The current trajectory puts Looking Glass on course to finish its domestic run in the $70-75M range which would be below past pricey Disney duds like The Lone Ranger, Tomorrowland, and possibly even John Carter. Global sits at $176.3M including a solid $49.5M in China which is the only overseas market truly rocking on this one. The film plunged 76% in its second weekend there so it has only so much more left to extract from that key market.Falling a reasonable 48% from the holiday frame was Sony’s The Angry Birds Movie with an estimated $9.8M lifting the cume to $86.7M. Worldwide total is now over $280M.2016’s top-grossing blockbuster Captain America: Civil War took in an estimated $7.6M dropping 51% on its fifth weekend. The Disney cume is now $388.9M domestic putting it at number 23 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters right behind Frozen. The third Captain America is on target to end its North American run right at the same level as Iron Man 3‘s $409M. With the international run closing up soon, Civil War has now amassed a fantastic $1.13 billion worldwide, including a stellar $190.2M in China which is twice what Batman v Superman grossed there. The Marvel smash should finish at just under $1.2 billion global.Universal followed with a pair of R-rated comedies. Neighbors 2 dropped 50% to an estimated $4.7M for a total of $48.6M. The studio’s new Andy Samberg pic Popstar was utterly rejected by paying audiences opening poorly in eighth place with an estimated $4.6M from a nationwide bow in 2,311 locations for a lousy $2,004 average. Critics were pleased for the most part, but regular moviegoers saw no reason to come out and spend their money. Those that did were only moderately pleased as evidenced by the so-so B CinemaScore. Demos showed that the crowd was 60% male, 55% under 25, and 67% white. For ages, Hollywood has blindly given away financing plus marketing/distribution support to films aimed at young men thinking there is a gold mine there. But Popstar follows this year’s Keanu, Hardcore Henry, Triple 9, and The Brothers Grimsby as original R-rated content aimed at this demographic that just failed to draw in crowds at the box office.Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten again was the runaway smash The Jungle Book which dropped 40% to an estimated $4.2M pushing the total to $347.5M. It now sits at number 36 on the all-time domestic list right behind American Sniper. Worldwide, Jungle has amassed $895.1M with Korea and Japan still to come. The Nice Guys rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.5M, off 46%, for a mild sum of $29.1M for Warner Bros.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121M which was up 2% from last year when Spy opened at number one with $29.1M; and down 21% from 2014 when The Fault In Our Stars debuted in the top spot with $48M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"docuseries, stoner, halloween, ABC, American, winner, BBC, Martial","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/05160150/600TMNT.jpg","slug":"box-office-mutant-ninja-turtles-bump-marvel-muties-for-1-spot"},{"id":"47509103601255","title":"Box Office: Angry Birds Knock Out Captain America","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Angry Birds Knock Out Captain Americaby Gitesh Pandya | May 22, 2016 |  CommentsSony’s The Angry Birds Movie flew high knocking out Captain America and friends, while two other films opened softer than expected.Becoming the first non-Disney film in six weeks to take the top spot at the box office, The Angry Birds Movie beat up enough pigs this weekend to take in an estimated $39M from 3,932 theaters for a per screen average of $9,919. Reviews haven’t been too kind (only 43% positive on Rotten Tomatoes) but with a decent CinemaScore of B+ it remains to be seen how high these birds can fly. With an additional $112M coming from overseas (in two weeks) and a current worldwide total of $151M it feels like they’re well on their way to at least an Angry Birds 2.The Avengers-lite Captain America: Civil War had another hefty decline slipping 54.4% to an estimated $33M this weekend, bringing its total up to $347.4M. That puts it at #2 for the year (with Deadpool sitting at #1 with $362.7M); #4 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (with 2013’s Iron Man 3‘s $409M still within striking distance); and #19 worldwide as the film crossed the $1B mark this weekend.Dropping a disturbing 55% from the opening of the original, Universal’s Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising took in $21.8M this weekend, according to estimates, from 3,384 theaters for a per screen average of $6,439. Critics were more in favor than not (61% positive on Rotten Tomatoes, down 12% from the original) and the CinemaScore was a B (the same as the original) but it appears audiences were not as interested in the hijinks of Seth Rogan, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron again, even with the addition of Chloe Grace Moretz and others to the cast.Opening in fourth place was the critically acclaimed The Nice Guys which rounded up an estimated $11.3M this weekend from 2,865 theaters for a per screen average of only $3,934. Rotten Tomatoes currently has it at 91% positive but the CinemaScore was only a B- from paying audiences which means that it’ll be hard for the film to gain any traction over the next few weeks.Fifth place belonged to another Disney juggernaut, The Jungle Book, which had the best hold in the top 10 dropping only 35.6% to an estimated $11M, bringing its cume to $327.5M. In its second weekend, Sony’s Money Monster dropped 52% to an estimated $7M, bringing its total to only $27M. Look for a finale in the $40-45M range which is a disappointment considering the star wattage attached to the film. Also dropping 52% in its second weekend was the horror flick The Darkness which took in an estimated $2.4M, bringing its total up to $8.4M. Look for a final figure around $11M.Eighth place belonged to the final Disney blockbuster in the top 10, Zootopia which slipped a slim 39.7% in its 12th weekend, taking in an estimated $1.7M, bringing its total to $334M. The three Disney films in the top 10 have grossed a combined $1B domestically and $2.9B worldwide. Universal’s The Huntsman: Winter’s War added an estimated $1.2M to its coffers this weekend, bringing its total up to $46.6M with not much left in the tank. And rounding out the top 10 was Mother’s Day which continued its free fall dropping 66% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $1.1M, bringing its total to $31.2M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.6M which was down 10% from last year when Tomorrowland opened at number one with $33M (over the first three days of the 4-day Memorial Day weekend); and down 26% from 2014 when X-Men: Days of Future Past debuted in the top spot with $90.8M (also over the first three days of the 4-day Memorial Day weekend).Compared to projections, The Angry Birds Movie came in slightly above Gitesh’s $37M forecast, while Neighbors 2 and The Nice Guys came in under Gitesh’s respective predictions of $28M and $16M.Follow&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com on twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Star, Awards, kong, Carpet, All, book, Emmy, Opinion","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/22143047/angry-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-angry-birds-knock-out-captain-america"},{"id":"47509103604328","title":"Box Office: Captain America Still #1 Surging Past $900M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Captain America Still #1 Surging Past $900Mby Gitesh Pandya | May 15, 2016 |  CommentsThe Marvel smackdown Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;was once again the most popular movie in the land grossing an estimated $72.6M in its second frame for a drop of 60% from its massive debut. The decline was just slightly bigger than what other super hero sequels with the same characters saw in their second weekends. Last May’s Avengers: Age of Ultron fell 59%, the previous year’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier dropped 57%, and 2013’s Iron Man 3 declined by 58%.Civil War‘s fall was on the higher end, but generally in the same neighborhood. It had some of the best reviews and word-of-mouth of any of these hits, but super hero sequels tend to draw their pre-defined audiences upfront and so even well-liked installments can see large drops on the sophomore session.The cume now sits at a sturdy $295.9M and the super soldier may cross the $300M mark on Monday night becoming the fifth such blockbuster of 2016, and third for Disney. And it’s only the middle of May. Civil War&nbsp;is currently running 4% ahead of Iron Man 3 and 6% behind Ultron. All three opened on the first weekend of May. At this trajectory, a domestic final in the neighborhood of $420M should result. That would mark a jump of more than 60% over the $259.8M of Winter Soldier.Disney and Marvel saw wonderful results overseas for a third weekend. The new Captain America grossed an estimated $84.2M falling 62% from last weekend. The international cume rose to $645M (led by China’s $155.8M) lifting the global gross to a stellar $940.9M. $63.7M has come from 955 IMAX screens worldwide. It now stands as the sixth biggest super hero movie of all-time behind both Avengers films, Iron Man 3, and the last two Dark Knight&nbsp;pics. The billion dollar mark could get shattered this Friday. Direct competition will get hot soon as X-Men: Apocalypse opens in much of the world next weekend followed a week later by its North American launch for the Memorial Day holiday frame.Audiences were still mesmerized by The Jungle Book which spent its fifth weekend among the top two spots. The VFX-heavy adventure dipped only 28% to an estimated $17.8M joining the triple-century club this weekend with a new cume of $311.8M. On Monday it will join the all-time Top 50 bumping off Iron Man 2 and a final of $350M or more looks likely. Overseas grosses rose to a stellar $516.3M led by China’s $151M putting the global tally at a superb $828.1M with Korea and Japan still to open.George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and director Jodie Foster supplied the starpower for the hostage thriller Money Monster&nbsp;but were met with only a moderate debut with an estimated $15M. Sony averaged $4,832 from 3,104 locations for the R-rated action pic which tried to be the alternative choice for mature adults at a time when comic book heroes and Disney kidpics are the main options. Reviews were mixed.Money Monster‘s opening was well below those of other adult-skewing crime thrillers from stars like Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson who often break $20M and even $30M on the first weekend playing to a similar audience. With a so-so B+ CinemaScore grade and direct competition for adults coming next weekend from The Nice Guys starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, the road ahead will not be easy. The production budget is reported to be only $27M (not including the marketing spend) and international prospects look good so Money Monster&nbsp;may end up being a moneymaker.The Blumhouse horror film The Darkness opened on Friday the 13th with a moderate release and grossed an estimated $5.2M from 1,755 locations for a mild $2,952 average. Rated PG-13, the supernatural chiller was panned by those critics who chose to review it. Exit poll data showed that the audience was 53% female, 55% under 25, and 55% non-white.Coming off of the titular holiday, and facing another Julia Roberts movie opening, Mother’s Day plunged 71% to an estimated $3.3M putting Open Road at $28.8M. Earth’s biggest blockbuster of 2016 – Zootopia – followed with an estimated $2.8M slipping a slim 12% for the smallest drop by far of any wide release this weekend. The cume rose to $331.8M putting the Disney toon at number 41 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Worldwide, Zootopia&nbsp;climbed to $969.8M powered by China’s $235.6M.Universal’s big-budget adventure The Huntsman: Winter’s War grossed an estimated $2.6M, off 35%, for a new cume of $44.5M domestic. The worldwide run is slowing and struggling at $153.9M from all global markets except Japan.Three comedies rounded out the top ten with under $2M a piece. Keanu took in an estimated $1.9M, down 42%, for a $18.6M total for Warner Bros. The studio also saw its Barbershop: The Next Cut slip 40% to an estimated $1.7M putting Ice Cube at $51.4M to date. It’s the 13th $50M+ hit in the star’s career and many of those films had relatively low budgets. Melissa McCarthy saw a 38% slide to an estimated $1.2M for The Boss which has banked $61.1M to date for Universal.A24 scored the biggest opening weekend average of the year for an indie film with its platform release of the critics’ darling The Lobster in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. The Colin Farrell-Rachel Weisz pic bowed to an estimated $188,000 for a sizzling $47,000 average. Winning the Cannes Jury Prize last year, Lobster&nbsp;is set in a world where people have 45 days to find true love or else they turn into an animal of their choosing. A24 expands next weekend before going nationwide on May 27.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.9M which was down 29% from last year when Pitch Perfect 2 opened at number one with $69.2M; and down 26% from 2014 when Godzilla debuted in the top spot with $93.2M.Follow&nbsp;BoxOfficeGuru.com on twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adaptation, demand, teaser, dc, tv, RT, Tyler, drama, kids, thriller, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/15170733/550CaptainAmerica.jpg","slug":"box-office-captain-america-still-1-surging-past-900m"},{"id":"47509103616622","title":"Box Office: Super Tumble For Batman v Superman","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Super Tumble For Batman v Supermanby Gitesh Pandya | April 3, 2016 |  CommentsAs expected, the super hero tentpole Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice held onto the number one spot for a second straight frame despite a large drop, however the decline was very troubling as bad word-of-mouth kicked in causing grosses to nosedive. The PG-13 actioner fell 68% from its record opening weekend to an estimated $52.4M.Comic book movies generally attract the bulk of their sales on the first weekend (which include Thursday night pre-shows) so sophomore sessions routinely suffer large declines. Plus, BvS launched over the Easter holiday weekend which helped pump up the grosses with Good Friday being a day off for many. So a decline of 60% or a bit more would have been acceptable.But 68% was steep. Add in the fact that there was no major competition from new releases and it leads to a shaky road ahead. Dawn’s predecessor was 2013’s Man of Steel which was directed by Zack Snyder as well. Its second weekend drop was also 68% when factoring in all Thursday night pre-shows into the opening weekend figure. But the big difference was competition as the second weekend of MoS had to deal with nearly $149M from the openings of Monsters University affecting kids and World War Z impacting action lovers. BvS faced just $12M in grosses for this weekend’s two new wide openers.Second weekend drops for recent major super hero sequels include 59% for Avengers: Age of Ultron, 64% for X-Men: Days of Future Past, 61% for The Amazing Spider-Man 2, 58% for Iron Man 3, 57% for Thor: The Dark World, and 61% for The Dark Knight Rises. Last summer’s panned reboot Fantastic Four matched BvS with a 68% crash on the second weekend.Last year on Easter weekend, Furious 7 smashed records with a $147.2M debut and fell 60% in the second weekend to $59.6M, a gross Justice was not able to reach on its sophomore frame. In fact since Tuesday, daily grosses for BvS have consistently fallen behind F7‘s. The path ahead should find the super hero smackdown finishing its North American run with about $345M. Though a huge amount, especially for the spring season, it does not seem that it will beat the domestic tallies for Furious 7 ($353M) or Deadpool ($355.1M and counting) which did not have the added bonus of 3D surcharges.As North American sales were in freefall, Batman v Superman suffered even more in China where it tumbled by 78% in its second weekend to $12.4M after debuting to $57.2M when it launched day and date with the U.S. Other second weekend falls from top territories included 49% in Brazil, 58% in Germany, 69% in the U.K., and 71% in both Korea and Mexico.The overall international weekend estimate was $85.1M from 67 markets pushing the cume to $421.4M. The global gross rose to $682.9M with offshore markets accounting for 62% of the tally. With sales eroding quickly worldwide, BvS is now on a new trajectory to end its global run in the area of $900M which is still an impressive figure for any big-budget comic book movie.A movie that will in fact sprint past the $1 billion global box office mark is Zootopia which took second place again in its fifth weekend. The Disney smash grossed an estimated $20M and slipped a mere 17% from last weekend which was helped by the Easter holiday. This is the second best performance of all-time for a toon in its fifth weekend of play. Only Frozen did better with $28.6M on a frame that fell during the Christmas school holidays.Zootopia‘s incredible legs have put the bunny cop pic at $275.9M to date in North America with a trajectory to $330-340M by the end of the domestic run. There is even a possibility that Zootopia ends ahead of Batman v Superman domestically. The animated hit will enjoy one more weekend without competition before the studio’s own kidpic The Jungle Book arrives on April 15.Overseas, Zootopia cracked the half-billion mark this weekend with a $30M international frame making for a sturdy $50M worldwide weekend, off just 24%. Offshore grosses have climbed to $511.7M, driven in large part by China’s monumental $215.3M, boosting the global gross to a stellar $787.6M. Zootopia will break $800M within days and should zoom past $900M by the time it opens in Japan on April 23 where the toon is expected to do gangbusters.In its sophomore frame, the comedy sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 dropped 38% to an estimated $11.1M giving Universal $36.5M to date. Normally this decline would be commendable, but given the lack of competition this weekend from new releases, it fell on the high end of drops in the top ten. A $55M final may occur.The faith-based sequel God’s Not Dead 2 opened in fourth place with mild results grossing an estimated $8.1M from 2,419 locations for a soft $3,350 average. Both the gross and average were below what its predecessor generated two years ago in March 2014. The first God’s Not Dead bowed to $9.2M from just one third of the theaters for a potent $11,852 average followed by an expansion and good legs. Part 2 featured a new cast and did not build up the same excitement among its target audience.Another faith-based film sat in the top five with Miracles from Heaven grossing an estimated $7.6M in its third round. Off just 22%, the Sony release has banked an impressive $46.8M to date which is more than three times the film’s production cost.The underperforming sci-fi thriller The Divergent Series: Allegiant witnessed the largest drop in the top ten falling 39% to an estimated $5.7M for a cume to date of $56.4M. International grosses stand at $80.3M with worldwide now at $136.7M. The global tally should finish in the $160-170M range for Lionsgate, a disappointing figure for a big-budget franchise film with one more installment to go.Paramount’s monster flick 10 Cloverfield Lane fared well dipping 20% to an estimated $4.8M for a new cume of $63.6M. It will end its run not far behind the $80M of 2008’s Cloverfield. The Mike Epps comedy Meet the Blacks debuted to decent results in moderate release opening to an estimated $4.1M from 1,015 locations for a $4,026 average. The R-rated film earned poor marks from moviegoers.Helen Mirren’s military thriller Eye in the Sky expanded and jumped up to the number nine spot with an estimated $4.1M as well. The Bleecker Street release averaged $3,941 from 1,029 locations playing to a mature crowd. Total is $6.2M. The overachieving super hero hit Deadpool rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.5M in its eighth weekend, off 29%. Fox has amassed a colossal $355.1M to date domestically and global has just hit $754.4M making it the top-grossing film worldwide from the entire X-Men franchise beating Days of Future Past. This is especially impressive since Deadpool had no China release.A pair of films debuted well in limited release. Richard Linklater’s critically acclaimed Everybody Wants Some!! bowed to an estimated $323,000 from 19 theaters for a solid $17,000 average. Paramount expands to 50+ locations on the second weekend. Don Cheadle directs, produces, writes and stars in the Miles Davis biopic Miles Ahead which platformed to an estimated $123,000 from four sites for a strong $30,750 average. Sony Classics widens to 20+ locations on Friday and will be nationwide on April 22.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121.3M which was down 44% from last year when Furious 7 opened at number one over the Easter holiday frame with $147.2M; and down 22% from 2014 when Captain America: The Winter Soldier debuted in the top spot with $95M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Comic-Con, RT21, John, kaiju, japanese, Chilling, HBO, FX, of, Fox, jamie, breaking, Rey, joker, Witch","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/03150359/600BvS1.jpg","slug":"box-office-super-tumble-for-batman-v-superman"},{"id":"47509102064226","title":"Box Office: Dory Cruises to #1 &amp; Nears $300M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Dory Cruises to #1 &amp; Nears $300Mby Gitesh Pandya | June 26, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend,&nbsp;Disney and Pixar ruled the box office with ease as the animated smash Finding Dory was once again the most popular film in the land taking in an estimated $73.2M in its second weekend of release. That represented a 46% decline which is good considering the record opening it is coming off of which included massive Thursday pre-shows from last week, and the fact that it is a sequel. Last year’s Pixar entry Inside Out was an original film that dropped 42% and the 2013 sequel Monsters University fell by 45%. All three Pixar movies opened in the second half of June right as schools were letting out for summer vacation.Through the second weekend, Dory stands tall at $286.6M surpassing the final domestic total of University. On Monday, it will pass Up to become Pixar’s fourth biggest blockbuster ever and on Tuesday it should crack the $300M mark. Eventually the fish tale will beat out Finding Nemo, Inside Out, and Toy Story 3 to become the animation leader’s highest-grossing film of all-time on its way to a finish in the $500M range. Seven of the top ten films this weekend are sequels and all are performing worse than their predecessors – with the notable exception of Dory.The overseas take climbed to $110.3M led by China where the second weekend tumbled by two-thirds for a cume of $30.2M. That put the global sum at $396.9M with several top markets yet to open.Opening in second place to rocky results was the big-budget sci-fi sequel Independence Day: Resurgence with an estimated $41.6M from 4,068 locations for a $10,226 average. The PG-13 film continued this summer’s string of sequels that audiences never asked for and performed below the levels of its predecessor. 20 years ago, Independence Day was a pop culture phenomenon opening mid-week ahead of the Fourth of July holiday with $50.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $96.1M over the six-day debut period which began on Tuesday evening with shows starting at 6pm. Yes, pre-shows existed many years ago too. ID4 ended up as the top-grossing film of that year.Even with a Friday launch, higher ticket prices, 3D, IMAX, and 1,186 more theaters, Resurgence still saw a much lower opening weekend than the 1996 hit. In fact when comparing admissions, the sequel pulled in 55-60% fewer people. Many cast members returned in the sequel, but Will Smith was noticeably absent. The actor has had more flops than hits in recent times so it is hard to determine what impact his presence would have had, but overall consumer excitement was never very high for Resurgence.Studio data from Fox showed that the audience was understandably more male (58%) while 64% were over 25. Reviews were mostly bad and the B CinemaScore grade indicates that paying audiences were only moderately happy with the entertainment they got.With a budget reportedly north of $160M, the Roland Emmerich-directed action tale is global in scope and made to earn its revenues from around the world.&nbsp;Independence Day: Resurgence made use of its day-and-date roll-out by grossing a hefty $102.1M internationally for a $143.7M global bow this weekend. China, of course, repped the biggest share with a large $37.3M weekend almost matching the domestic gross. The next biggest markets were Korea with $7.4M, the U.K. with $7.3M, and Mexico with $6.8M.Kevin Hart films often tank on the second weekend, but with The Rock on board, Central Intelligence dropped 48% to an estimated $18.4M taking third place. Given the big marketing push and the arrival of new action offerings, that was a reasonable sophomore decline for Warner Bros. With $69.3M to date, the action-comedy looks to end its run in the area of $115M which would be second-best all-time for Hart after Ride Along‘s $134.9M.Blake Lively scored a commercial hit, and proved her box office pull, with the shark attack thriller The Shallows which exceeded expectations to open to an estimated $16.7M in fourth. Averaging a solid $5,638 from 2,962 locations, the PG-13 pic was powered by young women and served as fresh content in a marketplace filled with recycled brands. Sony’s well-reviewed one-woman survival story played to an audience that was 54% female and 50% under 25. With a production cost of only $17M, Shallows will end up as one of the more profitable titles of the summer.Audiences had no interest in Matthew McConaughey’s new slave drama Free State of Jones which flopped with an opening weekend of only $7.8M, according to estimates, from 2,815 theaters for a weak $2,761 average. Backed in part by Chinese financing, the STX release earned negative reviews which turned off its target audience of serious-minded adults. Plus the story was something that summer ticket buyers were just not in the mood for in the first place.A five-pack of sequels filled up the rest of the top ten. Horror offering The Conjuring 2 grossed an estimated $7.7M, down 48%, giving Warner Bros. $86.9M to date. Global is now a fantastic $242.9M. Lionsgate’s Now You See Me 2 dropped 40% to an estimated $5.7M for a $52.1M cume. The magic pic is the latest Hollywood movie to open bigger in China than in the U.S. thanks to this weekend’s $43.3M debut which is not surprising since half the film is set there. Global on NYSM2 is $159.8M.Fox’s X-Men: Apocalypse fell 53% to an estimated $2.5M giving the mutants $151.1M to date. Rounding out the list with long titles and declines of more than half were Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows with an estimated $2.4M and Alice Through the Looking Glass with an estimated $2.1M. Totals are $77.1M and $74.6M, respectively.Dropping out of the top ten in only its third weekend was the big-budget adventure Warcraft with an estimated $2.1M and terrible $43.9M cume. The Universal tentpole has suffered back-to-back 70% declines and is looking at a domestic final of about $47M. The video-game-inspired Mortal Kombat from 21 years ago did much better with $70.4M in the summer of 1995. But overseas is a different story for Warcraft where the China total has risen to $221M even though it is decelerating fast there. Global is now $412.2M with a whopping 89% coming from outside North America.Disney owns four of the six biggest blockbusters of 2016 and two of them fell out of the top ten this weekend. Captain America: Civil War climbed to $403.9M domestic and $1.15 billion worldwide while The Jungle Book rose to $358M and $929.5M global.The top ten films grossed an estimated $178.1M which was up 2% from last year when Jurassic World remained at number one for a third time with $54.5M; and up 4% from 2014 when Transformers: Age of Extinction debuted in the top spot with $100M, a figure other distributors disputed.Compared to projections, Finding Dory was on target with my $74M forecast while Independence Day was close to my $39M prediction. The Shallows&nbsp;opened well above my $10M projection and Free State of Jones was on target with my $7M forecast.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"politics, drama, black","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/26125206/dory-3-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-dory-cruises-to-1-nears-300m"},{"id":"47509103617647","title":"Box Office: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Dominates the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Dominates the WeekendZootopia falls to second, while My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 opens respectably in third.by Gitesh Pandya | March 27, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, following years of fan anticipation, audiences drove the new super hero event film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to a gargantuan global opening of $424M seizing total control of the box office around the world.In North America, the Warner Bros. release bowed to an eye-popping $170.1M, according to estimates, marking the sixth largest opening weekend of all-time and the biggest ever in the entire January-to-April corridor. The PG-13 film averaged a stunning $40,099 from 4,242 locations including 3D and other formats with the 388 IMAX screens contributing $18M, or 11% of the gross.It was the fourth biggest opening ever for a super hero film trailing the last three outings for Tony Stark. The largest overall domestic debuts of all-time are now Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($248M), Jurassic World ($208.8M), The Avengers ($207.4M), Avengers: Age of Ultron ($191.3M), Iron Man 3 ($174.1M), and BvS. Four of these six occurred in just the past 11 months as moviegoing remains red hot, as long as studios supplied exciting content.The nation’s film critics were not big fans of Batman v Superman as reviews were quite negative. In fact, all five movies which opened bigger had good to great reviews so,&nbsp;Dawn of Justice scored the best opening in history for a critically-panned film. Fans ignored the reviews as they wanted to see the historic mash-up of Justice League heroes and judge for themselves.&nbsp;Audience feedback has been mixed, but is certainly better than where critics are at. The CinemaScore grade was a so-so B, although the largest groups (males and over-25s) both gave a B-.The historic weekend began with Friday’s opening day tally of $82M (tied with Jurassic World for fourth all-time) which included Thursday night pre-shows beginning at 6:00pm of $27.7M. It was also the Good Friday school holiday allowing for more audiences to be available. Saturday dropped 38% to $50.9M while Warners is projecting Sunday to dip 27% to $37.2M. BvS will need to hit that projection in order to stay #6 among all-time opening weekends to edge out the $169.2M of the final Harry Potter film from 2011.For the second year in a row, studios have used Easter to launch a major tentpole movie — the kind that would normally be programmed into summer. And they still generated summer-like business, proving audiences will show up in droves for the right film no matter what the calendar says. Last year, Universal launched Furious 7 to a $147.2M weekend with daily drops of 31% on Saturday and 29% on Sunday.The studio will take this holiday back next year with Fast 8,&nbsp;Warner Bros. has already claimed 2018’s bunny weekend for Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, and Universal has planted its flag for 2019 with Fast 9 followed by Fast 10 taking Easter 2021. Currently, Cyborg is scheduled to open a week before Easter in 2020 but that could certainly get pushed a week. The holiday’s colossal money-making potential is too big to ignore.Studio data on Justice showed that males, not surprisingly, made up 62% of the crowd while 60% was over 25. This is in line with most comic book movies. Another opening weekend record broken was for the DC super hero universe beating the $160.9M of The Dark Knight Rises. That final Chris Nolan film was 2D only and was affected by a shooting tragedy which hampered first weekend sales to some extent. Also, BvS delivered the best debut ever in the January-to-April corridor beating the $152.5M of 2012’s The Hunger Games which was also 2D only.Word-of-mouth will play a major role for the road ahead. While some fans are disappointed, there are plenty who love the film and are recommending it. Plus this is the key movie setting up all the future DC comic book movies which will continue with next summer’s Wonder Woman and the first of two Justice League films which arrives in November 2017. Many schools and colleges have breaks this coming week so mid-week numbers are sure to be strong – another benefit to an Easter launch. Batman v Superman could finish its first full week of release in the $215-220M range and break $275M after its second weekend.Warner Bros. gave Dawn of Justice a true worldwide launch with all major markets bowing this weekend including China and Japan which often open later. Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne amassed a stellar $254M from 66 markets making for a jaw-dropping $424.1M worldwide debut. Leading the way were China with $57.3M, the U.K. with $21.9M, and Mexico with $18.6M. IMAX saw $18M from 557 screens including $7M just from China. Super hero action sells well across the planet so crashing the $1 billion mark is likely for this behemoth putting its studio in a great position for the years ahead.After a three-week run at number one, the bunny cop toon Zootopia remained strong over Easter weekend with an estimated $23.1M slipping 38%. Disney has banked an impressive $240.5M to date and looks on track to break $300M domestic with this one. Overseas markets rocked this holiday weekend with an estimated $42.5M pushing the international take to $456.2M and the worldwide tally to a stunning $696.7M. China smashed the double-century mark and stands at $201M as the biggest toon ever there. In Russia, Zootopia is now the second biggest Hollywood blockbuster of all-time after Avatar. The release in Disney-loving Japan is four weeks away and breaking $1 billion worldwide seems likely.The comedy sequel My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 had a respectable opening in second place with an estimated $18.1M from 3,133 sites for a $5,782 average. The PG-13 film follows up on the 2002 sleeper hit which shocked the box office world with a leggy run for months that ended in a $241.4M final making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all-time. 14 years later and no film has been able to take that record away.The sequel earned mostly bad reviews but Universal was able to attract a nice crowd in the first frame which was scheduled for Easter. Paying audiences were pleased, as Wedding 2 got a good A- grade from CinemaScore. Older white females were the core audience as studio data showed that the crowd was 76% female, 60% over 35, and 70% white. The studio dropped this on the calendar because of the holiday weekend and as counter-programming against the comic book superflick.The Divergent Series: Allegiant took a nasty tumble in its second weekend falling a disturbing 67% to an estimated $9.5M for a domestic total of only $46.6M. That puts the third film in the franchise 46% below the pace of last year’s Insurgent. A $65-70M final may result with the final film still on the calendar for next year. International markets have contributed $71.8M for a global take of $118.4M.The faith-based hit Miracles from Heaven held up well over Easter weekend grossing an estimated $9.5M, off 36% in its sophomore session. Sony has grossed $34.1M to date for this $13M production. The monster movie 10 Cloverfield Lane was off 52% to an estimated $6M for a new total of $56M for Paramount.Despite the arrival of the super hero mash-up, Deadpool fared well, dropping just 38% in its seventh frame to an estimated $5M. Fox has amassed $349.5M domestically and has grossed another $396.5M overseas for a global gross of $746M. Rival R-rated actioner London Has Fallen took in an estimated $2.9M, off 57%, for a new sum of $55.6M for Focus.A pair of critically acclaimed indies headlined by actresses around age 70 expanded and jumped into the top ten. The Sally Field pic Hello, My Name is Doris collected an estimated $1.7M from 488 locations for a $3,486 average and $3.3M cume for Roadside Attractions. Helen Mirren’s military thriller Eye in the Sky did well, averaging $8,138 from 123 sites for a weekend estimate of $1M. Bleecker Street has taken in $1.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $247M which was up 14% from last year’s Easter weekend when Furious 7 opened at number one with $147.2M; and up 112% from 2014’s holiday when Captain America: The Winter Soldier spent its third week in the top spot with $25.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Month, CW, a, Grant, MSNBC, Unbreakable, BET, TV, Review, aapi, serial, 2017","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/27163456/BatmanVSupermanBO1.jpg","slug":"box-office-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-dominates-the-weekend"},{"id":"47509103622770","title":"Box Office: Disney Animals Rule!","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Disney Animals Rule!by Sujit Chawla | March 6, 2016 |  CommentsDisney’s Zootopia&nbsp;set a few new records while London Has Fallen opened to decent numbers and Whiskey Tango Foxtrot barely registered with audiences.Disney Animation (not to be confused with Disney/Pixar) had their biggest opening of all-time as Zootopia&nbsp;exploded on the scene with an estimated $73.7M this weekend from 3,827 theaters for a per screen average of $19,258. In 2013 Frozen went wide in its second weekend and took in $67.4M, while 2014’s Big Hero 6 opened to $56.2M. Both of those were November releases. Zootopia‘s opening is the largest animated opening in the month of March, beating out The Lorax ($70.2M in 2012) and it’s the fourth largest opening in March coming in behind two other Disney films (Oz The Great and Powerful, $79M in 2013);&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland, $116M in 2010; and of course The Hunger Games, $152.5M in 2012). Internationally, Zootopia&nbsp;picked up an additional $63.4M bringing its total up to $158.8M and its global cume up to $232.5M. With an A CinemaScore, an astounding 98% positive Rotten Tomatoes score and no other competition for the next few weeks, Zootopia&nbsp;could be seeing a lot of green for Disney.Second place belonged to London Has Fallen, a sequel to the surprise hit Olympus Has Fallen which opened in 2013 to $30.3M on its way to a $98.9M finale. The sequel took in an estimated $21.7M from 3,490 theaters for a per screen average of $6,222. Reviews were not as strong as they were for the original but moviegoers gave the film a solid A- CinemaScore so next weekend will be interesting to watch.Superhero film Deadpool continued its blistering run with an additional $16.4M, according to estimates, a drop of 47% from last weekend, bringing its cume to a rousing $311M, making it only the 3rd R-rated film to cross the $300M mark. It still has an outside shot at overtaking American Sniper ($350M in 2014) but will likely come up a bit short against The Passion of the Christ ($370.7M in 2004) unless marketers come up with some Easter ads that make it seem like Deadpool&nbsp;is the second coming.Debuting in fourth was Tina Fey’s latest, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot&nbsp;which opened to an estimated $7.6M from 2,374 theaters for a per screen average of only $3,201. A so-so CinemaScore of a B does not bode well for the future and makes you wonder if as talented as Tina Fey is, she’s better off sharing top billing with another big star.Holdovers took over the rest of the top 10. In fifth place was the disaster film – I mean, film that is a disaster – Gods of Egypt which dropped a big 64.6% in its second weekend to an estimated $5M, bringing its total up to only $22.8M off a budget of around $140M. In sixth place off a budget of only $20M was the faith-driven Risen which made an estimated $3.9M in its third weekend, bringing its total up to $28.6M.Kung Fu Panda 3 took seventh place this weekend with an estimated $3.5M, bringing its total up to $133.8M. The Revenant took advantage of a couple of big Oscar wins and slipped only 16% in its 11th weekend to an estimated $3.3M, bringing its cume up to $176M.Falling nearly 50% in its second weekend was the feel-good tale of Eddie the Eagle which took in an estimated $3.1M bringing its total up to $10.8M for Fox. And rounding out the top 10 was the horror film The Witch which made $2.5M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $21M.Outside of the top 10 The Other Side of the Door opened in 546 theaters to an estimated $1.2M for a per screen average of $2,198. Oscar Best Picture Winner&nbsp;Spotlight added 542 screens and jumped 150% from last weekend, taking in an additional $1.8M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $41.6M. And just for fun, Star Wars: The Force Awakens took in another $1.8M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $928.8M after 12 weeks in theaters. You know somewhere Disney marketers are wondering if there’s a way to make another $70M before the home video release on 4/5.The top ten films grossed $140.7M which was up 85% from last year when Chappie debuted at number one with $13.3M; and up 54% from 2014 when 300: Rise of an Empire opened at number one with $45M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"dramedy, 72, Mirror, Talk, Paramount, Hallmark, marvel, women, ViacomCBS, Box, Emmys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/06191707/Zootopia-600.jpg","slug":"box-office-disney-animals-rule"},{"id":"47509103623795","title":"Deadpool Threepeats Over Oscar Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Deadpool Threepeats Over Oscar Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 28, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend with Hollywood focused on the Academy Awards, super hero giant Deadpool&nbsp;easily remained number one in its third weekend with an estimated $31.5M. Down a reasonable 44%, the Fox smash has upped its cume to a stunning $285.6M which is an incredible figure for a not-so-well-known comic book character. Deadpool now ranks as the third highest-grossing R-rated film of all time after The Passion of the Christ and American Sniper. International markets were red hot too with another $40.2M this weekend boosting the offshore total to $324.2M and the worldwide tally to $609.8M.The historical epic Gods of Egypt became a big-budget flop on opening weekend debuting in second place with an estimated $14M which amounted to just one-tenth of the production cost of the effects-heavy action pic. The PG-13 vehicle released by Lionsgate was panned by film critics and had faced plenty of negativity since the debut of its trailer months ago for both an abundance of white actors playing Egyptians and a cheesy overall look.With a reported budget of $140M (more than double that of Deadpool), Gods will need a wildly successful international run. 68 overseas markets opened this weekend to the tune of $24.2M with only one market able to get past $2M. Russia led the way with a $3.5M weekend and key territories like Korea, China, France, and Germany are still to come.Panda power followed as the DreamWorks Animation threequel Kung Fu Panda 3 grossed an estimated $9M dropping 28% in its fifth round. Fox has amassed $128.5M so far in North America and $314.3M worldwide. It has already become the highest grossing animated film of all-time in China with $144.2M there. The biblical drama Risen enjoyed a good second weekend taking in an estimated $7M, down 41%, to boost the cume to $22.7M for Sony.The weekend’s two other new releases were met with soft results from audiences. Fox’s inspirational pic Eddie the Eagle bowed to an estimated $6.3M from 2,042 sites for a mild $3,085 average. Reviews for the Hugh Jackman flick were positive and word of mouth has been strong (the CinemaScore is a glowing A) so its drops may not be too big in the weeks ahead.Similar numbers were seen by the cop drama Triple 9 which debuted to an estimated $6.1M from 2,205 locations averaging a weak $2,768 per theater. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated Open Road release with a cast including Casey Affleck, Kate Winslet, Woody Harrelson, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Anthony Mackie.Collecting an estimated $5.2M was the comedy How To Be Single which fell 37% and has banked $39.6M to date for Warner Bros. A24’s horror film The Witch fell just 43% to an estimated $5M in its sophomore session. With $16.6M to date, the low-cost period chiller could end up with $25-30M. The Jesse Owens film Race followed with an estimated $4.3M, down 42% in its second weekend, putting Focus at $13.9M.Leading all films with 12 Academy Award nominations, The Revenant remained popular with moviegoers grossing an estimated $3.8M, off a scant 2% in its eighth weekend of wide release, boosting Fox’s cume to a hefty $170.5M. Leonardo DiCaprio is all set to take home the Best Actor Oscar for what is the third highest grossing film of his career after Titanic and Inception. A win for Picture or Director (or both) would help keep the box office run going throughout March. Global tally is $404M and Oscar gold would take it near the $500M mark.Below the top ten, Oscar contenders for Best Picture had one more weekend to squeeze out some cash from their big nominations. Audiences will lose interest quickly for those that do not win big.PGA winner The Big Short grossed an estimated $1M this weekend, up 13%, giving Paramount $68.5M to date. Spotlight has cleaned up with critics groups and is still taking in cash with an estimated $788,000, up 51% with screens boosted by 71%. The Open Road pic is now at $39.2M.Brooklyn dipped just 4% to an estimated $735,000 for $36.5M overall for Fox Searchlight which won the Best Picture trophies over the last two years with 12 Years A Slave and Birdman. Likely Best Actress winner Brie Larson’s Room expanded and watched its weekend take climb 58% to an estimated $643,000. A24’s cume is $13.5M which is more than double what it had when Oscar nominations were announced.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.1M which was up 3% from last year when Focus opened at number one with $18.7M; but down 12% from 2014 when Non-Stop debuted in the top spot with $28.9M.Compared to projections, Gods of Egypt came in a little higher than my $12M prediction. Triple 9 and Eddie the Eagle opened a little below my forecasts of $9M and $8M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"harry","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/28122132/Deadpool_-rep.jpg","slug":"deadpool-threepeats-over-oscar-weekend"},{"id":"47509104688756","title":"Deadpool Tops Box Office Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Deadpool Tops Box Office AgainRisen and The Witch take #3 and #4, while Race finishes sixth.by Gitesh Pandya | February 21, 2016 |  Comments&nbsp;This weekend, there was no stopping fans from rushing out to the multiplexes for a wild dose of super hero fun as the juggernaut Deadpool held steady in the number one spot for a second frame with an estimated $55M, falling a reasonable 59% from its holiday debut. The cume shot up to a staggering $235.4M after just 10.5 days, already making it the sixth highest-grossing R-rated movie of all-time.Buzz has been strong and repeat business is helping too. Add in no major competition from new releases and the Fox hit has amassed a fantastic gross so far with plenty more still to come. The final domestic haul should reach the area of American Sniper‘s $350.1M, challenging Clint Eastwood’s smash for number two all-time among R films. Matching the record $370.8M of The Passion of the Christ may not be possible.International audiences are loving Deadpool‘s unique action-comedy blend too. A hefty $85.3M came in this weekend from 74 overseas markets, pushing that tally to $256.3M and the worldwide haul to a stellar $491.7M. Korea led the new territories with a strong $12.1M launch, while the top overall market remains the U.K. with $36.9M through its second weekend. With Japan still to come in June, Deadpool is now on course to finish its global run with over $800M which is astonishing for a film that cost only $58M to produce.For those looking for lighter fare compared to ultraviolent super hero action, Kung Fu Panda 3 did the trick coming in second place again with an estimated $12.5M, dropping a moderate 37%. Fox has grossed $117.1M to date and the toon threequel is benefiting from being the only game in town for younger kids. The third Panda is currently running 17% behind the pace of its 2011 predecessor domestically. Global has climbed to $294.2M including just seven international markets with $137M coming from the world’s top place – China.The biblical drama Risen debuted in third place with an estimated $11.8M and averaged $4,048 from 2,915 theaters. Starring Joseph Fiennes, the PG-13 film was given a fairly wide launch for a faith-based film with Sony targeting its audience effectively. Studio data showed that the crowd was 53% female and 70% over 25. Reviews were mixed, but these films do not depend too much on the opinions of film critics. Word of mouth is good so Risen hopes to keep finding more audiences during the weeks leading up to Easter.A24 enjoyed a nice little launch for its low-budget horror title The Witch which debuted to an estimated $8.7M. Averaging a decent $4,245 from 2,046 sites, the R-rated period thriller garnered strong reviews from film critics while buzz from ticket buyers was shaky. Two weeks ago, Hail Caesar! had the same disconnect between media and regular joes.Dropping 54% in its second weekend and taking fourth place was the dating comedy How To Be Single with an estimated $8.2M. With $31.8M thus far for Warner Bros., a $45-50M final is likely.Failing to finish in the top five on opening weekend was the biopic drama Race which bowed to an estimated $7.3M from 2,369 locations for a soft $3,071 average. Focus earned mixed reviews for its Jesse Owens saga and the February release slot led to no help from awards season. Many critics described the film as being not bad, but ordinary and not special. Starpower was low and the opening in the middle of Black History Month did little to motivate audiences who were never very excited about this PG-13 film in the first place.Ben Stiller’s hope for a career resurgence, the comedy sequel Zoolander 2, took a nosedive tumbling 60% from what was a disappointing opening weekend. The estimated take of only $5.5M gave Paramount a troubling $23.7M on its way to a $33M finish. It cost over $50M to produce and is the latest underachiever for Stiller. The Frat Pack in general with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have not been selling at the box office in recent years, a far cry from their numerous hits a decade ago.Remaining a sturdy draw at the turnstiles since the 1990s was Leonardo DiCaprio whose Oscar offering The Revenant followed with an estimated $3.8M. Down 42%, the Fox release has banked an impressive $165.1M to date and is hoping to win the film industry’s biggest prize next weekend. Worldwide tally has risen to $381.6M.All-time domestic champ Star Wars: The Force Awakens spent its tenth weekend in the top ten and grossed an estimated $3.8M as well, off 38%. Disney has now amassed $921.6M domestically and $2.04 billion worldwide with a little more left in the tank. The Coen Brothers watched their latest project Hail, Caesar! fall sharply to tenth place with an estimated $2.6M, down 59%, giving Universal a soft $26.2M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.3M which was up 15% from last year when Fifty Shades of Grey stayed at number one with $22.3M; and up 27% from 2014 when The LEGO Movie remained in the top spot for a third time with $31.3M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"anthology, Summer, actors, golden, TV, furious, joker, History, language, trailers, Comic-Con, thirty, Awards, Valentine's","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/21165802/DeadpoolBO2.jpg","slug":"deadpool-tops-box-office-again"},{"id":"47509104692854","title":"Box Office: Panda Remains Champ Over Super Bowl Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Panda Remains Champ Over Super Bowl Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 7, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend with all eyes on Super Bowl 50, studios refrained from opening anything new that was worthwhile allowing current champ Kung Fu Panda 3 to easily repeat at number one for a second time. The DreamWorks Animation offering fell 49% to an estimated $21M bumping the ten-day cume up to $69.1M. The last film in the franchise opened over Memorial Day weekend in the summer of 2011 and suffered a similar 50% sophomore fall. Panda 3 is now running 26% behind the pace of KFP2.Oscar-winning directors the Coen Brothers saw an unimpressive second place debut for their new film Hail, Caesar! which opened to an estimated $11.4M from 2,232 locations for a moderate $5,125 average. The PG-13 satirical comedy boasted some big star names like George Clooney, Channing Tatum, and Scarlett Johansson and was met with mostly positive reviews from critics. However the response from paying audiences was different and those who did go out an see the film gave harsh marks as evidenced by the lousy C- CinemaScore grade.Often, films from the Coens platform and expand later but Universal went wide from the start with Caesar. The result was a weekend gross slightly behind what the filmmakers saw over a decade ago with films like The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty which both opened in the $12-13M range at a time when ticket prices were much less. Hail, Caesar! should fade fast thanks to poor word-of-mouth and intense competition next weekend from a trio of studio comedies.Oscar player The Revenant dropped 44% to an estimated $7.1M boosting its cume to a robust $149.7M. The Fox release took home the coveted DGA prize on Saturday for its director Alejandro G. Iñárritu keeping it a major contender in what has been a tight and wide open race this year. On Monday, Revenant&nbsp;becomes the fifth film of Leonardo DiCaprio’s career to reach $150M domestically following Titanic, Catch Me If You Can, Inception, and Django Unchained.Jedi power led to double milestones this weekend for Star Wars: The Force Awakens with the $900M domestic mark being broken on Friday and $2 billion global being shattered on Saturday. The Disney smash grossed an estimated $6.9M in its eighth weekend, off 38%, shooting the North American total up to $906M – the best for any movie in history.Overseas markets contributed a similar $7M this weekend pushing the international cume to $1.1 billion and the global tally to $2.008 billion. Force‘s trajectory still puts it on course for a $2.05 billion finish with 55% coming from overseas. With $124.5M, China stands as the world’s number three market for the film after domestic and the U.K. But with the run nearing its end there, the figure is far from what numerous other Hollywood action films have done. The gross is just slightly better than what Captain America: The Winter Soldier did in China two years ago.Two new female-skewing films were dropped into the marketplace on Super Bowl weekend as counter-programming but failed to create any excitement. The romance The Choice bowed to an estimated $6.1M from 2,631 locations for a weak $2,313 average for Lionsgate. Critics panned this latest PG-13 adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel.Sony countered with the Jane Austen-inspired horror flick Pride and Prejudice and Zombies which was rejected with an estimated $5.2M debut. The PG-13 film averaged a dismal $1,774 from 2,931 locations. It had the smallest opening weekend among the new releases despite having the most theaters.The Coast Guard rescue film The Finest Hours fell 54% to an estimated $4.7M in its second weekend bumping Disney’s cume up to $18.4M. Ride Along 2, the comedy forever to be known as the movie that ended the reign of The Force Awakens at number one, followed with an estimated $4.5M dropping 46%. Universal has banked $77.2M and the global gross cracked $100M.STX saw its spookfest The Boy fall 46% to an estimated $4.1M putting the cume at $26.8M. The raunchy comedy Dirty Grandpa grossed an estimated $4.1M, down 47%, for a $29.4M sum for Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed an estimated $75.1M which was down 6% from last year’s Super Bowl frame when American Sniper stayed at number one with $30.7M; but up 14% from 2014’s football championship weekend when Ride Along remained in the top spot with $12M.Compared to projections, Hail, Caesar! opened on target with my $11M forecast. The Choice and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies both opened below my respective predictions of $8M and $12M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.&nbsp;","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"japanese, visit, drama","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/07144308/600KungFuPanda3.jpg","slug":"box-office-panda-remains-champ-over-super-bowl-weekend"},{"id":"47509103620721","title":"Box Office: Zootopia #1 Racing Past $400M Global","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Zootopia #1 Racing Past $400M Globalby Gitesh Pandya | March 13, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, for a second straight frame, Disney’s latest animation sensation Zootopia led the North American box office and showed the kind of strength that indicates a long spring run ahead. The PG-rated toon grossed an estimated $50M this weekend dropping only 33% lifting the cume to a stellar $142.6M. Zootopia is only the third March film in history to reach $50M on its second weekend joining The Hunger Games and Alice in Wonderland which both were coming off of opening weekends that were well over $100M.Compared to other March toons, Zootopia‘s decline was much better than the 45-50% range that other films like Home, The Lorax, and Horton Hears a Who fell into. Parents and kids alike are loving the animal-filled film and word-of-mouth has been sparkling. A final domestic haul of $260M+ seems likely.The international run has also been red hot. China has been a stand-out performer with the sophomore frame more than doubling the opening weekend with $56.5M pushing the local cume to a stunning $109M in ten days beating all past Disney and Pixar toons there. Zootopia grossed $83.1M from 45 markets pushing the offshore total to $288.7M and the global gross to $431.3M. China will continue to sizzle and several major territories are still to open including Australia, Brazil, the U.K., and Disney-loving Japan. With Easter school holidays coming soon around the world, the global tally for Zootopia should be able to reach an eye-popping $900M or more.Paramount enjoyed a nice launch for its sci-fi thriller 10 Cloverfield Lane which debuted to an estimated $25.2M this weekend in the number two spot. The PG-13 film averaged a sturdy $7,431 from 3,391 locations. $3.1M, or 12% of the gross, came from IMAX screens. Those large format venues will get busy very fast with the arrival this Thursday night of The Divergent Series: Allegiant followed a week later by the highly-anticipated Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice which opens day and date in China and features special scenes shot with IMAX cameras.As a franchise film, 10 Cloverfield Lane did not match up to the $40.1M bow of 2008’s Cloverfield which entered the marketplace with a mysterious marketing campaign that ignited fan interest. It delivered the biggest January opening of all-time then. Lane attracted terrific reviews from film critics which helped drive in audiences this weekend. But paying crowds felt differently as evidenced by the lackluster B- CinemaScore grade. Still, with a budget under $20M this will be a profitable project regardless of how international numbers fare. Studio data showed the opening day audience to be 60% male and 68% over 25.Deadpool fared well in its fifth weekend taking in an estimated $10.8M, off 35%, pushing Fox up to $328.1M in North America. Hitting $350M seems likely which would triple the final gross of Green Lantern, the last super hero film anchored by Ryan Reynolds. Overseas, Deadpool saw its total zoom to $380M giving the naughty comic book character $708.1M worldwide which sets the bar high for Batman v Superman which opens in less than two weeks.More R-rated action followed with London Has Fallen which fell a reasonable 51% in its sophomore round to an estimated $10.7M. Focus has banked $38.9M to date and should finish with around $60M. The Gerard Butler sequel is currently running 29% behind the pace of 2013’s Olympus Has Fallen which also opened in March. Following a soft bow, the Tina Fey comedy Whiskey Tango Foxtrot held well in its second weekend dropping 38% to an estimated $4.6M. With $14.6M overall, Paramount looks to reach $25-30M.Three new releases followed with $3-5M openings. The relationship film The Perfect Match debuted to respectable results in moderate national release with an estimated $4.2M from 925 locations for a $4,486 average. The R-rated pic starring Terrence Jenkins, Paula Patton, and Donald Faison earned mixed reviews.Faith-based audiences had little interest in the new drama The Young Messiah which opened poorly in seventh place with an estimated $3.4M. Averaging a weak $1,933 from 1,761 locations, the PG-13 entry suffered a sharp fall on Saturday and faces a difficult road ahead.Sacha Baron Cohen hit a new career low with his latest raunchy comedy The Brothers Grimsby which was met with a pitiful opening weekend grossing an estimated $3.2M from 2,235 theaters for a horrific $1,409 average. The R-rated pic was utterly ignored by U.S. audiences and the three-day figure did not even beat the $4.2M Wednesday opening day of 2012’s The Dictator. That film had the actor’s worst opening ever as a lead with $17.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday session in May of that year. Reviews were bad for Grimsby, but the CinemaScore was a decent B+. Its final domestic gross is likely to be a miserable $8M.Dropping 52% in its third fight was the big-budget adventure Gods of Egypt with an estimated $2.5M pushing the domestic cume for Lionsgate to $27.3M. China opened with a strong $20M this weekend pushing the international haul to $80.5M and the global tally to $107.8M with domestic accounting for only one quarter of that gross. Sony’s Risen fell 44% to an estimated $2.2M for a new total of $32.3M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $116.7M which was up 1% from last year when Cinderella opened at number one with $67.9M; and up 18% from 2014 when Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman stayed in the top spot with $21.8M.Compared to projections, 10 Cloverfield Lane and The Perfect Match opened close to my respective forecasts of $23M and $5M. The Young Messiah and&nbsp;The Brothers Grimsby debuted below my predictions of $7M and $8M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Country, spinoff, comedy, TV, curtis, Biopics, documentaries, cancelled","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/13143053/zoo-rep.jpg","slug":"box-office-zootopia-1-racing-past-400m-global"},{"id":"47509104706170","title":"Box Office: Star Wars #1, Crosses $800M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Star Wars #1, Crosses $800Mby Sujit Chawla | January 10, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, Star Wars: The Force Awakens is now the number one film all time domestically, The Revenant expanded nationwide to explosive results while Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight crumbled in its second week of wide release.In a mere 20 days, Star Wars: The Force Awakens&nbsp;managed to overtake Avatar&nbsp;and become the highest grossing film of all time domestically. In its 4th weekend (which would be 24 days), The Force Awakens racked up another $41.6M, according to estimates, raising its record to $812M. Internationally it made another $146M (including a record-breaking $52.6M two-day opening in China) bringing its cume to $921M for a worldwide total of $1.73B, overtaking&nbsp;Jurassic World for number three all-time. This leaves only Titanic&nbsp;($2.1865B worldwide) and Avatar&nbsp;($2.788B) left in its path. Will it be able to make another billion dollars? That might be difficult but never say never with this film. Perhaps if one person wins this week’s $1.3B Powerball jackpot in the U.S., they’ll spend all their money on Star Wars tickets?In what turned out to be a close race, Leonardo DiCaprio’s best chance yet at Oscar glory The Revenant&nbsp;exploded in wide release taking in an estimated $38M from 3,375 theaters for a per screen average of $11,259, best in the top 10. If the estimates hold, it’ll be the fifth highest opening weekend in January, slipping right in between 2015’s Taken 3 ($39M) and 2014’s Lone Survivor ($37.8M). The last three years have seen five of the top six January openings. For DiCaprio, it’s his fourth biggest opening behind Shutter Island ($41M in 2010), The Great Gatsby ($50M in 2013) and Inception ($62.8M in 2010). Finally, we have a prestige pic that does well in its nationwide expansion, which should bode well for its Oscar chances.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg’s Daddy’s Home continued it’s impressive run with an estimated $15M in its third weekend, a drop of 48% from last weekend’s holiday infused grosses. Its total now stands at $116M for Paramount, a studio always in desperate need of a hit.Debuting in fourth was the horror film The Forest which made $13.1M, according to estimates, from 2,451 theaters for a per screen average of $5,340. January has always been kind to horror films and anytime you can make back your budget in a single weekend, you’re on the right path. Between this and The Revenant, audiences spent a lot of money on films that take place in between the trees.Also continuing a strong run was the tag team of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler with Sisters&nbsp;taking in an estimated $7.2M this weekend, bringing its cume after four weekends to $75M. Collapsing in sixth place was the eighth film from Quentin Tarantino, The Hateful Eight&nbsp;which fell 60% from last weekend despite adding over 450 theaters. It took in an estimated $6.35M this weekend bringing its total up to $41.5M. So let’s kindly forget my thoughts from last week where I said it had a shot at hitting $100M, shall we?Holding on in seventh place with the smallest drop in the top 10 (30%) was The Big Short which made an estimated $6.3M bringing its total up to $42.8M for Paramount. A couple of Fox films took the next two spots with Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip bringing in an estimated $5.5M lifting its total to $75M and awards-hopeful Joy&nbsp;taking in an estimated $4.5M bringing its cume up to $46M. And rounding out the top 10 was Concussion which became much more relevant after the vicious hit taken by Antonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers last night left him with a concussion. The Will Smith starrer took in $3M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $31M.Outside of the top 10 Anomalisa added 13 theaters but saw its per screen average drop from $35,000 to $13,000 with its total now at $490K.The top ten films grossed $140.6M which was up 34% from last year when Taken 3 debuted at number one with $39M; and up 25% from 2014 when Lone Survivor jumped into the top spot in its first weekend of wide release with $37.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"furious, Mary","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10170946/600StarWars6.jpg","slug":"box-office-star-wars-1-crosses-800m"},{"id":"47509104704121","title":"Box Office: Ride Along 2 Dethrones Star Wars: The Force Awakens","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Ride Along 2 Dethrones Star Wars: The Force Awakensby Gitesh Pandya | January 18, 2016 |  CommentsThis weekend, the buddy comedy sequel Ride Along 2 earned the distinction of booting all-time champ Star Wars: The Force Awakens from the number one spot pulling in an estimated $41.6M in its debut across the four-day Martin Luther King holiday period. The Universal hit averaged a terrific $13,087 from 3,175 locations and watched its domestic gross match its production budget on the opening weekend.Kevin Hart and Ice Cube reprised their roles from the 2014 smash hit and the studio even slotted the release for the same exact weekend. The sequel opened 15% below the $48.6M four-day bow of its predecessor. However, given how franchise fatigue is a bigger issue nowadays and how so many sequels open below their previous installments, Ride Along 2 ended up with a very admirable take. It ranks as the fourth best MLK weekend debut ever after American Sniper, the first Ride Along, and the J. J. Abrams-produced Cloverfield.The Friday-to-Sunday portion amassed $35.3M and gave superstar Hart his fifth $25M+ opener over the past two years which is an incredible feat. Marks from critics and moviegoers alike were more harsh this time around which is understandable for a comedy sequel intended to just entertain popcorn crowds and make cash in the process.Studio exit poll data showed that ticket sales were powered by ethnic audiences broken down by 34% black, 34% Latino, 22% white, 5% Asian, and 5% other. Cross-gender appeal was solid as the split was a nice 52/48 while 55% were under 25. Part 2 is not expected to have the legs of the first Ride Along, but a final gross near the $100M mark seems possible kicking off another good year for Universal.Ice Cube will stay in comedy-sequel mode returning to theaters in April with Barbershop: The Next Cut while Hart hits primetime with the summer action-comedy vehicle Central Intelligence teaming up with Dwayne Johnson opening in June.Holding steady at number two was Leonardo DiCaprio’s The Revenant which led all of Hollywood with 12 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, coming into the weekend. The acclaimed period drama grossed an estimated $39M over four days pushing its total up to a stellar $97.2M. This was only the Fox film’s second round of wide release and it averaged a muscular $10,958 from 3,559 locations over the long weekend.Strong reviews, awards buzz, and the starpower of the Titanic actor have all contributed to the large pull the movie has seen at the multiplexes. This is a hard movie to sell so the exclusive run over the holidays followed by the early January expansion has worked wonders. Revenant also scored points a week ago when it won big at the Golden Globes taking home Best Picture – Drama, Best Director, and Best Actor for Leo. He repeated this weekend at the Critics Choice Awards and is the clear front-runner to take home Oscar gold on February 28.Future weeks look promising for The Revenant which has plenty of untapped potential. On Tuesday or Wednesday it will become Leo’s tenth career hit to cross $100M domestic and it certainly has a shot at becoming his third to crack $200M joining the iceberg hit and Inception.After a four-week reign at number one, the all-time domestic box office champ Star Wars: The Force Awakens slipped down to third with an estimated $32.6M over the four-day extended frame. The three-day portion of $26.4M was down a reasonable 38% from last weekend vaulting the record cume to $858.5M.By comparison, the former all-time leaders from James Cameron made more in their fifth weekends (also four-day MLK frames) – $54.4M for Avatar and $36M for Titanic. All three films opened a week before Christmas and sailed into the new year still in the top spot. With no Best Picture Oscar nomination to extend its legs, the Kylo Ren film looks on course to break $900M and finish off at about $915M.3D and IMAX ticket pricing have helped in turbo-charging the grosses, as have today’s high standard ticket prices. Calculating approximate domestic admissions figures, the new Star Wars has actually sold roughly 25% fewer tickets than Titanic did during its historic run in 1997-1998 when the average movie ticket price was below $5.Overseas, Force smashed the $1 billion mark from international territories this weekend and boosted the worldwide total to $1.88 billion through Monday making it the third largest global blockbuster of all-time after Cameron’s dynamic duo. Totals (through Sunday) from the top offshore markets include the United Kingdom’s $168.6M, Germany’s $100.1M, China’s $95.2M, France’s $80M, Japan’s $73.5M, and Australia’s $60.7M. Force is on course to complete its worldwide run at about $2.1 billion which would not be enough to surpass the $2.19 billion lifetime tally of the Jack &amp; Rose romance.Michael Bay’s new military drama 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi enjoyed a decent opening in fourth place with an estimated $19.7M over the four-day frame from 2,389 theaters for a sturdy $8,225 average. Three-day figures were $16.2M and a $6,789 average. Given the scale of the release, the Paramount title scored an average that was commendable. However the gross was well below what many past military-themed hits have generated in the January-February timeframe.13 Hours opened below films like Zero Dark Thirty, Lone Survivor, and Act of Valor which all debuted in the $24-38M range. All were films about U.S. soldiers that tapped into post-holiday patriotism. Last year’s American Sniper was a monster hit opening wide to a record-shattering $107.2M this same four-day weekend, however Hours was not expected to come anywhere close to that level. Audience feedback has been very good so nice legs may result over the weeks ahead. The CinemaScore grade was an A.Cornering the mainstream comedy market over the holidays, Daddy’s Home dropped to fifth in its fourth weekend with an estimated $12M putting Paramount at a solid $132M to date. The road ahead could very well lead to a $150M finish which would be the second highest ever for Will Ferrell in the lead role of a live-action film.Failing to excite family audiences was the first new toon offering of 2016, Norm of the North. The PG-rated pic opened poorly in sixth with an estimated $9.3M from 2,411 theaters for a lackluster four-day average of $3,868. Film critics panned the movie, starpower from the voice cast was low, and there was no brand here that kids were already familiar with. And with so many kids still interested in the adventures of BB8, there were few left willing to pay to see this option. Lionsgate has a two-week run before Kung Fu Panda 3 takes away its audiences and screens.Falling to seventh place in its second weekend was the horror flick The Forest with an estimated $7M for Focus. The PG-13 chiller dropped 53% over the three-day portion which was average for the genre. Cume stands at $22.3M.Best Picture nominee The Big Short had a nice weekend taking in estimated $6.5M to raise its total to $51.8M for Paramount. Off just 14% over the Friday-to-Sunday span, the R-rated hit is showing great legs as more people become interested in the all-star vehicle which features Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt plus an assortment of bad wigs. With its Best Comedy win at the Critics Choice Awards adding to its resume, upside potential is substantial over the weeks ahead as it sits as a major contender that also overflows with starpower and timely subject matter.Former Golden Globe hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler followed with their R-rated comedy hit Sisters which grossed an estimated $5.5M putting Universal at $82M overall. A solid final of about $90M seems likely. Add in Amy Schumer’s Trainwreck and Melissa McCarthy’s Spy and audiences have already spent over $300M on the raunchy funny ladies of 2015.Quentin Tarantino is seeing some of the lowest numbers of his career with his latest project The Hateful Eight which has been fading fast. The Weinstein Co. release made an estimated $4.4M over the long weekend for a new cume of $48.6M. The final gross should be roughly $55M which will be the lowest gross for a Tarantino solo effort since 1997’s Jackie Brown. Starpower and awards buzz are both significantly less this time compared to the director’s last film Django Unchained which ended up winning a pair of major Oscars.Below the top ten, Oscar contenders saw strong results following the announcements of Academy Award nominations on Thursday with many Best Picture contenders seeing their weekend grosses shoot upwards. Spotlight, which also took home the Critics Choice Award for Best Picture on Sunday night, grossed an estimated $2.1M boosting Open Road’s cume to $31.1M. The three-day portion enjoyed a healthy 78% surge from last weekend with added screens helping too.Fox Searchlight’s period drama Brooklyn collected an estimated $2.2M for a new sum of $25.2M. Room expanded wider and grossed an estimated $893,000 over four days giving A24 $6.2M to date. Increases over the Friday-to-Sunday period were 68% and 504%, respectively. In its 16th frame, Ridley Scott’s The Martian did not expand but it did see its weekend take a nice 21% uptick to an estimated $555,000. Cume through Monday is a giant $227.2M and by the end of the week it will surpass The Bourne Ultimatum to become Matt Damon’s highest grossing film ever.Films not making the cut for a Best Picture Oscar nod but earning nominations in other categories like acting fared well too as they tried to reach broader audiences. The Weinstein Co. romance Carol took in an estimated $1.8M while Focus saw an estimated $898,000 for The Danish Girl. New cumes are $9.5M and $8.9M, respectively. The three-day figures suffered only minor drops.The top ten films grossed an estimated $177.5M over four days which was down 20% from last year when American Sniper opened at number one with a record $107.2M; but even with 2014 when Ride Along debuted in the top spot with $48.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Awards","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/18130627/RideAlongBO1.jpg","slug":"box-office-ride-along-2-dethrones-star-wars-the-force-awakens"},{"id":"47509106430599","title":"Box Office: Steve Jobs, The Martian Fry Pan","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Steve Jobs, The Martian Fry Panby Gitesh Pandya | October 11, 2015 |  CommentsAudiences continued to send their money to Mars, a reimagining of a classic fairy tale opened to disappointing numbers, one film expanded into a disaster and one film exploded in limited release.For a second straight weekend, The Martian took the top spot at the box office, slipping a slight 32% to an estimated $37M, bringing its total to $109M. The fall was a bit larger than fellow outer space thriller Gravity had in its second weekend when it fell only 23%. If The Martian travels along the same path it could hit $210M by the end of its run. Of course Gravity had the added benefit of immediately becoming an Oscar favorite while the buzz for The Martian is strong, but not as strong.Sony’s animated sequel Hotel Transylvania 2 dropped a slim 39% in its third trip around the multiplexes, taking in an estimated $20.3M this weekend, bringing its total up to $116.8M. It’s still ahead of the original’s $102M after its third weekend which means we should be hearing of a greenlight for the third film any minute now…Opening poorly in third place was the Warner Bros. reimagining of the classic Peter Pan story, Pan. With an estimated budget of $150M, the film took in an estimated $15.5M this weekend from 3,515 theaters for a dismal per screen average of $4,418. A mediocre result for most films it looks even worse for a film of this magnitude. Critics have ravaged the film, which is sitting at 23% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences have been enjoying it a bit more, giving it a B+ CinemaScore, but unless international audiences take a shine to it, this is going to be a costly mistake for the studio.On the other end of the scale, studio stablemate The Intern had the lowest drop in the top 10, slipping only 26% to an estimated $8.6 this weekend, bringing its total up to $49.6 on an estimated $35-40M budget. But who do you think will get to direct another movie first, Pan‘s Joe Wright or The Intern‘s Nancy Meyers?Critical darling Sicario landed in fifth place this weekend with an estimated $7.4M bringing its total after a month to $27.7M. Sixth place belonged to Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials which made $5.3M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to $70.6M.Expanding out of IMAX and into theaters everywhere, The Walk hit a proverbial wall this weekend, taking in an estimated $3.7M for a dismal per screen average of $1,455. Critics loved the film but it seems no one wanted to go see it. Cume now stands at $6.4M. In eighth place was the Johnny Depp-starrer Black Mass which earned an estimated $3.1M this weekend bringing its total up to $57.6M after four weeks.Universal took the final two positions in the top 10 with their mountain climbing thriller Everest&nbsp;which took in $3M, according to estimates, and The Visit which scared up an estimated $2.4M this weekend. Totals now stand at $38M and $61M respectively.Debuting outside the top 10 was Steve Jobs which took in an estimated $521,000 from only 4 theaters for a per screen average of a scorching $130,250. And everyone knows, Oscar loves biopics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $106.3M which was down 19% from last year when Gone Girl remained at number one with $26.4M; and up 3% from 2013 when Gravity also repeated at number one with $43.1M. Compared to projections, Pan came in just a little below Gitesh’s $17M forecast.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"space","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/600TheMartian2.jpg","slug":"box-office-steve-jobs-the-martian-fry-pan"},{"id":"47509106443916","title":"The Box Office Has Its Worst Labor Day Weekend in 15 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Box Office Has Its Worst Labor Day Weekend in 15 YearsFaith-Based Film War Room Edges Out Comptonby Gitesh Pandya | September 6, 2015 |  CommentsAudiences yawned at Hollywood’s offerings and avoided North American multiplexes driving the box office to the worst Labor Day weekend performance in 15 years. The Top 20 films sold just $79 million worth of tickets over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long holiday frame. Though typically a slow summer-ending weekend, the Labor&nbsp;Day frame is usually good for $90 to 110 million for the Top 20 over three days. No film managed to break double digit millions this weekend.Holdovers led as the low-budget faith-based hit War Room rose from second to first place thanks in part to a 34 percent boost in screens. The Sony title grossed an estimated $9.4 million, off 18 percent, and raised its total to $24.7 million. It only cost $3.5 million to produce but may reach about $50 million by the end of its run.After three weeks at number one, Straight Outta Compton slipped down to the runner-up spot for the three-day session, but still has a shot at being number one for the full four-day holiday span. Regardless of bragging rights to the top spot, the Universal sensation is still playing well with an estimated $8.9 million for the weekend, off 33 percent. The cume rose to $147.8 million and is expected to crack $150 million on Labor Day — something nobody expected at the start of the summer movie season.The Robert Redford–Nick Nolte outdoors film A Walk in the Woods debuted to solid results in third place exceeding expectations. The Broad Green release bowed to an estimated $8.1 million over three days for a $4,133 average and has grossed $10.2 million since its Wednesday launch. Rated R, Woods earned mixed reviews and a B CinemaScore grade.One of the year’s most popular action films Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation followed in fourth with an estimated $7.2 million dipping only 12 percent for a robust $180.4 million to date. The Paramount hit joined Jurassic World as the only movies this summer to spend six weekends in the top five. The global cume crossed the half-billion mark with $511 million and China opens this Tuesday, which is sure to send the total well past $600 million this month.Actions fans did not feel the need to come out for The Transporter Refueled,&nbsp;which opened very wide with 3,434 locations but debuted to just $7.1 million, according to estimates, for a poor $2,076 average. The EuropaCorp release saw bad reviews and the lack of Jason Statham — who anchored the first three films in the franchise — certainly diluted interest. Studios have long relied on young males to power them at the box office, especially in the summertime. But among the two new wide releases, the older-skewing Woods opened better despite having almost half the screens. Demos for Transporter were 60 percent male and 60 percent between ages 18 and 34 and international markets are where this one will see the bulk of its revenue potential.The Weinstein Co. saw its Owen Wilson film No Escape drop 33 percent to an estimated $5.4 million, pushing the modest sum to $18.4 million. The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&nbsp;grossed an estimated $3.4 million, off 22 percent, and has banked $39.4 million for Warner Bros.Lionsgate scored big with Latino family audiences as its new animated rooster comedy Un gallo con muchos huevos&nbsp;debuted to strong numbers grossing an estimated $3.4 million from only 395 locations for a terrific $8,608 average. The PG-13 toon was slotted into this school holiday frame and connected with its target audience. The distributor expects $4.4 million over the four-day session.Falling 28 percent was the horror sequel Sinister 2 with an estimated $3.4 million and $23.7 million overall for Focus. Disney and Pixar rounded out the top ten with the expanding Inside Out which jumped back onto the list with an estimated $3.1 million, pushing the cume to $348.2 million domestic and $734.4 million worldwide with China, Germany, and Italy yet to open.The top ten films grossed an estimated $59.4 million over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long holiday weekend which was down 29 percent from last year’s Labor Day when Guardians of the Galaxy held number one with $17.1 million; and down 30 percent from 2013’s holiday when The Butler stayed in the top spot with $14.9 million.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Grammys","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/war-room-the-movie-tyndale-02-600.jpg","slug":"box-office-has-its-worst-labor-day-weekend-in-15-years"},{"id":"47509104727682","title":"Box Office: Spectre Breaks Half Billion Worldwide, Still #1 in America","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Spectre Breaks Half Billion Worldwide, Still #1 in Americaby Gitesh Pandya | November 15, 2015 |  CommentsThe spy blockbuster Spectre&nbsp;held onto the number one spot with ease in its sophomore frame falling a reasonable 50% to an estimated $35.4M pushing the domestic cume to a solid $130.7M. The Sony smash suffered a smaller decline than Skyfall‘s 54% and Quantum of Solace‘s 60%, partly due to significantly less competition from new releases. Cumulative weekend grosses for new competitors was $98M for Quantum, $165M for Skyfall, but a mere $18M for Spectre.&nbsp;The last two James Bond flicks had new Twilight movies opening on their second weekends while this weekend saw no new releases reach double digit millions.The more friendly marketplace will allow the latest 007 pic to collect more during the week ahead before Thursday night’s launch of the franchise-ending tentpole The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2 which is expected to bow to $120M or more. A domestic final in the area of $220M may result for Spectre&nbsp;which has been generating decent but not stellar buzz from ticket buyers.The new Bond enjoyed a giant opening in China on Friday locking down an estimated $48.1M in its first weekend in the lucrative market including $4.6M from 246 IMAX screens. That stands as the largest opening weekend ever there for a 2D-only Hollywood film. Skyfall grossed $59M in China across its entire run and with all the growth there over the past three years, Spectre&nbsp;is headed for a sharply higher haul. The overall international weekend hauled in an estimated $152.6M from 91 markets pushing the offshore total to $413.1M (including $121M from the U.K.) and the global gross to $543.8M on its way to a possible billion.Staying in second place for a second weekend was the animated family comedy The Peanuts Movie with an estimated $24.2M falling by 45%. That’s a bigger drop than the 38% of last year’s Big Hero 6 and the 33% of 2012’s Wreck-it Ralph. Both of those launched on the first weekend of November as well, but were not based on such a broadly known property like Charlie Brown. Peanuts has banked $82.5M to date and may end up in the $150-160M range for Fox.The Christmas comedy Love the Coopers was panned by critics, but moviegoers showed up in decent numbers giving the film an opening weekend of $8.4M from 2,603 theaters for a mild $3,227 average. Released by CBS and Lionsgate, the PG-13 pic featured an ensemble cast that included Olivia Wilde, Amanda Seyfried, Marisa Tomei, Diane Keaton, John Goodman, and Ed Helms so the value pack of familiar names amounted to something. The audience was 70% female and 82% over 25. Coopers hopes to play through the Thanksgiving holiday attracting a mature audience that comes out over time, though shaky word-of-mouth will make that challenging.Spending its seventh weekend in the top five, Fox’s The Martian dipped only 26% to an estimated $6.7M and lifted its sum to an amazing $207.4M. It is only the second October film in history to reach $200M+ following Gravity. The latest flop for Warner Bros. came in the form of a mining disaster drama as The 33 debuted to an estimated $5.8M from 2,452 sites for a miserable $2,384 average. Starring Antonio Banderas, the PG-13 film was not liked by film critics.Sony’s Goosebumps fared well in its fifth weekend slipping 32% to an estimated $4.7M pushing the cume to $73.5M. Bridge of Spies has banked $61.7M over the same number of weeks and grossed an estimated $4.3M this weekend dipping 27% for Disney. The new Hindi-language film Prem Ratan Dhan Payo opened in eighth place with an estimated $2.4M from 286 theaters for a $8,392 average for FIP. It was the fourth largest Bollywood opening ever in North America and the cume since the Thursday launch is $2.8M.The animated hit Hotel Transylvania 2 became the highest grossing film of Adam Sandler’s career after this weekend’s estimated $2.4M (off 35%) raised the total to $165.2M surpassing the $163.5M of Big Daddy which had been the funnyman’s top film since 1999. Vin Diesel rounded out the top ten with The Last Witch Hunter which took in an estimated $1.5M, down 42%, for a $26.1M.The PG-rated football drama My All American failed to connect with moviegoers debuting outside the top ten with an estimated $1.4M from 1,565 locations for a puny $889 average for Clarius. In order to keep good relations going with Angelina Jolie-Pitt, Universal released her latest directorial effort By The Sea which stars her and husband Brad Pitt but was met with audience indifference. The R-rated relationship drama bowed in ten theaters and grossed an estimated $95,000 for a weak $9,500 average. Reviews were mostly negative for the vanity project and the exclusive play plus big starpower did not add up to packed houses.Among expanding sophomore holdovers in specialty release, Spotlight fared well with an estimated $1.4M from 60 locations for a solid $23,300 average for Open Road. Fox Searchlight’s Brooklyn collected an estimated $485,000 from 23 sites for a similar $21,087 average. Totals are $1.8M and $833,000 respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $95.8M which was down 24% from last year when Dumb and Dumber To opened at number one with $36.1M; and down 17% from 2013 when Thor: The Dark World debuted in the top spot with $36.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"RT, Discovery, medical, Quiz, Superheroes, golden, dogs, Studios, Heroines, south, e.","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15233310/James-Bond-breaks.jpg","slug":"box-office-spectre-breaks-half-billion-worldwide-still-1-in-america"},{"id":"47509106435720","title":"The Martian Lands at Number One This Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Martian Lands at Number One This WeekendRidley Scott's Space Odyssey Ties Gravity for the Second-Largest Opening in Octoberby Gitesh Pandya | October 4, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend Matt Damon scored the second biggest opening of his career – and best for a non-sequel – with the space saga&nbsp;The Martian&nbsp;which opened triumphantly at number one with an estimated $55 million. Directed by Ridley Scott, the PG-13 pic earned sensational reviews across the board and averaged a stellar $14,357 from 3,831 locations. If estimates hold, it will be the second largest October opening of all-time nearly matching current leader&nbsp;Gravity&nbsp;which bowed to $55.8 million this same weekend in 2013. That sci-fi drama, which would go on to win seven Oscars, ran about 50 minutes shorter and had more daily showtimes.Damon’s only bigger opening was the $69.3 million of 2007’s&nbsp;The Bourne Ultimatum&nbsp;which had a large built-in fan base for the actor’s signature role. And Fox’s Martian&nbsp;also beat out the opening weekends of other big sci-fi players like&nbsp;Interstellar‘s $47.5M from last year and the $51.1M of Scott’s own&nbsp;Prometheus&nbsp;from 2012. Those are some big films to surpass.Martian not only won over film critics, it also scored big with paying audiences too. The A grade from CinemaScore indicates great word-of-mouth ahead.&nbsp;Gravity two years ago enjoyed a prolonged run breaking $250 million that year before adding more later from a re-release during Oscar season. Competition will not be very fierce next weekend so a solid sophomore frame should be on the horizon as it races to the century mark.Studio research showed that the audience was 56 percent male and 72 percent over 25. The Martian&nbsp;scored with 3D as the format represented 45 percent of the box office which is impressive by today’s standards. IMAX screens were booked up by&nbsp;The Walk&nbsp;but other premium large format screens contributed 11 percent of the take with the studio reporting they ran at near-capacity levels.The Martian launched in 40 percent of the international marketplace this weekend with an estimated $45.2 million making for a global debut of $100.2 million. Next weekend will see openings in Germany, Russia, and South Korea and the global potential for a sci-fi film like this is enormous.With good buzz and nothing new for kids coming out, Sony’s&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 2&nbsp;enjoyed a terrific hold in its second weekend grossing an estimated $33 million. The Adam Sandler animated comedy declined by just 32 percent which was better than the first film’s 36 percent and the 38 percent of the studio’s recent toon sequel&nbsp;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. All films opened on the last weekend of September.&nbsp;Hotel Transylvania 2&nbsp;sits at $90.5 million which is 18 percent ahead of its 2012 predecessor and could be headed for the $175 million range by the end of its domestic run. Competing studios have left October open in terms of new animated offerings so competition will be mild in the weeks ahead, especially for younger children.Lionsgate saw a moderately good result for the nationwide expansion of its drug cartel thriller&nbsp;Sicario&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $12.1 million from 2,620 locations for a decent $4,609 average. The R-rated Emily Blunt pic scored muscular numbers in limited release for two weeks, but attracting discerning adult audiences this weekend against The Martian&nbsp;proved to be a challenge. With $15.1 million to date, the well-reviewed film still hopes to keep it going as word-of-mouth spreads. The CinemaScore grade was a favorable A-.Oscar winners Anne Hathaway and Robert De Niro took fourth place with their comedy&nbsp;The Intern&nbsp;which held well in its sophomore frame slipping only 35 percent. Warner Bros. has collected $36.5 million to date and could be headed for an admirable $65-70 million finish.It was a good third weekend for the sci-fi sequel&nbsp;Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials&nbsp;which grossed an estimated $7.7 million slipping 46 percent. Fox’s cume is now $63.2 million which is 14 percent behind the pace of last fall’s predecessor. Johnny Depp‘s crime saga&nbsp;Black Mass&nbsp;fell 47 percent to an estimated $5.9 million giving Warner Bros. $52.5 million to date.Universal contributed the next two most popular movies this weekend. The mountain adventure&nbsp;Everest&nbsp;lost its IMAX screens to&nbsp;The Walk&nbsp;and tumbled 58 percent to an estimated $5.5 million from conventional playdates for a total of $33.2 million. The studio’s low-budget thriller&nbsp;The Visit&nbsp;fared well for a fright flick and dipped 41 percent to an estimated $4 million raising the total to $57.7 million. After many turbulent years with audiences and critics, M. Night Shyamalan can now claim the highest grossing horror movie of the year. And Visit&nbsp;cost only $5 million to produce plus extra for marketing.Sony rounded out the top ten with two low-cost hits led by black casts that have grossed over $113 million together. The faith-based drama&nbsp;War Room&nbsp;made an estimated $2.8 million, off 34 percent, for a new cume of $60.5 million. Dropping 50 percent to an estimated $2.4 million was the romantic thriller&nbsp;The Perfect Guy&nbsp;which has scared up $52.6 million to date.Opening outside the top ten with lackluster results was the Robert Zemeckis film The Walk&nbsp;which debuted exclusively in IMAX and other PLF screens to the tune of $1.6 million from 448 locations for a disappointing $3,460 average. The PG-rated drama starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and telling the true story of the man who walked between the Twin Towers in 1974 on a highwire tried to make itself a special event with premium screens only on the first weekend.But its target audience of mature adults was busy with The Martian and Sicario opening nationwide, plus those who like higher-priced IMAX thrills just spent cash a couple of weeks ago on Everest&nbsp;which bowed to a much better $7.2 million from 545 screens. Sony goes nationwide next weekend with The Walk&nbsp;in over 2,500 locations and will need to really energize audiences if it wants to have those cash registers ringing. Reviews were very positive.The top ten films grossed an estimated $139.9 million which was up 3 percent from last year when&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;opened at number one with $37.5 million; and up 26 percent from 2013 when Gravity&nbsp;debuted in the top spot with&nbsp;$55.8 million.Compared to projections, The Martian&nbsp;soared higher than my $41 million forecast while Sicario was on target with my $13 million prediction.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on&nbsp;Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"streaming, TV+, Cosplay, on, E3, elm, Disney, fresh, John, impossible, San, rings, IFC, adventure","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Martian-600.jpg","slug":"the-martian-lands-at-number-one-this-weekend"},{"id":"47509106441867","title":"The Perfect Guy Edges Out The Visit At the Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})The Perfect Guy Edges Out The Visit At the Box OfficePlus, faith-based film 90 Minutes in Heaven disappoints, and No Escape and The Transporter Refueled continue to tumble.by Gitesh Pandya | September 13, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, rebounding from the worst Labor Day box office in 15 years, North American multiplexes attracted crowds again as two new low-cost thrillers opened very well targeting — and &nbsp;connecting with — different audiences. It was also the first time ever that two films opened north of $25M each on the same weekend in the traditionally weak month of September.The romantic thriller The Perfect Guy scored a muscular number one debut opening to an estimated $26.7M from 2,221 theaters for a sensational $12,022 average. With ample starpower from Sanaa Lathan, Morris Chestnut, and Michael Ealy, the PG-13 pic cost only $12M to produce and will be a nice little moneymaker for Sony. The studio used this same weekend last year for the thriller No Good Deed which bowed to $24.3M and a stellar $11,150 average targeting the same audience at the same time.Guy‘s CinemaScore grade came in at a solid A-, although other metrics show lower satisfaction rates from consumers. As expected, women led with a very high 69% of the business and those over 25 were 58% of the crowd. Starpower and an intriguing look trumped bad reviews. A final gross north of $50M seems likely.With The Perfect Guy, the box office has now been ruled for five straight weeks by films led by African-American casts following last week’s War Room and the runaway blockbuster Straight Outta Compton which sat at number one for three weekends.After a string of flops, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan delivered a strong result with the opening of his new low-budget thriller The Visit which debuted close behind in second place with an estimated $25.7M exceeding industry expectations. It was the biggest horror opening of 2015 and with a budget of only $5M, the PG-13 chiller is on firm financial footing. The Universal release averaged a stellar $8,370 from 3,069 locations. The Blumhouse name certainly helped too.Young women and ethnic audiences contributed greatly to the success for The Visit which is often the case for suspense thrillers. Females made up 60% of the crowd, 48% were under 21, and 61% were non-white. Often the target of critics, Shyamalan saw generally good reviews this time and audiences were satisfied too. The B- CinemaScore grade was better than what scary films typically get.The faith-based hit War Room dropped from first to third with an estimated $7.4M, off just 22%. Sony has banked $39.2M to date. Broad Green slipped 44% with the second weekend of A Walk in the Woods which grossed an estimated $4.6M for $19.9M thus far.Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation fell 43% to an estimated $4.2M lifting the impressive cume to $188.2M for Paramount. The spy flick stands as the only summer movie to spend seven weeks in the top five. For the entire year, Furious 7 is the only other one to do it. MI5 also enjoyed a monster debut in China with a colossal $86M across six days, lifting the global tally to $613M on its way to smashing $700M soon.Late summer smash Straight Outta Compton dropped 53% to an estimated $4.1M in its fifth round and has collected a sturdy $155.7M for Universal. Falling 47% to an estimated $2.9M was No Escape, which has taken in just $24.2M for The Weinstein Co. EuropaCorp’s action film The Transporter Refueled fell apart in its second weekend, to nobody’s surprise. Tumbling 63% in its sophomore frame, the non-Statham flick grossed an estimated $2.7M for a weak $13.3M to date.Opening in ninth place was the new faith-based drama 90 Minutes in Heaven which debuted to an estimated $2.2M from 878 locations for a lackluster $2,461 average. Based on a best-selling book, the PG-13 pic stars Hayden Christensen and Kate Bosworth and did not connect with its target audience the way many others from recent years have. The Spanish-language toon Un Gallo con Muchos Huevos expanded screens but still fell by 45% to an estimated $1.9M in its second weekend. Lionsgate has taken in $6.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.3M, which was up 12% from last year when No Good Deed opened at number one with $24.3M; but off 5% from 2013 when Insidious Chapter 2 debuted in the top spot with $40.3M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Musical, and, TV, review, game, Paramount, Epix, Purge, blaxploitation, and, Network, rotten","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/ThePerfectGuyBO.jpg","slug":"the-perfect-guy-edges-out-the-visit-at-the-box-office"},{"id":"47509106445965","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 3 New Titles Enter Soft Late Summer Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 3 New Titles Enter Soft Late Summer Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | August 30, 2015 |  CommentsThree more wide releases enter the marketplace looking to pick up whatever scraps are left of the summer box office. Leading the way could be the film with the least number of screens. The faith-based drama War Room tops the freshman class in advance ticket sales and momentum may carry it into a strong debut with a rock solid average.Sony should see a substantial portion of the business come from African American audiences with females likely to outnumber males. The few reviews that come out will be irrelevant as far as commercial potential goes. Opening in over 1,100 theaters, War Room may debut to about $8M this weekend.Owen Wilson enters action hero territory with No Escape starring opposite former 007 Pierce Brosnan. The R-rated international thriller from The Weinstein Co. will play to mature adults who have better movie options right now, and many non-movie distractions as well. This one has VOD written all over it, despite a very aggressive roll-out for a late August flick. The Wednesday launch resulted in a modest $1.2M and the five-day bow should not be very impressive. Playing in 3,355 locations by Friday, No Escape might open to around $8M for the weekend and $10M across five days.Zac Efron goes into DJ mode with the drama We Are Your Friends which is targeting older teens and young adults. The former squeaky clean Disney star has done a terrific job jumping into more mature roles and R-rated films and still selling tickets. This offering, however, has little heat and is unlikely to make much. Reviews have been mixed. Opening in over 2,200 locations, We Are Your Friends could debut to about $6M.Hoping to become only the second movie all summer to three-peat (a dino-sequel being the other) Straight Outta Compton should suffer a smaller decline than last time and may slide by 45%. That would give Universal about $14.5M in its third frame and a new cume of $135M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Trivia, documentaries, History, Alien, mission:, hard, of, Video, video, Access, australia, language, your, Fall, concert","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/No-Escape-BOG.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-3-new-titles-enter-soft-late-summer-weekend"},{"id":"47509106428550","title":"Box Office: Goosebumps Scares Off Its Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Goosebumps Scares Off Its CompetitionThe Martian follows close behind, with Bridge of Spies and Crimson Peak pulling into third and fourth.by Gitesh Pandya | October 18, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, kid-friendly scares ruled as the PG-rated fright comedy Goosebumps opened at number one with $23.5M to lead the North American box office. Sony’s fourth number one hit of the last seven weeks averaged a good $6,712 from 3,501 locations with many offering it in 3D.With a known brand (over 400 million books sold worldwide) and a mid-October launch date that gives it two full weeks of play before Halloween, Goosebumps connected with its target audience of kids and parents following in the footsteps of the studio’s Hotel Transylvania 2 from last month.A promising A CinemaScore grade indicates positive buzz from paying customers which should help over the next few weeks. Jack Black provided a bit of starpower and worked the talk show circuit to convince parents to hit the theaters for a mix of spooky scares and laughs. Reviews were quite good for the $58M production. Bringing an older kid property to the big screen is always a challenge as today’s children will not always find it relevant. But Goosebumps scored and should enjoy a bright road ahead.Following its two-week reign at number one, Matt Damon’s The Martian slipped to the runner-up spot grossing an estimated $21.5M. Off a reasonable 42%, the Ridley Scott film has now banked $143.8M making it the third highest-grossing film ever for the esteemed director after 2000’s Gladiator ($187.7M) and the following year’s Hannibal ($165.1M). A final domestic take of about $200M seems likely.Prolific director Steven Spielberg had the first October release of his long career with the Cold War drama Bridge of Spies which debuted in third with an estimated $15.4M. The Tom Hanks starrer averaged a middling $5,471 per theater from 2,811 locations delivering only a moderate turnout. It was well below the openings of other recent star-driven October dramas like Fury ($23.7M), Argo ($19.5M), and the Hanks hit Captain Phillips ($25.7M). Spielberg’s Lincoln opened against the second weekend of Skyfall in 2012 plus had 1,000 fewer theaters than Spies and still bowed to a stronger $21M frame.Reviews were fantastic for Spies. Given the A-listers behind and in front of the camera, a bigger debut would have been expected. Certainly Martian is pulling away older adults right now and has been performing better than anticipated. Disney’s marketing push on Bridge has also been formidable so awareness among the target audience is high.October is a great month for scary movies, but Guillermo del Toro’s new supernatural thriller Crimson Peak attracted just a mild debut, opening to an estimated $12.9M from 2,984 locations for a not-so-spooky $4,305 average. It was well below last October’s fright offerings Dracula Untold and Ouija which opened to $23.5M and $19.9M, respectively. Familiar brands helped bring in sales for those which Peak lacked.Reviews for the R-rated Crimson were fairly decent and the audience gave a B- grade from CinemaScore which is good for this genre. Studio research showed that the crowd was 60% female, 55% over 25, and 52% white. Despite a good pre-Halloween release date, a name director known for creepy fare, and zero horror competition, ticket buyers just did not come out in large numbers for this offering.Toon titan Hotel Transylvania 2 followed with an estimated $12.3M, off 40%, for a new total of $136.4M. The Sony sequel is running 15% ahead of its 2012 predecessor and could surpass that film’s final total next weekend. Mega-flop Pan tumbled 62% from its lousy opening weekend to grab an estimated $5.9M bringing the total to a disastrous $25.7M for the $150M-budgeted adventure from Warner Bros. A horrible $35M final seems likely adding to a string of underperformers for the studio this year.The Intern continued to play well with adult women grossing an estimated $5.4M and slipping 38% for Warner Bros. Lionsgate saw its drug drama Sicario fall 41% to an estimated $4.5M. Cumes stand at $58.7M and $34.7M, respectively.The new high school football drama Woodlawn debuted in ninth place with modest results grossing an estimated $4.1M from 1,553 sites for a weak $2,640 average for Pure Flix. Fox’s action sequel Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials dropped 49% to an estimated $2.8M lifting the sum to $75.4M which is 17% behind where the first Maze was at the same point last fall.Universal is taking it slow and steady and is earning big rewards for its awards contender Steve Jobs, which almost jumped into the top ten despite playing in only 60 locations. The second weekend expansion for the Danny Boyle hit saw an estimated $1.6M in ticket sales for a potent $25,833 average with a nationwide roll-out into 2,400 locations set for this Friday. Cume is $2.3M.Making a sparkling debut in platform release was the Toronto International Film Festival’s Audience Award winner Room with an estimated $120,000 from just four sites in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $30,000 average. Reviews were glowing across the board and A24 will expand to five more markets next weekend as it rolls out the film slowly hoping to capitalize on building buzz as more and more audiences see it and start talking about it.The top ten films grossed an estimated $108.1M which was down 6% from last year when Fury opened at number one with $23.7M; but up 19% from 2013 when Gravity remained in the top spot for a third time with $30M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"HBO, Plus, Disney, deadpool, Film, dogs, universal, service, TV","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GoosebumpsBO.jpg","slug":"box-office-goosebumps-scares-off-its-competition"},{"id":"47509107625619","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Little Minions Open Huge","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Little Minions Open HugeJurassic World and Inside Out round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 12, 2015 |  CommentsThe looney toon Minions towered over the competition opening at number one by a mile generating the second largest opening weekend in history for any animated film. Universal’s much-hyped kidpic grossed an estimated $115.2M since its debut Thursday night with 6pm pre-shows. Averaging a muscular $26,784 from 4,301 locations, the PG-rated spinoff opened bigger than every past toon except for Shrek the Third’s $121.6M from May 2007.Minions doubled the $56.4M bow of 2010’s franchise founder Despicable Me. Its sequel launched on the Wednesday before the Fourth of July holiday weekend in 2013 with $143.1M over five days including $83.5M over the weekend portion. The Minions’ strength showed that audiences were still hungry for another story featuring the bumbling yellow sidekicks even if Steve Carell’s Gru character was no longer the central figure. Other toon spinoffs like Puss in Boots and Penguins of Madagascar did not post openings anything close to their prior franchise sequels.The weekend began with $46.2M on Friday including $6.2M from Thursday pre-shows. Saturday dipped 16% to $39M while Sunday is projected to fall 23% to $30M. A larger Sunday decline would put the weekend in the $110-115M range. After Furious 7 and Jurassic World, three of the four biggest opening weekends of 2015 have come from Universal and all eight of the top debuts for the year have been from either it or Disney. The two studios have dominated the movie industry this year but the Mouse House will be fighting back with next weekend’s Marvel pic Ant-Man and the next Star Wars movie arriving in mid-December.A broad audience showed up for Minions which stormed into multiplexes backed by a tremendous marketing push. 59% of the crowd was female, 55% was under 25, and 55% was non-white. 40% of the crowd was non-family showing how much appeal this picture had as a broad comedy playing to young adults. With an A CinemaScore and not much else for kids coming in July, look for the domestic total to soar past $300M just like Despicable Me 2‘s did.Overseas where it got its start earlier, the weekend brought in a mammoth $124.3M from 56 markets including 30 which opened. With $280.5M to date from international territories, Minions stands at $395.7M worldwide and could very well be on its way to joining the billion dollar club. To date, the three Despicable Me films have grossed a massive $1.9 billion.Summer juggernaut Jurassic World has spent all five of its weekends in the top two positions now. The dino-smash dropped just 38% to an estimated $18.1M giving Universal the gold and silver this weekend. World boosted its domestic cume to a staggering $590.7M and could break the $600M mark by Friday.Overseas, the monster hit collected an estimated $21.7M this weekend from 65 territories lifting the international haul to $875.2M propelling the global gross to a stunning $1.47 billion. In another week, Jurassic World will surpass Universal’s own Furious 7 to become the fourth biggest worldwide blockbuster of all-time. Japan, the final market, is still to open on August 5.Dropping from first to third place was Pixar’s Inside Out which still held up well despite the direct competition from another major animated comedy. The Disney release grossed an estimated $17.1M in its fourth frame, off 43%, raising the cume to $283.6M passing Pixar’s last film Monsters University from two summers ago. Inside Out has also banked $151.8M overseas with half of the international marketplace still to come. Worldwide sits at $435.4M with plenty to come as top markets like China, Japan, Germany, and the U.K. have not opened yet.Down 49% in its second weekend, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator Genisys ranked fourth with an estimated $13.7M still making it the lowest-grossing Terminator sequel ever. With $68.7M after 12 days, the PG-13 flick is running 26% behind the pace of 2009’s Terminator Salvation and 38% behind Terminator 3 from 2003. Looking at estimated admissions, Genisys has sold less than half as many tickets as Terminator 3 did from a dozen years ago over the same part of the calendar. A domestic final of just around $100M seems likely.A tentpole like Genisys was always made with international audiences in mind. An overseas weekend estimate of $47.3M boosted the offshore cume to $156.1M and the global gross to $225M. Unlike in North America, the film is outgunning many recent action and sci-fi hits abroad. After China gets its release, Terminator Genisys could find its way to about $450M worldwide with two sequels already on the calendar for the summers of 2017 and 2018.The horror entry The Gallows debuted in fifth place with an estimated $10M from 2,720 locations for a mild $3,682 average. Audience demos came out as expected for the R-rated thriller with 52% being female and 53% being under 25. A C grade from CinemaScore puts it in the normal zone for fright flicks.Stripper sequel Magic Mike XXL posted a solid sophomore hold in part due to its target audience of adult women being heavily distracted last weekend because of holiday activities. The Channing Tatum flick grossed an estimated $9.6M, off only 25%, for a $48.4M total for Warner Bros. Friday continues to be the night this audience is coming out on. A $70M final is possible for the inexpensive $14M production. Off 50% in its third round was Ted 2 with an estimated $5.6M giving Universal $71.6M to date. It will fail to reach nine-digit territory – a rare case for its studio lately.Audiences showed virtually no interest in the new sci-fi thriller Self/Less which debuted quietly in eighth place with an estimated $5.4M from 2,171 locations for a weak $2,579 average. Released by the rebooted Gramercy label of Focus, the PG-13 film starring Ryan Reynolds and Ben Kingsley was panned by critics.The canine film Max took in an estimated $3.4M, off 48%, pushing its total to $33.7M for Warner Bros. Melissa McCarthy scored her fourth $100M+ R-rated comedy hit in as many years with Spy which slipped 42% to an estimated $3M giving Fox $103.5M to date.Indian films often do well in the North American market, but their distributors rarely report opening weekend estimates on Sundays. Though no official data was reported, the Telugu-language historical epic Baahubali generated a mammoth debut generating somewhere in the area of $4M+ from Thursday night through Sunday. Touted as India’s most expensive film and filled with visual effects, the movie won universal praise from the country’s film critics helping to drive excitement. About 170 theaters in North America were playing it with Tamil and Hindi dubs contributing a small portion and the Telugu version seeing the vast majority of the sales. With some venues playing multiple languages the total screen count was over 200. The incredible weekend average was in the $20,000 range.As is often the case with A-list films from South India, ticket prices were much higher for the premiere shows on Thursday and Friday with many locations charging in the $20 to $28 range per ticket which helped the overall gross swell. By comparison, the largest Bollywood opening weekend ever here was $3.6M from 272 locations last December for Aamir Khan’s PK which had standard pricing and not much coming from Thursday pre-shows. Baahubali has been well-received by audiences so it may not erode as quickly as most Indian commercial films do. Given that only a fraction of the Indian-American population speaks Telugu, this opening weekend performance was jaw-dropping – and possibly record-breaking if and when official numbers get reported.The top ten films grossed an estimated $201.2M which was up 50% from last year when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes opened at number one with $72.6M; and up 10% from 2013 when Despicable Me 2 stayed in the top spot with $43.9M.Follow BOG on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"FX, name, Lionsgate, Universe, toronto, romance","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Minions-CC.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-little-minions-open-huge"},{"id":"47509106449039","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Straight Outta Compton Drops at Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Straight Outta Compton Drops at Number OnePlus, Man from U.N.C.L.E. makes a disappointing debutby Sujit Chawla | August 16, 2015 |  CommentsIn what can be described as right film, right place, right time, Universal’s Straight Outta Compton blitzed the box office this weekend, while the other wide opener crashed and burned.Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and the boys of N.W.A. took control of the box office 27 years after their debut album took the nation by storm. This weekend Straight Outta Compton took in an estimated $56.1 million from 2,757 theaters for a per screen average of $20,348, defying even the loftiest industry expectations. A hit with both fans and critics alike (88 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and an A CinemaScore) means Compton should have some good legs ahead of it. By the way, in the 20 weekends since the beginning of April, Universal and/or Disney have now had a number one film for 16 of them.Slipping one spot after a two-week run at the top was Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation which brought in an estimated $17 million this weekend, bringing its cume to $138 million. Outside North America, the film made another $46 million bringing its international total to $235 million and its worldwide total to $373 million.Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer debuted at number three with The Man From U.N.C.L.E. which took in a disappointing $13.5 million, according to estimates, from 3,638 theaters for a per screen average of only $3,720. Critics mostly enjoyed it (67 percent at Rotten Tomatoes) but a B CinemaScore does not bode well for its future with the fans. After all, even Entourage scored an A-.Speaking of disappointments (which may be the understatement of the year as far as the box office is concerned) Fantastic Four fell 69 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $8 million, bringing its total up to $42 million. To be fair, another Marvel superhero film fell 69 percent in its second weekend — X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009 — but to be even more fair, that film made $85 million in its opening weekend, not $26 million. A disaster any way you look at it, here’s hoping Fox takes the same line as Sony did with Spider-Man and gives Marvel control over the Fantastic Four franchise and lets them enter the official Marvel Cinematic Universe. Fantastic Four looks to end its run with maybe $60 million which would put it $10 million behind Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 for the year.Dropping 45 percent from its opening weekend was The Gift which made an additional $6.5 million this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $23.5 million with a finale in the $35 to 40 million range likely. The one good thing that Fantastic Four is doing? It’s making fellow Marvel film Ant-Man look better by comparison. In its fifth weekend, the world’s tiniest superhero took in another $5.5 million, according to estimates, bringing its total to $157.6 million so far.The Vacation remake fell 40 percent from last weekend to an estimated $5.3 million, bringing its total to $47 million. The Minions of… Minions took in an estimated $5.2 million in their sixth weekend, bringing their robust total to $313 million, good for fifth place so far in 2015. Meryl Streep’s turn as a rock star, Ricki and the Flash, dropped only 31 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $4.5 million, bringing its total up to $14.6 million. Look for a finale in the $25 to 30 million range. And rounding out the top 10 was Trainwreck (which has been anything but) with an estimated $3.8 million bringing its total to $98 million with the $100 million club right around the corner.The top ten films grossed an estimated $125.5 million which is even with last year when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remained at number one for a second weekend with $28.4 million; and up 10 percent from 2013 when The Butler opened in the top spot with $24.6 million.Compared to projections, Straight Outta Compton opened well above Gitesh’s $32M forecast while The Man From U.N.C.L.E. came ever so slightly below Gitesh’s $15 million prediction.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Bravo, Film, story, Festival, Hulu, Columbia, Critics, slashers, comedy","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/NWA.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-straight-outta-compton-drops-at-number-one"},{"id":"47509107628693","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jurassic Still Rules World","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jurassic Still Rules Worldby Gitesh Pandya | June 28, 2015 |  CommentsFor the third straight week, the dinosaur juggernaut Jurassic World held the number one spot at the North American and global box office breaking records and speeding to new industry milestones. Domestically, the Universal overachiever grossed an estimated $54.2M this weekend dropping 49% boosting the cume to an eye-popping $500.1M.If the estimate holds, the Chris Pratt-led hit will set a new record cracking the half-billion barrier in only 17 days breaking the old mark of 23 set in 2012 by The Avengers. Also it will become only the third film to ever break $500M while still sitting at number one joining Avatar and Titanic. Avatar and Avengers were the only films ever to gross more on their third weekends than Jurassic World. The dino-sequel’s first two weekends both ended up above studio estimates when finals were reported so it is possible that Sunday slides by less than the 24% that Universal is expecting.Obviously Jurassic World has outgrossed 1993’s original Jurassic Park thanks in part to higher ticket prices including 3D and IMAX premium options today. But the new installment is also posting impressive admissions numbers too. Domestically, World has sold roughly 54 million tickets which is up a healthy 31% from the estimated 41 million sold by Park at the same point in its run. There are more theaters today and the population has grown over 22 years, but Jurassic World is still performing at incredible levels even when only looking at the number of bodies it is attracting.Jurassic World now is the top-grossing movie of 2015 beating Avengers: Age of Ultron and sits at number five on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. Its trajectory still puts it on course to finish in the neighborhood of $650M from North America.With China crossing $200M, overseas markets contributed another $82.5M this weekend boosting the international total to a stellar $737.5M vaulting the global haul to $1.24 billion in just under three weeks of play. Japan, the final territory, opens in August and a finish near $1.7 billion seems likely which would make Jurassic World the third largest global blockbuster of all-time behind only James Cameron’s dynamic duo.Disney and Pixar enjoyed another incredible performance in the runner-up spot with their latest offering Inside Out which grossed an estimated $52.1M, off just 42%. That marks the fourth best second weekend gross for any animated film ever and the best for one that isn’t a sequel. And among all non-franchise films, the toon scored the fourth largest sophomore weekend behind Avatar and the R-rated pics American Sniper and The Passion of the Christ. The Pixar brand name is making Inside Out play like a mega-sequel. Strong word-of-mouth is not hurting either.Joy and her emotional pals now stand at a whopping $184.9M after the sophomore frame. Compared to Pixar’s biggest hits from recent years, that’s 19% behind company champ Toy Story 3 and 9% ahead of Monsters University. Inside Out’s second weekend hold is also better than University’s 45%, Brave’s 49%, and Toy Story 3’s 46%. With the Fourth of July holiday period approaching, the toon should smash $200M quickly and could find its way to a final domestic tally in the $325M range. That sets the bar high for summer’s next major toon offering, Minions opening July 10.The R-rated comedy sequel Ted 2 opened in third place with results that were disappointing when compared to its predecessor, but satisfactory when considering its genre. Universal’s latest franchise play debuted to an estimated $33M from 3,442 theaters for a solid $9,587 average. That ranks as the second best opening of the year for any R-rated comedy falling in between the $33.8M of Get Hard and the $29.1M of Spy. Both of those films are now at or near the $90M mark.But it was a steep 39% tumble from the massive $54.4M opening weekend of the first Ted which also launched on the last weekend of June three years ago. That smash had the excitement of being Seth MacFarlane’s debut as a movie director pulling in his large Family Guy fan base. Fast forward to 2015 and Ted 2 is his third directorial outing and follows his underwhelming performance as Oscar host plus last summer’s flop A Million Ways to Die in the West. This time around, seeing a new Seth flick was nothing too special, but it did break $30M which is where so many solid R-rated comedies open at.With a decent B+ CinemaScore, a holiday weekend next week, and no new raunchy comedies opening until mid July, Ted 2 should be able to find its way to the $100M mark domestically. It cost $85M to produce with the studio and Media Rights Capital footing the bill. The audience breakdown not surprisingly was 59% male and 51% over 25 showing good strength with hard-to-reach young adults. Reviews were not too positive.Warner Bros. launched the military dog drama Max and saw respectable numbers against intense competition for the family crowd. The PG-rated film bowed to an estimated $12.2M from 2,855 locations for a $4,277 average. Not a flashy movie based on an existing brand, Max is trying to establish itself in the marketplace hoping that word-of-mouth will carry it forward with the Independence Day holiday around the corner and most kids now out of school for summer vacation.The road ahead looks promising as the A CinemaScore grade is indicating that audiences are liking what they are getting. The grades from those under 18 and mature folks over 50 both came out as A+. With a patriotic holiday coming up, Max should connect with a broad audience looking for uplifting fare that honors all those who serve in the armed forces – even canine Marines. Reviews have been lackluster.The arrival of another R-rated comedy was no major obstacle to Melissa McCarthy’s Spy which dropped a slim 31% in its fourth mission to an estimated $7.8M giving Fox $88.4M to date. Hit disaster flick San Andreas declined by 39% to an estimated $5.3M putting Warner Bros. at a solid $141.9M to date here and $439.7M worldwide.Indie hopeful Dope fell a disturbing 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.9M after last week’s sluggish debut. The Open Road release, acquired by the distributor at Sundance for $7M plus a $15M investment into P&amp;A, has grossed $11.8M and should end its domestic run in the disappointing $16-18M range. Reviews were quite good, but summer audiences just did not find this one to be a top priority given all the other high-profile choices now.Down 51%, the horror threequel Insidious: Chapter 3 took in an estimated $2M putting the total at a nice $49.8M for Focus. Action hit Mad Max: Fury Road followed with an estimated $1.7M, down 43%, for a $147.1M cume. Global is now $356.4M. Rounding out the top ten was Avengers: Age of Ultron with an estimated $1.6M, down 42%, and $452.4M so far. It is no longer the top-grossing blockbuster of the year, but its hefty totals now stand at $919.1M international and $1.37 billion worldwide with its final market Japan opening next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $172.9M which was up 1% from last year when Transformers: Age of Extinction opened at number one with $100M; but off 4% from 2013 when Monsters University stayed n the top spot with $45.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, e., Western","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jurassic-Shark.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-jurassic-still-rules-world"},{"id":"47509107637913","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tomorrowland Tops A Lackluster Memorial Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tomorrowland Tops A Lackluster Memorial Day WeekendPlus, Pitch Perfect 2 holds at #2, Mad Max takes #3, and Poltergeist debuts at #4.by Gitesh Pandya | May 25, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers loudly told studios that they were getting their Memorial Day weekend entertainment from other places as the North American box office slumped to unusually low levels during what is typically one of the busiest frames of the year. The Top 10 over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long weekend fell to just $141.5M marking the worst showing for this holiday since 2001. And for the first time in 20 years, not a single Memorial Day weekend film reached $40M over three days. Five films grossed over $20M each spreading what wealth was there, but overall, moviegoers were unimpressed with what Hollywood was selling this time.Disney’s big-budget adventure film Tomorrowland opened at number one, but pulled in unimpressive numbers in the process. The PG-rated sci-fi pic headlined by George Clooney bowed to an estimated $32.2M over three days from 3,972 locations (including 354 IMAX screens) for a $8,096 average. Over the four-day holiday session, the studio is projecting $40.7M in ticket sales which is a troubling start for a tentpole earning a high-profile Memorial Day weekend slot and costing over $180M to produce.Tomorrowland failed to get its story across in the trailers and TV spots and consumer excitement never was very high. Many reviews were negative for the Brad Bird-directed pic and even those moviegoers who did come out were not very impressed. The film earned a so-so B CinemaScore grade indicating that it is not being recommended with much enthusiasm.Memorial Day weekend openers often finish up with around two and half times their four-day debuts so Tomorrowland, with no stellar word-of-mouth to benefit from, could end its domestic run in the area of only $100-110M. That will put pressure on international markets to help it break even.But overseas openings this weekend in 65 territories delivered only $26.7M, led by Russia’s $3.6M, Mexico’s $2.8M, and $2.1M from the U.K. Key markets still to come include Spain, China, Australia and Korea next weekend, followed by Japan and Brazil on the following frame. Many countries have school holidays coming up which Tomorrowland hopes to benefit from, but making this film into a moneymaker will certainly be difficult.Following its strong number one debut, Pitch Perfect 2 slipped to second place falling by a steep 56% to an estimated $30.3M. The Universal hit has amassed a stellar $117.8M to date giving the studio its third entry this year into the century club after Fifty Shades of Grey and Furious 7 with more brand-based heavyweights like Jurassic World, Ted 2, and Minions coming up this summer. Worldwide, Perfect has grossed $179.5M.Good word-of-mouth has been helping Mad Max: Fury Road during the week and again over the holiday weekend. The R-rated film dropped a reasonable 47% to an estimated $23.9M in its second round boosting the cume to $87.3M. It was the exact same dip experienced by 2013’s Star Trek Into Darkness which also opened on the weekend before the Memorial Day frame on its way to reaching three times its opening weekend figure.The horror remake Poltergeist attracted a large crowd opening to an estimated $23M over three days for the biggest fright film debut since last October’s Halloween season offerings. The PG-13 film earned lackluster reviews but scored an impressive $7,099 average from 3,240 locations for Fox. The original Poltergeist was a smash hit in 1982 and spawned a pair of sequels.Oddly enough, this was not the first time the Top 10 has included both Poltergeist and Mad Max films. In June of 1982 when the original supernatural thriller opened, it was joined a few notches below the holdover film The Road Warrior which was the sequel to the first Mad Max.Crashing the $400M barrier and still in the top five was summer kickoff pic Avengers: Age of Ultron with an estimated $20.9M for a 46% decline. The Disney release upped its North American cume to $404.1M putting it at number 16 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters bumping down the original Spider-Man from 2002 which had lower ticket prices and no 3D. International grosses swelled to $859.8M putting Ultron at $1.26 billion worldwide making it the second biggest super hero film of all-time after the first Avengers.Comedy flop Hot Pursuit dropped 39% to an estimated $3.5M for a new cume of just $28.9M for Warner Bros. Fox Searchlight went nationwide with its arthouse pic Far From the Madding Crowd going from 289 to 865 locations and grossed $2.3M with $5.4M overall.The world’s fourth biggest blockbuster of all time, Furious 7, fell 42% in its eighth weekend in the top ten grossing an estimated $2.1M. Universal has lifted its domestic total to $347M and its global tally to a hair below $1.5 billion. It will cross that mark on Monday or Tuesday bringing, the franchise cume to a staggering $3.9 billion across seven films in 14 years with the next installment on the calendar for April 2017.Sony’s Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 was off 51% to an estimated $1.8M and has banked $65.1M to date. The hit spring toon Home followed with an estimated $1.7M in its ninth weekend, down 34%, for a new total of $168M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the holiday weekend which was down 19% from last year when X-Men: Days of Future Past opened at number one with $90.8M; and down 43% from 2013 when Fast &amp; Furious 6 debuted in the top spot with $97.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"archives, Food, comedy, Bros., movies, war, talk, MTV, screen, Pride, popular, best, CMT, blockbusters","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tomorrowland-box-office.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-tomorrowland-tops-a-lackluster-memorial-day-weekend"},{"id":"47509107638938","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pitch Perfect 2 Sings Its Way to the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pitch Perfect 2 Sings Its Way to the TopPlus, Mad Max debuts at #2 with respectable numbers, and Avengers holds on to third.by Gitesh Pandya | May 17, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, multiplexes were packed with audiences as a female-driven comedy and a male-skewing action adventure — both from known brands — joined forces to pump $115M into the North American box office by appealing to different demographic groups and expanding the marketplace.Girls ruled as the highly anticipated a cappella sequel Pitch Perfect 2 shattered expectations taking the number one spot with an estimated $70.3M. Universal’s latest winner generated the third biggest opening of all-time for a comedy trailing only the $85.9M of 2011’s The Hangover 2 and the $73.1M of 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember. Pitch Perfect 2 has already surpassed the $65M made during the entire run of its 2012 predecessor.The sequel brought back most all of the cast members, gave standout star Rebel Wilson a bigger role, and saw producer/co-star Elizabeth Banks take on directing duties. It was the biggest opening weekend ever for a first-time director. Playing in 3,473 theaters, the PG-13 hit averaged a sizzling $20,250 per location.Studio data showed that the audience was 75% female and 62% under 25. Moviegoers liked what the singing gals had to offer as the CinemaScore grade was a solid A-. A run towards the $200M domestic mark could be possible for the $29M-budgeted film, with a third pic likely to be put on the fast track.Thirty years after the last installment, Mad Max: Fury Road stormed the box office winning over film critics and debuted to muscular numbers in second place with an estimated $44.4M, the best opening weekend of the year for a number-two film. The fourth chapter in the Warner Bros. franchise averaged a stellar $12,004 from 3,702 locations. Director George Miller returned to helm once again but this new chapter went ahead without Mel Gibson in the title role. Instead, it was Tom Hardy as Max joined by co-headliner Charlize Theron adding some female muscle to the pic.As expected, business was powered by older men. Studio research showed that the audience was 70% male and 54% over 35. 3D screens accounted for 46% of the gross which is a commendable figure by today’s standards.With a splashy premiere at Cannes timed to coincide with the global launch, Fury Road opened to an outstanding $65M overseas from 68 markets for a global debut of $109.4M. The new Mad Max is set to open in Japan on June 20, but no China date has been secured yet.Fury Road earned some of the best reviews ever for a Hollywood action franchise film. Ticket buyers were not as impressed but still gave a good B+ grade via CinemaScore, though online feedback from audiences compiled by Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango were both higher. Action films tend to fade quickly at the box office, but with positive buzz from moviegoers plus a major holiday weekend coming next week, Fury Road has a promising road ahead.After its two-week reign, Avengers: Age of Ultron got bumped down to third place by the newbies. The super hero sequel dropped a reasonable 50% to an estimated $38.8M in its third round, lifting the total to a strong $372M. The decline was slightly higher than the 46% that The Avengers witnessed in its third weekend in 2012, and about the same as the 51% of 2013’s Iron Man 3. Ultron is currently running 19% behind the pace of Avengers, but 10% ahead of the third Tony Stark flick.Age of Ultron has now climbed up to number 25 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters sandwiched in between a pair of 2004 smashes — Spider-Man 2 and The Passion of the Christ. The new Avengers installment is still on a trajectory to finish its domestic run at about $450M. Though below most industry expectations, it would still be the third highest ever for any summer film in history after The Avengers and 2008’s The Dark Knight.Overseas, Avengers: Age of Ultron continued to rake in the cash and was propelled this week by a massive opening in China which began on Tuesday. The six-day start brought in an incredible haul of $156.3M which pushed the international cume to $770.5M and the worldwide gross to $1.14 billion. It is the eighth highest-grossing film of all-time and has plenty of business left in China, plus its final market opening in Japan in July. Reaching $1.5 billion is very possible and edging out the $1.52 billion of the first Avengers is very much a possibility as well depending on how it holds up in China.Taking a sharp nosedive after a soft opening, the comedy Hot Pursuit tumbled 59% to an estimated $5.8M in its sophomore session. The Warner Bros. release has collected only $23.5M to date and should finish up with around $33M.Two spring sequels tied for fifth place. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 dipped 32% to an estimated $3.6M raising Sony’s total to $62.9M. The year’s biggest global smash, Furious 7, followed with an estimated $3.6M in its seventh weekend, off 33%. Universal has upped the domestic total to $343.8M and the worldwide haul to $1.49 billion. It is now just $30M shy of matching the global tally of 2012’s Avengers. China has ended its run at a staggering $390.5M — the best ever for any film there — so other markets will need to kick in the balance.Lionsgate’s The Age of Adaline saw much of its female fan base taken away by the collegiate singers. Falling 45% to an estimated $3.2M, the Blake Lively pic has banked $37.1M to date. The DreamWorks toon Home dropped only 12% to an estimated $2.7M in its eighth round to raise the cume to $165.6M for Fox. It continues to benefit greatly from no kidpic competition.Sci-fi pic Ex Machina grossed an estimated $2.1M, down 40%, for a new sum of $19.6M for A24. Rounding out the top ten was Fox Searchlight’s expanding indie Far From the Madding Crowd with an estimated $1.3M from 289 locations, an average of $4,498, and a total of $2.6M. The period film widens again next weekend to over 700 runs for the Memorial Day holiday frame.The top ten films grossed an estimated $175.9M which was up 5% from last year when Godzilla opened at number one with $93.2M; and up 20% from 2013 when Star Trek Into Darkness debuted in the top spot with $70.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"psycho, Reviews, scorecard, It, crime, 2015, bond, furious, Tyler, movies, Larson, Channel, Universal","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pitch-perfect-box-office.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-pitch-perfect-2-sings-its-way-to-the-top"},{"id":"47509106451088","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission: Impossible Holds On To Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission: Impossible Holds On To Top SpotPlus, Fantastic Four reaches #2, The Gift earns third, and Shaun the Sheep opens just outside the top ten.by Gitesh Pandya | August 9, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, Tom Cruise kept his box office title as the veteran actor’s latest hit Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation spent its second straight weekend at number one beating a handful of new releases including the new super hero offering Fantastic Four, which stumbled into second place. The latest Ethan Hunt adventure grossed an estimated $29.4M, dropping an encouraging 47%. That is a terrific hold for an action sequel, as MI5 has been benefitting from strong word-of-mouth from those who have seen it already. The cume rose to $108.7M with 369 IMAX screens contributing a high 14% of the total at $15.5M.All five Mission: Impossible films have now spent exactly two weekends at number one. Four did it during their first two frames while 2011’s Ghost Protocol did an IMAX-only debut and then spent its second and third weekends in the top spot that holiday season once in full wide release. The 19-year-old spy franchise is still relevant with today’s moviegoers and once again a solid and entertaining product is drawing in customers.Rogue Nation opened in 18 more overseas markets and collected a stellar $65.5M this weekend from 58 total territories to boost Paramount’s international cume to $156.7M and the global haul to $265.4M. With major markets like France, Brazil, and Italy still to open this month followed by China on September 8, MI5 looks on course to make over $700M worldwide which would be a new career high for Tom Cruise.The new action entry Fantastic Four suffered one of the worst openings ever for a major Marvel super hero property, grossing an estimated $26.2M which was less than half of what the two previous films in the franchise opened to. Panned by film critics, the PG-13 pic averaged only $6,558 from 3,995 locations for Fox falling well below what comic book movies do in the prime summer season.This reboot was clobbered by poor reviews which repelled audiences. Those who did buy tickets agreed and gave a thumbs down. The CinemaScore grade was a lousy C-, and other metrics also showed among the lowest scores for any Hollywood film this summer. Moviegoers made a strong statement this weekend, telling studios that they will not come out and spend money on super hero movies that are not well-made and exciting. Marvel and DC should listen up, given the long list of big-budget comic book movies they have scheduled over the next several years.Fantastic Four played 60% male according to studio data with younger appeal making the split between those over and under 25 almost even. With a huge 25% tumble on Saturday from Friday, the road ahead looks bleak with the domestic final possibly ending up in the $60-65M range. Last summer’s Marvel super hero team flicks X-Men: Days of Future Past and Guardians of the Galaxy made more than that in just their first two days of release. Both were loved by critics and audiences alike.New distributor STX enjoyed a solid opening for its first release, the psychological thriller The Gift, which landed in third with an estimated $12M from 2,503 sites for a good $4,794 average. The R-rated Jason Bateman pic played 53% female and 73% over 25 and earned rave reviews across the board. Budgeted at only $5M, Gift was not as well-liked by paying audiences, as evidenced by the so-so B grade from CinemaScore, but even with average legs this one should recoup its production and marketing costs in the near future.The R-rated road comedy Vacation dropped a reasonable 38% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.1M. Opening mid-week helped lessen the sophomore fall and buzz has been so-so despite weak reviews. Warner Bros. sits at $37.3M which is roughly half of what the studio’s August road comedy hit We’re the Millers did two years ago over the same period.Spending its fourth weekend in the top five was the Marvel hero Ant-Man with an estimated $7.8M, falling only 39% despite the launch of another super hero flick. Disney has banked $147.4M to date and the global tally has shot up to $326.3M with lucrative Asian markets Korea, Japan, and China still to open.Jumping over the triple-century mark this weekend was the animated smash Minions which slipped 40% to an estimated $7.4M putting Universal at a stellar $302.7M to date. The worldwide haul vaulted past the $900M mark over the weekend and now stands at $912.5M making it the number seven toon of all-time globally. Minions should crack $1 billion before it even opens in China on September 13.Critics were not all that happy with three-time Oscar queen Meryl Streep’s latest film Ricki and the Flash, which opened in seventh place with an estimated $7M from 1,603 locations for a moderate $4,367 average. Sony’s PG-13 rocker pic played heavily to older women, as expected, with studio data showing the crowd to be 70% female and 78% over 30. Mixed reviews hurt, as did healthy competition from adult drama The Gift, which was praised by critics and offered more cross-gender appeal. With a decent B CinemaScore, an older skew, an addition of 400 screens next week, and the lazy days of August ahead, Ricki may still have some legs.Young women continued to rally behind Amy Schumer’s breakout comedy hit Trainwreck which slipped only 34% to an estimated $6.3M giving Universal $91.1M to date. Add in the hits Spy and Pitch Perfect 2 and the ladies have been dominating the comedy world this summer. Adam Sandler’s Pixels dropped 48% to an estimated $5.4M putting Sony at $57.6M with the global total now at $130.6M. Boxing drama Southpaw rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4.8M, off 38%, for a $40.7M cume for The Weinstein Co.There was also notable activity below the top ten. The new animated film Shaun the Sheep opened to soft numbers with an estimated $4M for the weekend and $5.6M since its Wednesday launch. The PG-rated entry was showered with praise from film critics, but families looked at this one as a rental to watch later at a lower price point. Lionsgate saw a dull three-day average of only $1,724 from 2,320 locations for the Aardman pic.Summer behemoths fell from the top ten but still lifted their impressive totals higher. Disney’s Inside Out has amassed $335.4M domestically and $635.5M worldwide with more major territories like China still to come. Universal’s Jurassic World, 2015’s number one smash, sits at $635.6M in North America and a stunning $1.58 billion worldwide. It opened in its final market of Japan this weekend to a muscular $13M over five days with more to come.FUNimation saw success with its specialized release of the Japanese anime blockbuster Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ which opened on Tuesday with showings only on select days. This weekend, its one-day gross from just Saturday was $1.4M raising the cume to $5.6M from 922 theaters. The PG-rated film will continue to play through Wednesday of this week.The top ten films grossed an estimated $115.5M which was down 32% from last year when Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened at number one with $65.6M; and down 16% from 2013 when Elysium opened in the top spot with $29.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"books, Walt, dark","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MI5BoxOffice.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-mission-impossible-holds-on-to-top-spot"},{"id":"47509107623570","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ant-Man Climbs to $58M in Top Spot Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ant-Man Climbs to $58M in Top Spot Debutby Gitesh Pandya | July 19, 2015 |  CommentsMarvel took its usual number one spot for its latest super hero flick Ant-Man which debuted to an estimated $58M launching yet another big character for the comic studio. The PG-13 actioner averaged $15,052 from 3,856 locations and played to the usual comic book crowd which tends to be reliable when a good film is presented to it.The opening was off 11-12% from the debuts of the first Captain America and Thor pics from the summer of 2011 which makes sense since this character is not as well known. Ant-Man did not, however, come close to the heights of the $94.3M bow of Guardians of the Galaxy from mid-summer last year which was also another Marvel production based on characters that were not mainstream.Ant-Man with Paul Rudd did earn good marks from critics and paying audiences gave an A grade from CinemaScore. Their breakdown was pretty standard for the genre – 58% male and 55% over 25. The micro-sized hero will next appear in the third Captain America flick opening next May. With ongoing soap opera-like storylines that interconnect, Marvel super hero films can tempt fans back in again and again as they do not want to miss out on the overall saga. Overseas debuts brought in $56.4M this weekend giving Ant-Man a $114.4M worldwide launch.Following its explosive opening weekend, the animated smash Minions fell sharply in its second session but still grossed a massive $50.2M, according to estimates. Down 57%, the Universal spin-off has racked up a giant $216.7M after its second weekend and looks to be on course to end in the $350M range putting it very close to the $368.1M of Despicable Me 2. Its healthy $66.2M international weekend propelled the overseas total to $409.1M putting Minions at a mammoth $625.8M worldwide making the $1 billion mark within reach.Amy Schumer scored her first hit movie with her first try as Trainwreck debuted well in third place with an estimated $30.2M putting it in the same range as many other top R-rated comedy hits from more established box office stars. Universal’s umpteenth success this year averaged a muscular $9,575 from 3,158 locations with white adult women leading the charge. Studio data showed that the audience was 74% white, 66% female, and 63% over 30.Costing only about $35M to produce, Trainwreck could find its way past the $100M mark just like another female-led R-rated comedy from this summer, Melissa McCarthy’s Spy, which bowed to $29.1M and currently stands at $106.6M. Add in Pitch Perfect 2’s $183.5M and this summer’s laughs are coming from the ladies. Trainwreck also marks a comeback for Judd Apatow who has not directed a big hit in eight years. Reviews were very positive and audiences also liked the film which earned an A- from CinemaScore. Schumer looks to be a mighty box office force in comedy movies over the years to come.Pixar scored only its third ever $300M+ domestic blockbuster with its latest hit Inside Out which grossed an estimated $11.7M sliding only 34%. The Disney release has now banked a stellar $306.4M from North America and has added $183.8M from international markets for a global tally of $490.2M. Pixar’s only other films to cross the triple-century mark here were Finding Nemo and Toy Story 3.Still in the top five in its sixth round was Jurassic World which this weekend became 2015’s biggest worldwide blockbuster by edging past Universal stablemate Furious 7. The dino-sequel held up well again dropping 37% to an estimated $11.4M pushing the domestic cume to a staggering $611.1M. It cracked $600M on Friday in a record 36 days. The overseas haul topped $900M reaching $902.3M giving World a worldwide haul of $1.51 billion with 60% coming from international.Terminator Genisys got shoved aside by this weekend’s new action entry and suffered the worst fall of any wide release. The return of Arnold saw a sharp 61% tumble with an estimated $5.4M for a new domestic total of $80.6M. This will be the first Terminator sequel that fails to crack $100M domestically as Genisys is on track to end with about $93M. Overseas markets have brought in a solid $196.8M for a global take of $277.4M with China yet to set a release date. 71% of the worldwide box office has come from outside of North America.Warner Bros. followed with a pair of titles. Magic Mike XXL dropped 53% to an estimated $4.5M while The Gallows fell 59% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4M. Totals are $58.6M and $18M. The comedy sequel Ted 2 grossed an estimated $2.7M, off 52%, for a $77.4M cume for Universal.Barely sneaking into the top ten was the Ian McKellen film Mr. Holmes with an estimated $2.5M debut from 363 locations for a solid $6,857 average. The well-reviewed drama is from Miramax and Roadside Attractions.The top ten films grossed an estimated $180.6M which was up 38% from last year when Dawn of the Planet of the Apes stayed at number one with $36.3M; and up 4% from 2013 when The Conjuring opened in the top spot with $41.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"vampires, social, show, in, Animation, TLC, Writers, Sabrina, dogs, Logo, movies, Brie","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ant-Run.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-antman-climbs-to-58m-in-top-spot-debut"},{"id":"47509107645086","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Beats Paul Blart to Top $1 Billion","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Beats Paul Blart to Top $1 BillionPlus, Unfriended debuts at #3, while Monkey Kingdom takes seventh.by Gitesh Pandya | April 19, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, it was threepeat time for the action juggernaut Furious 7 which came into the weekend smashing the $1 billion global mark and still ruling multiplexes worldwide. Gravity-defying in terms of both stunts and box office, the Vin Diesel-Paul Walker pic grossed an estimated $29M domestically, falling by an understandable 51% in its third round, and vaulted its cume to a staggering $294.4M. Universal should find its way to $350M or more from North America.Overseas is where Furious 7 is truly demolishing records. This weekend saw an eye-popping $167.9M of sales including $93.3M from its first full weekend in China. The international total soared to $858.3M putting the worldwide haul at an unbelievable $1.15 billion with much more to go. It is the highest-grossing film in the studio’s history. China has reached a stunning $250.5M in only eight days of play and is on course to beat Transformers: Age of Extinction by next weekend to become the top-grossing American film ever in that market.Furious 7 now sits at number 7 on the list of all-time global blockbusters and will quickly speed past Iron Man 3, Frozen, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, and The Avengers to rank third behind just Avatar and Titanic. This was never expected to be possible, showing once again how unpredictable moviegoing can be. The only challenger Furious 7 will face in the weeks ahead will be the much-anticipated Avengers: Age of Ultron, which opens in many international markets this Wednesday, hoping to eventually reach or exceed the heights of its 2012 predecessor. The Marvel superheroes do not invade China until May 12 so the speed racers still have a clear road ahead there for three full weeks.Sony scored a nice hit with its comedy sequel Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2, which opened to an estimated $24M coming in ahead of expectations. It was below the $31.8M of its 2009 predecessor, but star Kevin James has not been much of a box office anchor since then on his own. The PG-rated sequel was slammed by critics, as expected, but averaged a good $6,606 from paying audiences in 3,633 locations. The CinemaScore grade was a lackluster B- so the road ahead may be a little shaky. But with a $30M budget, Blart 2 should end up with a nice run regardless of how international results turn out.Horror hitman Jason Blum enjoyed yet another scary moneymaker with the online terror flick Unfriended which debuted in third with an estimated $16M for the best fright opening of this year so far. The R-rated chiller averaged a solid $5,850 from 2,739 locations and played mostly to older teens and young adults. Studio data showed that the audience was 74% under 25, 60% female, and 68% non-white. Savvy marketing and a relevant topic helped the micro-budgeted $1M production excite its target audience. Blum has more screams in store with this summer’s sequels Insidious: Chapter 3 in June and Sinister 2 in August.The animated hit Home dropped 44% in its fourth weekend to an estimated $10.3M, raising its cume to a robust $142.6M and putting it dead even with The Croods from two years ago at the same point in its spring run. That other DreamWorks Animation pic ended up with $187.2M domestic and $587M worldwide, where Home may end up at as well.The romance The Longest Ride fell 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.9M for Fox, putting the cume at $23.5M on its way to $35-40M. The Warner Bros. comedy Get Hard followed with an estimated $4.8M, down 41%, for a new total of $78.3M.Disney’s annual nature documentary timed to Earth Day landed in seventh place. Monkey Kingdom opened to an estimated $4.7M from 2,012 locations for a weak $2,343 average. That was almost equal to the $4.8M bow of the studio’s Bears from this weekend last year. A portion of the proceeds for these films are donated to conservation charities.Close behind in eighth was Helen Mirren’s Woman in Gold with an estimated $4.6M, off just 16%, for a new sum of $15.9M for The Weinstein Co. which could be headed for the $30M range. Insurgent dropped 38% to an estimated $4.2M, putting Lionsgate at $120.6M (10% behind Divergent‘s pace) and $262.2M globally. Disney’s Cinderella rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.9M, off 46%, for a new total of $186.3M. The fairy tale hit stands at $457.7M worldwide.Two new films debuted in moderate national release and posted weak results finishing outside the top ten. The James Franco-Jonah Hill drama True Story bowed to an estimated $1.9M from 831 locations for only $2,323 per site for Fox Searchlight. Tom Hardy’s Cold War thriller Child 44 fared worse with an estimated $600,000 opening weekend from 510 playdates for a dismal $1,176 average for Lionsgate. Neither was well-liked by film critics.The sci-fi drama Ex Machina expanded well in its second weekend from four to 39 theaters across several top markets and grossed an estimated $814,000 for a solid $20,872 average. A24 takes it nationwide next weekend hoping to sustain the buzz created in the bigger cities.The top ten films grossed an estimated $108.3M which was down 7% from last year when Captain America: The Winter Soldier remained at number one for a third time with $25.6M; but up 12% from 2013 when Oblivion debuted in the top spot with $37.1M.Follow BOG on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"york, of, Academy, Sci-Fi, period, true, kong, Tarantino, BAFTA, name, 71st","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paul-walker-furious.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-furious-7-beats-paul-blart-to-top-1-billion"},{"id":"47509109398184","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: SpongeBob Dethrones American Sniper With Strong Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: SpongeBob Dethrones American Sniper With Strong DebutJupiter Ascending and Seventh Son fall far behind in 3rd and 4th.by Gitesh Pandya | February 8, 2015 |  CommentsThis weekend, Clint Eastwood’s runaway blockbuster and two new action films were no match for the animated comedy The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water which rocketed to number one in North America with a spectacular debut of an estimated $56M. It was the second largest opening weekend ever for an animated film in February behind only The LEGO Movie‘s $69.1M from this same frame last year. With the Presidents Day holiday coming up next week plus many schools closing for winter breaks later this month, the road ahead looks promising for SpongeBob. The PG-rated project cost $74M to produce.Competition was not tough. The only film to succeed with families this year has been Paddington, which is old now, and the last major animated film was Thanksgiving’s Penguins of Madagascar, which performed poorly. In fact, SpongeBob opened better than nine of the last ten toons from DreamWorks Animation. Since Baymax hit theaters three months ago, there has not been a single toon that audiences were truly excited for.Following its three-week reign, Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper dropped to second but still posted a sensational hold dipping only 21% to an estimated $24.2M. Cume to date is now a staggering $282.3M for Sniper, which has just surpassed The Matrix Reloaded to become the second highest grossing R-rated film of all-time behind only The Passion of the Christ. The Bradley Cooper vehicle has also now grossed more than all the other Best Picture Oscar nominees combined. Making it to the $350M neighborhood seems likely.The latest big-budget flop from the Wachowski siblings Jupiter Ascending crashed and burned this weekend opening to just $19M, according to estimates, taking third place. Costing over $175M to produce, the sci-fi action pic averaged $5,973 from 3,181 sites and had help from higher 3D and IMAX ticket prices. Recent big-budget action flops like After Earth, John Carter, Battleship, and The Lone Ranger all opened better than Jupiter.This was the third consecutive time the Wachowskis were given a huge bag of cash to make an effects-driven action film which ultimately was rejected by audiences. Following 2003’s Matrix sequels, they had Speed Racer in 2008 and Cloud Atlas in 2012. All films were from Warner Bros. These last three duds look to end up with combined domestic grosses of only about $115M while having combined budgets of over $400M with much more on top of that for marketing. International grosses help, of course, but these are three money-losing ventures in a row. It will be interesting to see if the studio continues to do business with the sibling filmmakers any more.Another new effects-heavy action epic rejected by moviegoers followed in fourth place. The historical adventure Seventh Son bowed to just $7.1M, according to estimates, for a dreary $2,470 average from a wide 2,875 locations. With an estimated production cost of $95M, the Universal release was utterly rejected by domestic audiences. Horrendous reviews did not help the PG-13 pic, nor did slotting the much-delayed film against another effects-driven action offering. Studio research showed that the few who did turn out came from Jupiter‘s demo — 61% male and 53% over 30.Despite the arrival of Squidward and pals, the family pic Paddington held up well dropping 35% to an estimated $5.4M raising the cume up to $57.3M for The Weinstein Co. Paramount’s low-cost Project Almanac dropped 36% from Super Bowl weekend to an estimated $5.3M. The $12M-budgeted pic from producer Michael Bay looks headed for a $25M finish.Off a scant 3%, The Imitation Game continued to cash in on Oscar nominations and collected an estimated $4.9M for a $74.7M total to date for The Weinstein Co. This one has no real expectation of actually winning the biggest prizes, but is using awards attention to cash in at the box office from adults wanting to see high profile contenders with the Academy’s seal of approval. Close behind was The Wedding Ringer with an estimated $4.8M, down just 16%, with a $55.1M sum for Sony.Falling 27% in its second weekend was Kevin Costner’s Black or White with an estimated $4.5M and a weak $13.1M overall for Relativity. Universal’s JLo thriller The Boy Next Door rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4.1M, down 33%, and a $30.9M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $135.3M which was up 2% from last year when The LEGO Movie opened at number one with $69.1M; and up a sizable 64% from 2013 when Identity Thief debuted on top with $34.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"book","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-SpongeBob-Dethrones-American-Sniper-With-Strong-Debut"},{"id":"47509109396135","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Record Opening for 50 Shades of Grey","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Record Opening for 50 Shades of Greyby Gitesh Pandya | February 15, 2015 |  CommentsSmashing the all-time opening weekend record for Presidents Day weekend, the hotly anticipated erotic drama Fifty Shades of Grey opened huge collecting an estimated $81.7M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long holiday session. The Universal smash averaged an eye-popping $22,400 from 3,646 theaters by pulling in fans of the best-selling sex-filled novel who had been waiting for the story to be put onto the big screen. The previous record holder for this holiday weekend was the romantic comedy Valentine’s Day with $56.3M in 2010.It was the fifth biggest opening weekend of all time for an R-rated film and second highest overall for the month of February trailing only The Passion of the Christ’s $83.8M. It was also the top non-sequel debut in company history for Universal. The much-buzzed-about film was developed through its specialty division Focus with the studio taking over and giving it a major league push.The record weekend began on Friday with a colossal $30.3M including $8.6M from Thursday night pre-shows starting at 8pm. Normally films of this nature with intense fan love draw the bulk of their business on opening day and then slip on Saturday. But with Valentine’s Day falling on day two, Fifty Shades actually rose 21% that day to a spectacular $36.7M. The studio is projecting a steep 60% fall Sunday to $14.7M. Pre-sales were among the best for any film in history with fans making their plans in advance for Thursday, Friday, or Saturday shows. Tickets went on sale over a month ago. Still, factor in Monday’s holiday take and the four-day gross may soar past $90M shattering the current record for this holiday frame of $63.1M by the PG-13 Valentine’s Day.Critics were quite harsh in their reviews of Fifty Shades before it released and paying audiences were in agreement as its CinemaScore grade was a lousy C+. Given the low audience scores and intense upfront demand, look for rapid erosion in the days and weeks ahead. A last-minute IMAX version was offered tapping into those willing to pay a premium and the 85 screens are projected to contribute $2.1M over four days.Studio data showed that opening day audiences skewed female, as expected. 68% were women while 58% were over 25. Delayed from its August 2014 release date, Universal wisely picked Valentine’s Day weekend – the one time of the year when men are most likely to submit to seeing films they actually do not want to see. The strategy worked wonders. Brilliant marketing for months paid off handsomely, especially the use of Beyonce’s music in trailers and TV spots which helped to give broad mainstream appeal.A day and date release in most of the world delivered a stunning $158M from 58 international territories for a jaw-dropping $239.7M global debut. These are super hero numbers! Most major markets opened this weekend with Korea to come on February 26 and China having no date yet. Leading the way overseas was the U.K. with a mammoth $21.1M in three days for the ninth largest opening of all-time. Lead actor Jamie Dornan is from Northern Ireland and author E.L. James is British. Other notable launches were $15.2M over four days in Germany, $12M over five days in France, and $10.5M across four days from Russia. Produced for about $40M, a global gross north of $600M could result. The next film in the franchise is being planned for a release next year some time.Opening to strong results in second place was the comic-inspired spy flick Kingsman: The Secret Service with an estimated $35.6M from 3,204 locations for a muscular $11,111 average. The R-rated hit opened much better than recent action offerings debuting over Presidents Day weekend including last year’s RoboCop and the previous year’s A Good Day To Die Hard which were both based on well-known brands. Those launched in the $21-25M range over Friday-to-Sunday. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson starred in Kingsman as hero and villain, respectively.Many action films have sputtered this year but Kingsman connected with moviegoers. Saturday even witnessed a sizable 47% surge for Valentine’s Day from audiences preferring shooting over spanking. Those polled by CinemaScore gave a decent B+ average grade while reviews were generally positive. The opening weekend performance was at the same level as Denzel Washington’s last film The Equalizer (also R) which debuted to $34.1M and not far from the $39.2M of Liam Neeson’s Taken 3. That’s great company to have.Last week’s top choice The SpongeBob Movie took a tumble in its second frame, despite not having any new kidpics to compete with. The Paramount title fell 45% to an estimated $30.5M which was still a robust amount of business and boosted its cume up to a solid $93.7M. With Monday being a school holiday, it may cross the $100M mark then. The new toon has already beaten The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie which collected a total of $85.4M in 2004.Clint Eastwood’s runaway smash American Sniper broke the $300M mark on Sunday as it continued on its record-breaking run. Its fifth weekend of wide release saw an estimated $16.4M in grosses sliding 29% from last frame for a new North American tally of $304.1M. Sniper has now joined the list of all-time domestic blockbusters sitting at number 47 just behind Skyfall’s $304.4M. Warner Bros. has enjoyed tremendous success and news coverage in recent days about the trial of the real “American Sniper” killer has helped to keep this film on the minds of movie audiences. It is the second biggest R-rated film of all-time trailing the $370.3M of The Passion of the Christ which it will probably not beat.Suffering the worst drop of any film in the top ten was the sci-fi bomb Jupiter Ascending which grossed an estimated $9.4M in its second weekend, falling 49%. Cume for the Warner Bros. release is just $32.6M, a weak amount for an action film costing more than $175M to produce. Seventh Son, another sophomore flop, followed with an estimated $4.2M dropping 42% giving Universal a measly $13.4M.Kidpic Paddington did well with an estimated $4.1M, down 21%, followed by Weinstein Co. stablemate The Imitation Game with an estimated $3.5M, dipping 24%. Totals are now $62.3M and $79.7M. Kevin Hart saw his comedy The Wedding Ringer fall 28% to an estimated $3.4M giving Sony $59.7M thus far. Paramount’s Project Almanac rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.7M, off 48%, and a $19.6M sum.Opening very well in platform release was the award-winning vampire comedy What We Do In The Shadows with an estimated $66,000 from solo houses in New York and Los Angeles for a stellar $32,915 average. Reviews were quite strong across the board and Paladin/Unison will expand next weekend into the top ten markets.Depending on how estimates hold and how well Monday performs, this could be a record Presidents Day weekend beating out 2010’s explosive session which saw the Top 20 gross a stunning $233.4M over four days.The top ten films grossed an estimated $191.7M which was up 23% from last year when The LEGO Movie stayed at number one with $49.8M; and up a sizable 58% from 2013 when A Good Day To Die Hard debuted on top with $24.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Christmas, 2016, italian, game-of-thrones, school","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Record-Opening-for-50-Shades-of-Grey"},{"id":"47509107648160","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Roars to Record Launch","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Roars to Record Launchby Sujit Chawla | April 5, 2015 |  CommentsFurious 7 opened to record numbers, and a bunch of other movies also happened to be playing in the same theaters and a few people went and saw them, probably because Furious 7 was sold out.You know when something is expected to happen, just not as much as what actually happens? That’s how one would describe the monstrous opening of Furious 7 this weekend. Opening in 4,004 theaters, at least one of which in Queens, NY played the movie 24 hours a day, Furious 7 exploded with a towering $143.5M this weekend, according to estimates. The records are almost too numerous to mention, but here are a few. It was the 9th biggest opening weekend of all-time and the 3rd biggest outside of the summer movie season (behind only the first two Hunger Games films). Internationally it took in an estimated $240.4M which is the 3rd highest international opening behind only Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. Which makes its worldwide opening of $384M the 4th highest global opening weekend behind Deathly Hallows- Part 2, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Avengers. It set new records for the biggest opening in the month of April (destroying the $95M Captain America: The Winter Solider made just last year) and is the biggest opening weekend in the history of Universal Studios.First off, the idea that an action franchise could go seven films deep is just about unheard of. But to have a franchise that makes more money as it goes along? And this isn’t something that’s based on a book where you know how the story ends and the excitement builds, this is an original franchise where writers have to keep coming up with bigger and bolder stunts and sequences. When Vin Diesel and the late Paul Walker decided to come back and reboot the series in 2009 with Fast &amp; Furious, audiences forgot about the disappointment of Tokyo Drift and came roaring back to see their favorite duo teaming up once again. Each film after that upped the ante, adding previous cast members and having new ones (ie. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson) join in the fun as well. Audiences were well primed for Furious 7 anyway, but the sudden death of Walker in 2013 added to the must-see aura of the film. The cast, crew and the studio made this a fitting tribute to Walker with fans coming out to pay their last respects, and even with a tear in their eye, had a great time seeing Walker one last time in his most famous role.The CinemaScore was an A, meaning people loved what they saw, which could lead to strong holds over the next few weeks before The Avengers: Age of Ultron hits theaters in May. The audience was evenly split with 51% males and 49% females. And, in keeping with the multicultural nature of the cast, the audience was 37% Hispanic, 25% Caucasian, 24% African American and 10% Asian. This film literally had something for everyone.Yes, there were other movies still playing this weekend. Second place belonged to last weekend’s top film, Home which fell a reasonable 47% to an estimated $27.4M, bringing its total up to $95.6M. With no other films targeting children over the next many weeks, its weekend drops should slow down and it could reach $185-200M by the end of its run, which would be a nice surprise for the embattled DreamWorks Animation studio.Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell took third place as Get Hard fell a hefty 62% from last weekend to an estimated $13M, bringing its total up to $57M. Furious took a bite out of all of the top 10, but Get Hard got hit the hardest and what on paper looked like a surefire $100M may have a hard time getting there. Pun intended.Two female-driven films came within a few hundred thousand of each other and landed in fourth and fifth place. First was the Disney live-action remake Cinderella which fell just under 40% in its 4th weekend to $10.3M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $167M. And in fifth was The Divergent Series: Insurgent which fell 53.6% to an estimated $10M, helping it cross the $100M mark this weekend with a current total of $103.4M. It’s falling at a faster rate than Divergent and won’t be able to reach the $151M that film got to, but could still end up around $130M with two more films in the pipeline.Indie horror darling It Follows added 437 theaters but fell 35% from last weekend to an estimated $2.5M for a current cume of $8.5M. It seems mainstream audiences aren’t digging the scares as much as limited audiences did. Still, for a film built a lot on word-of-mouth, and with only a $2M budget, it has to be considered a success.Another newcomer landed in the 7th spot this weekend as the Helen Mirren holocaust drama Woman in Gold debuted with an estimated $2M from 1,327 theaters for a per screen average of a very solid $7,767. Critical reviews were very mixed which could keep the grosses down in the upcoming weeks, as this is the type of film where people care about reviews.Kingsman: The Secret Service continued its strong run as it has now been in the top 10 for two months. This weekend it made another $1.7M, according to estimates, bringing its cume up to $122M. Ninth place belonged to the Christian drama Do You Believe? which, despite it being Easter weekend, fell 35% from last weekend to an estimated $1.5M and a total of only $9.8M. And rounding out the top 10 was The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which rounded up another $1M, according to estimates, for a total to date of $30M.Follow BOG on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, italian, indie, HBO, YouTube","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/furious-7-one.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-furious-7-roars-to-record-launch"},{"id":"47509107643037","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 First to Four-peat in 3 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 First to Four-peat in 3 Yearsby Gitesh Pandya | April 26, 2015 |  CommentsIn its fourth and final frame taking pole position, the action juggernaut Furious 7 held onto the top spot vaulting into triple-century territory domestically and joining the elite billion-dollar club overseas. The Universal smash grossed an estimated $18.3M dropping only 37% during a weekend that saw very little competition come its way. Most holdovers in the top ten had small declines. Furious 7 became the first film to spend four straight weeks at number one since 2012’s The Hunger Games.Vin Diesel’s action mega-hit has now grossed $320.5M putting it at number 36 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just ahead of the $319.1M of 2007’s Transformers. Furious 7 is on course to challenge American Sniper by the end of its run, although Avengers: Age of Ultron has every intention of surpassing their domestic numbers in the weeks ahead as it launches here at 7:00pm this Thursday night.Furious 7 now stands an incredible 46% ahead of where the last film Fast &amp; Furious 6 was at the same point. Diesel and Universal announced days ago that an eighth pic in the lucrative franchise is in development and will open on April 14, 2017. This was not a shocker given that the first seven films have grossed $3.7 billion worldwide and counting with the best numbers coming from the most recent installments.The international marketplace continues to shine for Furious 7 and the overseas cume topped $1 billion this weekend. Only two other films have ever done this in movie history – Titanic in 1998 and Avatar in 2010. This weekend’s international gross was hit hard by Ultron’s launch in much of the world and came in at $69.7M from 67 markets. The highlight was China which surged to an amazing $323M in only 15 days breaking the record for the highest-grossing film of all-time there. Transformers: Age of Extinction held that record since last summer. China also surpassed North America as the film’s top-grossing market in the world.Worldwide, Furious 7 ranks number five all-time behind James Cameron’s dynamic duo, The Avengers, and the final Harry Potter. It will sail past Deathly Hallows Part 2 within days and will challenge the $1.52 billion of Avengers by the time its run ends. Of course, Ultron is also looking to crash that party soon hoping to reach similar territory this summer.The lowbrow comedy sequel Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 enjoyed a solid second weekend slipping only 35% to an estimated $15.5M thanks to the family crowd nearly doubling Saturday’s gross over Friday. Sony’s $30M production has banked a commendable $44M to date and could end up with $75-80M giving the studio a nice spring hit.Blake Lively saw her new romantic drama The Age of Adaline enjoy a decent debut as the Lionsgate title opened in third place with an estimated $13.4M. The PG-13 drama averaged a respectable $4,472 from 2,991 locations and attracted mixed reviews from critics. Studio data showed that the decades-spanning saga about a woman who does not age played to an audience that was 75% female and 58% over 25. This is the quadrant least interested in the new Avengers movie so Adaline may play as counter-programming in the near term before female-driven comedies Hot Pursuit and Pitch Perfect 2 open in mid-May.DreamWorks Animation was able to cross the $150M domestic threshold with its current hit comedy Home which eased just 22% in its fifth frame to an estimated $8.3M putting the cume at $153.8M. That keeps the Fox release even with what the toon studio’s 2013 hit The Croods did at this same point in the run. The low-budget horror pic Unfriended collapsed by 61% in its sophomore showing to an estimated $6.2M and $25.2M overall. Universal should finish at $30-35M for this $1M-budgeted thriller.Audiences across the country showed some interest in the artificial intelligence drama Ex Machina which expanded everywhere and grossed an estimated $5.4M. The A24 release averaged a so-so $4,335 from 1,255 locations putting the total at $6.9M for the well-reviewed sci-fi offering. It hopes to pull in those sold out of Ultron in the weeks ahead.The Fox romance The Longest Ride dropped 38% to an estimated $4.4M for a $30.4M cume. Holding up very well in its fifth round was the comedy Get Hard with an estimated $3.9M, down just 21%, for a $84.1M sum for Warner Bros. heading to $90M+.Disney’s nature doc Monkey Kingdom followed with an estimated $3.6M, off 22%, and a $10.3M total. Helen Mirren rounded out the top ten with Woman in Gold which slipped 24% to an estimated $3.5M giving The Weinstein Co. $21.6M to date.The final weekend of April is often used as a dumping ground for films that distributors have no faith in. This year was no different as a couple of new releases debuted to modest results but failed to make the top ten. The critically-panned World War II-era drama Little Boy bowed to an estimated $2.8M from 1,045 locations for a weak $2,708 average. Grosses tumbled after opening day for Open Road.Warner Bros. gave Russell Crowe’s The Water Diviner a moderate national launch in 320 locations (including 70 IMAX screens) and came up with just $1.3M, according to estimates, for a sluggish $3,906 average. The R-rated war drama, which the Oscar winner directed and starred in, earned mixed reviews and skewed very old.One week ahead of its North American launch, the heavily hyped super hero sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron rocked 44 international markets with its colossal opening of $201.2M easily making it the world’s biggest movie this weekend. Leading the way were Korea with $28.2M, the U.K. with $27.3M, and Russia with $16.2M. 175 IMAX screens delivered $10.4M for a muscular $60,000 average.Disney reported that the debut was 44% bigger than 2012’s Avengers in the same territories when comparing local currencies. The U.S. dollar has strengthened over the past three years so the uptick in dollars was less. The first film also opened overseas one week before domestic and collected $185M from a more narrow 39 territories from a weaker dollar. Spain and Mexico open Ultron next weekend along with North America and will be followed by China (which is expected to be massive) on May 12 and Japan on July 4. Depending on how China plays out, Ultron may very well join Furious 7 in the $1 billion overseas club.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.4M which was down 15% from last year when The Other Woman opened at number one with $24.8M; but up 6% from 2013 when Pain &amp; Gain debuted in the top spot with $20.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"target, fiction, horror, of, Ovation, ratings, dark, Drama, demand, Fall, adaptation, SundanceTV, boxoffice, Action, bond","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/furious-7-vin-diesel.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-furious-7-first-to-fourpeat-in-3-years"},{"id":"47509109391012","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chappie #1 in Weakest Weekend of 2015","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chappie #1 in Weakest Weekend of 2015by Gitesh Pandya | March 8, 2015 |  CommentsThe robot film Chappie led a crappy North American box office with a number one debut that was nothing to be happy about. The R-rated action pic bowed to an estimated $13.3M from 3,201 locations (including 358 IMAX screens) and averaged a soft $4,155. It was the worst gross for a number one film since Halloween while the top ten slumped to its lowest point since early December.Starring Hugh Jackman, Dev Patel, and Sigourney Weaver, Chappie skewed 60% male and 57% under 30, according to studio data. Reviews were generally negative which hurt. Those polled by CinemaScore gave a lukewarm B grade to this Sony title which never generated much consumer interest at all. Produced for $49M, and unlikely to reach that amount in domestic grosses, Chappie will need substantial success overseas to break even. The international cast and crew will certainly help in that regard.March came in like a lamb with box office sales slumping to the worst showing of 2015 so far. But girlpower muscles will be flexed soon with next weekend’s fairy tale epic Cinderella followed a week later by the sci-fi sequel Divergent so expect this month to go out like a lion.Dropping from first to second was the Will Smith flick Focus with an estimated $10M in its sophomore frame. The 46% decline was reasonable but Warner Bros. has banked only $34.6M after two weekends which is on the low side for the actor. Even his 2008 flop Seven Pounds grossed more in its first ten days. Focus looks on course to end with $57M which would be Smith’s worst-grossing film since 2000’s The Legend of Bagger Vance.Debuting in third place was the comedy sequel The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with an estimated $8.6M from 1,573 locations for a $5,467 average. The Fox Searchlight release played to a mature audience and brought back the stars from the first film including Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, and Dev Patel while adding Richard Gere.Scoring the highest average among all wide releases, the PG-rated film earned reviews which were generally positive and saw a B+ grade from CinemaScore. Next weekend will see another 200 locations being added to the run. The first film, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel platformed in 27 theaters in May 2012 before expanding out to nearly 1,300 theaters nationwide ending with a $46.4M domestic total.Successful winter films followed. Fox’s Kingsman: The Secret Service eased 30% to an estimated $8.3M boosting the domestic cume to near the century mark at $98M. Kidpic The SpongeBob Movie followed with an estimated $7M, off 35%, giving Paramount $149M to date. Global stands at $259.4M.Worldwide phenomenon Fifty Shades of Grey dropped 47% to an estimated $5.6M for a new domestic haul of $156.4M while Universal’s global tally rose to a stellar $527.7M. Fading fast, look for a final of just under $600M which will be fantastic. Kevin Costner’s McFarland, USA followed dipping 32% to an estimated $5.3M putting Disney at $29.4M.Tumbling 50% in its sophomore frame was the supernatural thriller The Lazarus Effect which collected an estimated $5.1M landing it at $17.4M to date. Hit high school comedy The DUFF eased just 29% in its third round to an estimated $4.9M for a cume of $26.1M.Vince Vaughn continued his tumble out of box office relevancy with his latest comedy Unfinished Business which barely made the top ten opening to a dismal $4.8M, according to estimates. The Fox release averaged a poor $1,728 from 2,777 locations and marked the former star’s fourth consecutive flop after The Watch, The Internship, and Delivery Man which all opened in the $8-17M range.Poor reviews slammed Business and its B- CinemaScore indicates that paying audiences were not too satisfied with what they got. Moviegoers no longer see Vaughn as an appealing comedy anchor and he will need quality projects that actually deliver laughs in order to return to his old form. He enjoyed six $30M+ openings from 2004 to 2009. R-rated comedies in general have underperformed over the past year and Hollywood will need to up its game if it wants to mine the riches that can come from this genre.Bumped out of the top ten after a seven-week stay, Clint Eastwood’s smash hit American Sniper achieved yet another milestone as it surpassed The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 to become the highest-grossing domestic hit to come out of 2014. Over 99% of its current cume of $337.2M came in 2015, but still to beat out all the tentpoles, super hero flicks, and big-budget behemoths of last year is an amazing accomplishment. Worldwide, Sniper has just smashed $500M with more still to come. The domestic portion should finish in the neighborhood of $350M which is more than double Eastwood’s previous career high of $148.1M for Gran Torino.The top ten films grossed an estimated $72.9M which was down a steep 43% from last year when 300: Rise of an Empire opened at number one with $45M; and down 42% from 2013 when Oz the Great and Powerful debuted on top with $79.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Lifetime, female, 2020, comic, WGN, Animation, Shudder, Mystery","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/chappie-best.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-chappie-1-in-weakest-weekend-of-2015"},{"id":"47509107646111","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Outpaces the Competition Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious 7 Outpaces the Competition AgainHome and The Longest Ride round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 12, 2015 |  CommentsThe unstoppable action sequel Furious 7 easily held onto the number one spot in its second lap and also enjoyed a record launch in China putting it on course to become one of the highest-grossing global blockbusters of all-time.In North America, the Universal smash dropped 59% to an estimated $60.6M boosting the total to an eye-popping $252.5M after just 10 days. This was the second fastest any non-summer film in history has ever broken the quarter-billion domestic mark. Only The Hunger Games: Catching Fire did it faster needing just eight days in November 2013.Also impressive was that the decline was smaller than the 62-64% that the last three films in the Furious franchise had seen in their sophomore frames. Action sequels are built to draw their fan bases upfront and then suffer rapid deceleration on the second weekend. Most April movies would kill for a $60M first weekend so collecting this much cash on the second round is just incredible.Early in its run, Furious 7 has already become the second highest grossing film of 2015 behind American Sniper‘s $347.2M which it should be able to surpass. The latest Vin Diesel flick has already become the top-grossing chapter in the franchise beating the $238.7M of the last installment, Fast &amp; Furious 6. With the road ahead, Furious 7 may end up in the neighborhood of $375M domestically.As amazing as the North American performance has been, Furious 7‘s global domination has been nothing short of spectacular. Beyond spectacular, actually. The second weekend delivered a sensational $195M from 66 territories pushing the international cume to $548 and the worldwide tally to a jaw-dropping $800.5M. Though North America is playing the 2D format, most major foreign markets have it in higher-priced 3D. In just 12 days of release around the world, the Paul Walker hit has already outgrossed most of last year’s biggest global hits including Guardians of the Galaxy, Maleficent, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and Interstellar.Anchoring the overseas jackpot was a record-shattering opening day in China of $68.6M on Sunday – the biggest first day there all-time for any film whether Chinese or foreign. It more than doubled the $30M Friday opening day of Transformers: Age of Extinction from last summer which set a record at the time for biggest first-day for a Hollywood film there. That robot hit, which launched day and date with the U.S., ultimately reached over $300M from China powered by 3D and IMAX screens which Furious also has. Transformers even had Chinese locations, actors, financing, and cast/crew publicity visits to help its performance there while Furious 7‘s connection to the country is minimal.Mexico and the U.K. lead all other international territories with $39-40M a piece after two weekends. Russia generated the largest four-day opening of all-time with $15M this weekend including 3D and IMAX. On Monday, Furious 7‘s international cume will zoom past the $550M of Furious 6 to shatter a new franchise record. Developing an eighth installment must be a priority for Universal, regardless of the changes in cast and crew.With China just getting started and Japan still to open this Friday, look for the high-octane seven-quel to bust through the billion-dollar barrier next weekend. In fact, Furious 7 is now on a trajectory to reach about $1.5 billion making it the fourth largest global blockbuster of all-time behind just Avatar, Titanic, and The Avengers. It even has a shot at surpassing that Marvel assembly of super heroes, although the sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron launches overseas in T minus ten days and will have something to say about reaching that same box office stratosphere. Add in this year’s new Star Wars, Hunger Games, Jurassic Park, Pixar, and James Bond films and 2015 is setting its sights on obliterating all-time industry records.The DreamWorks Animation hit Home also stayed put ranking second again in its third round. Fox’s family release grossed an estimated $19M, down just 30% from the Easter frame, for a robust new cume of $129.6M. Compared to other recent toons opening on the week before the bunny holiday, Home is running 3% ahead of 2013’s The Croods and 34% ahead of last year’s Rio 2. A final in the $180M range seems likely with plenty more from overseas markets.The latest Nicholas Sparks romance The Longest Ride ended up opening in third place with mediocre results taking in an estimated $13.5M from 3,366 locations for a mild $4,011 average. Attracting lackluster reviews just like many past films based on this author’s best-selling books, Fox’s PG-13 pic lacked starpower with Scott Eastwood and Brittany Robertson in the lead. It did, however, open better than the last Sparks pic The Best of Me which bowed to just $10M last October.Funnymen Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart followed with their R-rated comedy Get Hard which slipped 34% in its third weekend to an estimated $8.6M. The Warner Bros. title has banked $71.2M to date and looks headed for $90M+, a great result for this genre.Fairy tale smash Cinderella slipped only 29% to an estimated $7.2M boosting the Disney cume to $180.8M after its fifth frame. Worldwide, the glass slipper saga has grossed a stellar $436.8M led by China’s $69.8M with Disney-loving Japan set to open in two weeks. Last summer’s Maleficent saw its top foreign grosses come from China, Mexico, and Japan. Reaching $200M domestic and over $525M global is possible for the princess.The Divergent Series: Insurgent fell 32% to an estimated $6.9M pushing Lionsgate to $114.8M in North America with the global total topping $250M. Domestically, it is running 8% behind last spring’s Divergent. The Helen Mirren film Woman in Gold expanded and grossed an estimated $5.9M from 1,504 locations for a $3,891 average. The Weinstein Co. has collected $9.3M so far.Expanding indie films followed. The low-budget horror pic It Follows added screens again and scared up an estimated $2M in its third wide frame giving Radius $11.8M. Al Pacino’s Danny Collins went national and joined the top ten with an estimated $1.6M and mild $2,169 average. Cume is $2.5M for Bleecker Street. A24’s While We’re Young added locations too and rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.4M raising the sum to $2.4M.Specialty distributor A24 has nurtured several platform hits recently and its latest came in the form of sci-fi drama Ex Machina which bowed to $250,000 from just four sites in New York and Los Angeles for a powerful $62,500 average. Reviews have been great and buzz out of South by Southwest helped fuel interest with genre fans. The R-rated pic goes nationwide next weekend where it will try to stay buzzworthy with a much broader audience.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.7M which was down 3% from last year when Captain America: The Winter Soldier remained at number one with $41.3M; but up 21% from 2013 when 42 debuted in the top spot with $27.5M.Follow BOG on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Plus, IFC, streaming, america, Con, VH1, movies, ratings, BET, history","poster":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/furious-7-vin-diesel-again.jpg","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-furious-7-outpaces-the-competition-again"},{"id":"47509111248567","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Nightcrawler and Ouija Tie For First","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Nightcrawler and Ouija Tie For FirstFury rounds out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | November 2, 2014 |  CommentsHalloween madness put a curse on the North American box office which sunk to a seven-week low with all wide releases failing to reach $11M for the weekend or a $4,000 average. Two films tied for the number one spot in a race that was too close to call with weekend estimates so final numbers to be reported on Monday will tell which movie takes the crown – newcomer Nightcrawler or horror holdover Ouija. Either way, it will be an unimpressive victory.Jake Gyllenhaal attracted a mediocre debut for his critically acclaimed crime journalism thriller Nightcrawler which opened to an estimated $10.9M from 2,766 theaters for a mild $3,944 average. The R-rated pic won raves from reviewers, however what film critics love often differs from what regular moviegoers want to pay to see. The Open Road release earned a lackluster B- grade from CinemaScore so ticket buyers were not too impressed. But for Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler‘s opening weekend was in the same range as some of his other films where he is the only major commercial selling point. They generally only open in the $10-15M range.Last weekend’s top film – the supernatural thriller Ouija – was the other movie making a run for the top spot with an estimated $10.9M as well, according to its distributor Universal. The studio is projecting a Saturday-to-Sunday decline of 50% compared to the 35% Open Road estimated for Nightcrawler so Ouija stands a good chance of edging out a repeat at number one. Compared to what other distributors are guessing for their Sunday drops, Nightcrawler‘s is conservative while Ouija‘s is aggressive. Universal’s spookfest, which ranked number one on both Friday and Saturday, is now up to $35M and counting.Many films held up well this weekend, especially kidpics, but it was the calm before the storm. On Friday, the holiday movie season kicks off with a potent double feature of Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi drama Interstellar and the Disney toon Big Hero 6 based on the Marvel character. Together, the tentpoles are expected to pull in over $100M in ticket sales next weekend and shove aside fall leftovers.With hardly any competition from new films, Brad Pitt’s tank film Fury dropped 32% to an estimated $9.1M in its third weekend. Sony has grossed $60.4M so far. The missing-wife thriller Gone Girl became director David Fincher’s highest grossing film ever and landed in fourth place in its fifth weekend with an estimated $8.8M. Off a slender 20%, the Fox title has now amassed $136.6M and may end its domestic run in the $150-160M range.Studio stablemate The Book of Life followed close behind with an estimated $8.3M, off just 17%, for a new total of $40.5M. Also holding up well, especially for a Keanu Reeves action film, was John Wick which dropped 44% to an estimated $8.1M. Lionsgate has taken in $27.6M to date and looks headed for a $45M domestic finish.Audiences continued to flock to the hit indie comedy St. Vincent starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy which virtually matched its gross from last weekend with an estimated $7.8M. The Weinstein Co. added 270 new locations boosting the theater count by 12% but the average of $3,038 was still solid dipping by only 11% from last weekend. That’s a terrific hold thanks mostly to encouraging word-of-mouth. Cume now sits at $19.5M.Also showing much strength with moviegoers was Disney’s Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day which eased by a slim 10% to an estimated $6.5M for a sturdy $53.6M to date. The Judge followed with an estimated $3.4M, off 22%, giving Warner Bros. $39.6M so far. The monster movie Dracula Untold rounded out the Halloween weekend top ten with an estimated $2.9M, down 34%, putting Universal at $52.9M.The Nicole Kidman thriller Before I Go To Sleep flopped instantly with a weak opening weekend estimate of only $2M from 1,935 locations for a flimsy $1,047 average. Clarius Entertainment saw mixed reviews plus could not compete in a crowded marketplace filled with better options for the target audience of mature adults. Kidman has not anchored a box office hit on her own in nearly a decade.Lionsgate took a chance and re-released the horror hit Saw on Halloween day for its tenth anniversary, but failed to attract any business stumbling to the worst opening of 2014 for any film going out in 2,000+ theaters. The iconic torture porn flick attacked 2,063 locations but grossed a puny $650,000 for a horrendous $315 average. The brand is no longer very relevant and the film has been widely available on other platforms for years so there was nothing new that the theatrical re-release brought to the table. Sure the gorefest has already been made, but costs for marketing and new digital prints will not be recouped by this re-release. Most re-releases in recent years, including 3D upgrades, have struggled to make much of a dent at the box office.In the specialty marketplace, only one film continues to make a lot of noise. Oscar hopeful Birdman expanded in its third round from 50 to 231 locations and grossed an estimated $2.5M for a strong $10,866 average. It was the best average for any film. With $5M in the bank and plenty more to come, the Fox Searchlight release is still growing and reaching new markets establishing itself as a major awards contender early in the kudos season. Next weekend will see it fly to nearly 450 theaters nationwide.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.6M which was down 34% from last year when Ender’s Game opened at number one with $27M; and down 36% from 2012 when Wreck-It Ralph debuted in the top spot with $49M. However, Halloween did not fall on either of those weekend periods.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Hallmark, Max, USA, Land, motion, Witch, series, 72","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Nightcrawler-and-Ouija-Tie-For-First"},{"id":"47509111216821","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dumb and Dumber Debuts at the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dumb and Dumber Debuts at the TopBig Hero 6 and Interstellar follow close behind, and Beyond the Lights ranks a distant fourth.by Sujit Chawla | November 16, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, 20 years after the release of the original, the Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels sequel Dumb and Dumber To ruled the box office while last weekend’s biggest hits had small falls. The rest of the box office was mediocre at best.1994 was the year of Jim Carrey. While he had appeared in a handful of films previous to ’94, it was the launch of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective in February to a surprise #1 opening that really made the world sit up and take notice. He quickly followed that up with The Mask and Dumb and Dumber, both of which also opened at number one. Fast forward 20 years, and here we are in 2014 and once again Carrey (with Daniels) has taken pole position with Dumb and Dumber To, which opened this weekend to an estimated $38M, Carrey’s biggest live-action opening since 2003’s Bruce Almighty. A mediocre B- Cinemascore won’t help its overall box office prospects, but it’s a strong opening from a former comedy champ.Strong matinee sales made this a close race for first with last weekend’s champ, the Disney animated Big Hero 6, holding up well in its second weekend, falling 36% to an estimated $36M, bringing its total to a robust $111.6M after only 10 days. There are a couple of films aimed towards kids coming out over the next few weeks, but none of them are currently generating any significant buzz, which means Big Hero 6 could end up with a final gross in the $250M range.After leading most of the mid-week, Paramount’s Interstellar settled for third place this weekend, falling a slim 38.6% to an estimated $29.2M, bringing its cume to $97.8M after 10 days. The hold is smaller than your typical sci-fi film, so while it’s not playing out like last year’s big sci-fi extravaganza, Gravity, Interstellar is holding up better than other sci-fi films like Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Interstellar seems to be playing out more like an adult drama than a sci-fi film, which can only help its long-term prospects.Opening in fourth place was the Relativity romantic drama, Beyond the Lights which stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Nate Parker, Danny Glover, and Minnie Driver. The film generated $6.5M this weekend, according to estimates, and reviews were generally pretty positive, so it should find a much wider audience on home video in the upcoming months.Fifth place belonged to the long-running Gone Girl, which brought in an estimated $4.6M in its seventh weekend. Also falling a slim 25% was Bill Murray and company’s St. Vincent, which landed in sixth place as the Oscar-hopeful took in another $4M, according to estimates. Seventh place went to the war drama Fury, which made an estimated $3.8M this weekend, bringing its total to a solid $75M after five weeks.Jake Gyllenhaal’s Nightcrawler fell 43% and brought in an estimated $3M this weekend for an eighth place finish. Horror film Ouija fell 48.5% to $3M as well, bringing its total to $48M after a month. And rounding out the top 10 was art house darling Birdman, which added nearly 400 screens and went up 6% from last weekend, bringing in an estimated $2.45M this weekend for a current total of $11.5M with many award nominations to come, which should help its final totals.A couple of Oscar hopefuls opened in limited release this weekend with opposite results. The heavily-promoted Jon Stewart film Rosewater opened on 371 screens to an estimated $1.2M for a per screen average of only $3,235. With the nearly non-stop press over the last couple of weeks, and his own show on Comedy Central, you would have thought this opening would have been much stronger. On the other end of the spectrum was Steve Carell’s Foxcatcher which took in an estimated $288K from only 6 theaters for a sizzling per screen average of $48,000. Reviews for both films were positive.The top ten films grossed $130.7M which was up 13% from last year when Thor: The Dark World remained at #1 for a second weekend with $36.6M; and down 45.6% from 2012 when The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 had a gargantuan $141M opening, which was the 8th biggest opening ever at the time.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"drama, police, Crackle, new, Super, canceled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dumb-and-Dumber-Debuts-at-the-Top"},{"id":"47509110989488","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbits Rule One Last Time","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbits Rule One Last Timeby Sujit Chawla | December 21, 2014 |  CommentsIt’s the beginning of the end for the Middle Earth Saga as the final chapter in the six-film epic opened this weekend at number one, destroying everything in its path even as it slipped from previous entries. Two other films debuted to middling numbers while most holdovers had substantial falls.For one last time, Peter Jackson’s tremendous Middle Earth Saga took the number one spot at the box office over the weekend, as The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies grossed an estimated $56.2M from 3,875 theaters for a per screen average of $14,508. Its cume since its opening day on Wednesday is $90.6M.While the reviews for the latest Hobbit film are the best in the series, there has been some audience fatigue domestically, though since this is the series swan song, people who dropped out for part two may come back for this one. All that being said, with an overseas gross of $265M in only 12 days, there’s a great chance Five Armies could still hit $1B worldwide when all is said and done, which would be a great way to close out the series. When your lowest grossing film makes ‘only’ $869M worldwide (Fellowship of the Ring), you know you’ve done something pretty remarkable.Another film trilogy with a presumed concluding chapter opened this weekend at number two as Ben Stiller’s Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb opened to an estimated $17.3M from 3,785 theaters for a per screen average of a middle-of-the-road $4,571. The original surprise hit Night at the Museum opened in December of 2006 to $30M and hit a $250M total by the end of its run. Its sequel, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian opened in May of 2009 to $54M and a final total of $177M. It seems fans were not looking forward to another trip to the museum this time as even with eight years of ticket price increases, Secret of the Tomb could barely muster half of the original’s opening.Beleaguered studio Sony released what was to be the first half of a one-two punch during the holidays with Annie starring Jamie Foxx, Quvenzhane Wallis, Rose Byrne, and Cameron Diaz. The remake of the cult classic from 1982 grossed an estimated $16.3M from 3,116 theaters for a per screen average of a decent $5,231. Sony could obviously use some good news and Annie may be it. While it fell a little behind fellow family film Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb it could very well outgross it in the long run as its Cinemascore was a solid A- vs. Secret of the Tomb’s B+, and most sequels tend to do frontloaded business. As we all know by now, the second punch was to come on Christmas Day with the release of The Interview but Sony and the North Koreans simply couldn’t see eye to eye and the film got yanked. Normally you’d think this much publicity would be great for the movie, but that wasn’t the case this time around. Eventually I think the film will hit theaters and most people will wonder what all the fuss was about.Dropping heavily in its second weekend was the Biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings which took in an estimated $8M this weekend a drop of… 66.6% from last weekend. You can’t make this stuff up folks. Any slight change up or down would make that percentage change as well but still, it’s almost as if someone planned it. The cume for Exodus now stands at $39M with a final total in the $55M range likely.Rounding out the top five was the season’s biggest film, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 which dropped a reasonable 39% this weekend to an estimated $7.8M, bringing its total up to $289M after five weeks. If you had asked me five weeks ago if it would be the number one movie of the year I’d have said absolutely, but it doesn’t look like it’ll be able to pass Guardians of the Galaxy and with the final Hobbit film underperforming, it looks like Marvel’s merry band of misfits will take the 2014 domestic box office crown.Reese Witherspoon’s Oscar-bait Wild jumped into sixth place this weekend, grossing an estimated $4.1M bringing its cume to $7.2M after three weeks. After spending only one week in the top five, Chris Rock’s Top Five fell nearly 50% from last weekend bringing in an estimated $3.6M this weekend for a total cume of $12.4M. Look for a final total in the $20M range.A couple of family films took the next two spots this weekend with Disney’s Big Hero 6 raking in another $3.6M, according to estimates, and bringing its cume to $190M. Not quite Frozen numbers but still a pretty darn good total from the Mouse House. In ninth place were the Penguins of Madagascar who took in an estimated $3.5M this weekend, bringing their cume up to $64M, a disappointing total for Dreamworks Animation.Rounding out the top 10 was the Bollywood hit PK which took in an estimated $3.5M this weekend from 272 theaters for a per screen average of $12,725, second best in the top 10. From studio UTV this is one of the highest opening weekends in North America for a Bollywood film in history.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.9M which was down 8.5% from last year when The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug remained at #1 for a second weekend with $31.5M; and up 68% from 2012 when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey also remained in the top spot for a second straight weekend with $36.9M.Follow B.O.

If the estimate holds, it will rank as the second best January debut of all-time behind just Ride Along which bowed to $41.5M a year ago.The gross was down from the $49.5M of Taken 2 from 2012 but up sharply from the $24.7M launch of 2009’s first film which became a sleeper hit. Taken 3 attacked 3,594 locations and averaged a fantastic $11,241. The third chapter impressed on Saturday and actually rose 5 percent from Friday. Threequels are generally front-loaded, Friday grosses include Thursday night pre-shows, and this particular Saturday featured the distraction of two high-profile NFL playoff games so to witness any increase was remarkable.Demographic data from Fox showed that Taken 3‘s audience was 54 percent male, 64 percent over 25, and 54 percent non-white. Critics slammed the PG-13 offering which is common for action threequels, but paying audiences were generally satisfied as the CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Produced for $48M, including a hefty payday for Neeson, Taken 3 should be another moneymaker especially as international appeal for the Luc Besson-produced films has always been substantial for this franchise. The three films combined may end with about $900M in global box office off of $120M in combined budgets.Jumping up to second place in its first weekend of nationwide play was the MLK drama Selma which grossed an estimated $11.2M from 2,179 locations for a mediocre $5,140 average. It was a disappointing showing for what has been a hot film during awards season with the PG-13 pic earning rave reviews across the board, plenty of nominations from numerous film groups, and having a very relevant true story about civil rights for blacks in America. The wide opening was less than half of the $24.6M for The Butler and the $27.5M of 42 – other dramas about real African American men from recent history. Both played in more theaters, however Selma‘s average was down 39 percent vs. Butler‘s $8,400 and off 44 percent compared to 42‘s $9,153.But Selma does have plenty of upside in its near future. Next weekend is likely to post strong numbers given that it is the long MLK holiday frame. Plus many Oscar nominations are expected this Thursday including Best Picture which will ignite interest immediately. In addition, the Paramount release’s glowing A+ CinemaScore indicates a bright road ahead as those who did show up loved the film and will be recommending it. The studio is hoping that this was more like a preview session which will spark positive buzz going into next weekend when more people will be in the mood to see Selma. Cume to date including the limited run over the holidays is now $13.5M.Studio research showed that Selma played older, as expected, with 83 percent of the audience for the 1965-set film being over 25. Females made up 61 percent for the Oprah-backed project. The racial breakdown was 43 percent black, 40 percent white, and 17 percent other. Though a story about famous Americans, the cast was led by England-born actors who played Martin Luther King, Coretta Scott King, President Lyndon B. Johnson, and Governor George Wallace. With a $20M production budget and promising weeks ahead, Selma should be able to reach profitability.The Disney musical Into The Woods ranked third with an estimated $9.8M breaking the $100M mark in the process. Adding 295 more locations, the PG-rated pic fell 48 percent and lifted its sum to $105.3M. A final of around $130M is possible unless the Meryl Streep starrer grabs some major love from Academy Award nominations which will be announced later this week.All Middle Earth reigns come to a conclusion and like its predecessors, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies dropped out of the top spot after three weeks as king. The final Peter Jackson epic fell a sharp 57 percent to an estimated $9.4M boosting the domestic total to $236.5M which is just slightly ahead of the $231.9M that the last film The Desolation of Smaug had grossed in the same number of days. That chapter enjoyed a better fourth weekend take of $15.7M. Armies may end up with roughly $260M from North America edging out the $258.4M of Smaug.Falling 54 percent was Angelina Jolie’s war drama Unbroken with an estimated $8.4M boosting Universal’s total to $101.6M. It has become the tenth $100M+ domestic hit of Jolie’s career, but the first as a director. The final take should reach the neighborhood of $120M unless it scores a number of major Oscar nominations.The Weinstein Co. expanded its awards contender The Imitation Game from 754 to 1,566 locations to have its product everywhere by the time Oscar nominations come out on Thursday morning. Off just 2 percent, the Benedict Cumberbatch hit remained strong with an estimated $7.6M and $40.8M to date possibly heading to the $70M range. Comedy threequel Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb followed with an estimated $6.7M, down 54 percent, for a new total of $99.5M for Fox right on the verge of joining the century club.Falling 56 percent was the musical Annie with an estimated $4.9M giving Sony a solid $79.4M overall. Close behind was the horror sequel The Woman in Black 2 which took a 68 percent nosedive in its sophomore session to an estimated $4.8M. Relativity has banked $22.3M.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.8M in its eighth round, down 50 percent. Lionsgate has collected $329.5M to date and is one week away from surpassing Guardians of the Galaxy to become the highest-grossing domestic film from 2014.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107M which was down 5 percent from last year when Lone Survivor expanded and hit number one with $37.8M; and down 5 percent from 2013 when Zero Dark Thirty opened wide in the top spot with $24.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"globes, Action, Broadway, discovery, GIFs, Premiere, of, play, zero, Biopics, comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Taken-3-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509109409455","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Rules Robust Christmas Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Rules Robust Christmas Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | December 28, 2014 |  CommentsA wide assortment of flashy choices brought large numbers of moviegoers out to the multiplexes driving the box office to the best Christmas holiday weekend in five years. Holding onto the crown for a second straight frame was the concluding Middle Earth chapter The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies which dipped 24% to an estimated $41.4M pushing the total to $168.5M after 12.5 days. That puts the final film of the trilogy 20% ahead of last year’s The Desolation of Smaug and even with 2012’s An Unexpected Journey after the same number of December days. Tentpole sequels normally tumble in their second weekends but the holidays helped soften the blow in this case. With an $89.2M international haul this weekend, the worldwide tally now stands at $573.6M with a billion dollars likely by the end.All films have a lucrative week ahead of them. With schools closed and many adults also being off from work, every day will play like a Saturday at the box office allowing cumes to rise quickly.There was a virtual tie for second place from two films driven by the starpower of Hollywood’s leading ladies, both scoring better sales than expected. Angelina Jolie’s directorial outing Unbroken debuted to an estimated $31.7M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a stellar $47.3M over the four-day period starting with Thursday’s Christmas Day launch. Playing in 3,131 locations, the inspirational PG-13 war drama averaged a terrific $10,140 over three days.With no major stars on the screen, no widely known subject matter, and reviews that were decent but not exceptional, Universal focused on the uplifting true story set during World War II, American patriotism, and Jolie’s star wattage. And it worked. Thursday kicked off with a massive $15.6M gross for the third largest Christmas Day opening in history. Despite what critics had to say, audiences liked Unbroken which earned a good A- CinemaScore. Studio research showed that the audience was 52% female and 71% over 25.Close behind in third place – and final numbers Monday may show them swapping positions – was the Disney musical Into The Woods starring Meryl Streep which bowed to an estimated $31M over three days and a potent $46.1M over four days. The PG-rated musical attracted nearly identical sales but did so from 691 fewer theaters. Co-starring Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine, and Johnny Depp, Woods averaged a spectacular $12,714 from 2,440 locations across the Friday-to-Sunday span.Reviews were positive, but ticket buyers were only somewhat satisfied with what they got out of Woods. The CinemaScore grade was a B which is only decent. Maybe paying customers were expecting more than just two minutes of Depp in the film. Studio data showed that the audience breakdown was 54% female and 57% over 25. Woods scored one of the biggest openings of all-time for a musical nearly matching the $48.8M four-day start of Les Miserables which also debuted on Christmas Day.Both Unbroken and Into the Woods should have no problem soaring past $100M domestically in early January.Fourth place went to the adventure sequel Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb which enjoyed a solid 21% holiday surge from its opening weekend to gross an estimated $20.6M. The Fox release has banked $55.3M to date and has a whole holiday week ahead of it. Fellow PG-rated sophomore Annie also saw a boost inching up 5% to an estimated $16.6M this weekend. Sony has banked a solid $45.8M to date for a film that has been pirated for weeks thanks to the studio’s files being hacked.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 became only the second movie of 2014 to break $300M domestic. Lionsgate’s popular tentpole rose 27% to an estimated $10M lifting its cume to $306.7M. While the latest Katniss saga joins Guardians of the Galaxy as this year’s only members of the triple-century club, it still is running 22% behind the pace of its predecessor Catching Fire from this same time of year. That hit stood at $391M at this point on its way to a $424.7M finish after the holidays. Mockingjay has reached $670M worldwide.Opening to disappointing results was Paramount’s The Gambler with an estimated $9.3M from 2,478 locations for a mild $3,753 average. Moviegoers who did show up did not care much for the Mark Wahlberg film as the CinemaScore grade was a lousy C+. Total since Thursday is $14.3M. The gender split was even with males making up 51% of the crowd, but Gambler skewed much older with 81% being over 25. Reviews were mixed.Benedict Cumberbatch’s awards contender The Imitation Game expanded nationwide from 34 to 747 theaters and took in an estimated $7.9M for a fantastic $10,616 average. Building up buzz for a month in limited play, The Weinstein Co. release successfully executed its expansion and stayed popular in wider play despite a flood of other competitors in the marketplace going after sophisticated adults. Cume is $14.6M and there is plenty of cash still to come.Fox’s big-budget epic Exodus: Gods and Kings followed with an estimated $6.8M, down 17%, for a $52.5M cume to date. The Reese Witherspoon awards contender Wild rounded out the top ten with an estimated $5.4M, jumping up 32%. Fox Searchlight has collected $16.4M so far.With so many choices for adults, Tim Burton’s latest film Big Eyes failed to capture an audience and opened outside of the top ten with an estimated $3M from 1,307 locations for a weak $2,285 average. The four-day total since its Christmas Day debut was only $4.4M. Reviews have been generally good for the Amy Adams-Christoph Waltz starrer, but the lack of major awards buzz coupled with limited starpower led to only a modest turnout for The Weinstein Co.The controversial comedy The Interview generated respectable grosses given its unique situation and collected an estimated $1.8M from 331 theaters over the weekend for a $5,471 average. Total since the Christmas Day launch is $2.8M. The James Franco-Seth Rogen pic about two Americans asked to assassinate North Korea’s leader was released legally on Wednesday on online platforms such as YouTube, Google Play, and Microsoft Xbox which quickly resulted in illegal copies being shared for free download on other sites. With so much online availability, especially since this film skews towards a tech-saavy audience of young men, the fact that many shows in theaters were sold out was impressive.The Interview has made headlines for weeks as part of the Sony hack story and its full theatrical release was scrapped and then reconfigured employing smaller chains and independent theaters with an online component added in. The major chains refused to play the film after threats of violence were made by the hackers. 36% of the four-day gross came from the first day making it the most front-loaded of all the films debuting on Christmas Day. Intense media attention created intrigue which translated into solid upfront business. Some audiences were buying tickets just to support freedom of speech. Reviews were mixed and audience feedback now that the film is out has been somewhat good, but not great. Sony is not planning any significant expansion of theaters.Clint Eastwood’s newest film American Sniper exploded to sensational numbers in platform release grossing an estimated $610,000 from only four houses in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas for a jaw-dropping $152,500 average per location. Reviews have been good with the R-rated film earning much praise for the direction and Bradley Cooper’s acting. Sniper will stay in limited release for two more weeks and then expand nationwide on January 16, one day after Oscar nominations are announced.Paramount’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. film Selma got off to a strong start with an estimated $590,000 opening weekend from 19 theaters for a solid $31,053 average. Likely to be a major contender at the Oscars, the critically acclaimed drama debuted in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Washington D.C. and has banked $912,000 since its Thursday launch. The studio will go nationwide on January 9, a week before the MLK holiday weekend. With Academy Award nods to be announced on January 15, Selma should certainly enjoy at least two weeks of terrific nationwide play, if not more. The production budget was only $20M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $180.8M which was up 8% from last year when The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug stayed at number one for a third frame with $29M; and up 17% from 2012 when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey remained in the top spot with $31.9M, also from its third round.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"obituary, stand-up, casting, anthology, bad, Black","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Rules-Robust-Christmas-Weekend"},{"id":"47509109408430","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Kicks Off 2015 at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Kicks Off 2015 at #1by Gitesh Pandya | January 4, 2015 |  CommentsJust like its predecessors, The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies spent a third consecutive weekend at number one ruling over a strong marketplace. The final Middle Earth film rang in the new year with an estimated $21.9M dropping a sizable 47% from the post-Christmas frame. To date, the Peter Jackson epic has collected a stellar $220.8M domestically and looks on course to reach the vicinity of $260M by the end of its North American run. That would edge out the $258.4M of the last film The Desolation of Smaug but fall below the $303M of the first chapter of the trilogy, An Unexpected Journey which was the fantasy franchise’s first film in nine years. The threequel should see rapid erosion in the weeks ahead now that the holidays are over and fans have already seen it.Overseas, Armies smashed the $500M international mark this weekend with continued success in Europe and around the world. The weekend saw an estimated $52.5M from 65 markets boosting the offshore tally to $502.1M and the global gross to $722.9M. China opens on January 23 so surpassing $800M and $900M will be no problem. Leading international markets are Germany with $68.9M, the U.K. with $57.4M, and France with $42M. However, those totals are all lower than Smaug’s at this same point last year despite the same number of weekends.The Disney musical Into The Woods won another close battle for second place with an estimated $19.1M in its second weekend, off 39%. Meryl Streep and her co-stars had a red hot holiday week and have raised the cume to a stellar $91.2M in 11 days. A final north of $120M is likely. That is a formidable amount considering the PG-rated pic is playing in the fewest theaters among the top six movies nationwide. Average is a sturdy $7,512 from 2,538 locations.A hair behind was Universal’s war drama Unbroken with an estimated $18.4M, off a similar 40%. The Angelina Jolie-directed film has banked $87.8M to date and should be able to clear at least $115M by the end of its run. Woods has fared better with critics, but Unbroken has scored higher marks with paying audiences.The weekend’s only new release found itself opening in fourth place. Relativity’s horror sequel The Woman in Black 2 debuted to an estimated $15.1M from 2,602 locations for a good $5,821 average. While not big, it was still above modest expectations going into the weekend. The PG-13 thriller follows the first hit film which opened to a strong $20.9M over Super Bowl weekend in 2012 led by Daniel Radcliffe in his first major role since the end of the Harry Potter franchise. The haunted house sequel features a new cast and takes place 40 years later.Reviews were mostly negative which is common for horror sequels. Exit polls showed that first-day audiences were 53% female, 65% under 25, and 62% non-white. The CinemaScore grade was a C which is mediocre for a spooky thriller. With November and December usually filled with cheery, upbeat films, the first weekend of January traditionally is a good time to bring back scary movies as distributors usually do each year. With Friday being a day off for many people (especially the target audience of teens and young adults) it accounted for a whopping 51% of the weekend gross as Saturday tumbled 36%. A fast fade is likely.PG-rated holdovers offering clean fun for the whole family followed. Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb dipped 29% to an estimated $14.5M for Fox lifting the cume to $89.7M. Final should reach about $110M which would be the lowest in the series following the $250.9M and $177.2M of the first two installments. The updated Annie dropped 31% to an estimated $11.4M giving Sony a solid $72.6M to date. That is an impressive total for a critically-panned musical that was also pirated online as part of the studio being hacked. A $90M final seems likely.The Weinstein Co. continued to see sensational results from its big horse in this year’s Oscar race. Benedict Cumberbatch’s The Imitation Game grossed an estimated $8.1M, up 2%, for a new total of $30.8M with much more ahead of it. The computer genius pic boasted what was by far the best per-theater average of any film in wide release with $10,757 from 754 locations. Expect strong sales throughout January boosted by a handful of expected Academy Award nominations.A terrific holiday season has now put The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 on course to surpass Guardians of the Galaxy to become the top-grossing domestic blockbuster from 2014. The latest Katniss adventure took in an estimated $7.7M, off 24%, for a new cume of $323.9M putting it only about $9M behind the Marvel smash which had the added benefit of 3D and IMAX prices. Mockingjay should end its domestic run near $340M. Its current global tally rose to $695.5M with China still to open next month so a $750M final is possible with the final film set to release in November.Earning low audience scores, The Gambler dropped 31% to an estimated $6.3M for a new total of $27.6M for Paramount. Disney’s hot toon Big Hero 6 jumped back into the top ten at number ten with an estimated $4.8M, off a scant 4%. With $211.3M to date, the popular animated film has surpassed the studio’s recent holiday season toons like Wreck-It Ralph and Tangled. Global tally for Baymax is now $378.7M with Japan leading overseas markets with $34.6M. Several major territories will open across January and February so there is much more ahead.There was plenty of action below the top ten with films in more limited release. The controversial comedy The Interview added 250 more theaters in its second weekend but also saw its digital release add cable and satellite providers for more in-home availability. The theatrical gross fell 39% to an estimated $1.1M while its per-theater average tumbled 65% to $1,893. Cume for Sony is $4.9M and the studio did not have an update on gross sales from non-theatrical revenue streams.The critically acclaimed drama A Most Violent Year platformed on Wednesday, December 31, in order to make the Oscar deadline and enjoyed a strong start with an estimated $188,000 from four sites for a potent $47,000 average. Total over five days is $300,000 for A24. Paramount’s MLK drama Selma added three theaters and enjoyed a 13% bump to an estimated $645,000 for a solid $29,318 average in its second weekend. Cume is $2.1M and the studio expands nationwide this Friday against the opening of Taken 3.Clint Eastwood’s new film American Sniper once again generated one of the best averages of all-time in its second weekend of platform play in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas. The Warner Bros. pic grossed an estimated $640,000 for a jaw-dropping $160,000 weekend average lifting the sum to $2.2M. The studio is waiting until January 16 to go nationwide once Oscar nods are announced.The top ten films grossed an estimated $127.3M which was up 7% from last year when Frozen returned to number one with $19.6M; and up 9% from 2013 when Texas Chainsaw 3D opened in the top spot with $21.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"critic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Kicks-Off-2015-at-1"},{"id":"47509111250616","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ouija Scares Its Way to #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ouija Scares Its Way to #1 DebutJohn Wick takes second, and Fury drops to third in its sophomore week.by Gitesh Pandya | October 26, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, With Halloween approaching, young women powered the supernatural thriller Ouija to the top of the North American box office with a solid opening of an estimated $20M. Produced for under $5M, the PG-13 chiller based on the creepy game from Hasbro averaged an impressive $7,000 from 2,858 locations.It’s the third horror film in four weeks to deliver strong results, but the first to hit number one. Annabelle and Dracula Untold both debuted in second place and the three films combined have grossed $147.8M to date putting the troubled horror genre in good shape during the all-important Halloween month. Studio research from Universal showed that an incredibly high 75% of the audience was under 25 while 61% was female. A lackluster C CinemaScore grade indicates that paying moviegoers were not too satisfied with their purchase and that declines common for this genre are to come.Ouija‘s successful release follows a radical shift in the development of the project. Originally, Michael Bay’s production company which turned Hasbro’s Transformers property into a multi-billion-dollar franchise was planning a big-budget approach for Ouija. It was later reconceptualized under micro-budget horror king Jason Blum’s company as a low-cost, low-risk project aimed at spooking teens and young adults. The domestic gross should finish at eight or nine times the production cost.For the first time in six years Keanu Reeves made it to the top two spots at the box office landing in second place with the opening of his new action thriller John Wick which debuted to an estimated $14.2M. Averaging a respectable $5,465 from 2,589 theaters including 347 IMAX screens, the brutally violent R-rated entry played mostly to adult men as expected. Studio research from Lionsgate showed that Wick skewed 60% male, and 77% over 25. IMAX screens accounted for $2.5M, or a very high 18% of the gross, and the CinemaScore grade was a decent B.Reviews were very strong, but audience turnout was nothing too impressive. Football and the World Series provided distractions for this audience over the weekend. Reeves last hit number one with 2008’s The Day the Earth Stood Still with $30.5M. But his most recent studio effort — the big-budget 47 Ronin — flopped last Christmas with $14.2M in its first three days, the same as Wick. Since the actor’s signature Matrix trilogy ended 11 years ago, he has not had a single $100M+ domestic hit. Lionsgate acquired the film at no cost, however recouping marketing costs for a wide North American release will be no easy task.Falling back to third place was the Brad Pitt tank drama Fury with an estimated $13M, off 45%. The decline would be moderate for most films, but for this particular pic it was slightly high given the Sony movie’s good buzz and older skew. Plus direct competition was not too furious this weekend. Second weekend declines for this month’s other star-driven mature-skewing films were 30% for Gone Girl and 40% for The Judge. Budgeted at $68M, Fury has grossed $46.1M so far and could be headed for a finish of about $75M.Into its fourth weekend, Fox’s hit thriller Gone Girl enjoyed the lowest decline of any wide release slipping just 37% to an estimated $11.1M for a new cume of $124.1M. Studio stablemate The Book of Life collected $9.8M, off a reasonable 42% in its sophomore frame, for a total of $29.9M for the animated entry. A final in the $50-60M range seems likely.The indie comedy St. Vincent starring Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy expanded nationwide and came in at number six with an estimated $8.1M from 2,282 locations for a mild $3,531 average. Earning good reviews, the PG-13 film from The Weinstein Co. has grossed $9.2M to date.Disney’s family comedy Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day held up well in its second outing dipping 39% to an estimated $7M for a new cume of $45.5M. Tumbling 53% in its second weekend was the Nicholas Sparks romance The Best of Me with an estimated $4.7M and a weak $17.7M to date. Look for a $25M final for the Relativity title.Robert Downey Jr. dropped to ninth with The Judge which grossed an estimated $4.3M, down 45%, giving Warner Bros. $34.4M overall. Collecting the same weekend estimate was the horror entry Dracula Untold which stumbled 57% thanks to new fright competition. Universal is now sitting at $48.3M domestic and $166M worldwide.Among notable specialty releases, Michael Keaton’s Birdman expanded from four to 50 theaters and grossed an estimated $1.4M for a strong $28,720 average following its monster platform debut in New York and Los Angeles last weekend. Fox Searchlight’s cume is now $2.1M and the distributor will widen again on Friday to the Top 60 markets with a total of nearly 250 locations with more to come in November. Birdman is currently on the shortlist of many industry insiders to earn an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.On the documentary side, the Edward Snowden film Citizenfour debuted in five theaters this weekend grossing an estimated $125,000 for a solid $25,000 average. Earning sensational reviews, the Radius release platformed in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. this weekend and will expand on Friday to Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Chicago. By Thanksgiving, the political doc expects to be playing nationwide.The top ten films grossed an estimated $96.5M which was up 4% from last year when Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa opened at number one with $32.1M; and up 29% from 2012 when Argo returned to the top spot with $12.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Annual, Dead, venice, National, Mary, america, Disney, Disney, Arts","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ouija-Scares-Its-Way-to-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509111210676","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mockingjay Rules, But With Less Fans","content":"Critics Consensusvar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Incredibles 2 Is Certified FreshPlus, Tag is mildly entertaining and Superfly is more style than substance.by Jeff Giles | June 14, 2018 |  CommentsThis weekend at the movies,&nbsp;we have a belated sequel to a Pixar classic (Incredibles 2, featuring the voices of&nbsp;Holly Hunter&nbsp;and&nbsp;Craig T. Nelson), some of Hollywood’s funniest fellows trying to touch one another without permission (Tag, starring&nbsp;Ed Helms,&nbsp;Jeremy Renner, and Jon Hamm), and a remade blast from the blaxploitation past (Superfly, starring Trevor Jackson&nbsp;and Jason Mitchell).&nbsp;What are the critics saying?Incredibles 2 (2018)  93%If you’re going to try and follow up an acclaimed blockbuster, you might as well take your time getting the sequel right — and in animation, where time can stand still forever, you have the added benefit of not needing to rush your cast back in front of the camera. Still, after waiting nearly 15 years for a second installment of The Incredibles, fans can be forgiven a certain amount of impatience; while the creative teams at formerly franchise-averse Pixar dreamed up new stories for the characters in Toy Story, Cars, Finding Nemo, and Monsters Inc., the ability to return to theaters continued to elude the superpowered Parr family. All that waiting has finally paid off with Incredibles 2, which reunites the original voice cast for a new adventure serving up more of the domestic turmoil, superhero satire, and brilliantly animated action that made the first one such a hit. It’d be tough to improve on the original Incredibles, and critics say that while this sequel doesn’t quite pull off that feat, it comes impressively close, adding yet another acclaimed entry to Pixar’s already estimable filmography. If you were a kid when The Incredibles&nbsp;came out, you might have kids of your own now — and like all the best stuff the studio has put out, the whole family can look forward to enjoying Incredibles 2.Tag (2018)  56%On one hand, it’s easy to believe Hollywood has long since exhausted most of the reasonable possibilities for comedy that exist in movies about grown men acting like boys. On the other, when you’ve got the Wall Street Journal writing about a real-life group of guys who take a month off every year to continue the game of tag they’ve been playing since they were kids, well, it’s awfully hard to resist the temptation to turn that into a film. Enter the descriptively titled Tag, starring Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, and Jeremy Renner as the fellows in question — a talented bunch whose commitment to the story was reflected in the set injury Renner sustained, breaking both of his arms and necessitating some last-minute CGI limb replacements in post-production. It would be wonderful to report that Renner’s suffering came in service of one of the year’s best-reviewed action comedies; alas, the truth is that critics are kinda meh on Tag, which reviews describe as funny and engaging in fits and starts, but ultimately not consistent or committed enough to fully deliver on its premise. Still, this is one talented cast, and even the critical pans say the movie isn’t without its moments, so if you’re in the mood for some arrested development laughs, you may want to check your local listings.Superfly (2018)  51%Released in 1972, the original Superfly&nbsp;helped lead the blaxploitation wave with a thoughtful Harlem-set drama about a drug dealer looking for one last big score; the movie’s trappings may look somewhat dated today, but thanks to Ron O’Neal‘s performance as main character Youngblood Priest — not to mention a killer Curtis Mayfield soundtrack — it still feels fresh. It’s easy to understand why music video veteran Director X wanted to take a shot at updating the story, and its themes are just as relevant as they were more than 45 years ago; unfortunately, critics say those themes have mostly been lost in this new version, which is far more focused on style than substance. Starring Trevor Jackson as Priest, the 2018 edition moves the action to Atlanta, but the basic contours of the story remain the same — which is part of why a number of reviews have outlined pundits’ disappointment with the lost social subtext. This Superfly&nbsp;will make its fortune by and by, thanks to Director X’s way with an artfully arranged scene or set piece, but as is so often the case with remakes, the original still reigns supreme.What’s New on TVThe Bold Type: Season 2 (2018)  100%The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women’s careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.Strange Angel: Season 1 (2018)  71%A beautiful slow burn, Strange Angel shoots for the stars, but gets a little lost in its own orbit.Also&nbsp;Opening This Week In Limited Release Eating Animals (2018) , a documentary about the commercial factory farming industry and its various impacts, is at 100%.

After a humdrum summer, autumn is bringing new life into the box office as nine films grossed over $6M this weekend.Holding on to number one for a second straight weekend was Fox’s Gone Girl, down a slim 28.6%, for a weekend estimate of $26.8M, bringing its total to $78.3M. The small fall in its second weekend shows that audience word-of-mouth is pretty good and people are interested in this unique, adult story. It is easily on its way to becoming director David Fincher’s highest grossing film, which is currently 2008’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which grossed $127.5M and was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, winning 3. Gone Girl likely won’t follow the same awards path, but will more than make up for it in box office receipts.The undisputed King of vampires got a reboot this weekend as the origin story Dracula Untold exploded into second place with an estimated $23.5M from 2,885 screens, for a per screen average of $8,131. After watching horror film after horror film flop this year, this is the second straight weekend that one has done extremely well. Perhaps horror fans were waiting for the spooktacular month of October to spend their well earned dollars, and an A- Cinemascore can only help the long term growth of the film. I’m sure Universal is quite happy with this performance and we should be seeing reboots to some of their most famous horror characters like The Mummy, The Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man and more coming over the next few years.Family audiences helped Disney land in third place this weekend with Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day which took in an estimated $19.1M from 3,088 theaters for a per screen average of $6,185. Based on the bestselling children’s book, the film opened slightly higher than the only other family film currently playing, The Boxtrolls which opened to $17.3M a few weeks ago. With another A- Cinemascore, Alexander will likely have a more profitable run than The Boxtrolls.Last week’s number two, the horror prequel Annabelle, dropped a reasonable 56% from last weekend to an estimated $16.3M, bringing its cume to $62M. It is the highest grossing horror film since last years Insidious Chapter 2 which went on to make $83M. Annabelle had a stronger second weekend hold (Insidious 2 dropped 66%) and is running about 3% ahead at the same point in its box office travels. Annabelle should end its run around $85-90M, which is extraordinary for a horror film.Robert Downey, Jr. shed his popular flying suit and instead put on a lawyer’s suit for The Judge, which also stars Robert Duvall. Opening in 3,003 theaters, the legal drama took in an estimated $13.3M this weekend, for a per screen average of a mild $4,439, lowest of the newcomers this weekend. With Gone Girl and the still potent The Equalizer out there, adult audiences more or less skipped seeing the man of iron outside of what they’ve come to love him for. Awards season is approaching and if Downey can get on some critics lists, The Judge might have some more money to make, otherwise chalk this one up as so-so for the A-list actor. Speaking of The Equalizer, Denzel Washington’s revenge thriller took in an additional $9.7M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to just a shade under $80M for Sony.Normally, the film at number seven would be the surprise of the top 10, but Lionsgate’s Addicted will have to take a back seat to a film we’ll discuss in a minute. However, the very adult drama based on the bestselling novel by Zane did remarkably well opening to an estimated $7.6M from only 846 theaters, for a per screen average of $8,983, second best in the top 10. Zane is a huge bestselling author of erotic fiction and Lionsgate must be ecstatic at the possibility of bringing more of her books to the big screen if this is the type of reception they’re going to get.A couple of holdovers landed in the next two spots this weekend. The Maze Runner dropped 35% this weekend to an estimated $7.5M, bringing its total to $83.8M with the $100M crown still in reach, and a sequel is already fastracked for next year. The Boxtrolls fell 44% to an estimated $6.6M, bringing its cume to $41M for Universal.Finally, the last new release in the top 10 was by far the most surprising – Meet the Mormons, a documentary about, well, Mormons. Paid for entirely by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the film took in an estimated $3.5M this weekend from 317 theaters, for a per screen average of $11,041. While reviews have not been kind, the film obviously hit the mark with its target audience. The LDS church has stated that all net proceeds from the film will go to the American Red Cross.Two award-bait films opened in limited release this weekend to positive numbers. Sony Picture Classic’s Whiplash opened in six theaters to an estimated $143K, for a per screen average of $23K, while Bill Murray’s latest, St. Vincent was even stronger from its four theaters, grossing an estimated $121K, for a per screen average of $30K.The top ten films grossed $134M which was up 29.6% from last year when Gravity held on to the number one spot for a second week with $43.2M; and up 14.3% from 2012 when Taken 2 also took the top spot for a second week with $21.8M.Compared to projections, Dracula Untold powered ahead of Gitesh’s $17M prediction, while Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day came in a couple of notches ahead of his $17M projection. The Judge came in just below his $16M estimate, while Addicted came in just about on target with his $7M prediction.Follow Box Office Guru on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Cosplay, Disney, YA, Awards, sag, show, heist, documentary, the, universal, TV, in, curtis","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gone-Girl-Still-1"},{"id":"47509112753858","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Turtles Defeat Expendables, Cops","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Turtles Defeat Expendables, Copsby Sujit Chawla | August 17, 2014 |  CommentsAveraging less than $1M per person listed above the title on the poster, The Expendables 3 crashed and burned settling for a fourth place finish while overperformers Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Guardians of the Galaxy continued their strong run atop the box office. Overall, the August box office came back down to normal numbers after two extremely strong weekends to open the month.The top two from last week stayed in the same position this week as two different sets of heroes remained in charge of the box office. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fell a reasonable 58% from its huge opening last weekend and brought in an estimated $28.4M for a total cume to date of $117.6M. Look for a finale in the $175M range with a sequel on its way in 2016, because what would life be without sequels? Guardians of the Galaxy fell 41% from last weekend to an estimated $24.7M, bringing its total haul to $222.3M to date. It’s running about 10% ahead of Captain America: The Winter Soldier from earlier this year, albeit with a slightly bigger third weekend drop. Guardians is still likely to become the highest grossing film of the year and stay that way, at least until The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 comes out in November. The Guardians sequel is due in 2017.Led by the stars of The New Girl and The Vampire Diaries, Let’s Be Cops landed in third place this weekend with an estimated $17.7M with a total cume from its opening on Wednesday of $26.1M. Heavy promotion and lack of a similar film in the marketplace – the last broad comedy came out over a month ago (anyone remember Sex Tape?) – helped the film break through. Audience breakdowns were 56% Male / 44% Female with 54% under the age of 25.Fourth place belonged to the film with the most star power in the history of the medium, The Expendables 3. Seriously, is there another film that could boast this kind of lineup? The only one I can think of that might come close is X-Men: Days of Future Past. Led by megastars Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford and others, The Expendables 3 opened to an estimated $16.2M. There are 17 actors listed above the title on the promotional poster which means the movie made less than $1M per person. This isn’t a scientific observation, just a very humorous one. While the series was never meant to get into megablockbuster range, this opening has to be seen as very disappointing. The first two films in the series opened to $34.8M and $28.6M. Cinemascore was an A- which is decent and means that people who wanted to see the film enjoyed it, it’s just that not many people wanted to see it.The beloved book-to-film genre added another entry this weekend as The Giver opened in fifth place to an estimated $12.7M. Hoping to tap into the audience of other popular page-to-screen translations like The Hunger Games or Divergent, instead the movie played out more like a Beautiful Creatures or Mortal Instruments. Perhaps there was too long a wait between the novel (which was released in 1993) and the film adaptation.The disaster film Into the Storm dropped 55% from its opening last weekend and ended up in sixth place this weekend, bringing in $7.7M, according to estimates. Its total now stands at $31M leading to a likely $45M finish. The Hundred-Foot Journey took seventh place this weekend falling a slim 35% to an estimated $7.1M, bringing its total to $23.6M. A finale in the $45M range also seems likely.Scarlett Johansson crossed the $100M bar this week with Lucy, which took in an estimated $5.3M this weekend for a total of $107.5M to date. The latest in the dance film series Step Up All In came down hard this weekend, falling 58% in its second go around to an estimated $2.7M, bringing its total to $11.8M. Now we play the waiting game to see if the film can reach the heights of Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo which made $15.1M all the way back in 1984/85. Indie darling Boyhood bounced back into the top ten at number ten, adding 265 screens and jumping 9% from last weekend to an estimated $2.1M, bringing its cume to $13.1M.The top ten films grossed $124.8M this weekend, up 10% from 2013 when Lee Daniels’ The Butler opened at number one with $24.6M; and up 2% from 2012 when The Expendables 2 opened on top with $28.6M.Compared to projections, The Expendables came in under Gitesh’s $24M prediction, while both Let’s Be Cops and The Giver were right on target with his $17M and $12M projections, respectively.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"free, international, Apple, christmas, Amazon, television, Britbox, Elton, joker, Awards, of, period","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Turtles-Defeat-Expendables-Cops"},{"id":"47509112748736","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Guardians Tops a Slow Labor Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Guardians Tops a Slow Labor Day WeekendPlus, The November Man and As Above/So Below have subpar openings.by Gitesh Pandya | September 1, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, Labor Day brought an end to another summer movie season on a slow note with the Marvel overachiever Guardians of the Galaxy leading the way again grossing an estimated $22.2M over the long Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend in its fifth frame. Three of those frames were spent at number one.With a three-day Friday-to-Sunday take that was almost identical to last weekend’s, the Disney release boosted its domestic cume to a fantastic $280.5M. That’s slightly ahead of the $277.4M that the first Iron Man had in the bank at the exact same point in its release. Starlord hopes to go on and also collect more riches by growing its franchise fortunes in the years to come. Overseas grosses for Guardians rose to $273.1M putting the worldwide tally at an impressive $554M. It still has yet to open in key markets such as Italy, Japan, and China so $700M+ is likely.Once again in second place was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with an estimated $15.7M over four days in its fourth round upping the cume to a robust $166.4M. Paramount saw a reasonable slide and with $112.1M from overseas markets has now taken in a strong $278M worldwide kicking off a new global franchise. Past Turtles movies were at New Line and Warner Bros.Warners collected an estimated $11.6M for its teen romance If I Stay over the long weekend and has made $32.2M so far. The buddy comedy Let’s Be Cops followed with an estimated $10.6M for a new cume of $59.7M for Fox.The new horror flick As Above/So Below opened in fifth place with an estimated $10.3M from 2,640 locations for a mild $3,910 four-day average. The low-budget Paris-set thriller earned a lousy C- CinemaScore from paying moviegoers and is looking at the usual short-lived theatrical run witnessed by films of this genre. The three-day bow was just $8.6M. Nearly every horror movie this year has underperformed as the industry heads into the critical pre-Halloween September-October corridor when demand for this genre usually increases. Even Labor Day weekend has historically been a great launching pad for horror titles but with teens and young adults abandoning multiplexes, this type of film has been struggling to attract paying crowds.Pierce Brosnan’s new spy thriller The November Man debuted close behind in sixth place with an estimated $10.2M from 2,776 locations for a lackluster $3,674 average. Since its Wednesday launch, the total has been just $11.9M for Relativity. Reviews were negative for the umpteenth action offering of the summer.Sony’s inspirational football drama When the Game Stands Tall fell to an estimated $8M and has racked up $18.7M so far. The book-to-movie entry The Giver was next with an estimated $6.9M over four days giving The Weinstein Co. $33.1M to date.Disney’s Oprah-Spielberg-promoted hit drama The Hundred-Foot Journey enjoyed another good hold collecting an estimated $6.3M raising the total to $41.1M. Sylvester Stallone and his gang from The Expendables 3 had the worst drop in the top ten falling to an estimated $4.6M. Lionsgate has banked a weak $34.2M to date.The Mexican film Cantinflas opened outside the top ten but played well with an estimated $3.3M from 382 sites for a good $8,704 average for Lionsgate. Sony re-released the modern classic Ghostbusters to celebrate its 30th anniversary (and upcoming Blu-ray release) and saw modest numbers with an estimated $2.2M weekend from 784 locations for a soft $2,806 average. Re-releasing old hits rarely leads to huge grosses these days, but they do put the spotlight on a popular brand re-energizing it so that it can monetize itself on other platforms.The top ten films grossed an estimated $106.3M over four days which was down 3% from last year when The Butler led again with $20.2M; but up 5% from 2012 when The Possession opened on top with $21.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dead, Spectrum, Nominations, Trailer, Winter, directors, Holidays, thriller, Kemper, The, Biopics, dc, TV, Video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Guardians-Tops-a-Slow-Labor-Day-Weekend"},{"id":"47509111264956","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Equalizer Scores Denzel’s 3rd Best Opening Ever","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Equalizer Scores Denzel's 3rd Best Opening Everby Gitesh Pandya | September 28, 2014 |  CommentsNorth American audiences came out in big numbers to see Denzel Washington fight for the little guy as his latest action thriller The Equalizer opened at number one selling an estimated $35M worth of tickets. It was the third largest debut of the double Oscar winner’s career behind just American Gangster ($43.6M in 2007) and Safe House ($40.2M in 2012) and proved once again how bankable and consistent he is as a box office draw. Over the past decade, every single one of Washington’s 12 starring vehicles has debuted north of $20M and was among the top three for its opening weekend. Half of them reached the number one spot.Equalizer also scored the fourth biggest September opening in history. Sony launched the brutal R-rated crime thriller in 3,236 theaters including 352 IMAX screens and averaged a robust $10,816 per location. Washington’s older-skewing brand of action pics and dramas are not known to be premium-priced events so having 9% of the weekend gross come from IMAX was impressive.Studio research showed that 65% of the audience was over 30 while the gender split was fairly even with 52% being male. Washington is a reliable draw with adult couples and is seen as someone who does not pick bad projects. Heavy promotion with the NFL and Eminem (who contributed a new song) paid off. Reviews were mixed but paying customers liked what they got as evidenced by a good A- CinemaScore.The Equalizer opened to an estimated $17.8M from 65 overseas markets including the United Kingdom, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and Australia. Washington is not as strong of a draw internationally as he is in the U.S with his last three films making more here than abroad. But breaking $200M worldwide is certainly a possibility for Equalizer which cost $55M to produce.Fox’s adventure drama The Maze Runner dropped 46% in its second weekend to an estimated $17.5M. It was a moderate decline and boosted the total to date to $58M. Produced for under $35M, look for Maze to reach a solid domestic final of about $90M with its sequel already set to release on the same weekend next September.Opening in third place with respectable results was the creepy toon The Boxtrolls with an estimated $17.3M from 3,464 locations for a $4,980 average. The PG-rated film’s debut gross edged out the $16.8M bow of the same company’s Coraline from 2009, however that film launched in 1,165 fewer theaters for a stronger $7,329 average.The new Focus release skewed 57% male and earned a decent B+ CinemaScore from audiences. Reviews were generally upbeat. With no competing animated films over the next couple of weeks and the Halloween season getting started soon, Boxtrolls could play well into October and find its way to a final gross in the neighborhood of $70M.The Warner Bros. comedy This Is Where I Leave You dropped a reasonable 39% in its second weekend for a good hold. The Jason Bateman-Tina Fey pic grossed an estimated $7M and raised its total to $22.6M. Off 46% in its third lap was Dolphin Tale 2 with an estimated $4.8M pushing the cume for Warner Bros. to $33.7M which is off 31% from the pace of its predecessor at the same point.No Good Deed followed with an estimated $4.6M, down 53%, for a good sum of $46.6M for Sony. Liam Neeson’s action entry A Walk Among the Tombstones tumbled by 67% for a weak sophomore showing collecting an estimated $4.2M. Universal’s cume is $20.9M on its way to a dull $28M.&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy stayed in the top ten for a ninth weekend and surpassed the lifetime grosses of the first Iron Man, Transformers, and Harry Potter films in the process. Star Lord and pals slipped 28% to an estimated $3.8M boosting the domestic tally to a sensational $319.2M. That puts Guardians at number 33 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Higher ticket prices and 3D surcharges helped, but still, for the Groot pic to reach this level is amazing considering that the characters are not well-known in the mainstream world and that it played in a less lucrative time of year. The global gross for Guardians shot up to $644.3M heading to $750M+. A big opening in China is right around the corner on October 10.The buddy comedy Let’s Be Cops grossed an estimated $1.5M, down 44%, putting Fox at $79.6M. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pulled in an estimated $1.5M as well and fell 45% in its eighth weekend. Paramount’s new cume is $187.2M with the worldwide tally rising up to $342.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.1M which was up 6% from last year when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 debuted at number one with $34M; but off 6% from 2012 when Hotel Transylvania opened on top with $42.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"book, teaser, Seed, prank, rings, Sony, 21st, comedy, discovery, singing, Emmys, sitcom, screenings","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Equalizer-Scores-Denzels-3rd-Best-Opening-Ever"},{"id":"47509112760006","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Lead Lackluster Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Lead Lackluster WeekendOok, ook, hail box office.by Gitesh Pandya | July 20, 2014 |  CommentsCaesar still ruled the North American box office as the well-liked action film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes pulled in the most ticket sales for a second frame at number one beating out three new releases over another sluggish session for what Hollywood chose to offer up this summer.The Fox film grossed an estimated $36M dropping a reasonable 50% in its sophomore frame pushing the total to date up to an impressive $139M. That was a great hold for a sci-fi sequel and shows that audiences are liking and recommending the adventure film. None of the new openers were action tentpoles so that helped as well. Dawn averaged a healthy $9,070 from 3,969 locations and is now running an encouraging 32% ahead of the pace of 2011’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes. But the coming weeks will present some challenges with a large number of big-budget action offerings on the calendar starting with this Friday’s double dose of Lucy and Hercules. Still, Dawn looks to be on track to reach about $225M from North America alone.50 overseas markets for Dawn, including 29 new ones that just launched post-World Cup, grossed a stellar $61M this weekend bumping the international cume up to $103M with seven of the top ten offshore territories still to open. Worldwide tally stands at $242M with 17 new markets including Brazil and Mexico debuting next weekend.Ending a drought that has lasted for almost a year, a horror film finally opened to strong numbers as the sequel The Purge: Anarchy debuted in second place to an estimated $28.4M. Scoring a solid $10,110 average – tops among all wide releases – the low-cost $9M thriller fell just 17% from the shockingly huge $34.1M opening weekend of The Purge from last summer. Reviews were mixed but Universal’s marketing was effective, as was the brand, and brought out an audience that has avoided almost every fright film this year. None had broken $20M on opening weekend yet. Anarchy delivered the best horror debut since the $40.3M of last September’s Insidious Chapter 2.Studio research showed that the audience was 52% female but what was more critical was that a very high 61% was under 25. Teens and younger adults do not come out to the multiplexes as often as they always have in the past. The mobile device is the new multiplex for this generation. So it is rare today for any film to see that high of a share of its audience be from this younger age demo. Anarchy’s audience was also ethnically diverse. Latinos led the way with 36% of the crowd and non-whites in general were 71%. The CinemaScore grade was a B which is pretty decent for this genre. Its predecessor earned a C and plummeted 76% in the second weekend.Taking advantage of a concerning void in the summer marketplace right now for kidpics, the animated sequel Planes: Fire and Rescue opened well to an estimated $18M from 3,826 locations for a $4,705 average. Considering this is a follow-up to a film intended to go straight to video, the debut was quite respectable and was not too far from the $22.2M launch of Disney’s Planes last August. Current kid movies have played out and Pixar has skipped the summer games for the first time in nine years creating a lucrative opportunity for a lower quality animated entry like Fire to enter and succeed.The audience breakdown was split evenly between males and females and 78% of the crowd consisted of families with little crossover appeal to teens or couples. Reviews were poor which was not surprising but audiences gave an A CinemaScore grade. With studios making the unwise choice of programming no more major toons for the rest of the summer, the new Planes is well-positioned to cash in over the weeks ahead.Cameron Diaz’s new comedy Sex Tape disappointed in fourth place with an opening weekend of an estimated $15M which was less than half of the debut of her 2011 summer R-rated comedy hit Bad Teacher from the same director. The Sony release averaged a mediocre $4,899 from 3,062 locations and was panned by critics which helped to repel potential ticket buyers. Studio research showed that the audience was 53% female and 52% over 30.Paying moviegoers agreed with reviewers as the CinemaScore grade was a lousy C+. Diaz fared much better anchoring April’s The Other Woman which opened at number one to $24.8M on its way to a current cume of $83.8M. In Australia, a great market for American comedies, Sex Tape opened about even with Teacher this weekend so international results could help this new raunchfest become a money maker.The global phenomenon Transformers: Age of Extinction fell 39% to an estimated $10M for a new domestic total of $227.2M on its way to a finish of around $250M. Overseas results remained much better with an $81.2M international weekend gross driven by new openings in Brazil and much of Europe which until now was distracted by the World Cup. The overseas take vaulted to $659.1M repping three-quarters of the $886.3M global gross as it looks to break the billion dollar mark next week. China leads the world with a staggering $285.7M to date – an amount no film in North America has reached yet in 2014. Extinction has a shot now to surpass the $895M of The Avengers for the number four spot on the list of all-time overseas blockbusters trailing just Avatar, Titanic, and the final Harry Potter. That is an incredible feat for a film which will not even reach the Top 75 among all-time domestic hits.Melissa McCarthy’s Tammy followed with an estimated $7.6M, down a moderate 39%, for a new total of $71.3M for Warner Bros. An R-rated comedy doing much better with summer crowds, 22 Jump Street, dropped only 28% to an estimated $4.7M in its sixth round pushing Sony’s new cume to $180.5M.The DreamWorks toon How to Train Your Dragon 2 took in an estimated $3.8M, off 37%, giving Fox $160.7M. That’s 16% behind the pace of its 2010 predecessor. At this point in each of the last two summers, two toons had broken $200M already.Disney’s leggy super villainess pic Maleficent became the first summer movie to spend eight weeks in the top ten with an estimated $3.3M, off only 21%. The Angelina Jolie smash has now amassed a remarkable $228.4M in North America and an incredible $697.2M worldwide. The only other films all year to spend eight weeks in the top ten were Ride Along and Divergent. Among all films however, the year’s leader is Frozen with 11 since the beginning of January which followed five frames at the end of 2013. Together, the muscular girlpower mega-hits Maleficent and Frozen have grossed a jaw-dropping $1.97 billion globally for Disney.Relativity’s kidpic Earth to Echo fell 41% to an estimated $3.3M pushing the modest sum up to $32M.On the specialty scene, the critical darling Boyhood enjoyed a wonderful expansion from five to 34 locations and grossed an estimated $1.2M for a potent $35,235 average. The slower roll-out from IFC is allowing audiences to find the film at the right time as word-of-mouth spreads to all major markets. It’s the most talked about film in the indie world right now. Cume is $1.8M with plenty more to come as an additional 15 markets will open next weekend. Boyhood will certainly become one of the highest-grossing films in company history for IFC.Writer/director/star Zach Braff’s new film Wish I Were Here, which generated mountains for press for its Kickstarter campaign, debuted with just decent numbers as reviews from critics were lackluster. Focus bowed the R-rated tale in 68 locations and grossed an estimated $495,000 for a mild $7,279 average. Boyhood, which has far better reviews and even Oscar buzz, is providing plenty of competition at this moment among arthouse audiences across the top ten markets. Wish is planning to expand into about 600 theaters next week which will be a challenge given the average it generated in its limited start. Kate Hudson is receiving much praise for her performance, though.Hollywood is in a funk this summer as this was the sixth consecutive weekend that the box office was down versus last year. Four of those frames were down by more than 20%. A major factor causing the deficit comes from two genres that usually deliver massive grosses at this time of year – animated films and super hero pics. Compared to this point last summer, those two categories have grossed a whopping $600M less this summer. Add in some lame films, the continuing exodus of teens, and a lack of installments from the top-selling franchises of today, and the industry now has to deal with weak summer attendance that will result in fewer people seeing trailers for the upcoming fall and holiday season movies.The top ten films grossed an estimated $130M which was down a disturbing 25% from last year when The Conjuring opened at number one with $41.9M; and off 41% from 2012 when The Dark Knight Rises debuted on top with a 2D record $160.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"lee, MCU, Wars, Awards, chucky, nightmare, cats, spanish, Islander, camera, Country, Pirates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Apes-Lead-Lackluster-Weekend"},{"id":"47509111276222","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Good Deed Roars at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Good Deed Roars at #1by Gitesh Pandya | September 14, 2014 |  CommentsThe home invasion thriller No Good Deed stormed the North American box office and delivered a sensational debut taking the number one spot and energizing a marketplace in need of excitement. Starring Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson, the PG-13 film debuted to an estimated $24.5M from 2,175 locations and averaged a sizzling $11,264 per location. Sales were driven by adult women with the leads flexing some starpower (plus taking Executive Producer credits) and engaging fans actively on social media to create must-see buzz.Among films opening in September in under 2,500 theaters, No Good Deed generated the second best debut ever. The only bigger one was the 3D re-release of The Lion King which bowed to $30.2M from 2,330 locations in 2011. Deed succeeded in reaching its target audience and getting them to come out and open wallets. Reviews were mostly negative but ticket buyers instead responded to the stars as well as to the slick trailer and commercials promising a thrilling good time.Studio data from Sony showed that females made up 60% of the audience while 59% were over 30. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Deed opened not too far behind Elba’s Obsessed ($28.6M) and Henson’s recent hit Think Like A Man Too ($29.2M) which was a major sequel with a large cast of stars. All three films were produced by Will Packer who has enjoyed a terrific track record over the past seven years.Family audiences came out in decent numbers for the new save-the-animal story Dolphin Tale 2 which debuted in second with an estimated $16.6M from 3,656 theaters for a $4,527 average. The PG-rated sequel opened 14% below the $19.2M of its 2011 predecessor which also launched in mid-September just after kids went back to school. That film had great legs finishing with nearly four times its opening weekend gross.The solid A CinemaScore grade hints at a good run ahead for Warner Bros. especially since next weekend sees no new competitors for the family crowd. Reviews were generally upbeat for Dolphin which reunited cast members Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Harry Connick Jr.The Marvel juggernaut Guardians of the Galaxy smashed the $300M barrier twice this weekend, first with domestic and then with international. The four-time chart-topper saw another great hold slipping 22% in its seventh weekend to an estimated $8M boosting the North American total to a robust $305.9M. Groot and friends climbed up to number 43 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and might be able to make it into the all-time Top 30. In the next week, Guardians will surpass Iron Man 2 and in another week, will sail past Iron Man.Overseas grosses rose to $305.6M for a new worldwide tally of $611.5M on its way to $700M+. Japan opened strong this weekend beating out the recent Captain America and Thor sequels. China and Italy open next month for extra cash in the bank.Two successful summer leftovers rounded out the top five with solid holds. Kid adventure Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles dropped only 26% to an estimated $4.8M for a new total of $181M for Paramount. Michelangelo and pals are on course to finish close to the final domestic totals of early summer tentpoles like The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Godzilla. Global rose to $319.9M. The Fox comedy Let’s Be Cops grossed an estimated $4.3M, off just 23%, for a new total of $73M.Opening close behind in sixth place was the crime drama The Drop with an estimated $4.2M from 809 locations for a respectable $5,192 average. The R-rated film starring Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini earned good reviews and played to older adults. Fox Searchlight will add more theaters next weekend.The Warner Bros. romance If I Stay and the Relativity spy thriller The November Man followed with estimates of $4.1M (down 27%) and $2.8M (off 36%), respectively. New cumes are $44.9M and $22.5M.Sci-fi drama The Giver fell 23% to an estimated $2.6M and $41.3M cume for The Weinstein Co. Rounding out the top ten was the leggy restaurant flick The Hundred-Foot Journey with an estimated $2.5M, off 22%, for a new sum of $49.4M. The Helen Mirren hit has spent six weeks in the top ten, never dropped by more than 35%, and is within striking distance of cracking the $50M mark for Disney.The top ten films grossed an estimated $74.3M which was down 14% from last year when Insidious Chapter 2 debuted at number one with $40.3M; but up 15% from 2012 when Resident Evil: Retribution opened on top with $21.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-No-Good-Deed-Roars-at-1"},{"id":"47509114413780","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is Still Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America: The Winter Soldier is Still Number OneRio 2 and Oculus round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 13, 2014 |  CommentsMarvel muscle kept Captain America: The Winter Soldier on top of the North American box office for a second time while the Brazilian birds of another April sequel, Rio 2, landed in second place followed by middling debuts from a pair of other new releases.The latest Captain America saga grossed an estimated $41.4M in its sophomore frame falling an acceptable 56% from its record debut. That was about even with the 57% decline experienced last November by Thor: The Dark World and the 58% drop Iron Man 3 saw last May. All three enjoyed a post-Avengers boost with audiences. Winter Soldier now sits at a mighty $159M on its way to the vicinity of $250M which will beat out all five Thor, Hulk, and Captain America movies.Overseas success, led by China, has been tremendous for the new Steve Rogers story. This weekend saw $60.6M from 54 markets boosting the international tally to $317.7M and the worldwide haul to $476.7M which is already much bigger than the $371M lifetime global gross of its 2011 predecessor. It could eventually double that mark.China leads all overseas markets by a wide margin with a jaw-dropping $80.4M to date which is bigger than the next three markets – Korea, UK, and Mexico – combined. With Japan opening next weekend, reaching the $750M mark may just be possible which would beat out most of the films from the Avengers gang as well as last summer’s Superman movie Man of Steel.Opening in second place was the animated sequel Rio 2 with an estimated $39M which was virtually identical to the $39.2M bow of its 2011 predecessor. Both films opened on the session before Easter weekend which is a slot studios often use for major kidpics given that many schools start closing during that time making the target audience available during weekdays. Rio 2 actually edged out Winter Soldier on Friday, but the Saturday increase was not as strong so the full weekend gross came in a few notches below.Good weather in much of the country on Saturday affected the overall box office and certainly family films. The first Rio jumped 69% Friday-to-Saturday in its debut frame while the sequel increased only 28%. Sequels do tend to be more upfront and nowadays there is extra Thursday night business added to the Friday take, however Rio 2 did not jump up on Saturday as much as expected. Fortunately, there are no A-list toons opening between now and mid-June so Rio 2 can make up any lost business in the days and weeks to come. The G-rated movie can especially corner the market for younger children who parents would not take to gun-heavy super hero films like Captain America. It earned a solid A CinemaScore while marks from film critics were mixed.Studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was female, 57% was non-white, and a low 31% of sales came from 3D screens. Animated films often score low in this higher-priced format. The reported production budget was just over $100M. The first Rio grossed a whopping $486M worldwide with 71% coming from overseas markets so the follow-up is certainly looking at worldwide audiences to measure success. Rio 2 has already amassed $125.2M from international markets with plenty more to go with Easter holidays coming up. The pair of Rio films may certainly reach a combined global gross of more than $1 billion.The supernatural thriller Oculus debuted in third place to mediocre results with an estimated $12M from 2,648 locations for a $4,532 average. The R-rated spooky mirror flick earned generally positive reviews from critics, but was not well-liked by the paying public as the CinemaScore grade was a lackluster C. Relativity picked up the low-budget $5M film at last year’s Toronto International Film Festival and promoted it as being from the producer of the Paranormal Activity and Insidious franchises. But despite having no major horror films release over the past two months, Oculus still did not attract any impressive turnout.Kevin Costner suffered his third disappointment in four months as the football flick Draft Day bowed to an estimated $9.8M landing in fourth place. The Lionsgate release averaged a weak $3,506 from 2,781 and was just the latest film this year to see its pricey Super Bowl TV spot fail to translate into box office gold. Others included Need For Speed, Pompeii, Muppets Most Wanted, and Costner’s own 3 Days to Kill. Reviews were mixed for Draft Day which cost just under $25M to produce and the CinemaScore was a moderate B+.Book-based hit Divergent dropped 42% in its fourth lap to an estimated $7.5M pushing the domestic tally to $124.9M for Lionsgate which has three more films to release for this franchise. Overseas grosses from 62 markets climbed to $50.3M for a worldwide take of $175.2M. Also collecting an estimated $7.5M was the historical epic Noah which tumbled 56% to a $84.9M sum for Paramount. Its bigger international haul stands at $162M now for a solid $246.9M global gross.A pair of moneymaking indies followed those big-budget epics. The faith-based hit God’s Not Dead grossed an estimated $5.5M, off 29%, for a $40.8M cume for Freestyle. Fox Searchlight saw an estimated $4.1M with its Wes Anderson smash The Grand Budapest Hotel which declined by 34% putting the total at $39.5M.Kidpics rounded out the top ten but fell hard thanks to new competition. Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted took in an estimated $2.2M, down 64%, while the animated comedy Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman banked an estimated $1.8M, down 64% as well. Totals are now $45.7M and $105.2M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $130.7M which was up 25% from last year when 42 opened at number one with $27.5M; and up 25% from 2012 as well when The Hunger Games remained on top for a fourth weekend with $21.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cars, FirstLook, festivals, blockbusters, die, poppins, Moore, Sneak, President, robots, Marvel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Captain-America-The-Winter-Soldier-is-Still-Number-One"},{"id":"47509112770249","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Transformers Scores Biggest Debut of the Year","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Transformers Scores Biggest Debut of the Year22 Jump Street and How to Train Your Dragon 2 hold onto distant #2 and #3 spots.by Gitesh Pandya | June 29, 2014 |  CommentsThis weekend, the fourth round of Autobots destruction conquered the global box office as the Michael Bay sequel Transformers: Age of Extinction scored the largest opening of 2014 both domestically and worldwide. The PG-13 film which featured a new cast led by Mark Wahlberg scored a domestic opening weekend of an estimated $100M. If the estimate holds, it will be the first movie of the year to break the century mark in its first weekend following four tentpoles that debuted to over $90M each. Even if the estimate turns out to be too aggressive, Extinction still seems likely to have the year’s largest opening frame.The new installment of loud mayhem averaged $23,624 from 4,233 locations including 3D and IMAX ticket prices. That is fourth best all-time among films opening in June. A robust $10.7M of the gross came from the 353 IMAX screens for an 11% share. 47% of the gross came from 3D screens including large-format ones; this is down from the 60% of Transformers: Dark of the Moon, which opened to a stellar $180.7M across six days plus Tuesday night previews also starting at 9pm. The Friday-to-Sunday portion, which did not include the key opening day gross, was $97.9M. Factoring in different conditions, Extinction opened a bit weaker than Moon.Reviews were mostly negative for the new Transformers and with teens today increasingly skipping multiplexes for their entertainment, it was tough to get much past $100M. Studio research showed that males made up a very high 64% of the crowd and 58% were 25 and over. The CinemaScore grade from paying moviegoers was a good A- so customers were generally satisfied with this as mindless summer escapism.The overseas launch of the new Transformers was scorching hot, led by a mind-blowing record-shattering opening in China — where parts of the film were shot — thanks to a strategic partnership in what was by far the largest-grossing international market on the last film in the series. Early estimates put the China opening day at $30M Friday and the opening weekend at $90M (including $9.8M from IMAX) which is an all-time high for a foreign film there. It was also double what Dark of the Moon did when it debuted three years ago. Moon launched in China a month after the US release. This time, the world’s two biggest movie markets opened day and date.Overall, the international debut soared to an incredible $201.3M from only 37 territories including most of the Pacific Rim. After China were Russia with $21.7M, where it was the second biggest opening of all-time, and Korea with $21.5M, which was tops for 2014. There is still plenty of upside as many key markets, not wanting to face the distraction of the World Cup, chose not to open this weekend. But with over $301M globally in under a week, Age of Extinction is well on its way to surpassing $1 billion in worldwide box office just like its predecessor. International growth may even lead to a new franchise high, prompting more Optimus Prime flicks.Sony’s comedy sequel 22 Jump Street has been performing well with audiences and held second place with an estimated $15.4M in its third weekend. Off 44%, the R-rated hit has now surpassed 21 Jump Street with $139.8M domestic and counting. A final near the $190M mark may result. Worldwide take right now is $194M.How to Train Your Dragon 2 once again did not show a great hold and has been eroding more like a sequel than like a quality toon with little direct competition. The third round saw an estimated $13.1M, down 47%, for a $121.8M total. After 17 full days of release, Dragon 2‘s cume is virtually identical to Kung Fu Panda 2‘s from 2011. That other DreamWorks Animation summer sequel ended its domestic run with $165.2M and the new Dragon should finish in the same ballpark.The June sequel with the worst legs is Think Like A Man Too which collapsed 64% in its sophomore round to an estimated $10.4M. Sony has banked $48.2M and could be headed for about $75-80M. It was the only film in the top ten to fall by more than half.Maleficent had a good weekend becoming the latest summer blockbuster (along with The Amazing Spider-Man 2) to cross the $200M domestic mark. The Angelina Jolie smash dipped only 36% to an estimated $8.2M raising the cume to $201.9M. Worldwide is now a remarkable $585.6M. It is now Jolie’s highest-grossing live-action film ever domestically, internationally, and globally. It should cross $600M by Saturday when it opens in its final market, Japan, where it hopes to unseat fellow Disney hit Frozen after its historic 16-week reign at number one. Edge of Tomorrow opens there next weekend too.Clint Eastwood’s Jersey Boys dropped a moderate 43% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.6M giving Warner Bros. $27.3M to date. The big screen adaptation of the Broadway musical has not been a strong performer and could end with about $50M.Tom Cruise’s sci-fi pic Edge of Tomorrow dropped 47% to an estimated $5.2M bumping the total up to $84.2M. With good holds, the Warner Bros. pic is set to surpass the $89.1M of his last film Oblivion which was also a futuristic actioner, and is on course to squeak past the $100M mark. Fox’s hit romance The Fault In Our Stars followed with an estimated $4.8M, off 44%, for a new cume of $109.5M.X-Men: Days of Future Past, the summer’s highest-grossing hit so far, fell 46% to an estimated $3.3M and has banked $223.4M to date for Fox. Breaking $700M worldwide, the latest chapter has allowed the mutant franchise to cross the $3 billion threshold in combined box office across seven films.Jon Favreau’s Chef continues to be this summer’s indie comedy sensation that audiences discover over time. Despite losing theaters in its eighth weekend, the Open Road release dipped a scant 3% to an estimated $1.7M for a new cume of $19.4M. Having never played in more than 1,300 theaters, Chef is on course to reach at least $25M and may even hit $30M.Opening to good results in limited release was the critically acclaimed sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer starring Chris Evans with an estimated $162,000 from just eight locations for a $20,250 average from Radius. Parent company The Weinstein Co. also saw a nice start for the Keira Knightley-Mark Ruffalo music industry tale Begin Again with an estimated $148,000 from five sites for a $29,600 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $169.7M which was down 6% from last year when Monsters University stayed at number one with $45.6M; and off 11% from 2012 when Ted debuted on top with $54.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Certified, New, police, football, RT21, Valentine's, crossover, CNN, batman, Star, reboot, ESPN, Out","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Transformers-Scores-Biggest-Debut-of-the-Year"},{"id":"47509112775371","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hill &amp; Tatum Take Down Dragon","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hill &amp; Tatum Take Down Dragonby Sujit Chawla | June 15, 2014 |  CommentsIn a battle of sequels, the R-rated action-comedy 22 Jump Street overpowered the animated family film How to Train Your Dragon 2 while last weekend’s champ The Fault in Our Stars went tumbling down the charts.A little over two years since the original 21 Jump Street opened to $36.3M on its way to a $138M final gross, 2-time Oscar nominee Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum returned to theaters this weekend with 22 Jump Street and hit a home run. The Sony release grossed an estimated $60M from 3,306 venues for a per screen average of $18,149. Critics have enjoyed this film as much as its predecessor (nearly identical Rotten Tomatoes scores of 85% for the original and 83% for the sequel) and audiences gave the film a solid A- Cinemascore. The $60M represents the highest R-rated opening in June beating 2012’s Ted and it’s the highest comedy opening in June taking down 1999’s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. While both Hill and Tatum have said in recent interviews there will be no third film, I have to imagine Sony will be pushing for an end to this lucrative trilogy.Settling for the runner-up spot was the DreamWorks animated sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2 which opened to an estimated $50M, with a per screen average of $11,756. The original film opened in March of 2010 to a relatively soft $43.7M but had great legs and ended its run at $217M. With four years of price increases, the sequel was predicted to open a little higher than it did and could have a hard time reaching the heights of the original, at least domestically. It is the highest opening for a DreamWorks animated film since 2012’s Madagascar 3 which opened to $60M on its way to a final take of $216.4M.Disney’s Maleficent fell 44% in its third go around to an estimated $19M, bringing its cume to $163M. It is the second highest live-action film for Angelina Jolie and should easily pass 2005’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith in the next couple of weeks. Fellow A-lister Tom Cruise landed in fourth place with his latest sci-fi adventure Edge of Tomorrow which fell 44% in its second weekend to an estimated $16.1M, bringing its total to just under $57M. Last year’s Oblivion fell 52% in its second weekend and was at $65M before ending its run at $89M. Edge of Tomorrow is on pace to equal that total.This weekend’s biggest drop comes courtesy of last weekend’s biggest film as Fox’s tearjerker The Fault In Our Stars tumbled 67% to $15M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $81.7M. With so much anticipation from the built-in fan base, the drop was a little bigger than expected but still not a huge surprise. X-Men: Days of Future Past became the first 2014 summer release (and third film of the year overall) to crack the $200M barrier, taking in an estimated $9.5M and bringing its total to $206M.Warner Brother’s monster hit Godzilla was in seventh place this weekend with an estimated $3M, bringing its total after five weeks to $191M. Universal’s western comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West continued to crumble falling 58% in its third weekend to an estimated $3M, bringing its total to a disappointing $39M. How quickly before Seth MacFarlane gets Ted 2 out? Oh wait, it’s already scheduled for next summer, where I’m sure he hopes people will have forgotten about his sheep farmer. Fellow Universal comedy stablemate Neighbors ended in ninth place with an estimated $2.5M bringing its total to a robust $143M after six weeks. And rounding out the top 10 was indie darling Chef which dropped 13% from last weekend to an estimated $2.3M, bringing its total to $14M.The top 10 grossed $181.4M which was down 6% from 2013 when Man of Steel destroyed the box office with $116.6M; and up a remarkable 50% from 2012 when Madagascar 3 held on to the top spot in its second weekend with $34M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Grant, Adventures, Pictures, Month, Mindy, Poppins, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hill-and-Tatum-Take-Down-Dragon"},{"id":"47509114371792","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Rowdy Neighbors Steals #1 From Spidey","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Rowdy Neighbors Steals #1 From Spideyby Gitesh Pandya | May 11, 2014 |  CommentsRaunchy comedy trumped super hero action as North American audiences flooded multiplexes to see the buzzworthy new film Neighbors which captured the number one spot with a thunderous opening shoving last week’s champ The Amazing Spider-Man 2 into second place in only in second weekend.Universal’s latest R-rated comedy winner debuted with strength grossing an estimated $51.1M over the weekend from 3,279 locations for a powerful $15,575 average. Starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, the well-reviewed laugher about young parents with a baby who battle a fraternity that moves in next door in their quiet neighborhood surged past lofty expectations to generate the second best opening weekend ever for an R-rated comedy not based on a popular brand. Only Universal’s Ted was bigger with a $54.4M debut in June 2012.Neighbors enjoyed broad appeal which helped to deliver the numbers. Men and women alike were excited and many age groups found the plot intriguing. Plus the two lead actors pull from different segments of the moviegoing audience leading to more business. Rogen’s comedy from last summer – This Is the End – was also outrageous and earned strong reviews, however its all-star cast pretty much pulled from the same fan base. Former teen heartthrob Efron brought a different crowd to the table. Also helping was the fact that studios have done a lousy job this year delivering broad comedies so ticket buyers were eager to go out and experience a laugh riot.It’s been three years since anything other than an action movie has hit number one in the summer kickoff month of May. That says a lot about how hard it is for a film like Neighbors to hit the top spot. The much-hyped sequel The Hangover Part II did it in late May 2011 with a phenomenal $85.9M debut which still holds the record today for debuts of all R-rated comedies. Studio research showed that the audience was 53% female and 53% over 25.The CinemaScore was a mediocre B so it will have to be seen what kind of legs it shows. The next major direct competitor will be Seth MacFarlane’s Ted followup A Million Ways to Die in the West opening three weeks later and there is the Memorial Day holiday weekend before that so the road ahead looks bright for Neighbors for the rest of May. Overseas debuts drove in a healthy $34.4M weekend – led by the U.K. and Australia – for a global tally of $85.5M very early on in the run.Bumped down to the runner-up position after just one week with the crown was the super hero tentpole sequel The Amazing Spider-Man 2 which fell a sharp 59% to an estimated $37.2M. That put Sony’s cume at $147.9M after ten days of release plus Thursday night previews which is 11% below the same point in the run of 2012’s Spidey reboot. The decline was in the same ballpark as Marvel’s other summer kickoff sequels like Iron Man 2 (59% in 2010), Iron Man 3 (58% last year) and Spider-Man 3 (62% in 2007).This is an event sequel featuring one of the most recognizable characters in existence with all the production and marketing dollars in the world at its disposal. It should be attracting a larger crowd than this, especially with a production cost alone of over $200M.The final take should end in the friendly $210-220M neighborhood making it the lowest-grossing Spider-Man film ever domestically despite having the highest ticket prices. It could end a full $50M shy of the $262M of its predecessor from two years ago and it certainly will not beat Captain Avenger: The Winter Soldier which was more successful at satisfying comic fans recently and will soon crack the quarter-billion mark.Sony has two more Peter Parker installments already on the calendar for 2016 and 2018 so it needs to find a way to reignite fan excitement for the franchise and deliver a product that pumps up audiences. But as with many action franchises, international markets are making up for shortfalls from North America. The overseas weekend haul of $69.5M boosted the offshore cume to $403M and the global gross to $551M. $750M is still possible.The Cameron Diaz hit The Other Woman held up well given the intense competition it faced from a new runaway hit comedy entering the marketplace. Fox’s former number one dipped 36% in its third weekend to an estimated $9.3M raising the sum to a solid $61.7M. Faith-based hit Heaven Is For Real kept bringing in the business in its fourth lap with an estimated $7M, down a slender 19%, putting Sony at $75.2M to date. Reaching $100M is now a possibility.April sequels followed. Disney’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier eased only 28% to an estimated $5.6M vaulting its domestic haul to an impressive $245M. With $450.6M from overseas markets, the Avenger raised its worldwide cume to a robust $695.6M. Toon Rio 2 fell 34% to an estimated $5.1M for $113.2M overall for Fox.Two smaller new releases debuted to modest results. The PG-rated comedy Moms’ Night Out bowed to an estimated $4.2M from only 1,044 locations for a lukewarm $4,023 average. Outreach to the faith-based crowd helped the Sony release to attract a respectable audience despite the moderate number of theaters, but the grosses were not at the same level as for this year’s many hit dramas which targeted Christian moviegoers. Reviews were poor.The animated film Legends of Oz brought in similar sales with an estimated $3.7M opening weekend but its average was much worse at a dull $1,421 thanks to an aggressive release in 2,607 sites. New distributor Clarius saw terrible reviews and the brand was not strong enough to bring out paying family audiences. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A, though.Divergent clung to the top ten for an eighth weekend with an estimated $1.7M, off a mere 22%, for a $145M total and over $254M collected worldwide. Relativity’s action film Brick Mansions dropped 60% to an estimated $1.5M for a $18.3M cume.Below the top ten, The Grand Budapest Hotel became Wes Anderson’s highest-grossing film ever as it grossed another $1.5M in its tenth frame, according to estimates. The Fox Searchlight hit has banked $53.7M to date and may end its domestic run near the $60M mark.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.3M which was down 16% from last year when Iron Man 3 stayed at number one with $72.5M; and down 21% from 2012 when The Avengers remained on top with $103.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"green, Amazon, The, VOD","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Rowdy-Neighbors-Steals-1-From-Spidey"},{"id":"47509114425045","title":"Box Office: Record Opening for Captain America","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Record Opening for Captain Americaby Gitesh Pandya | April 7, 2014 |  CommentsMarvel magic worked wonders again as the super hero sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier opened to record business while pulverizing the competition in the process. The Disney release debuted to a gigantic $96.2M, according to estimates, setting a new April opening weekend record beating the $86.2M of 2011’s Fast Five. Factor out three years of ticket price increases and 3D surcharges and the audience sizes were about the same.Still, Winter Soldier delivered summer-level grosses in early April proving that the right event films can attract monster business at any time of year. Playing in 3,938 locations, the new Steve Rogers film averaged a stellar $24,429 and was the biggest debut of 2014 by far. The three-day take was an encouraging 48% better than the $65.1M of its 2011 predecessor and 12% higher than the $85.7M of recent Marvel sequel Thor: The Dark World from November. Winter Soldier benefitted from fans liking the first Captain America film and loving The Avengers plus the new chapter had expanded roles from franchise regulars Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson adding to the starpower.Reviews were very strong and audiences agreed with critics giving it a solid A grade from CinemaScore. Soldier skewed heavily male (64%) and played older as 57% were over 25. 40% of the gross came from 3D formats which was a bit higher than the 38% for the last Cap pic. 346 IMAX screens delivered a whopping $9.6M, or 10% of the gross.Friday kicked off with $37M including $10.2M from Thursday night shows starting at 8pm. Saturday dipped 7% to $34.6M while Sunday is estimated to fall by 29% to $24.5M. The last Thor – which also started with 8pm Thursday night previews – played a bit differently with Saturday inching up 1% and Sunday dropping by 32%. Reaching $225M domestic is quite possible for the new Captain America.Overseas results were fantastic as well with Winter Soldier’s international cume already surpassing that of its predecessor after less than two weeks of play. The super soldier grossed a towering $107.1M from overseas markets this weekend led by a gargantuan debut in China of $39.2M. That was a new Marvel record in that lucrative territory beating Iron Man 3 and The Avengers. Chris Evans and company traveled to Beijing for a glitzy fan event and press conference to hype up their product there.The new Captain America has now amassed $207.1M internationally and sits at a hefty $303.3M worldwide with plenty of cash still to come as key markets Japan and Brazil have yet to open. Look for global grosses to eventually surpass $700M on this tentpole which cost roughly $175M to produce.Last week’s leader Noah fell sharply in its second weekend grossing an estimated $17M, down a hefty 61%. Mixed word-of-mouth and competition from a new action tentpole both contributed to the large decline. Paramount’s Russell Crowe starrer has now collected $72.3M from North America on its way to a possible $110M domestic final. Overseas love has been stronger as Noah banked an estimated $45.6M this weekend from 45 markets lifting the overseas tally to $106.2M and the global gross to $178.5M. Brazil led the new openers with a huge $8.5M (fourth best debut in history) while Russia leads the holdovers with $26.6M to date.Down 49% in its third round was the sci-fi flick Divergent with an estimated $13M boosting Lionsgate’s cume to $114M. Faith-based hit God’s Not Dead expanded again in its third weekend and grossed an estimated $7.7M, off just 12%, for a $32.5M sum for Freestyle.The Wes Anderson winner The Grand Budapest Hotel continued its red hot roll-out expanding another round and capturing an estimated $6.3M. Off 26%, the Fox Searchlight release has grossed $33.4M and is on its way to topping $55M.Two kidpics followed with good holds countering the arrival of the gun-heavy super hero tentpole which parents of younger children would avoid. Disney’s Muppets Most Wanted dipped 44% to an estimated $6.3M while the DreamWorks toon Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman fell 42% to an estimated $5.3M while joining the century club. Cumes to date are $42.1M and $102.2M, respectively.A trio of action titles rounded out the top ten with just under $2M a piece. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s insta-flop Sabotage tumbled 64% from its weak debut to an estimated $1.9M and poor $8.8M total for Open Road. Need for Speed fell 57% to an estimated $1.8M and has banked a disappointing $40.8M to date. Liam Neeson’s hit Non-Stop spent its sixth round in the top ten with an estimated $1.8M as well, off 55%. Universal’s cume is a solid $88.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $157.4M which was up 26% from last year when Evil Dead opened at number one with $25.8M; and up 36% from 2012 when The Hunger Games remained on top for a third weekend with $33.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Video, Women's, jurassic, song, Oscars, Polls, Mudbound","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Record-Opening-for-Captain-America"},{"id":"47509112779469","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Maleficent Has a Magical Opening Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Maleficent Has a Magical Opening WeekendX-Men: Days of Future Past andA Million Ways to Die in the West round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | June 1, 2014 |  CommentsAngelina Jolie dominated the box office with the fairy tale-inspired epic Maleficent which generated the largest opening of her career with an estimated $70M from 3,948 theaters for a sensational $17,730 average. Disney’s PG-rated tale of the villain from Sleeping Beauty used its starpower to attract a wide audience and came close to the $79.1M debut of the studio’s Oz: The Great and Powerful from last year. This also marked the first time in nine years that Jolie hit the number one spot with a live-action film. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith with future life partner Brad Pitt was her last one from this month in 2005.Reviews were mixed but audiences came out for the big-screen spectacle and for Jolie and were very satisfied by what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a solid A. Studio research showed that the audience was 60% female. Appeal was broad across all age groups as 51% were over 25. 35% of the business came from 3D formats and IMAX screens accounted for $6.7M, strong for a family film.The global marketing push resulted in audience excitement around the world leading to a mammoth $100.6M debut from international markets for a $170.6M worldwide start with the whole summer still ahead. Plus China and Japan have yet to open.Falling from first place was the super hero epic X-Men: Days of Future Past which fell a sharp 64% in its second round to an estimated $32.6M giving Fox $162.1M to date. That was slightly better than the 67% tumble that the franchise’s The Last Stand suffered coming off of the same Memorial Day holiday weekend in 2006 for a total of $175.3M at the same point in the run. A domestic future final of about $210M seem likely.Seth MacFarlane’s new raunchy comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West struggled in its opening weekend and landed in third with an estimated $17.1M from 3,158 locations for a mild $5,405 average. That was down a troubling 69% from the $54.4M debut of the Family Guy creator’s last hit Ted from June 2012. That film featured MacFarlane in only a voice role, similar to what fans are used to, and packed more starpower with Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis. West, instead, was the funnyman’s first attempt at anchoring a film with a live-action role plus co-star Charlize Theron has a weaker box office track record.Studio research showed that 55% of the audience was male and 72% was over 25. A lackluster B CinemaScore indicates that customers were only somewhat satisfied with what they got so reaching a broader audience will be difficult. West played mainly to the core Family Guy crowd this weekend.The Warner Bros. tentpole Godzilla followed with an estimated $12.2M thanks to another steep fall of 61% in the third frame. The cume to date is $174.7M. Dropping a reasonable 41% in its second weekend was the Adam Sandler-Drew Barrymore flop Blended with an estimated $8.4M. With just $29.6M so far, look for a weak $50M final. The raunchy comedy Neighbors declined by 45% to an estimated $7.7M and has banked an impressive $128.6M to date.In its fifth weekend, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 collected an estimated $3.8M, off 52%, giving Sony $192.7M domestically. The international cume climbed to $497.3M putting the webslinger reboot sequel at $690M worldwide. Down 47% was the baseball drama Million Dollar Arm with an estimated $3.7M and $28.1M overall for Disney. Jon Favreau’s indie title Chef expanded again and grossed an estimated $2M putting Open Road at $6.9M. Fox’s The Other Woman tumbled 62% to an estimated $1.4M for a total cume of $81.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $158.9M which was even with last year when Fast &amp; Furious 6 stayed at number one with $35.2M; but up 20% from 2012 when Snow White and the Huntsman debuted on top with $56.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Awards, Comedy, caribbean, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Maleficent-Has-a-Magical-Opening-Weekend"},{"id":"47509114349262","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mutant Fans Push X-Men to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mutant Fans Push X-Men to #1by Gitesh Pandya | May 25, 2014 |  CommentsWolverine and his mutant friends conquered the Memorial Day holiday weekend box office with the number one debut of X-Men: Days of Future Past which opened to an estimated $90.7M, the second best showing ever for the seven-film franchise. The Fox release averaged a muscular $22,698 from 3,996 locations and was helped by 3D and large format ticket prices.Future is expected to reach roughly $110M for the four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday period which would make it the fifth best launch ever over this lucrative frame. 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand debuted over the same session but was stronger with a $122.9M four-day debut, and was 2D only. But conditions were different. That film followed on the heels of two very well-liked X-Men movies and was seen as the end of a trilogy.On the other hand, Future follows a series of films in the franchise which had mixed results creatively so some fans have lost interest in recent years. Plus Last Stand faced virtually no action competition on its opening weekend whereas the new mutant movie had last week’s monster hit Godzilla to deal with. The new film uses a time travel plot to bring together characters from the original trilogy with those from the origin story First Class which was well-received in 2011.But the road ahead looks promising for the new X-Men, as far as front-loaded tentpoles go. Reviews for the Bryan Singer-directed film were terrific and fans polled by CinemaScore gave the combo pack of old and new mutant casts a glowing A grade which is also what Captain America: The Winter Soldier earned in April. Plus next weekend sees no new action movies of the same type opening.Days of Future Past kicked off its release on Friday with $36M (including $8.1M from Thursday night shows starting at 10pm). Saturday fell 18% to $29.6M and Sunday is projected to drop 15% to $25.1M. It is the fourth big-budget tentpole in eight weeks to open north of $90M, and third based on Marvel super heroes.The new X-Men opened day and date in most of the world this weekend and delivered a sensational $171.1M weekend for a worldwide opening of $261.8M. Japan and Spain are the only major markets that did not launch this weekend. Days of Future Past is on a trajectory to become the highest-grossing film in the fourteen-year-old X-Men franchise and the next installment Apocalypse is already on the calendar for this same weekend in May 2016.With another effects-heavy action tentpole entering theaters, last week’s champ Godzilla crashed in its sophomore frame falling 66% to an estimated $31.4M despite Sunday business being better than normal given the Monday holiday. That was in the same range as the 68% fall that 1998’s Godzilla suffered in its second weekend when it was coming off of its Memorial Day weekend opening. With its built-in audience of fans, the radioactive lizard was always expected to take a big fall in its second round.Warner Bros. has banked an impressive $148.8M for Godzilla in the first 10.5 days which is just slightly better than the $146.2M of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 from a few weeks ago. A domestic final of around $200M seems likely.Overseas, steep declines were also witnessed on the second weekend. Godzilla fell by roughly two-thirds to an estimated $34.5M for an international sum of $166.6M bringing the global haul to $315.4M and counting. With China and Japan still to open, a final worldwide gross of over $500M is still possible.Adam Sandler’s fading career suffered another flop as his latest entry Blended failed to get anywhere near his usual levels and stumbled into third place with an estimated $14.2M. That was the lowest opening weekend for Sandler in a PG-13 broad comedy (his specialty) in 18 years. 1996’s Happy Gilmore bowed to $8.5M which at the time was considered solid for a film like that. Opening wide in 3,555 theaters through Warner Bros., Blended averaged a lackluster $4,007 per location. The reteaming of Sandler with Drew Barrymore came nowhere near the first weekends of their previous partnerships. 1998’s The Wedding Singer bowed to $18.9M while 2004’s 50 First Dates launched twice as big with $39.9M. Sandler has headlined 13 comedies that have opened north of $30M and had been one of the most reliable box office stars around.As usual, film critics hated the comedian’s latest effort. His movies, instead, sell based on concept and Blended did not excite audiences with its single parents on an African safari plot. A poor title didn’t help either. Also, moviegoers looking for a big-screen spectacle had plenty of big-budget tentpoles to choose from and those wanting a laugh had Neighbors which grossed almost the same amount of money even though it was in its third weekend. Studio research showed that the audience breakdown was 56% female and 71% over 25. Sandler’s audience has aged with him and today’s teens have almost no connection to him.Joining the century club, the raunchy comedy Neighbors enjoyed a moderate hold in its third lap dropping 45% to an estimated $13.9M. Universal has captured a stellar $113.6M so far from North America and a sensational $181M worldwide with 22 more international markets to open. The global box office for the frat house flick is already more than ten times its budget of $18M.In its fourth weekend, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 once again saw more than half of its business vanish. The sequel to the webslinger reboot (and fifth installment in the overall franchise) declined by 54% to an estimated $7.8M boosting the domestic cume to $184.9M. A final of about $200M in North America seems likely. But overseas keeps on shining. The new international tally of $489M sent the global cume to $673.9M with 73% coming from offshore markets. The new Amazing has now surpassed the worldwide final of last summer’s Man of Steel and is on course to finish up matching Captain America: The Winter Soldier near the $720M neighborhood. China is by far the most successful overseas market on both films.The baseball film Million Dollar Arm dropped an encouraging 33% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.1M putting the total to date at a respectable $20.6M. The $25M-budgeted film may end its domestic run with around $40M. Fox followed with an estimated $3.7M for the comedy The Other Woman and an estimated $2.5M for the animated film Rio 2. The Cameron Diaz hit dropped 42% and has collected $77.8M to date. Off 33%, the bird toon has banked $121.6M so far.Low-budget films from outside the studio system rounded out the top ten. The indie comedy Chef from director Jon Favreau expanded from 72 to 498 locations in its third weekend and grossed an estimated $2.3M for a decent $4,538 average. Open Road’s cume is now $3.5M. Sony’s faith-based hit Heaven Is For Real fell 56% to an estimated $2M in its sixth weekend for a new total of $85.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $175.5M which was down 29% from last year when Fast &amp; Furious 6 opened at number one with $97.4M; but up 22% from 2012 when Men in Black III debuted on top with $54.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, crossover, biography, harry","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mutant-Fans-Push-XMen-to-1"},{"id":"47509116190432","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ride Along Cruises To Number One","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ride Along Cruises To Number OneLone Survivor and The Nut Job round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | January 19, 2014 |  CommentsKevin Hart and Ice Cube delivered the laughs with their new comedy Ride Along and if estimates hold, it will break the record for the biggest Martin Luther King holiday opening ever. The Universal hit grossed an estimated $41.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long frame and the studio is projecting about $47.8M over the four-day period. That would break the old records of $40.1M and $46.1M set in 2008 by Cloverfield. In fact, it would also break the record for the biggest debut in all of January which the low-budget sci-fi pic also has held.Cube has enjoyed numerous box office hits over the past two decades, but Ride Along‘s success can be attributed more to Hart who gets second billing here. The fast-rising funnyman boasts an enormous fan base (almost 10 million followers on Twitter) and his stand-up comedy concert films have done gangbusters over the past couple of years. His supporting turn in Think Like A Man certainly helped that film open to a stellar $33.6M but with Ride Along, he has his first real lead role in a major studio release. Also helping to sell it were an intriguing concept (guy must impress his fiancée’s cop brother) and a powerful marketing push. Hart even announced surprise pop-ins at various theaters.Studio research showed that the audience was 57% female, 54% 25 and older, and 80% black or Latino. Over three days, the average was a fantastic $15,471. Reviews were mostly negative, but Ride Along did not enter the marketplace as a fine work of art. It was sold as a funny two-hour good time at the movies and paying moviegoers got exactly what they expected as evidenced by the solid A CinemaScore grade.Over the last two decades, numerous films led by black casts have generated muscular openings and a large number have shattered industry expectations. But only a few have opened to $30M+ and rarely have they gotten to $40M+, especially when they are not sequels. It opened better than all but one of Will Ferrell’s hit comedies. Hart hopes to strike again next month with his next comedy About Last Night which opens on Valentine’s Day.Universal controlled the number two spot too with last week’s champ Lone Survivor which dropped a reasonable 39% to an estimated $23.2M for a healthy cume to date of $74M. The last studio to take the top two spots on the box office chart on the same weekend was, interestingly enough, Universal last June when it opened The Purge on top bumping Fast &amp; Furious 6 into second place.Opening well in third was the new animated comedy The Nut Job with an estimated $20.6M from 3,427 locations for a good $5,996 average. Kids looking to move on from the monster hit Frozen have had almost nothing for them since Thanksgiving. They responded here and Open Road now has a toon hit on its hands with two more weeks of no new competition until the February 7 debut of The Lego Movie.Paramount suffered a troubling start for the latest reboot of its spy franchise with Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit opening in fourth with an estimated $17.2M marking by far the worst performance in the Tom Clancy series which includes fives films across nearly a quarter-century. Averaging a mediocre $5,078 from 3,387 locations, the PG-13 film debuting Chris Pine as the fourth actor to play the title character just did not create much excitement with moviegoing audiences. The last film in the franchise was 2002’s The Sum of All Fears with Ben Affleck which bowed to a strong $31.2M that summer.Looking only at the opening weekend gross, Shadow Recruit tied the $17.2M of the first Jack Ryan film The Hunt for Red October from March 1990 for the lowest in franchise history. However, that film with Alec Baldwin and Sean Connery debuted in only 1,225 theaters and ticket prices were half of what they are today. The new pic even offered 300 runs on higher-priced IMAX screens. Reviews for the new $60M-budgeted Ryan were mixed and the CinemaScore grade was a lackluster B. Despite the casting of Pine, teens and young adults took no interest and the film did best with older males who have many other big films competing for their attention, especially Wahlberg’s Lone Survivor which has been overperforming. Studio research showed the audience was 52% male and a whopping 85% over 25.Disney’s runaway smash Frozen cracked the all-time Top 30 list this weekend after its estimated $12M take in its eighth round of wide release. That boosted the total to $332.6M putting it right at number 30 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list right behind Alice in Wonderland‘s $334.2M from 2010. A $24.6M gross overseas this weekend lifted the international gross to $426.5M and the global tally to a stellar $759.1M on its way to breaking $800M next weekend.With its incredible starpower and awards buzz, American Hustle led all the newly minted Best Picture Oscar nominees with an estimated $10.6M for a hearty 28% jump despite losing 425 theaters. Over the past seven days, the Sony release won the Golden Globe for Best Picture – Musical or Comedy, the Best Acting Ensemble prize at the Critics Choice Awards, and the top SAG honor for best cast. Add in the great reviews and ample star wattage and Hustle has the most mainstream commercial appeal among the top Academy Award nominees at this moment. Cume to date is $116.4M and $150M+ is possible.Not scaring up too much cash was the new horror entry Devil’s Due with an estimated $8.5M from 2,544 locations for a mild $3,341 average. The Fox release earned poor reviews and received a big thumbs down from the paying public with its D+ grade from CinemaScore.It didn’t earn a Best Picture nod from the Academy, but August: Osage County‘s two big acting nominations for superstars Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts helped it stay in the top ten, as did a doubling of screens. The Weinstein Co. pic took in an estimated $7.6M, up 6%, for a total of $18.2M so far. Best Picture nominee The Wolf of Wall Street slipped 15% to an estimated $7.5M giving Paramount $90.3M. Disney’s Saving Mr. Banks missed out on a top nomination and suffered a larger fall dropping 37% to an estimated $4.1M and $75.4M overall.Below the top ten, Oscar nominees for Best Picture all tried to turn those nods into extra box office gold with some expanding and seeing higher grosses and others staying in roughly the same theaters but posting great holds. Among those not expanding, Her declined by 24% to an estimated $4.1M, Philomena dipped 6% to an estimated $1.3M, and Nebraska inched up 6% to an estimated $940,000. Modest cumes are $15M, $24.1M, and $9.7M.Three contenders that opened in October and mostly concluded their runs returned to national release this weekend with their studios mounting re-expansions. Gravity rose to 944 locations and grossed an estimated $1.9M, 12 Years A Slave was in 761 sites and made an estimated $1.5M, and Captain Phillips took in an estimated $550,000 from 903 playdates. Totals are $258.4M, $40.6M, and $105.7M. While much attention is put on extra box office a film collects after earning key Oscar nods, it needs to be noted that these films must spend additional funds in order to play this game during awards season and stay in national release. Additional weeks of national advertising is not cheap.The top ten films grossed an estimated $152.5M which was up a healthy 42% from last year when Mama opened at number one with $28.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of MLK weekend; and up 44% from 2012’s holiday when Contraband debuted in the top spot with $24.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Lucasfilm, tv, italian, MTV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ride-Along-Cruises-To-Number-One"},{"id":"47509116196579","title":"Box Office: The Hobbit, Frozen stay classy over Christmas frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: The Hobbit, Frozen stay classy over Christmas frameRobust Wolf of Wall Street heads newcomers, while Mitty, Grudge Match and Ronin struggle.by Gitesh Pandya | December 29, 2013 |  CommentsOn the final frame of 2013, studios shoved six new wide releases into the marketplace but holiday moviegoers chose holdovers instead as The Hobbit stayed at number one while the month-old animated smash Frozen enjoyed a Christmas surge finishing close behind in second. Of the new faces, only one – The Wolf of Wall Street – posted impressive results with the rest attracting sales that ranged from mediocre to disastrous.Topping the charts for the third straight weekend, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug won a slim victory with an estimated $29.9M over the Friday-to-Sunday period boosting the cume to a healthy $190.3M. Off just 5% from last weekend, the Middle Earth saga grossed a hearty $49.7M over the five-day period from Christmas Day Wednesday to Sunday. Smaug continues to run 15% behind the pace of last year’s film An Unexpected Journey at the same point in the release. IMAX screens have accounted for $26M of the cume on the new Bilbo flick (about $50M worldwide) and this weekend’s share rose to 17% of the gross as fans continue to pay extra for the premium experience. A massive $98.3M overseas this weekend pushed the international tally to $423.8M and the global haul to $614.1M.The Disney animated blockbuster Frozen enjoyed a huge 47% jump from last weekend and grossed an estimated $28.8M in its fifth round of nationwide play. With positive buzz and no major competition for kids, the PG-rated smash has now amassed a stellar $248.4M making it the studio’s second biggest non-Pixar toon of all-time trailing just 1994’s The Lion King. Breaking $300M domestic seems likely. Frozen was red hot overseas too with new openings helping the international weekend gross reach $50.5M for a $79.3M global weekend. New cumes are now $243.5M overseas and $491.9M worldwide with Brazil, Japan, and China still to open.Dropping 25% from its opening weekend was the holiday season’s top broad comedy Anchorman 2 with an estimated $20.2M pushing the cume to $83.7M for Paramount putting it a day away from surpassing the $84.1M total of its 2004 predecessor. Close behind was the all-star awards contender American Hustle with an estimated $19.6M, up 2% from its wide debut last week. Sony has banked $60M to date.Fifth place went to the excesses of the finance world as Martin Scorsese’s raunchy new film The Wolf of Wall Street delivered the best opening among the half-dozen new releases with an estimated $18.5M over three days and $34.3M across the five days since its Christmas Day launch on Wednesday. The three-day average was $7,296 from 2,537 locations – solid for an R-rated film running three hours long.Earning strong but not sensational reviews, the director’s fifth outing with Leonardo DiCaprio skewed incredibly old playing more like a Marty film than a Leo one. A whopping 90% of the crowd was over 25 and 54% were male. Paying audiences did not like what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a troubling C which was among the lowest of any film this holiday season. With a budget of about $100M, Wolf will try to have the kind of legs that older-skewing movies do and if it secures a Best Picture Oscar nomination a few weeks from now, that could help it stay afloat too.The feel-good Tom Hanks-Emma Thompson pic Saving Mr. Banks surged 50% despite no increase in screens and grossed an estimated $14M. Averaging a solid $6,645, the Disney release has collected $37.8M thus far.Fox’s PG-rated film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty bowed to an estimated $13M from 2,909 locations for a mediocre $4,469 average. Total for the Ben Stiller project since its yuletide launch is $25.6M. Reviews were mixed and the CinemaScore was a B+. Demos were 52% female and 64% over 25.Jumping 16% was the Katniss tentpole The Hunger Games: Catching Fire with an estimated $10.2M in its sixth weekend and $391.1M overall making it 2013’s second biggest blockbuster after Iron Man 3 ($409M) which it may surpass before its run is through. The Lionsgate release has climbed up to number 18 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Keanu Reeves delivered a bomb with his pricey period adventure 47 Ronin which started with a solid opening day on Wednesday but then quickly lost its audience. The weekend saw an estimated $9.9M while the five-day period brought in just $20.6M. With a budget estimated to be in the range of $150-175M, the Universal release never generated interest outside of a core subset of the male action crowd. Reviews were terrible but the CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. There was a heavy male skew (62%) while 53% were over 30. Overseas results are not much better with $22.3M total to date from 29 markets including Japan where it is now in its fourth frame.Rounding out the top ten was A Madea Christmas with an estimated $7.4M, down just 12%, for a $43.7M total for Lionsgate. It should surpass $50M like so many previous Tyler Perry movies including all the Madea titles.Also rejected by critics and paying audiences alike was the Sylvester Stallone-Robert DeNiro boxing comedy Grudge Match which opened just outside the top ten to an estimated $7.3M over the weekend from 2,838 locations for a wimpy $2,576 average. The PG-13 pic earned a B+ from audiences and had only $13.4M in box office over five days. Older men, as expected, made up the core crowd as 55% were male and 68% were over 25. Reviews were dreadful and with so many better options, ticketbuyers took a pass on this fight.Two more films debuted nationwide but failed to crack the top ten posting weak grosses. The Idris Elba pic Mandela followed a prolonged one month run in platform release with an expansion into 975 theaters but grossed an estimated $2.4M for a lousy $2,484 average. Cume for The Weinstein Co. is $4.7M with a rocky road ahead.The supposedly-retired pop singer Justin Bieber failed to make his fans come out to theaters with his new music doc Believe which debuted to an estimated $2M from 1,037 locations for a flimsy $1,942 average. The five-day tally since its Christmas launch was a measly $4.3M which is a fraction of the $30.3M that his 2011 film Never Say Never opened to. Believe had only one-third of the screens and was released by Open Road which does not have the marketing muscle of Paramount and its MTV sibling. But still, the new film did not generate any impressive turnout with its opening weekend down an alarming 93% from Bieber’s last film.The top ten films grossed an estimated $171.4M which was up 8% from last year when The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey stayed at number one with $32.9M; and up 27% from 2011 when Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was in the top spot with $29.4M.Compared to three-day projections, The Wolf of Wall Street came in a little below my $22M forecast while The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was on target with my $13M prediction. 47 Ronin was close to my $9M projection and Grudge Match came in below my $13M forecast. Believe debuted well under my $6M prediction.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-The-Hobbit-Frozen-stay-classy-over-Christmas-frame"},{"id":"47509114474204","title":"Box Office: LEGO &amp; Kevin Hart Lead Solid Holiday","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: LEGO &amp; Kevin Hart Lead Solid Holidayby RT Staff | February 16, 2014 |  CommentsFour new releases and a rock solid holdover cartoon brought out large crowds to North American theaters over the Presidents Day frame which should end up with the best performance for the holiday session in four years. Leading the chart for the second weekend in a row was the animated hit The LEGO Movie with an estimated $48.8M over the Friday-to-Sunday span dropping a low 29% from its record opening.After just ten days, the PG-rated hit has grossed a sensational $129.1M making it the top-grossing film of 2014. Warner Bros. looks on course to finish its domestic run in the neighborhood of $250M which would be a remarkable accomplishment for a toon outside of the key play periods of summer and holiday.Word-of-mouth was strong, reviews have been awesome, and no new movies opened for families so LEGO easily dominated the marketplace for a second time. After the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, the 11-day sum could soar to about $140M. Mid-week business is expected to be solid too as many schools nationwide will be closed for winter break.Red hot comic Kevin Hart delivered his second hit comedy in as many months with the date flick About Last Night which debuted to muscular numbers with an estimated $27M from 2,253 locations for a fantastic $11,984 average. The Sony release was the only R-rated pic among the weekend’s four new titles and also grossed the most money. Reviews for the remake of the 1986 Rob Lowe-Demi Moore film were quite strong.Mature women drove the success as studio research showed that the audience was 63% female and 57% over 30. With the opening day also being Valentine’s Day, Friday registered a massive $13M in ticket sales which slightly edged out LEGO that day. Hart’s brand of humor has been extremely popular and his lead roles in About Last Night and last month’s Ride Along will lead to over $200M in combined domestic grosses. 2014 is a breakout box office year for him, much like 1994 was for Jim Carrey.Another 80s remake from Sony, the futuristic action thriller RoboCop, stumbled into third place with less firepower than the studio was hoping for. The PG-13 pic debuted to an estimated $21.5M from 3,372 locations including IMAX venues averaging $6,376 per site. With its soft mid-week launch on Wednesday, the five-day cume was only $26.4M. Including the Presidents Day holiday on Monday, the six-day debut period should end up at about $30M. The studio was publicly expecting it to reach the $35-40M range.The performance was below the levels of other 1980s action properties recently recycled for today’s audiences. Exactly one year ago, the sequel A Good Day to Die Hard bowed to $36.9M over five days during the same holiday weekend and 2012’s Total Recall debuted to $25.6M over a regular summer frame.Young male action fans used to be the bread and butter of Hollywood. But today, they are much harder to attract to multiplexes except with huge sequels or superhero films. In fact, very few male-skewing action movies have overperformed at the domestic box office over the past year with an alarmingly high number flopping. The upside is that these films, like RoboCop, often perform well overseas and later on video platforms.Budgeted at about $100M, RoboCop earned lackluster reviews from critics and played to an older male crowd. Studio research showed that 62% of the crowd was male and 64% was over 25. Overseas, the metal man took in $35M from 76 markets this weekend boosting the international total to $69.9M with the worldwide box office breaking $100M on Monday.Sony also owned fourth place with The Monuments Men which dropped a reasonable 32% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $15M. The George Clooney period drama has banked $43.7M to date and could be headed for the vicinity of $80M.Teen girls and young women powered the new romance Endless Love putting it into fifth place with an estimated $13.4M. The Universal release averaged a decent $4,627 from 2,896 sites and was driven by Valentine’s Day business on Friday which accounted for a whopping 55% of the weekend gross. The PG-13 film played to one quadrant as studio data showed the audience to be 80% female and 76% under 25. The CinemaScore was a good A-.Kevin Hart made his second appearance in the top ten with his other smash hit Ride Along. The comedy displayed tremendous strength in its fifth weekend easing a scant 8% to an estimated $8.8M boosting the total to date to a stellar $116.1M. Many Hart fans sold out of About Last Night had the option of checking out this one. Universal could be on its way to $140M or more making Ride Along a bigger hit than Will Ferrell’s recent heavily hyped comedy sequel Anchorman 2.Striking out with audiences over Valentine’s Day weekend was the critically-panned romance Winter’s Tale starring Colin Farrell, Russell Crowe, and Jennifer Connelly which settled for a seventh place opening. The Warner Bros. pic grossed an estimated $7.8M from 2,965 theaters for a weak $2,626 average. Reviews were terrible and the B CinemaScore indicated that ticket buyers were only modestly satisfied.Frozen, the highest-grossing original toon of all-time, dipped 15% to an estimated $5.9M and ended an amazing streak of 11 consecutive weekends in the top five. The Disney smash upped its total to $376M putting it at number 23 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list right behind the $377M of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The worldwide tally soared to $955.7M and is less than two weeks away from breaking the coveted billion dollar barrier.Universal’s Lone Survivor followed with an estimated $4.1M, down 26%, for a new total of $118.4M. Rounding out the top ten was the comedy That Awkward Moment which fell 36% to an estimated $3.3M for a sum to date of $21.4M for Focus.The top ten films grossed an estimated $155.6M which was up 28% from last year when A Good Day to Die Hard opened at number one with $24.8M over three days; and up 13% from 2012 when Safe House took the top spot in its second round with $23.6M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Hulu, Calendar, Poppins","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-LEGO-and-Kevin-Hart-Lead-Solid-Holiday"},{"id":"47509116194530","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Frozen is Back On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Frozen is Back On TopParanormal Activity: The Marked Ones and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | January 5, 2014 |  CommentsAs many parts of the country were freezing over, the box office was busy being conquered by Frozen as the Disney megahit reclaimed the number one spot in its sixth frame of wide play and came within striking distance of the triple century mark. Only one new film opened with Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones scaring up a respectable second place showing. With little incoming competition, holiday holdovers for the most part held up well although grosses did get affected for all films by the winter storms especially in the northeast and midwest. But despite weather issues, overall spending was actually even with the first weekend of January from both last year and 2012.Moviegoers kept flocking to multiplexes to see the singing sisters of Arendelle as Frozen slipped only 28% to an estimated $20.7M which was good enough for first place. It was its fifth weekend with sales above $20M. The animated smash has grossed an eye-popping $297.8M to date and may smash through the $300M barrier on Tuesday with much more cash to come.With competing studios doing an awful job of programming other compelling animated offerings this winter, the road ahead is still mostly wide open for Frozen to take advantage of. January 17 sees the debut of the month’s only new toon The Nut Job which may not be a huge rival making all of January a great play period for Disney to see its cume rise. Word of mouth and repeat business have been solid. Reaching the $360M domestic mark seems likely and surpassing the $367.9M of Despicable Me 2 is still possible which would make Frozen the toon champ from 2013. The fact that it is not a sequel speaks even more to the incredible performance.Overseas movie fans have been going gaga too for Anna and Elsa with the global tally crushing the $600M mark this weekend. The frame saw an estimated $52.5M from international markets boosting that cume to $342.1M and the worldwide haul to a sensational $639.9M. Look for the $700M barrier to come crashing down next weekend with Frozen on a trajectory to reach $900M and beyond with openings in Japan and China still to come.Opening in second place was the horror franchise flick Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones with an estimated $18.2M from 2,867 locations for a decent $6,348 average. It was a sharp drop from the opening of the last film in the franchise – 2012’s Paranormal Activity 4 – which bowed to $29M. However, the new chapter presented a new cast and was released in January instead of the fright-friendly month of October.Compared to other R-rated horror films opening in early January, Marked Ones debuted on the low end of the usual range. High teens and low 20s are common for this time of year for this type of film. This new saga took a bold turn by presenting a mostly Latino American cast with its Southern California setting. Given the expected erosion that a scary movie franchise would see in its fifth film, the non-Halloween release date, and some sales being lost to the winter storms, the opening weekend of Marked Ones was commendable.The CinemaScore grade was a C- which is lousy even by horror movie standards. Paranormal Activity 4 scored a C and the prior pic earned a C+. The gender split was even and 68% were under 25. With a low $5M production cost, and a marketing spend that was probably more than that, Marked Ones should still end up being another profitable chapter in the series. Its overseas opening this weekend brought in $16.2M from 13 markets for a $34.4M worldwide launch with Russia, Brazil, and many other Latin American territories to open next week. Paramount may need to juice up excitement to keep the franchise relevant this October when Paranormal Activity 5 is unleashed.Following its three-week reign atop the box office charts, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug fell to the bronze medal position with an estimated $16.3M. Its 44% decline represented the worst drop in the top ten while the domestic total rose to $229.6M. Released by Warner Bros., Smaug did rank number one on the international chart with an estimated $58M this weekend from 62 overseas markets. That drove the cume to $527M and the worldwide haul to $756.6M with Japan and China still to open in late February. Compared to last winter’s An Unexpected Journey, the new Hobbit saga is running 13% behind domestically and 8% behind globally. Getting to $1 billion is still a possibility, though.A pair of star-driven Oscar hopefuls followed with nearly identical grosses. Based on estimates, Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street inched ahead with an estimated $13.4M, off only 27% from its first weekend. Paramount’s 12-day total is $63.3M and the legendary filmmaker is well on his way to scoring another Leo-driven $100M hit. Sony’s American Hustle grossed an estimated $13.2M, off 30%, for a total of $88.7M on its way to the century club as well.Will Ferrell scored the seventh $100M hit of his career with Anchorman 2 which dropped 44% to an estimated $11.1M lifting the cume to $109.2M for Paramount. Disney followed with Saving Mr. Banks which slipped 33% to an estimated $9.1M while Fox’s The Secret Life of Walter Mitty followed with an estimated $8.2M, off 36%. Cumes stand at $59.3M and $45.7M, respectively.In its seventh weekend, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire still ranked in the top ten pulling in an estimated $7.4M, off 27%, propelling the domestic cume to a staggering $407.5M. The Katniss series is now the first movie franchise in history to score $400M+ grosses on each of its first two installments. On Monday, Catching Fire should surpass the $408M of the first Hunger Games and by mid-week it will exceed the $409M of Iron Man 3 to become 2013’s highest-grossing North American film. Fire currently sits at number 15 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and its worldwide tally has risen to $830.9M.Rounding out the top ten was a movie that did not make the list last weekend when it opened — Grudge Match. The Stallone-De Niro comedy eased only 23% to an estimated $5.4M and put its 12-day gross at a lackluster $24.9M for Warner Bros.Three less popular films opening on Christmas Day saw big tumbles on their second weekends. Universal’s big-budget bomb 47 Ronin fell 50% to an estimated $5M for a weak $32.6M to date for Keanu Reeves. Mandela dropped 51% to an estimated $1.1M giving The Weinstein Co. only $7.1M to date. Justin Bieber fans lost faith in Believe which grossed an estimated $573,000, down a disastrous 72%, for a puny $6M total to date for Open Road.Awards hopefuls kept chugging along as they awaited the Oscar nominations on January 16 which could give some a major commercial boost with broader audiences. Inside Llewyn Davis took in an estimated $1.2M, off only 6%, for a $7,532 average and $7M cume for CBS Films. Warner Bros. held in 47 sites for Joaquin Phoenix’s Her with an estimated $1.1M, up 11%. The average was a solid $15,362 with the sum at $3M. It expands nationwide next weekend.Paramount’s Nebraska slipped 9% to an estimated $670,000 with a mild $2,792 average and $7.1M total. The older-skewing story is just what Academy members often like so a Best Picture nomination could result. The Meryl Streep-Julia Roberts pic August: Osage County showed some weakness dropping 21% to an estimated $141,000 from five theaters in its second weekend. The average from platform release was a sturdy $28,177, cume is at $483,000 for Weinstein.The top ten films grossed an estimated $122.9M which was up 6% from last year when Texas Chainsaw 3D opened at number one with $21.7M; and up 2% from 2012 when The Devil Inside debuted in the top spot with $33.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Musical, watch, south, song","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Frozen-is-Back-On-Top"},{"id":"47509114445528","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Takes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman Takes the Top Spot300: Rise of an Empire and Need For Speed round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 16, 2014 |  CommentsThe top ten was littered with new faces as smaller films performed better than larger ones. The street racing actioner Need For Speed and Tyler Perry’s comedy The Single Moms Club both underperformed while indie pics The Grand Budapest Hotel and Veronica Mars jumped onto the list with the best averages. Overall, the domestic marketplace performed at normal levels for mid-March but it was a cartoon holdover that seized control of the number one spot.DreamWorks Animation captured the box office crown with its latest film Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman which declined by only 34% to an estimated $21.2M in its second weekend to lead all films. The Fox release has collected $63.2M in ten days and could find its way to $135M or more in North America which would improve upon recent DreamWorks titles Turbo and Rise of the Guardians.Peabody enjoyed a better second weekend hold than most previous animated films opening in March including The Croods, The Lorax, Horton Hears a Who, Monsters vs. Aliens, and the first two Ice Age flicks. The drop was equal to How To Train Your Dragon‘s from 2010 which was a durable hit that went on to gross five times its opening weekend take. The road ahead will not be easy for Sherman. Disney attacks this Friday with its heavily-hyped kidpic sequel Muppets Most Wanted followed three weeks later by Fox’s Rio 2.Falling from the box office throne was 300: Rise of an Empire which dropped by a reasonable 58% to an estimated $19.1M for second place. For a male-skewing action sequel, the decline was not too bad. The original 300, a pop culture phenomenon, fell by 54% in its sophomore frame this same month in 2007. Warner Bros. has taken in $78.3M in ten days and could be headed for a domestic final of $110-120M. Overseas, Empire grossed an estimated $41.3M from 62 markets this weekend boosting the international cume to $158M and the worldwide take to $236.3M.Selling over 140 million video games apparently means little at the multiplexes. The game-inspired action thriller Need For Speed disappointed in its debut weekend grossing only $17.8M, according to estimates, for a $5,717 average from 3,115 locations. Produced by DreamWorks Pictures and released by Disney, the PG-13 film played heavily to young men as expected. Studio research showed that guys made up 70% of the crowd while 56% were in the 18-34 age bracket. 3D accounted for 43% of the gross which was not bad by today’s standards on a film like this which is more driven by stunts than special effects.Need For Speed opened with less than half of the strength of the original Fast &amp; Furious film which relied on 2001 ticket prices and no 3D. That surprise street racing hit debuted to $40.1M and an average of more than $15,000 which would be north of $20,000 at today’s 2D prices. The CinemaScore on Need was a moderate B+.Speed was banking on fans of the game to come out and buy tickets. But young males have become incredibly difficult to lure into multiplexes in recent years, especially outside of tentpole sequels and VFX-driven super hero flicks. Plus, Speed had no major names in the cast and awful reviews from critics. Outside of Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning Lincoln, it’s been tough times for DreamWorks Pictures with a string of duds like Delivery Man, The Fifth Estate, People Like Us, and A Thousand Words before Need For Speed came out.International markets presented a brighter picture for Need For Speed. China opened strong this weekend with $21.2M (including $2.4M from 138 IMAX screens) beating out the domestic debut. $45.6M was grossed overseas this weekend making for a global start of $63.4M with key markets like Germany, France, Spain, Korea and Japan still to come. Produced for $66M and requiring a loud marketing push including a pricey Super Bowl commercial, Speed will need success from foreign markets to break even.Liam Neeson enjoyed another good weekend for his action thriller Non-Stop which grossed an estimated $10.6M falling only 33% in its third round. The Universal hit has collected $68.8M thus far.Tyler Perry’s star continued to fade this weekend as the media mogul suffered the worst opening of his directing career with The Single Moms Club which bowed to an estimated $8.3M. That was less than half of the usual $20M or so that he routinely delivers on the first weekend of most films. The PG-13 pic averaged a mild $4,378 from 1,896 locations – again, low by Perry standards.Club did earn a good A- CinemaScore grade and the audience skewed heavily towards adult women. Studio research showed that 79% was female and 80% was over 25. After releasing all his other work, Lionsgate recently decided not to renew its deal with Perry. His last film A Madea Christmas opened to $16M which was by far a new low for that character’s films, however somewhat understandable for a pic opening during the holiday shopping season when debuts are generally lower. It did go on to break $50M like all past Madea flicks. Meet the Peeples, presented by Perry but not written or directed by him, was a clunker last summer with a $4.6M debut.Toon hit The LEGO Movie followed with an estimated $7.7M, off 29%, for a robust $236.9M cume for Warner Bros. Worldwide tally is now $378.4M. Fox’s Biblical film Son of God fell 48% to an estimated $5.4M and has banked $50.9M to date.Wes Anderson’s newest offering The Grand Budapest Hotel pulled off a perfect expansion jumping from four to 66 locations and grossing an estimated $3.6M for an eye-popping $55,152 average. Ranking eighth nationwide despite a limited release, Fox Searchlight’s indie smash became the first film playing in under 100 theaters to hit the national top ten since the director’s own Moonrise Kingdom from June 2012. With $4.8M to date, Hotel will expand into 40 new markets next weekend with roughly 300 total theaters. The film has posted numbers even bigger than Anderson’s past hits suggesting his newest has appeal beyond his loyal fan base.The music-filled juggernaut that is Frozen ranked ninth with an estimated $2.1M, down only 28%, for a $396.4M domestic haul on its way past the $400M mark, possibly by month’s end. Disney’s Oscar-winning smash has now spent its first 16 weeks of wide release in the top ten matching Chicago for the most among all films released since 1997’s Titanic which spent 15 straight weeks at number one. Overseas, Frozen opened in its final market of Japan with a rare Friday release resulting in a big $9.4M debut weekend ahead of what should be a long run. The overseas tally soared to $630.2M for a global haul of $1.027 billion charging towards a $1.1 billion final. It releases domestically on Blu-ray this week while simultaneously being in the top ten theatrically.Snow sister Anna also found herself in tenth place as Kristen Bell’s Veronica Mars debuted to an estimated $2M from 291 theaters for a good $6,945 average. Backed by fans of the television series through a Kickstarter campaign, the indie film was extremely front-loaded as half of the sales came on opening day with Saturday plunging 39%. Fans who donated also got a digital copy to download, although many had technical problems with that platform. Warner Bros. handled distribution and reviews were fairly positive. Tied for tenth place was George Clooney’s The Monuments Men, also with an estimated $2M weekend, putting Sony at $73.8M to date.A year after conquering the box office with Identity Thief, Jason Bateman unleashed his directorial debut Bad Words in platform release and attracted commendable numbers from New York and Los Angeles. The raunchy spelling bee comedy bowed to an estimated $120,000 from six locations for a strong $20,000 average. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated pic which Focus expands Friday into the Top 20 markets before going nationwide the following week. Expanding at the same time as Budapest Hotel will be challenging, though, given the audience overlap.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.9M which was up 6% from last year when Oz the Great and Powerful stayed at number one with $41.3M; and up 5% from 2012 when 21 Jump Street took the top spot with $36.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Chernobyl, San, TV, Marvel, police, Black, 2017, Premium, Nominations, TNT, golden, disaster, 2020, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mr-Peabody-and-Sherman-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509114449625","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 300 Reigns Supreme at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 300 Reigns Supreme at #1by Gitesh Pandya | March 10, 2014 |  CommentsExactly seven years after the record-breaking opening of the blockbuster Spartan battle pic, the historical action sequel 300: Rise of an Empire conquered the global box office with international growth helping to make up for understandable domestic shrinkage. The brutal R-rated war epic debuted to an estimated $45.1M in North America capturing the top spot with ease driven by a carnage-loving male fan base. Warner Bros. averaged a strong $12,983 from 3,470 locations including 343 IMAX screens (up from only 62 on the first film) which did tremendously well.Rise opened 36% weaker than the $70.9M debut of 300 from 2007, however it was never expected to come close to that runaway smash. The first film offered a different graphic novel style to the worn out genre of historical epics and became a ground-breaking smash with one of the best trailers from the past decade. Rise featured a mostly new cast and a new director while 3D was added to the fun. With much of the film and backgrounds being computer-generated, that format lent itself well to the audience as the 3D share of the gross was 63% – very high by today’s standards.Reviews were lackluster for the $110M-budgeted production, but moviegoers came out for the action, intense war violence, and special effects. In fact, it opened better than several recent VFX-driven action movies – some with A-list stars – including Elysium, Oblivion, Riddick, The Lone Ranger, Pacific Rim, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation as well as Wrath of the Titans which was another Warner Bros. period action sequel opening in March. Breaking $40M on opening weekend for action movies has become difficult these days except for super hero flicks or top literary brand like The Hunger Games and The Hobbit.Long-term playability looks tough for Rise of an Empire. Its lukewarm B grade from CinemaScore shows that customer satisfaction is not too high, plus sequels like these are usually very front-loaded. IMAX screens contributed a robust $6.8M of the weekend gross accounting for a high 15% of the tally with an average of nearly $20,000. Males made up 62% of the crowd.Overseas, the new 300 launched in 58 markets and captured an estimated $87.8M which was 10% better than comparable results for the Gerard Butler flick. Global opening was a towering $132.9M since Wednesday. Factor out higher ticket prices today and 3D surcharges and the attendance was still extremely close to the first film’s making for a remarkable performance for this follow-up. The brand is still strong and with international markets growing significantly in recent years, especially for 3D and IMAX formats, Rise could be on its way past the $400M global box office mark just like its predecessor.The DreamWorks Animation offering Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman enjoyed a respectable debut in second place with an estimated $32.5M from 3,934 locations for a solid $8,261 average. The PG-rated comedy based on the 1960s cartoon characters opened in the same range as other 3D toons like Epic ($33.5M) and both Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs movies ($30.3M, $34M) and edged out the five-day $31M debut last summer of the studio’s last film Turbo.Reviews were very positive for the Fox release and audiences liked the film too as evidenced by its A CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that females made up 56% of the audience and 52% were over 25. The genius dog and his boy should have smooth sailing for the next week with no kidpics opening next weekend, but will face competition on March 21 when Disney rolls out the heavily-marketed The Muppets Most Wanted. But Peabody does seem to be on track to join 300 in becoming the latest $100M+ domestic grossers for 2014 with plenty of international potential as well.Liam Neeson enjoyed a moderate hold for his latest action hit Non-Stop. The airline thriller fell 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $15.4M for a ten-day cume of $52.1M. Look for the Universal release to end up with around $90M. Toon juggernaut The LEGO Movie took a big hit from the new DreamWorks competition and dropped 47% in its fifth round, the largest decline of its month-long run. The Warner Bros. smash grossed an estimated $11M and boosted its total to a hefty $225M.The Jesus pic Son of God tumbled 61% in its sophomore weekend to an estimated $10M suffering the worst drop of any film in the top ten. Fox has banked $41.5M in ten days and is headed for a $60M final. The George Clooney hit The Monuments Men grossed an estimated $3.1M, off 37%, for a $70.6M total.The Kevin Costner actioner 3 Days to Kill followed with an estimated $3.1M, down 38%, putting Relativity at $25.6M. Double Oscar winner Frozen eased only 17% to an estimated $3M boosting the phenomenal domestic cume to $393.1M. The Best Animated Feature champ has now spent 15 consecutive weekends in the top ten which is even more than Avatar. The global tally rose to $1.009 billion with Japan set to open this Friday as its final major market.The winner of the top trophy at the Academy Awards, 12 Years a Slave, more than doubled its screens and jumped back into the top ten for the first time since November with an estimated $2.2M more than doubling last weekend’s take. Fox Searchlight has taken in an impressive $53.1M for the indie film. Rounding out the top ten were two action titles with an estimated $2M each. The Kevin Hart-Ice Cube comedy hit Ride Along was down 34% with a robust $130M cume for Universal while Sony’s RoboCop fell 56% for $54.7M to date from North America but a potent $220M globally.Wes Anderson’s latest film The Grand Budapest Hotel rocked the specialty box office soaring even higher than his usual muscular standards with a platform bow of an estimated $800,000 from four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for an eye-popping $200,000 average. Most locations were triple-screening the well-reviewed comedy helping it score the best average in box office history among regular film releases. Budapest’s average was significantly better than the $130,749 registered by the director’s last film Moonrise Kingdom from May 2012, also in four theaters, which itself was phenomenal. The director has long had a large and loyal fan base. Fox Searchlight will expand quickly on Friday into most major markets nationwide into about 75 total playdates.The top ten films grossed an estimated $127.3M which was up 2% from last year when Oz the Great and Powerful opened at number one with $79.1M; and up 10% from 2012 when The Lorax took the top spot with $38.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Trek, laika, independent, Spring","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-300-Reigns-Supreme-at-1"},{"id":"47509116187359","title":"Box Office Wrap-up: Ride Along Says Bye, Frankenstein","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrap-up: Ride Along Says Bye, FrankensteinHorror flop comes in well behind recent holdovers.by Gitesh Pandya | January 26, 2014 |  CommentsIt was a sluggish session at the North American box office as Hollywood offered just one new movie which was rejected by audiences allowing the top five to be filled by the same faces as last week. The action-horror thriller I, Frankenstein flopped while the hit buddy comedy Ride Along once again took first place for a second weekend in a row with a reasonably good hold. Moviegoers did spend some time sampling the Academy Award nominees for Best Picture as eight of the nine contenders found themselves in the Top 20.Kevin Hart and Ice Cube once again ruled the box office with their runaway hit Ride Along which collected an estimated $21.2M in its sophomore round easily beating all competitors. The Universal hit dropped 49% which was a decent hold considering it was coming off of a holiday weekend when Sunday numbers were stronger than usual. With a robust $75.4M grossed in the first ten days, look for the PG-13 film to end up with roughly $125M which would be a career high for each star in a lead role, and also five times bigger than its $25M production cost. Ride Along is also set to soar higher than many of last year’s big comedy titles like This is the End, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa and The Hangover Part III and will reach the same vicinity as Anchorman 2.Mark Wahlberg and his fellow soldiers held their ground in second with Lone Survivor which fell back 43% to an estimated $12.6M in its third round of wide release. The Universal hit has grossed an impressive $93.6M and will cross the $100M mark before the Super Bowl. The studio is off to a fantastic start in 2014 topping the charts over the last three weeks with two films about to join the century club.Advertising itself as the #1 family movie in America, the animated comedy The Nut Job finished its second weekend in third place with an estimated $12.3M after a good hold that saw sales drop just 37%. The Open Road release has banked $40.3M in ten days and could be headed for a $75M final. A sequel has already been announced and will follow the same release pattern opening over the Martin Luther King holiday in 2016.Toon juggernaut, and double Oscar nominee, Frozen enjoyed great stamina again dipping only 23% to an estimated $9M in its ninth weekend of wide release boosting the remarkable domestic haul up to $347.8M. Next weekend, Disney will replace over 1,000 of the runs with a new sing-along version of the popular film in hopes of generating even more repeat business.Frozen now sits at number 27 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just two spots behind last year’s sensation Despicable Me 2 which had the added advantage of being a sequel playing in summer when kids were out of school. The snow sisters will surpass the Minions in a couple of weeks to steal away the animated box office crown for 2013. Frozen also zoomed past the $800M global mark this weekend with a worldwide tally of $810.3M and counting. With China and Japan still to open, breaking the billion dollar mark is looking more and more likely.The CIA reboot Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit followed its weak opening weekend with a moderate 43% decline to an estimated $8.8M for a disappointing ten-day take of $30.2M. With a reported production cost of $60M, the Paramount release should end its domestic run with only $50M or so. Overseas sales, though, are at a respectable $46.5M early in its run with nearly half coming from China.Moviegoers showed no interest in paying to see the new monster movie I, Frankenstein which opened poorly in sixth place with an estimated $8.3M. Averaging a weak $3,006 from 2,753 locations, the PG-13 film starring Aaron Eckhart failed to generate much heat and the higher-priced 3D and IMAX options did not seem to be premium experiences that ticket buyers felt like spending cash for on this particular title. The opening was even worse than the $11.2M debut of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein from back in 1994 when tickets cost half as much as today.Films like I, Frankenstein used to be able to count on teen males to turn out. But that demo’s lower attendance today (especially for non-tentpoles) is once again hurting big-budget action films. This one reportedly cost $65M to produce. Lionsgate research showed that 60% of the audience was over 25 and 62% was male. The CinemaScore grade was a B which was decent for this genre of action-horror fare. But past films of this category have opened much better like Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters’ $19.7M from this same weekend last year and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter’s $16.3M.A handful of Oscar nominees caught business from the public led by American Hustle with an estimated $7.1M, off just 28%, for a strong $127M cume to date for Sony. The Weinstein Co. added 360 theaters to the run of August: Osage County and saw sales dip 32% to an estimated $5M. Sum to date is $26.5M.Paramount’s The Wolf of Wall Street followed dipping 29% to an estimated $5M as well raising the total to $98M. Later this week it will become the fourth consecutive $100M+ grosser for the dynamic duo of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Dicaprio.Rounding out the top ten with an estimated $2.8M was the fright flop Devil’s Due which tumbled 67% in its second weekend. The Fox release has scared up a lousy $12.9M in ten days and should end off with only $17M.The seven remaining Oscar nominees for Best Picture not in the top ten were all still out in national release looking to cash in on the awards attention with some adding screens. Dallas Buyers Club expanded by 691 theaters more than doubling its run and saw a 117% spike to an estimated $2M this weekend and $20.4M to date for Focus. Fox Searchlight’s 12 Years a Slave, seen by many as the one to beat, widened by 470 locations and grossed an estimated $2M, up 31%. Total is now $43.5M.Adding 316 runs was Gravity which rose 8% to an estimated $2M for a new total of $261.2M. The Warner Bros. smash earned the prestigious DGA Award on Saturday for director Alfonso Cuaron. Paramount’s black-and-white film Nebraska more than doubled its run adding 560 extra screens and collected an estimated $1.4M – the biggest weekend gross yet of its 11-week run. Cume is $11.6M.The offbeat romance Her with Joaquin Phoenix and the voice of Scarlett Johansson lost 404 locations and fell 43% to an estimated $2.3M giving Warner Bros. $19.2M overall. Judi Dench’s Philomena held steady in 505 locations and took in an estimated $1M, off 18%, for a $25.8M total. After an expansion last weekend, Captain Phillips lost two-thirds of its screens and collected an estimated $328,000, down 37%, for a $106.3M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.1M which was up 13% from last year when Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters opened at number one with $19.7M; but up 1% from 2012 when The Grey debuted in the top spot with $19.7M as well.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Awards, TV, HBO, TV, 20th","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Ride-Along-Says-Bye-Frankenstein"},{"id":"47509117932274","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Insidious Soars to Chilling $41M Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Insidious Soars to Chilling $41M Debutby Gitesh Pandya | September 15, 2013 |  CommentsFall moviegoers were in the mood to be scared as the horror sequel Insidious Chapter 2 dominated the North American box office with a spectacular opening that ranked among the best of all-time for its genre. FilmDistrict’s follow-up to its 2011 sleeper hit thriller bowed to a stunning $41.1M, according to estimates, averaging a sensational $13,463 from 3,049 locations.It was the second largest opening ever during the month of September coming in a hair behind the $42.5M of last year’s animated comedy Hotel Transylvania. Chapter 2 also generated the second best horror opening of all-time during the August-to-November corridor which is the most popular time of year for that genre due in part to Halloween. The only bigger debut was the $52.6M of another supernatural thriller sequel – 2011’s Paranormal Activity 3. For scary movies, first weekend audiences don’t get much bigger than this and there was no 3D gimmick to jack up prices.Many factors contributed to the Insidious success. The first installment was a leggy hit that created a large fan base and the cast was back for the sequel. A PG-13 rating made it commercially-friendly to younger teens who often look for something compelling to see during this back-to-school month. A Friday the 13th release date made sitting in that multiplex extra creepy and director James Wan was red hot coming off of his last film The Conjuring which was a monster hit this summer opening to a similar $41.9M in July. It enjoyed terrific legs, strong word-of-mouth, and currently sits at $136M domestic and an amazing $271M worldwide.Bad reviews didn’t matter as Chapter 2 got the weekend started with a scorching $20.1M opening day on Friday including $1.5M from Thursday night late shows beginning at 10:00pm. Saturday tumbled by a third to $13.5M and Sunday is estimated to fall by 45% to $7.4M. Horror films that use Friday the 13th as their launch date can often make half of their weekend sales in that first day and the latest Insidious was no different. Friday accounted for 49% of its weekend gross.Produced for a mere $5M, Chapter 2 should shoot ahead of the $54M of its predecessor and become one of the most profitable wide releases of 2013. Studio research showed that the audience was 52% male and 62% under 25 as teens made up a major component. The CinemaScore grade was a B+ which would be decent for most films, but is actually pretty good for the horror genre. The Conjuring scored a notch better with an A- while the year’s second biggest fright film, the January supernatural hit Mama, received a B-. With Insidious Chapter 2 and last spring’s Olympus Has Fallen, FilmDistrict has had a solid year beating out its peers at the box office.The witness protection action-comedy The Family debuted in second place with respectable results grossing an estimated $14.5M from 3,091 theaters for a decent $4,691 average. Relativity’s R-rated film starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer earned lackluster reviews from critics which helped to dampen the overall potential with its target audience of mature adults. But it did deliver one of the best openings for De Niro in a lead role over the past decade. Luc Besson directed and executive producer Martin Scorsese’s name was used in advertising to make moviegoers take the film seriously. A lousy C CinemaScore grade indicates a fast fade ahead.Last week’s number one film Riddick suffered the kind of sophomore tumble expected of a sci-fi sequel with lukewarm word-of-mouth. The Universal release fell 63% to an estimated $7M pushing the ten-day total to $31.3M. It was a bit larger than the 61% crash that its predecessor, 2004’s The Chronicles of Riddick, experienced in its second weekend in June of that year. Produced for $38M, the new Riddick should finish its domestic run with a mediocre $45M.A pair of leggy hits from August reached milestones this weekend. If estimates hold, Forest Whitaker’s The Butler will cross the $100M mark on Sunday night. The Weinstein Co. release declined by 34% to an estimated $5.6M spending its fifth frame in the top five and is now the distributor’s fifth film to break the nine-digit domestic mark. The other four all went on to earn Oscar nominations for Best Picture – Inglourious Basterds, The King’s Speech, Django Unchained, and Silver Linings Playbook. Meanwhile, the Warner Bros. sleeper hit We’re the Millers became the first live-action film of 2013 to remain in 3,000+ theaters for six weeks. That marks exceptional staying power especially given how competitive the marketplace has been over the last month. The pot smuggling comedy slipped 30% to an estimated $5.4M for $131.6M to date and will soon become Jennifer Aniston’s highest-grossing film in a lead role.The Spanish-language hit Instructions Not Included dropped 48% to an estimated $4.3M in its third round boosting the cume for Lionsgate up to $26.6M. Disney’s animated flick Planes held up well again slipping only 26% to an estimated $3.1M for $83M to date.Sony released a new fan cut of the boy band concert doc One Direction: This Is Us and saw the title slip by 41% to an estimated $2.4M giving the teen girl magnets $26.9M to date. Studio stablemate Elysium followed with an estimated $2.1M, down 35%, and a total of $88.4M. Rounding out the top ten was the fantasy offering Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters which slipped 25% to an estimated $1.8M putting Fox at $62M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $87.1M which was up 34% from last year when Resident Evil: Retribution debuted at number one with $21.1M; and up 5% from 2011 when The Lion King 3D opened in the top spot with $30.2M.Follow the Gitesh on the Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"The, popular, transformers, Shondaland, Pet, Crackle","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Insidious-Soars-to-Chilling-41M-Debut"},{"id":"47509117927152","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Wins the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 Wins the WeekendPlus, Rush, Baggage Claim, Don Jon end up at 3, 4, and 5.by Gitesh Pandya | September 29, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Sony hit the top spot in North America with its new animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 which grossed more than the frame’s other three wide openers combined. The PG-rated 3D pic bowed to an estimated $35M from an ultrawide 4,001 theaters delivering a $8,748 average. Compared to the first Cloudy from this same month four years ago, the sequel’s opening weekend gross was 16% higher but its average fell 10%. The original, also in 3D, was released in nearly 900 fewer locations bowing to $30.3M on its way to $124.9M, or four times its opening weekend.Meatballs 2 had a solid debut for sure, but considering how well-liked the first film was and how empty the marketplace is right now for family movies, the opening was not stellar. A year ago this weekend, the same studio found itself with a $42.5M opening for the animated comedy Hotel Transylvania which did not have the benefit of a built-in audience. It did boast the voice talents of box office titan Adam Sandler, however the toon was not promoted as a Sandler vehicle per se.But the road ahead for Meatballs looks promising as the entire month of October lacks new kidpics. It’s a rare case for studios to just give up on a whole month like this. Also audiences did like the new $78M-budgeted food flick as the CinemaScore grade was an A- so reaching past the $100M domestic mark is certainly possible. Reviews were decent, but not outstanding.Falling 46% in its second weekend and landing in second place was last week’s top film Prisoners with an estimated $11.3M. The Warner Bros. release has grossed $39M in ten days and should end up with $65-70M, a solid amount for an adult drama opening in September.Ron Howard’s Formula One drama Rush expanded nationwide after a one-week platform run and raced into third place this weekend with an estimated $10.3M. It was a respectable showing as the Universal release averaged $4,490 from 2,297 theaters. With a non-American cast and subject matter, the R-rated film was a tough sell to U.S. crowds and a marketplace filled with other options for adults did not help any. Cume is now $10.6M.With solid buzz from the Toronto International Film Festival, stellar reviews, and an encouraging A- CinemaScore grade, Rush hopes to keep attracting business in the weeks ahead thanks to word-of-mouth. However, direct competition for adults will only get more fierce each week in October especially with Gravity starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney looking to deliver a powerful debut next weekend. Studio research showed that the 1970s-set Rush played 52% male and skewed old — 53% were 40 or above.The comedy Baggage Claim premiered in fourth place to decent results collecting an estimated $9.3M from 2,027 locations for a moderate $4,588 average. Panned by critics, the PG-13 film starring Paula Patton as a woman determined to get engaged before her younger sister’s wedding skewed towards an audience of African-American women. Customers liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an A-.Joseph Gordon-Levitt made a modest debut in fifth place with his first directorial effort Don Jon which grossed an estimated $9M from 2,422 theaters for a soft $3,716 average. The R-rated pic about a ladies man addicted to porn who finally meets Ms. Right (Scarlett Johansson) garnered strong reviews from critics, but was rejected by those who actually paid to see the movie.Its CinemaScore grade was a disappointing C+. That was close to the C- from Ryan Gosling’s Drive from 2011 which was another September pic centered around a hot young male star which won over critics, but got a thumbs down from ticket buyers. Sometimes quality doesn’t sell. A crowded marketplace for adult stories made things tough and the Don Jon opening was almost identical to the $8.6M bow and $3,517 average of the actor’s cancer comedy 50/50 from two years ago this very weekend.Dropping 51% in its third scare was the hit fright sequel Insidious Chapter 2 with an estimated $6.7M giving FilmDistrict a stellar $69.5M to date. Relativity collected an estimated $3.7M for The Family, down 48%, for a $31.7M cume.Falling 37% was the Mexican comedy Instructions Not Included with an estimated $3.4M and a total of $38.6M for Lionsgate. It now stands as the highest-grossing Spanish-language film of all-time in the U.S. surpassing Pan’s Labyrinth.The Jennifer Aniston comedy We’re the Millers became only the second summer film this year to last for eight weeks in the top ten joining Iron Man 3, the year’s top-grossing blockbuster. The sleeper smash took in an estimated $2.9M, off 37%, for a $142.4M sum to date. Rounding out the top ten was the White House hit The Butler with an estimated $2.4M, down 42%, putting The Weinstein Co. at $110.3M.Fox Searchlight enjoyed a solid expansion for its indie romantic comedy Enough Said starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini. Widening from four to 227 locations, the well-reviewed pic grossed an estimated $2.1M for a promising $9,317 average. Enough has banked $2.5M to date. Next weekend’s expansion will see the theater count double, though it will have to lure eyeballs away from Bullock and Clooney.The concert-thriller hybrid Metallica Through the Never opened outside the top ten with its IMAX 3D release debuting to an estimated $1.7M from 308 locations for a $5,429 average which was only moderate given the higher prices. Tickets cost as high as $21.50 each in New York City. The R-rated title earned good reviews and was distributed by Picturehouse which goes wider next weekend into about 650 playdates including conventional screens.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94M which was down 9% from last year when Hotel Transylvania debuted at number one with $42.5M; but up 13% from 2011 when Dolphin Tale climbed into the top spot with $13.9M.Follow the Gitesh on the Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"lord, One, 2020, Marvel, all-time","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Cloudy-with-a-Chance-of-Meatballs-2-Wins-the-Weekend"},{"id":"47509117926127","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Stuns with Record $55M Launch","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Stuns with Record $55M Launchby Gitesh Pandya | October 6, 2013 |  CommentsAlfonso Cuarón’s outer space survival thriller Gravity defied conventions both creatively and commercially and smashed the opening weekend record for October with a sensational $55.6M, according to estimates, to lead the North American box office accounting for half of all ticket sales in the top ten. The Warner Bros. release starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took advantage of a perfect storm of sensational reviews, strong starpower, and awards buzz attracting a huge turnout which was especially impressive given that it was an original film with no built-in audience. It opened like a summer tentpole.Gravity averaged a scorching $15,538 from 3,575 theaters over the weekend and was a major shot in the arm to the 3D and IMAX formats. With its captivating visuals and intense use of CG effects, moviegoers found it a film experience worthy of paying premium ticket prices for. A mind-boggling 80% of the weekend gross came from 3D screens. That’s double the rate that many 3D action films enjoy these days. $11.2M, or 20%, of the gross came from the 323 IMAX locations for a sizzling $34,754 average.Both Bullock and Clooney set new opening weekend career records with Gravity. Bullock just gave herself a new benchmark this past June with the $39.1M debut of The Heat while Clooney, who doesn’t normally have big openings outside of his signature Ocean’s franchise, beat his previous best of $42.9M set way back in 1997 with the mega-flop Batman &amp; Robin.After this weekend, Bullock cements her status as Hollywood’s most bankable actress. Four of her last six films have opened to more than $30M. She was the primary lead in all four and none were franchise movies with built-in audiences. With the romantic comedy The Proposal, the football drama The Blind Side, the buddy cop comedy The Heat, and the space thriller Gravity, the Oscar-winning actress sells across all genres. That sets her apart from Angelina Jolie who struggles to open movies outside of her action safety zone.After generating ample awards buzz by playing a trifecta of key film festivals – Venice, Telluride, and Toronto – Gravity became red hot and then generated fantastic reviews from all around. The PG-13 pic became that rare breed – a prestige picture with broad commercial appeal. Strong marketing helped attract the sci-fi crowd allowing it to pull from multiple audience segments. Friday kicked off with a solid $17.5M while Saturday saw an impressive 31% surge to $23M. Sunday is estimated to drop by 35% to $15M.For October, the space disaster film beat the month’s previous record for best opener which was $52.6M set in 2011 by Paranormal Activity 3. The margin of victory may not have been too much, and the horror hit didn’t have premium ticket prices to boost grosses, however Gravity’s performance was amazing considering it was an original film. The other seven biggest October openings of all-time are either sequels or animated films and until now, no original live-action film had ever opened to north of $40M in either September or October.According to studio research, Gravity skewed more towards the guys with 54% of the audience being male. Not surprising for a movie set almost entirely in space. A very high 59% were over the age of 35 and audience satisfaction was good as the pic earned an A- grade from CinemaScore.Produced for roughly $100M, Gravity opened like a summer blockbuster. In fact, it debuted better than every live-action film released since June’s World War Z starring Clooney’s pal Brad Pitt. Plus the road ahead seems bright given the positive buzz and older audience. That means holdover competition it will give to upcoming mature-skewing adult dramas Captain Phillips and The Fifth Estate will be even stronger.Gravity is just getting started with international territories but it’s already looking to become a fall behemoth with the majority of fans paying extra for the 3D and IMAX formats, just like their North American comrades. 27 markets opened this weekend delivering $27.4M with 3D accounting for an average of 70% of the gross. Russia led with $8.1M, 75% from 3D. The format’s share in Germany was a phenomenal 97% this weekend and 95% in Italy. Key markets like Brazil, Korea, Mexico, France, Japan, and the U.K. are still to come and the studio is still trying to confirm a release in China, the most lucrative overseas market for 3D and IMAX content.Declining by a reasonable 37% from its opening weekend, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 settled for second with an estimated $21.5M for a ten-day tally of $60.6M. That made for a better hold compared to the summer’s pair of toon sequel juggernauts – Monsters University fell 45% and Despicable Me 2 dropped 47%. The first Cloudy dipped just 17% in its sophomore round, but was an original pic with less of a built-in audience. Produced for $78M, the second Cloudy looks to end its domestic run a few notches below the $124.9M of its predecessor.Stumbling into third place was the critically-panned online gambling drama Runner Runner which debuted to just $7.6M, according to estimates, from 3,026 locations for a weak $2,512 average. Fox’s R-rated film starring Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck (in a lead role but taking the “and” credit) was rejected across the board by reviewers and opened below the $12.1M of the ‘N Sync star’s sci-fi pic In Time from October 2011. Runner cost $30M to produce and after its overseas bow a week ago, worldwide grosses stand at $31.1M.A number of September leftovers followed with each collecting a modest amount. Former number one Prisoners dropped 48% to an estimated $5.7M for a $47.9M total for Warner Bros. Ron Howard’s awards hopeful Rush starring Chris Hemsworth stumbled 56% and took in an estimated $4.4M giving Universal a soft cume of only $18.1M.Don Jon fell a sharp 52% in its sophomore round grossing an estimated $4.2M and just $16.1M after ten days for Relativity. Star Joseph Gordon-Levitt along with Hemsworth and Timberlake make up members of the new generation of male leads, but all have failed to attract notable sales with their recent films this fall.Falling 54% to an estimated $4.1M was Fox Searchlight’s romantic comedy Baggage Claim which has taken in $15.2M to date. Horror hit Insidious Chapter 2 followed with an estimated $3.9M, down 41%, putting FilmDistrict at an impressive $74.8M.The second Spanish-language hit of the fall entered the top ten as the Mexico City-set romantic comedy Pulling Strings debuted to an estimated $2.5M from 387 locations for a respectable $6,460 average. The PG-rated film earned a glowing A+ CinemaScore for Lionsgate and was produced by Latino studio Pantelion which saw its last film Instructions Not Included spend the past five weeks in the national top ten following its $7.8M opening weekend. Its current total is a stellar $41.3M.Rounding out the top ten was the arthouse comedy Enough Said starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini which nearly doubled its run and collected an estimated $2.2M from 437 locations for a $4,920 average. Cume for Fox Searchlight is $5.4M.Ahead of next weekend’s nationwide roll-out, Sony’s Somali pirate drama Captain Phillips starring Tom Hanks got a round of 800 sneak previews on Saturday night to help bolster buzz for the tough-to-sell pic. The studio reported that the sneaks were 75% full on average and that many shows were sold out across all regions of the country. Research showed that the audience was split evenly between males and females and that the crowd was very mature with 71% being over 35. Garnering strong early reviews, Captain Phillips opens on Friday in more than 3,000 locations.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.6M which was down 14% from last year when Taken 2 debuted at number one with $49.5M; but up 39% from 2011 when Real Steel opened in the top spot with $27.3M.Folow Gitesh on the Twitter will ya!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"The, Trophy, El, King, DGA, Sundance, Emmy, Rocketman, Hallmark, Classic, richard, who, Sematary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gravity-Stuns-with-Record-55M-Launch"},{"id":"47509116204776","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Catching Fire Toasts the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Catching Fire Toasts the CompetitionThor: The Dark World and and The Best Man Holiday round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | November 24, 2013 |  CommentsEliminating its foes and setting records in the process, the hotly-anticipated tentpole The Hunger Games: Catching Fire opened to staggering results atop the box office with explosive grosses worldwide. In North America, the Katniss sequel debuted to an estimated $161.1M making it the second largest debut of the year and the fourth biggest of all-time. The only stronger films all benefited from 3D ticket prices — The Avengers with $207.4M, this year’s Iron Man 3 with $174.1M, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 with $169.2M.If estimates hold, Fire will edge past the $160.9M of The Dark Knight Rises which until now held the record for the biggest opening of a 2D film (it was also affected by a shooting tragedy). Sunday estimates are guesses after all and final numbers to be reported on Monday will indicate whether it ends at number four or five on the all-time list. Playing in 4,163 theaters — a new record for a non-summer release – the PG-13 pic averaged a scorching $38,704. The gross was 6% better than the $152.5M launch of the first Hunger Games movie a year and a half ago. That film also set the all-time 2D record. Regardless of how the final numbers shape up, Catching Fire easily set new all-time highs for both November and non-summer debuts beating the $142.8M of The Twilight Saga: A New Moon set in 2009.What was truly remarkable about the new Hunger flick was how it held up on Saturday. Its decline from opening day was the exact same as for its predecessor which was amazing considering how Fire is a sequel and also had an earlier start with shows beginning at 8:00pm on Thursday night instead of midnight for the first Panem pic. Fire was expected to be more front-loaded and have a larger Saturday fall.The fireworks began with the official Friday opening day gross of $70.9M including $25.3M from Thursday night shows. Saturday dipped 25% to $53M while Sunday is estimated to slide by 30% to $37.3M. The first Hunger Games fell 31% on Sunday although that was a March release when there was no NFL football that day. Should Catching Fire end up with a 35% decline on Sunday, that would put the opening weekend at about $158M. A deep freeze across the northeast and midwest on Sunday may also impact the entire moviegoing landscape. Many industry observers were expecting an even larger debut north of $170M, however regardless of expectations, this tentpole delivered sensational results and will certainly be a profitable venture.Book franchises work in mysterious ways. The second Twilight opened in November a year after the first and saw twice as much business on opening weekend. But Hunger Games seems to be performing more like the Harry Potter series. The first wizard pic broke the all-time opening weekend record and then its follow-up one year later opened a tiny bit below it. Fans made a mad rush to see the debut film and then attendance dipped a notch on the second installment. For Fire, it inched up a tad but was basically in the same neighborhood. Reviews for Fire were terrific with most major critics finding it better than its predecessor. Audiences liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an A just like last time.Like most 2D and 3D tentpoles, Catching Fire had an IMAX version which was quite popular with hard-core fans willing to pay a premium for a better experience. $12.6M of the gross (8%) came from those large-format screens setting a new three-day opening record in November edging out the $12.5M from last year’s Skyfall. Worldwide IMAX grosses stand at more than $18M. Studio research showed that the new Hunger Games played 59% female and those over and under 25 were evenly split.Overseas, Catching Fire rolled out across 62 territories this weekend grossing a sensational $146.6M including the first full week in Brazil which opened a week earlier. Lionsgate reported that it more than doubled the first movie’s openings in most major territories. The global tally sits at $307.7M and the smash hit could crush the half-billion mark after next weekend.Far back in second place with an estimated $14.1M was the comic hit Thor: The Dark World which tumbled 61% due to competition from another event sequel (and Hemsworth lad). The Disney release has grossed $167.8M so far in North America and $548.8M worldwide. China still leads the international marketplace with $48.3M and Japan is the final major market still to open.Yet another November sequel followed. The Best Man Holiday fell 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $12.5M lifting the cume to $50.4M. Despite the A+ Cinemascore, the Universal release played like a sequel with a built-in audience and dropped sharply. A final near the $75-80M range could result and a third film in the series is being developed.Stating once again that they will not pay money to see Vince Vaughn do the same character for the 25th time, audiences rejected the actor’s latest effort Delivery Man which opened in fourth with a lousy $8.2M, according to estimates. Averaging a wimpy $2,706 from 3,036 locations, the PG-13 film about a man whose sperm donations helped create 533 children followed the disappointing $17.3M bow of Vaughn’s The Internship from last summer as well as the $12.8M of his previous film The Watch. Although the funnyman anchored five hits opening to $30M+ between 2004 and 2009, he has not had any hits in four years now. Reviews were weak.Relativity’s toon Free Birds grossed an estimated $5.3M, down 35%, for a $48.6M total. The comedy Last Vegas witnessed its biggest drop yet sliding 48% in its fourth frame to an estimated $4.4M with $53.9M to date for CBS Films.Getting to within striking distance of the century club, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa fell 54% to an estimated $3.5M giving Paramount $95.5M so far. The Sandra Bullock megahit Gravity placed eighth with an estimated $3.3M, down 46% in its eighth round, for a domestic take of $245.5M. A massive $35.5M China opening over six days propelled the overseas total to $331.5M and the global tally to a sensational $577M.Two potential Oscar contenders rounded out the top ten. Fox Searchlight’s 12 Years A Slave slipped 39% to an estimated $2.8M and has banked $29.4M to date. Focus expanded its Matthew McConaughey drama Dallas Buyers Club from 184 to 666 locations and collected an estimated $2.8M as well for a lukewarm $4,159 average and $6.5M total.In a special exclusive engagement at one Disney-owned L.A. theater, the studio’s animated feature Frozen got off to an explosive start grossing a phenomenal $238,000 this weekend from the solo venue in a run leading up to Wednesday’s nationwide release in over 3,600 theaters. The exclusive event featured special bonuses for moviegoers and tickets were priced between $13 for just the film for kids to $51 for a VIP package that included breakfast, popcorn, soda, reserved seating and no waiting in line. Several Disney toons in the past started with a very limited platform run including The Lion King, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast.The top ten films grossed an estimated $218M which was down 9% from last year’s pre-Thanksgiving frame when tentpole The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 opened at number one with $141.1M; but up 2% from 2011 when Breaking Dawn Part 1 debuted in the top spot with $138.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"series, Rom-Com","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Catching-Fire-Toasts-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509116210923","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Ender Bender as Game Wins No. 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Ender Bender as Game Wins No. 1Meanwhile, Thor thunders out globally, Bad Grandpa stays strong, and Orson Scott Card loves our headline.by Gitesh Pandya | November 3, 2013 |  CommentsA week before the Hemsworth brothers begin their double feature of November tentpoles, the sci-fi entry Ender’s Game opened atop the North American box office and was joined in the top five by fellow new releases Last Vegas and Free Birds, all of which posted moderate or respectable launches.Debuting to an estimated $28M, the effects-driven futuristic action pic Ender’s Game landed in the number one spot with a performance that was reasonably good, but not especially impressive for an expensive production. Based on the best-selling novel, the PG-13 film averaged $8,218 from 3,407 locations including higher-priced IMAX and other large-format screens. Reviews were mixed for the Lionsgate release and the CinemaScore grade was a middling B+. Tapping into a built-in audience, not having any standout buzz, and facing the arrival of Thor: The Dark World next weekend, Game is not likely to last very long and should finish up with a front-loaded theatrical run.Bad Grandpa enjoyed the best second weekend hold ever for a Jackass film dipping only 36% to an estimated $20.5M giving Paramount a healthy $62.1M in ten days. The low-cost $15M comedy should end its domestic run with about $110M making for yet another profitable installment for the eleven-year-old franchise. Fan feedback has been excellent.The old timers comedy Last Vegas opened in third pace with an estimated $16.5M from 3,065 theaters for a respectable $5,390 average. Starring Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline, the PG-13 film about a group of old friends reuniting for a bachelor party in Sin City played to a mature crowd as expected. Critics were not too impressed, but moviegoers came out for the CBS Films release for the starpower and premise.Audience data showed that 53% were female and an understandably high 83% were 25 and older. With a promising A- CinemaScore grade, a much older target audience, and no major direct competition coming, Vegas should be able to hold up well throughout the November weeks ahead and reach a domestic gross that doubles the $28M production cost.2013 has been a tough year for animated films – especially those that are not on the very top tier – and Free Birds was the latest to lack excitement with family audiences. The PG-rated turkey flick debuted to an estimated $16.2M from 3,736 theaters for a mild $4,336 average. Relativity had relatively clear sailing for its launch as the only other kidpic out there – Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 – was in its sixth weekend. But the target audience was not excited to spend top dollar for this toon and reviews were lousy.No animated films open until Thanksgiving so the distributor is hoping that lack of competition will help in the days and weeks ahead. The A- CinemaScore indicates that customers were fairly pleased with their purchase. Even bigger players like DreamWorks, Fox, and Sony have struggled to make toons work this year.Space juggernaut Gravity fell back to fifth place but still posted a solid frame grossing an estimated $13.1M making for the best fifth weekend gross for any film since The Avengers. Warner Bros. has banked a stunning $219.2M to date making it the highest-grossing non-franchise film of 2013, and number eight overall. The Bullock blockbuster also smashed the $200M international and $400M global marks this weekend. The $27.1M overseas weekend gross pushed the offshore cume to $207.5M with worldwide climbing up to $426.7M.Captain Phillips, another star-driven survival thriller getting Oscar buzz, followed with an estimated $8.5M. Down only 27%, the Tom Hanks film stands at $82.6M to date.Fox Searchlight gave another expansion to its awards hopeful 12 Years A Slave which widened from 123 to 410 theaters and more than doubled its weekend gross in the process. The acclaimed period drama took in an estimated $4.6M and posted another promising average with $11,220 putting it in good shape for the road ahead. Many prestige films stumble when expanding to this many markets but Slave is remaining a relevant and much-talked-about film bringing in new audiences thanks in part to stellar reviews. Cume is $8.8M and next weekend it expands again into roughly 1,000 locations.Three C’s rounded out the top ten. Toon sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 dropped 33% to an estimated $4.2M for a $106.2M cume for Sony. Horror flick Carrie grossed an estimated $3.4M, down 43%, giving Sony $32M to date. Fox’s crime drama The Counselor tumbled 59% in its sophomore round to an estimated $3.3M putting the total at just $13.6M.Rachel McAdams saw lackluster results for her latest romance About Time which was given a limited release in only 175 locations this weekend by Universal. The R-rated time travel love story bowed to an estimated $1.1M for a mild average of $6,046 which does not bode well for next weekend’s nationwide expansion. Reviews have been mixed.Generating plenty of must-see awards buzz – especially in the acting categories – was Dallas Buyers Club which delivered a superb platform launch over the weekend as the final release for the current incarnation of Focus Features. The Matthew McConaughey film bowed to an estimated $264,000 from only nine locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto for a strong $29,333 average. The R-rated true story expands on Friday to a dozen new markets – including Dallas – and will be everywhere by November 22. Reviews were sensational and McConaughey is seen as a major contender for the Academy Award for Best Actor.A week ahead of its domestic launch, the super hero tentpole Thor: The Dark World opened across much of the planet this weekend taking in a sensational $109.4M from 36 markets led by $13.4M in the U.K. The second Thor flick lands in over 3,800 North American theaters this Friday (with first shows beginning at 8:00pm on Thursday night) and has scared away all other new wide releases. China also opens next weekend so the global tally will soar by the end of next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118.3M which was even with last year when Wreck-it Ralph opened at number one with $49M; but up 18% from 2011 when Puss in Boots stayed in the top spot with $33.1M in its second weekend.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Arrowverse, ITV, Kids, Arts, America, Awards, 2018, toy, Musical","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Ender-Bender-as-Game-Wins-No-1"},{"id":"47509117922029","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Still #1, Heading to $500M+ Global","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Gravity Still #1, Heading to $500M+ Globalby Gitesh Pandya | October 20, 2013 |  CommentsGrossing more than all the new releases combined, the space smash Gravity led the North American box office with ease for the third straight time collecting an estimated $31M. The Warner Bros. blockbuster displayed tremendous legs once again by slipping only 28% allowing the 17-day cume to soar to an eye-popping $170.6M. Only one 2013 film has grossed more in its third weekend – the year’s top hit Iron Man 3 which did $35.8M. And The Butler was the only other film this year to spend three weeks at number one with its third frame winning only thanks to a holiday.Gravity is tapping into repeat business and is broadening its audience as newcomers are finding the Sandra Bullock-George Clooney disaster pic through stellar word-of-mouth. A final trajectory towards the $250-275M range seems likely for the domestic market which would be third best for the year. These are summer-like grosses in the fall. An incredible $38M has come from the 318 IMAX screens representing 22% of the total and that amount could climb up to about $60M which is more than what most new films opening this month will make from all screens.Bullock has now become the first star of 2013 to anchor two different hits grossing over $150M domestic each. Her summer action-comedy The Heat has grossed $159.3M to date and also had a leggy run thanks to high customer satisfaction. The Oscar-winning actress has now led four hits past the $150M mark over the last four years and is arguably the most bankable star in Hollywood today, male or female.Overseas, Gravity was tops again pulling in $33.5M from 51 markets pushing the international total to $114.2M and the worldwide tally to $284.8M. Korea and Mexico scored solid openings this weekend with $7.1M and $5.7M, respectively, while Russia leads overall with $17.3M after its third weekend. Some huge markets are still to come such as France, the U.K., China and Japan so surpassing $500M next month will not be a problem for the Alfonso Cuaron-directed thriller.Tom Hanks enjoyed a solid hold for his hostage thriller Captain Phillips which followed its strong opening with a 33% decline to an estimated $17.3M for an impressive ten-day tally of $53.3M. The sophomore weekend gross was even bigger than the first weekend debuts of all of the actor’s live-action films from this decade – Larry Crowne ($13.1M), Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close ($10M), and Cloud Atlas ($9.6M). Sony is on track to surpass the $100M mark with Phillips which is especially remarkable given the competition for adults from Gravity. Hanks and Bullock have banked substantial likability points over their careers and are now cashing them in with well-made films about Americans in peril.The horror flick Carrie opened in third place with an estimated $17M from 3,157 theaters for a lukewarm $5,385 average. Sony’s remake of the high school fright tale was aimed at today’s generation of teens and young adults and opened at the low end of expectations. Given that it was the only horror title for the Halloween month of October, the performance was a bit underwhelming. The production cost was reportedly near the $30M mark.Studio research from Sony showed predictable results – 54% of the crowd was female and 56% was under 25. Reviews were mixed, but not bad enough to scare away the target audience of young adults. And the B- CinemaScore grade is respectable for this genre. Positioned in part as a supernatural thriller, the poster featuring star Chloe Grace Moretz’s blood-soaked head may have been a turn-off for many young women who prefer spooks over gore.Getting to within striking distance of the century club, the toon sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 followed with an estimated $10.1M sliding by only 27%. Sony has banked $93.1M to date and after four weekends the 3D food pic is running only 3% behind the pace of its 2009 predecessor.Former box office kings Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger teamed up for the new prison action thriller Escape Plan but pulled in a soft amount of business with an estimated $9.8M opening weekend. Averaging a mild $3,399 from 2,883 locations, the R-rated pic played to older men. Studio research showed that males made up 55% (surprisingly low for this type of testosterone flick) and 61% over 30. Reviews were not too great but audiences were fairly pleased as Escape earned a B+ CinemaScore grade. The actors fared worse early this year with solo projects as Stallone’s Bullet to the Head bowed to $4.5M while Schwarzenegger’s The Last Stand debuted to $6.3M. International and ancillary markets should deliver better results for this type of product.The kidnapping thriller Prisoners dropped 43% to an estimated $2.1M this weekend and Warner Bros. has taken in a solid $57.3M so far. Adding 151 theaters, Fox Searchlight’s indie comedy hit Enough Said jumped back into the top ten with a remarkable hold easing a scant 6% to an estimated $1.8M. Cume is now $10.8M from 757 theaters.Audiences showed no interest in paying to see the new WikiLeaks movie The Fifth Estate. The Disney release opened poorly to an estimated $1.7M from 1,769 locations for a miserable $969 average. Rarely do wide openers fail to crack an average of $1,000 per location and this R-rated drama about Julian Assange and his web site for whistleblowers had no subject matter that could draw in moviegoers. Bad reviews hurt and the cast lacked any stars that could pull in business, although lead Benedict Cumberbatch did win praise for his performance. Competition for sophisticated adult audiences crushed it too. Openings in Spain and the U.K. have also been weak. Estate won the high-profile opening night slot of last month’s Toronto International Film Festival, but attracted negative buzz once more critics and industry people saw the film.The Justin Timberlake-Ben Affleck online gambling thriller Runner Runner fell 57% to ninth place with an estimated $1.6M giving Fox only $17.5M to date. Rounding out the top ten was this year’s second biggest horror hit Insidious Chapter 2 with an estimated $1.5M, off 44%, for a $80.9M total.Leveraging sensational reviews and loads of Oscar talk, the acclaimed period drama 12 Years A Slave debuted to fantastic results in limited release with an estimated $960,000 from only 19 theaters in six markets for a promising $50,526 average. Directed by Steve McQueen (Shame), the R-rated film stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti, Alfre Woodard and Fifth Estate’s Cumberbatch.Fox Searchlight will take Slave into more than 100 sites next weekend opening in additional markets hoping for a prolonged fall run that can reach a broad spectrum of audiences thanks to reviews and buzz. The film is currently seen as one of the front-runners to win the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor, although it is still incredibly early in the awards race. Academy voting runs from February 14 to 25 with the ceremony on March 2.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94M which was down 19% from last year when Paranormal Activity 4 debuted at number one with $29M; and down 11% from 2011 when Paranormal Activity 3 opened in the top spot with $52.6M. This is the first October in ten years without a Paranormal or Saw installment.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Netflix, BBC, TV+","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Gravity-Still-1-Heading-to-500M-Global"},{"id":"47509119437564","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Despicable Me 2 Crushes Holiday Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Despicable Me 2 Crushes Holiday WeekendPlus, Lone Ranger underwhelms, and Kevin Hart surprises.by Gitesh Pandya | July 7, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, toon bad guy Gru dominated the box office with a gargantuan debut for his animated sequel Despicable Me 2 which drove the marketplace to a new record for the Independence Day holiday frame. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp attracted disappointing numbers to his new summer tentpole The Lone Ranger which finished in second. People caught up on a wide variety of holdovers (and free air conditioning) as the top ten surged to a scorching $218M.Universal overperformed and took in an estimated $82.5M this weekend for its toon giant Despicable Me 2 with the full debut period clocking in at an astounding $142.1M since its first shows starting at 7:00pm on Tuesday evening. The PG-rated smash averaged a sizzling $20,645 over the Friday-to-Sunday portion from 3,997 theaters. By comparison, the summer’s other big animated sequel Monsters University grossed $105.3M in its first five days, although over a non-holiday period.The first Despicable debuted three years ago in July 2010 to $56.4M and was a leggy hit finishing with nearly five times its opening with $251.5M. Fan love for Gru and his Minions grew over the years and now the sequel has capitalized on it. And like Shrek 2 before it, DM2 scored huge numbers by being both a toon for families and a mainstream comedy for teens and young adults.Reviews were quite good for a sequel and audiences gave a big thumbs up with a glowing A grade from CinemaScore. Studio research showed that the crowd was 60% female and 55% under 25. With a $76M production cost, DM2 is sure to be a major moneymaker spawning more sequels (and fat paychecks) for Steve Carell and company. Universal already has a spin-off film for the Minions on the calendar for December 2014.International grosses were fantastic too. Despicable Me 2 grossed a stellar $88.8M over the weekend from 45 markets pushing the overseas take to $151.1M and the global gross to an eye-popping $293.2M with much more to come. Reaching the billion mark cannot be ruled out at this point.Debuting in second place with less than spectacular results was Johnny Depp’s big-budget Western adventure film The Lone Ranger with an estimated $29.4M over three days and $48.9M since its Tuesday night launch at 7:00pm. Directed by Gore Verbinski and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, the PG-13 period pic even opened below the $70.6M five-day launch of the team’s Pirates of the Caribbean from ten years ago this very month. Factor in a decade worth of ticket price increases and the audience was roughly half the size.Reviews were very negative and a film based on the Lone Ranger brand was not exactly something audiences were asking for. Last summer, Dark Shadows proved that ticket buyers will no longer come out automatically to see Depp do yet another eccentric role. The film actually needs to be good and look compelling. With a reported production budget of at least $215M not counting an aggressive marketing push, this is a huge investment from Disney which will be difficult to recoup. The CinemaScore was a B+ which was decent, but nothing special. And new action films will open every Friday over the next several weeks so the road ahead looks treacherous for Tonto.Overseas, Lone Ranger opened in 24 markets representing only 30% of the international marketplace so it was not a full upfront roll-out. The weekend delivered $24.3M with a global take so far of $73.2M. Russia easily led with $6.6M while key markets Australia, Italy, and Korea were not impressive.The Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy cop comedy The Heat held up well in its second weekend taking in an estimated $25M slipping only 36% thanks to a potent combo of a holiday session plus solid buzz. With $86.4M so far, look for the Fox hit to reach $150M or more.Disney and Pixar’s Monsters University took a direct hit from the Minions tumbling 57% to an estimated $19.6M after spending back-to-back weekends at number one. Cume sits at $216.1M while the global tally crossed $400M. Brad Pitt captured an estimated $18.2M with the zombie thriller World War Z, off 39%, putting Paramount at $158.8M to date domestic and $366.2M worldwide.More action offerings followed for those moviegoers who wanted their fireworks on the big screen this weekend. Sony’s actioner White House Down dropped a reasonable 46% to an estimated $13.5M and $50.5M total. Man of Steel was still in eight-digit territory with an estimated $11.4M in its fourth round, down 45%, for a $271.2M sum. $300M domestic is still within reach.The standup comedy concert Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain made a sparkling debut with an estimated $10.1M from 876 theaters for a superb three-day average of $11,530. Since its Wednesday launch, the R-rated Lionsgate release has banked an impressive $17.5M after just five days. That’s already more than twice the $7.7M total gross from the comedian’s last concert pic Laugh at My Pain which played in under 300 theaters. The success of that low-budget hit opened the door to Explain getting a high profile holiday slot and triple the theaters and the gamble paid off.Sony’s doomsday comedy hit This is the End followed with an estimated $5.8M, off just 33%, for a $85.6M cume to date heading towards the century mark. Rounding out the top ten was the sleeper success Now You See Me which fell 51% to an estimated $2.8M giving Lionsgate $110.4M so far.As if ruling the holiday box office wasn’t enough, Steve Carell also made an impressive debut on the specialty scene with the indie comedy The Way, Way Back which opened to an estimated $575,000 from 19 theaters across eight markets for a potent $30,263 average for Fox Searchlight. The critically acclaimed summer vacation pic expands to most other major cities over the next two weeks.The top ten films grossed an estimated $218.3M which was up 23% from last year when The Amazing Spider-Man opened at number one with $62M; and up a healthy 55% from 2011 when Transformers: Dark of the Moon debuted in the top spot with $47.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Biopics, razzies, TV, Festival, A24, Teen, Lifetime, and, Academy, ABC, of, of, Con","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Despicable-Me-2-Crushes-Holiday-Weekend"},{"id":"47509117949689","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wolverine Tops Weekend with $55M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wolverine Tops Weekend with $55Mby Gitesh Pandya | July 29, 2013 |  CommentsHollywood’s latest super hero offering took command of the box office as Hugh Jackman’s return to Adamantium action in The Wolverine resulted in a number one opening. The popular Marvel character took in an estimated $55M from 3,924 locations for a solid $14,016 average. The debut was almost identical to the $55.1M debut of the franchise’s last film X-Men: First Class which opened in June 2011. That summer’s Thor and Captain America films bowed to about $65M a piece.It can be argued that Wolverine could have attracted a slightly larger audience given its more well-known character and marquee star. However, every action film this month has debuted at or below expectations following an endless number of action titles since the first week of May. The clawed hero did deliver the biggest live-action opening in over a month. The character’s last full feature was 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine which opened to $85.1M, but against zero competition. Bad will from that poorly-received film may have taken part of the fan base out of the equation this time around.Set mostly in Japan, The Wolverine played to an expected crowd that skewed towards adult males. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male and 58% was 25 and older. Reviews were generally positive and paying moviegoers liked the PG-13 film giving it a good A- CinemaScore grade.A massive global roll-out this weekend led to a big $86.1M international opening weekend from 101 territories for a powerful $141.1M worldwide launch. Most key markets opened this weekend though Japan will not release until September. The Wolverine cost a reported $120M to produce and had no expensive players outside of the lead actor.Horror smash The Conjuring followed its spectacular opening with a terrific second weekend with an estimated $22.1M boosting the ten-day total to an incredible $83.9M. Off only 47%, the Warner Bros. release enjoyed an unusually low decline for a fright film and continues to benefit from strong audience buzz. A final domestic gross of about $140M is likely – among the best in history for a scary movie. Conjuring cost only $20M to produce.Mega-toon Despicable Me 2 eased just 36% in its fourth round and cracked the triple-century mark with an estimated $16M for a cume to date of $306.4M for Universal. Gru’s audience love and longevity has taken some of the speed out of rival animated offering Turbo which nonetheless held up well in its sophomore lap with an estimated $13.3M, off just 38%. With $55.8M in 12 days, Fox’s final domestic total might end in the $90-100M range. Kid competition will ramp up starting this Wednesday with Smurfs 2.Sequels for grown ups followed. Adam Sandler’s Grown Ups 2 fell 42% to an estimated $11.5M for Sony putting the total at $101.7M – the bankable star’s 14th $100M+ domestic grosser. Lionsgate saw its action pic Red 2 take in an estimated $9.4M, down 48%, resulting in a $35.1M sum.Hoping to reach nine-digit territory, the sci-fi monster jam Pacific Rim collected an estimated $7.5M, down 53%, giving Warner Bros. $84M thus far on its way to $100M.Leggy cop comedy The Heat dipped only 26% to an estimated $6.9M raising the total to $141.2M for Fox. Universal’s R.I.P.D., Hollywood’s umpteenth action offering this summer, fell apart in its second weekend with an estimated $5.9M falling 54%. The pricey flop has banked a miserable $24.4M and should end with a dismal $35-40M, one of the most memorable failures of this year.Indie hit Fruitvale Station expanded nationwide and jumped into the top ten with a decent, but not spectacular showing. The Weinstein Co. release about the final day in the life of a young unarmed man shot and killed by the police grossed an estimated $4.7M from 1,064 locations for a mediocre $4,377 average. Total stands at $6.3M. Based on a true story, the urban drama attracted publicity for its similaritires to the killing of Trayvon Martin which has been a major news story over the last two years. But as with mainstream films, indie pics with dark and serious tones can often struggle to find a large audience in the summer when people crave lighter, more upbeat fare.Making a major splash on the specialty scene was Woody Allen with his latest comic creation, Blue Jasmine starring Cate Blanchett, which grossed an estimated $613,000 from only six theaters for a jaw-dropping $102,167 average per site. Sony Classics will continue to roll out the well-reviewed film in the weeks ahead as the actress attracts Oscar buzz.Opening to soft results was the indie comedy The To-Do List with an estimated $1.5M from 591 locations for a weak $2,597 average. The CBS Films release stars Aubrey Plaza as a high school nerd trying to lose her virginity.The top ten films grossed an estimated $152.3M which was up 23% from last year when The Dark Knight Rises remained at number one with $62.1M; but off 9% from 2011 when Cowboys &amp; Aliens opened in the top spot with $36.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Islander, thriller, SXSW, Premiere, Universal, Epix, Fire","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Wolverine-Tops-Weekend-with-55M"},{"id":"47509119443711","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Man of Steel Sets June Record","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Man of Steel Sets June RecordThis Is the End follows at #2, and Now You See Me holds on to #3.by Gitesh Pandya | June 16, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Superman was reborn at the box office as the big-budget gamble Man of Steel paid off handsomely with a spectacular opening weekend in North America plus impressive launches overseas in only a portion of the international marketplace. The Warner Bros. summer tentpole grossed an estimated $113.1M domestically, breaking the record for the biggest June opening ever. Adding in $12M from Thursday night group sales led by Walmart’s promotion for 7:00pm shows, the total stood at a stellar $125.1M. The Friday-to-Sunday portion for the PG-13 film averaged a muscular $26,879 from 4,207 theaters including 331 IMAX screens. Toy Story 3 held the June record since 2010 with $110.3M.The 3.5-day performance exceeded the extended seven-day holiday opening of 2006’s reboot Superman Returns which amounted to $108.1M during the week leading up to Independence Day. That mega-budgeted film eventually inched its way into the double century club ending with $200.1M but was seen as a creative and commercial disappointment which failed to lead to a new franchise being born. The new reboot may match the last one’s gross by the end of next weekend.Man of Steel was directed by Zack Snyder with Henry Cavill taking on the title role and also featured an Oscar-caliber cast including Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Michael Shannon and Laurence Fishburne. Christopher Nolan, who successfully rebooted the Batman franchise for the studio, produced Steel and lent much to the box office pull of the film. After getting the origin story out of the way in 2005’s Batman Begins, grosses soared even higher for the next two chapters leading to a $2.5 billion global trilogy, so it was crucial for Warner Bros. to relaunch Superman in a way that brought in the masses.Reviews were mixed but paying audiences gave the super hero flick an encouraging A- grade from CinemaScore. Friday debuted to $44.1M including $9M in midnight shows. Saturday fell an understandable 18% to $36.3M while Sunday was projected to dip by only 10% to $32.7M thanks to the Father’s Day holiday. Much of the film’s story involves Superman’s two dads from Krypton and Earth and how they molded him.Studio research showed that Man of Steel skewed towards men as expected with 56% being male. But that made for a better female turnout than usual for a comic book pic. Iron Man 3 and Avengers were both 61% male and last summer’s Spider-Man reboot played 58% male. The stronger cross-gender appeal could allow it to play well over the coming weeks especially with the Fourth of July holiday around the corner.3,350 theaters offered a 3D option with those screens accounting for 41% of the gross. With conversions, even for effects-driven action pictures, audiences nowadays typically prefer the original 2D version at regular prices instead. IMAX venues contributed 12% of the total gross with $13.3M and a sturdy average of $40,181 since Thursday night. Tickets cost as much as $21.50 to experience Man of Steel in IMAX 3D in New York City. Massive cross-promotions with brand partners helped to drive in business too for the event film.The international launch for Man of Steel was also quite strong even though many top markets open later. The weekend saw $71.6M from 24 markets led by the U.K., Mexico, and Korea which were the only majors to open this week. 27 new countries will launch next weekend including key territories like France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Russia and China so Man of Steel has much more ahead this summer. But so far, the first weekend delivered $196.7M in global sales.Opening far behind in second place was the new doomsday comedy This is the End with an estimated $20.5M over three days and $32.8M since its launch on Tuesday night with 7:00pm shows. It was a respectable opening for the Sony release especially considering the distraction Clark Kent had over the target audience of young men. Playing in 3,055 locations, the raunchy R-rated comedy starring Seth Rogen, James Franco, Danny McBride, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel averaged $6,710 over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The full gross was below the $41.3M five-day debut of Pineapple Express in August 2008 which was from many of the same team members.Reviews were very solid for End but the CinemaScore grade was a B+ which is commendable, not glowing. The road ahead features plenty of new action movies which will continue to lure in young men so it will not be easy. But Rogen and company hope that word-of-mouth will help it reach many more moviegoers over the weeks ahead, especially those who want a rowdy laugh and are all actioned out. Studio research showed that the crowd was 60% male and 52% over 25. With a $32M production budget and marketing costs not in the same league as summer tentpoles, the comedy should turn out to be a moneymaker regardless of how it plays overseas.Holding steady in third place was Lionsgate’s heist thriller Now You See Me with an estimated $10.3M, down 46%, for a robust cume to date of $80M. Now the top-grossing installment of the franchise, Universal’s Fast &amp; Furious 6 followed with an estimated $9.4M dropping 52% pushing the domestic tally to a muscular $219.6M. Worldwide, it’s also the highest-grossing Furious flick with a total now of $636.9M and still growing.Last week’s top film The Purge got beaten down tumbling a frightening 76% to an estimated $8.2M. The micro-budgeted $3M pic has nonetheless raked in a healthy $52M in ten days for Universal. The Fox comedy The Internship fell a troubling 60% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M putting the Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson pic at a disappointing $31M.Dropping 50% to an estimated $6M in its fourth round was the animated film Epic which has collected $95.4M to date for Fox. Star Trek Into Darkness followed with an estimated $5.7M, off 51%, for an impressive $210.5M for Paramount.The summer’s most notable flop so far, Will Smith’s critically panned father-son sci-fi adventure After Earth, crumbled 65% to an estimated $3.8M for a lousy $54.2M cume to date for the pricey $130M gamble. Flirting with the quadruple century mark, Iron Man 3 rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M in its seventh weekend, down 50%.

The Paramount franchise film had an extended release and grossed $70.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday period with a total of $84.1M since its start on Wednesday night in IMAX locations making for a debut that was smaller than its 2009 predecessor’s.The studio chose to make the highly anticipated 3D tentpole available to fans earlier via premium large-format screens. The release kicked off on Wednesday with about $2M in ticket sales from 336 higher-priced IMAX 3D screens with shows starting at 8:00pm. Thursday was the official full opening day with $11.5M in business. The figure was not too impressive, however the release date was changed very late in the game from Friday so not all moviegoers knew about the earlier debut. Friday jumped 91% to $22.1M, Saturday climbed another 25% to $27.5M and Sunday was estimated to drop 24% to $21M. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, the new Trek averaged $18,241 from 3,868 locations.Four years ago, Star Trek opened in a slightly different format. It was slotted into the second weekend of May with a Friday release kicking off with Thursday night shows in all theaters starting at 7:00pm. It had an IMAX release in 138 locations, but was all 2D. Its opening was $75.2M over the three-day period and $79.2M including $4M from Thursday night shows. Add in that film’s Monday gross to make a similar 4.5-day start, and its $86.7M was bigger than the $84.1M of Darkness despite the new chapter having higher 2D ticket prices plus 3D surcharges plus 200 additional IMAX screens.Studio research showed that the audience was 64% male and 73% 25 and older. A very high 16% of the gross ($13.5M) came from IMAX indicating that fans were willing to pay extra in this case given that about 30 minutes of the film were shot with those special cameras making for a premium experience. Overall, 45% of the gross came from 3D screens including IMAX.The underperforming numbers of Into Darkness were downright baffling. Paramount made a good product and picked a fine time to release it giving it two weeks distance from the summer’s other action tentpole Iron Man 3. Reviews were mostly positive (more than good enough for a sci-fi sequel) and audiences also liked the film with opening day ticket buyers giving an A grade from CinemaScore. The marketing push was strong and normal for May action tentpoles. 2009’s Star Trek not only opened well, it also had solid legs with 70% of its domestic business coming after the first weekend. Sequels to leggy blockbusters like these usually open bigger, especially if 3D is added in.Before the film’s release, Paramount openly predicted a $100M opening through Sunday. Studios routinely low-ball these forecasts so the final numbers end up looking like they are above expectations. So the performance was probably much lower than what the studio internally believed was likely.If internal factors were not to blame, it may have been external ones that were in play – namely competition and erosion of audience interest. Competition that the two Trek movies faced was almost identical, although allocated differently. The rest of the Top 15 films this weekend grossed $77M which was 10% more than the $70M that 2009’s Trek faced. Factor in four years of ticket price increases and the same number of people saw competing movies each time.But what was in fact different was how much the second and third place films dominated the rest of the marketplace while all other movies made chump change. In both years, the runnerup pic was a superhero flick (Iron Man 3 and 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine) and the third place film was a female-skewing pic (The Great Gatsby and 2009’s Ghosts of Girlfriends Past). This year’s duo grossed a stellar $58.6M, up a whopping 60% from 2009’s $36.7M. This weekend’s two holdovers were an awesome twosome that combined for the highest gross in box office history for the second and third place movies on the critical third weekend of May and they may have taken away some of Trek’s potential audience.Darkness also came out four years after the Star Trek reboot and some fans, especially those who are not die-hard ones, may have lost interest in the franchise during that gap. The first nine Star Trek films spanned two decades and never had a gap this big. 2002’s Nemesis came out after a four-year void, ended up as the lowest-grossing film in series history, and was credited with killing the franchise. Until J.J. Abrams rebooted it six and a half years later.Most franchises in recent years have not taken that much time off in between installments including Twilight, Harry Potter, Iron Man, Transformers, and the Star Wars prequels. Even newer ones like Hobbit and Hunger Games have told fans that they will get a new chapter every year. Last year, however, there were a pair of films that came out exactly four years after their last installments and opened bigger without even needing 3D – The Dark Knight Rises and Skyfall. Both were threequels to a reboot and followed sequels that were also very successful so audiences were more hooked to the brands. The love shown for 2009’s Star Trek could have been somewhat of an anomaly. It certainly brought in a broader more mainstream crowd, but many may have lost the excitement this time around especially with popular alternative options from Mr. Stark and Mr. Gatsby out there right now.This is not the first time this year that Paramount has found itself in this situation. March’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation was the follow-up to the studio’s summer 2009 hit The Rise of Cobra and also had a 3D upgrade and a shift in opening day from Friday to Thursday with Wednesday night previews. The new pic (with added starpower) opened to $51M over 4.5 days which did not match up to the $54.7M three-day opening of the 2D Cobra. The sequel is on track to end with $122M, short of the first film’s $150.2M, but is seeing much better numbers from overseas markets.The road ahead will be tricky for Into Darkness. It is well-liked for the most part and it has the Memorial Day holiday weekend on its second frame. But the core adult male audience will be tempted away with two more big sequels opening at the end of this week – Fast &amp; Furious 6 and The Hangover Part III. Also sci-fi sequels tend to draw the bulk of their audiences upfront, even if word-of-mouth is very good.Overall, Into Darkness is not likely to match the $257.7M final domestic gross of the last Star Trek. However, it still has a shot at $200M if it can hold up relatively well next weekend. Budgeted at $190M, the Kirk-and-Spock sequel will definitely see substantial growth on the international side as several key overseas markets have become much more lucrative since 2009.This weekend, the new Trek launched in 33 international markets and grossed an estimated $40M from those plus seven holdover territories that bowed last week. Cume outside of North America is $80.5M with the global gross at $164.6M. Russia led the new markets with $8M (quadruple the opening of the last Trek) while the U.K. led the holdovers with a $5.9M weekend and $24M total. Half of the international marketplace has yet to open so plenty of potential is ahead with debuts scheduled in China (May 28), Korea (May 30), France (June 12), Italy (June 13), Brazil (June 14), Spain (July 5) and Japan (August 23).Dropping a notch down to second place was two-time chart-topper Iron Man 3 which pulled in an estimated $35.2M in its third weekend of release. The Disney title declined by 52% which was not bad considering it had such direct competition to face with Trek’s launch playing to the same adult male action crowd. Marvel’s hit 3D threequel has now soared to a domestic cume of $337.1M putting it at number 25 on the list of All-Time Domestic Blockbusters and passing the $336.5M of 2007’s Spider-Man 3. Iron Man 3 is still on a trajectory to break the $400M mark.Overseas, the latest Tony Stark smash remained a key contender collecting an estimated $40.2M, although sales dropped by more than half from last weekend. Iron Man 3’s international total climbed to $736.2M propelling the global gross to a towering $1.07 billion on its way to about $1.3 billion. Currently, it sits at number nine among all-time worldwide hits.The lavish Leonardo DiCaprio drama The Great Gatsby enjoyed another big weekend grossing an estimated $23.4M in third place. The 53% decline was quite respectable considering the weak word-of-mouth, negative reviews, and huge upfront turnout last weekend. After ten days, the Baz Luhrmann film has raked in $90.2M driven by adult women and is already the studio’s top-grossing film this year. No third place film has ever grossed this much money on the third weekend of May and Gatsby’s success may have chipped away at some of Star Trek’s potential. DiCaprio hardly ever does sexy heartthrob roles any more so this rare turn is pulling in audiences despite mixed buzz on the quality of the picture.Following its debut on Wednesday as the opening night film of the Cannes Film Festival, The Great Gatsby rolled out across international markets and grossed a strong $42.1M from nearly 8,400 screens in 49 territories. Leading the way was Russia with $6.2M followed closely by the U.K. with $6.1M. Major markets still to come include the director’s Australia (May 30), Mexico (May 31), Brazil (June 7), and Japan (June 14).The rest of the top ten was filled with leftovers that attracted small crowds with each grossing in the rough range of $1-3M. Paramount’s Pain &amp; Gain dropped 38% to an estimated $3.1M for a cume to date of $46.6M. In its ninth weekend of being the only toon game in town, The Croods slipped only 24% to an estimated $2.8M boosting Fox’s total to a robust $176.8M. The cavepeople comedy will finally face competition next weekend with the studio’s own release of the animated adventure Epic.The baseball drama 42 followed with an estimated $2.7M, off 41%, giving Warner Bros. a solid $88.7M. Universal’s sci-fi offering Oblivion fell 47% to an estimated $2.2M giving the Tom Cruise film $85.5M so far domestically. International sales are now up to $173M putting the global gross at $258.5M.Adding some more screens in its fourth weekend was the indie hit Mud which grossed an estimated $2.16M sliding only 15%. Roadside Attractions has collected $11.6M with the rural tale on its way to the vicinity of $20M. The Tyler Perry-produced flop Peeples tumbled 53% in its sophomore round to an estimated $2.15M and a weak $7.9M to date. Rounding out the top ten was another Lionsgate release The Big Wedding with an estimated $1.1M, down 56%, for a $20.2M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $145.3M which was up 9% from last year when The Avengers remained at number one with $55.6M; but down 7% from 2011 when Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides opened in the top spot with $90.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Christmas, Netflix, lord, who, star, films, Premium, Sundance, Awards, drama, streaming","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Star-Trek-Softer-Than-Expected-at-1"},{"id":"47509119429371","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Carell &amp; Sandler Sequels Rule Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Carell &amp; Sandler Sequels Rule Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | July 14, 2013 |  CommentsHumor was in demand as A-list funnymen Steve Carell and Adam Sandler dominated the box office with their hit sequels Despicable Me 2 and Grown Ups 2, respectively, while the raunchy laughs of The Heat with Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCarthy also finished among the top four movies for the frame. The big-budget sci-fi actioner Pacific Rim opened in third and helped lead another weekend when ticket sales were substantially ahead of last year’s.Staying at number one for a second weekend, Despicable Me 2 delivered a solid sophomore frame with an estimated $44.8M dropping only 46%. The toon smash has now amassed a staggering $229.2M and could be on its way to doing $350M or more from North America alone. By next weekend, it will surpass the $251.5M domestic total of its 2010 predecessor.The Minions continued to win over audiences around the world too. The international marketplace took in a hefty $55.5M from 50 markets boosting the offshore sum to $243.2M and the global tally to $472.4M and rising quickly. By midweek, the worldwide haul will crush the half-billion mark.Adam Sandler scored another box office hit, this time with his first-ever sequel, as the comedy Grown Ups 2 debuted close behind in second place with an estimated $42.5M. The Sony release averaged a sturdy $12,174 from 3,491 locations with no help from 3D. That edged out the $40.5M debut of its 2010 predecessor which went on to finish with $162M domestically. Grown Ups 2 tied last fall’s animated hit Hotel Transylvania for Sander’s second biggest opening weekend ever trailing only the $47.6M of 2005’s The Longest Yard.The funnyman’s live-action films since the first Grown Ups ranged from disappointing to pathetic at the box office indicating that fans may have tired of his brand of humor. But the sequel opened at the high end of Sandler’s usual first weekend range cementing his status as one of the most reliable box office draws in the business. He is well on his way to having his 14th $100M+ domestic grosser over the past 15 years.Grown Ups 2 – which also brought back Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Salma Hayek – skewed 53% female giving that audience a funny and light alternative to the macho action fare. 54% was under 25. Reviews were among the worst of the year which is usually the case with Sandler’s films. They don’t win over critics, but they do sell to mainstream moviegoers looking for light-hearted fun that requires no thinking. The CinemaScore grade was a mediocre B.Opening in third place was the sci-fi actioner Pacific Rim with an estimated $38.3M from 3,275 theaters for a good $11,695 average. That was about even with the $37.1M bow of April’s futuristic thriller Oblivion with Tom Cruise. Both were sci-fi action pics not based on known brands which also had 3D and IMAX contributing. Oblivion was star-driven but Pacific had a prime summer slot. District 9 from the summer of 2009 opened to a similar $37.4M.Ordinarily this would be a very strong opening for an original action film with no major box office stars. However, Pacific Rim carried an enormous budget, reportedly in the $200M range, so it will take a long road to reach break-even. Directed by Guillermo del Toro, Rim tells the story of a time in the near future when humans build humungous robots to do battle with alien monsters on a mission to exterminate Earth’s inhabitants.Reviews were very positive and the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A- which was the same as for other summer action flicks like Man of Steel, White House Down, and The Heat. This might indicate a good road ahead, although fanboy pics typically draw their main audience upfront. Studio research showed that males made up 61% of the crowd while 53% were over 25. The special effects were a big draw as 19% of the gross came from IMAX screens and 50% overall came from the 3D format. That share represented the highest of any film in that format this summer.About half of the international marketplace opened Pacific Rim this weekend with $53M collected from 38 markets for a global debut of $91.3M. Most, but not all, markets were impressive led by $9.6M in Korea and $9.3M in Russia. More key markets are to come including France and Germany next weekend and China, which could be a huge one for an IMAX film like this, on July 31.Enjoying the best hold in the top ten was the Sandra Bullock-Melissa McCarthy comedy hit The Heat which grossed an estimated $14M in its third weekend, off 44%. The Fox release surged to $112.4M becoming the sixth live-action $100M+ domestic grosser for Bullock and third for McCarthy in a major role.Disney contributed the next two films. The mega-budgeted adventure The Lone Ranger tanked in its second frame with an estimated $11.1M falling a steep 62%. That was especially troubling considering that the opening day did not fall on the first frame’s Friday-to-Sunday take. The Johnny Depp misfire should end its domestic run just under the $100M mark. Overseas grosses are not exactly on fire. Only $48M has been collected so far from 33 markets representing a third of the overall foreign marketplace with the worldwide figure at just $119.1M. Additional major territories don’t open until August.Among suppliers, the studio is seeing much better results from Pixar than from Jerry Bruckheimer. The toon sequel Monsters University declined by 46% to an estimated $10.6M in its fourth round pushing the total to $237.8M. The global score has risen to $474.2M on its way to over $600M.Hunk-led disaster movies followed. Brad Pitt’s zombie thriller World War Z fell 49% to an estimated $9.4M while Channing Tatum’s White House Down dropped 54% to an estimated $6.2M. Totals are $177.1M for Paramount and $63M for Sony.Standup concert film Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain followed with an estimated $5M, off 50%, giving Lionsgate $26.4M to date. Rounding out the top ten was the superhero smash Man of Steel which tumbled 58% to an estimated $4.8M putting Warner Bros. at $281M thus far. A final in the $290-295M range should result.In the limited release scene, The Weinstein Co. attracted sensational business to its Sundance winner Fruitvale Station which bowed in just seven sites to an estimated $377,000 for a scorching $53,857 average. Reviews have been terrific and Oscar buzz is already growing. The Hindi film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag debuted to an estimated $670,000 from 139 theaters for a $4,820 average for distributor Reliance Entertainment. Indie comedy hit The Way, Way Back expanded from 19 to 79 locations and grossed an estimated $1.1M for a solid $14,051 average. With $1.9M to date, Fox Searchlight will expand to nearly 300 theaters on Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $186.7M which was up 25% from last year when Ice Age: Continental Drift opened at number one with $46.6M; but down 25% from 2011 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 debuted in the top spot with a record $169.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, directors, Academy, psychological, comedy, TV, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Carell-and-Sandler-Sequels-Rule-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509117944567","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Elysium Tops Crowded List of Newcomers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Elysium Tops Crowded List of Newcomersby RT Staff | August 12, 2013 |  CommentsNorth American multiplexes were hit with a traffic jam as four new wide releases took all the leading spots with the top ten beating out both last weekend’s and last year’s numbers. Leading the way with a number one debut was the sci-fi action thriller Elysium starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster which opened to $30.5M from 3,284 locations for a good $9,287 average. Considering the original story, R rating, and the fact that 14 other summer action films came before it, the debut was respectable though not stellar.The opening came in below the $37.4M of director Neill Blomkamp’s debut feature film District 9 which released around the same time on the calendar three years ago, but with no stars and a fraction of the production budget. That film won rave reviews, hot buzz out of Comic Con, and eventually an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Sony acquired worldwide rights for Elysium for $115M. It’s been a tough summer for the studio with After Earth, White House Down, and The Smurfs 2 all underperforming. Comedies This is the End and Grown Ups 2 have done well though.The futuristic film lacked female appeal which held back some of its potential. Hollywood has bombarded summer audiences with 15 action titles since early May and this weekend a comedy like We’re the Millers proved to be a better option for many adult couples looking for a fun time at the movies. Studio research showed that a high 61% of the crowd was male and 52% was under 30. IMAX sales were solid, though.Despite generally positive reviews, paying audiences were not too jazzed by Elysium as the CinemaScore grade was only a B. That was the same grade earned earlier this summer by After Earth and The Hangover Part III which both fell by more than 60% in the second weekend. In fact, the only action film this summer to score a lower grade was the universally-panned R.I.P.D. with its C+. Among this year’s original sci-fi action pics, Elysium debuted below Oblivion and Pacific Rim which each opened to $37M and change. But those were both PG-13 so given the rating difference, it was not too much weaker. Since May, action films have generally been good, but not amazing. And amazing is what many moviegoers need in order to open their wallets at this point.Jennifer Aniston scored the seventh $25M+ opening of her career in a major role with the new comedy We’re the Millers which debuted strongly in second place with an estimated $26.6M over the weekend and a hefty $38M since its Wednesday launch. The Warner Bros. release averaged a potent $8,146 over three days from 3,260 locations. Critics slammed the R-rated comedy about a fake family trying to smuggle pot into the country from Mexico, however regular audiences felt differently. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A- as those looking for raunchy summer laughs that don’t require much thinking were satisfied with what they paid for.Millers benefited from solid cross-gender appeal as studio research showed that males made up 51% while the overall skew was towards mature adults with 61% being over 25. Aniston has been a bankable actress over the years and her starpower trumped the bad reviews as the film has no other star with a proven box office track record. Millers may just become the sixth $100M+ domestic grosser of her career, fifth among major roles.Landing in third with a respectable bow was Disney’s animated film Planes with an estimated $22.5M from 3,702 locations for a $6,085 average. It was the best opening among all the kidpics released since the juggernaut Despicable Me 2, but was not an especially impressive turnout. The PG-rated film was heavily marketed as being connected to Pixar’s Cars franchise even though it was made by filmmakers from the direct-to-DVD world. Planes earned an A- CinemaScore which is common for toons and had limited appeal beyond the core family crowd.Another new kidpic followed with a similar gross, though it needed five days to reach it. Fox’s fantasy sequel Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters debuted to an estimated $14.6M over the weekend and $23.5M since its Wednesday bow. The five-day debut was down a troubling 39% from the four-day holiday bow of its 2010 predecessor Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians. With weak reviews, a glut of mediocre titles for kids, and a moderate B+ CinemaScore grade, the PG-rated film did not attract huge sales. The effects-driven pic averaged only $4,817 from 3,031 theaters.Consistently bankable Denzel Washington suffered a drop that was larger than usual for his latest action pic 2 Guns which fell 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $11.1M. Incoming competition from the many new releases hurt all films but this Universal release also has seen audience buzz that was mediocre and not stellar. With $48.5M, look for 2 Guns to finish with about $75-80M. Fellow sophomore The Smurfs 2 declined by 46% to an estimated $9.5M and has given Sony a disappointing $46.6M after 12 days. The final tally might end at around $70M which would be half of what its 2011 predecessor made.Tumbling 63% to an estimated $8M was The Wolverine which has banked $112M so far for Fox. The spooky smash The Conjuring grossed an estimated $6.7M in its fourth weekend, down 49%, for a cume of $120.7M for Warner Bros.The latest hits from a pair of A-list funnymen rounded out the top ten. Steve Carell’s monster blockbuster Despicable Me 2 ranked ninth with an estimated $5.7M, off 44%, for a domestic haul of $338.3M. The Universal sensation also watched its international cume soar to $407.5M while the worldwide tally hit $745.8M. Breaking $800M will be simple as key markets like Russia, Korea, and Italy are still to open between now and October. Adam Sandler’s first sequel Grown Ups 2 fell 53% to an estimated $3.7M putting Sony at $123.8M to date.On the specialty scene, UTV’s action-comedy Chennai Express broke the record for the biggest Bollywood opening ever with an estimated $2.2M from 196 locations for a $11,352 average. Cume since the Thursday launch is $2.5M. Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine expanded well again with an estimated $2.5M from 119 sites for a $21,202 average and $6.2M sum for Sony Classics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.9M which was up 8% from last year when The Bourne Legacy debuted at number one with $38.1M; and up 3% from 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes remained in the top spot with $27.8M.Follow Gitesh on the Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"screenings, Month","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Elysium-Tops-Crowded-List-of-Newcomers"},{"id":"47509117946616","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2 Guns Shoots Its Way to the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2 Guns Shoots Its Way to the TopPlus, The Smurfs 2 stumbles into third.by Gitesh Pandya | August 4, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg seized the number one spot at the North American box office with their new action thriller 2 Guns, which opened to an estimated $27.4M. Universal’s seventh top spot debut of the year averaged a solid $9,045 from 3,025 locations and ended up in the mid-20s range where so many of Washington’s films have opened before. It was an impressive bow given that the film was rated R, was not part of a well-known brand, and arrived as the 14th action movie of the summer. Audiences have had a plethora of choices in this genre lately and no action movie has overperformed since World War Z in mid-June.Earning mixed reviews, 2 Guns played to a broad audience of older adults. Studio research showed that cross-gender appeal was substantial with females taking a slight edge at 51% while those over 25 made up a very high 77% of the audience. The CinemaScore grade was a mediocre B+ so buzz is not anything too special. The undercover cop pic cost $61M to produce.For Washington, 2 Guns delivered the fifth best opening of his career and now his top eight debuts are all for R-rated pictures. While he doesn’t do mega-budgeted tentpoles, the Oscar winner has been among the most bankable and reliable box office draws in the film industry over the last decade. In fact, over the last thirteen years, 14 of his 15 films have opened above $20M and none were sequels. 2003’s Out of Time was the sole exception with a $16.2M debut and this does not count his two directorial efforts which featured him in supporting roles. When Denzel Washington picks a project to star in, audiences know they will be entertained. This consistency is especially remarkable given that the actor turns 60 next year. Stars of this age rarely keep headlining hits.The superhero flick The Wolverine dropped down to second place in its sophomore session with an estimated $21.7M falling 59% in the process. The drop fell between the 61% suffered by 2011’s Captain America at the same point in the summer and the 56% of X-Men: First Class from early June that same season. All were based on Marvel characters. The decline was much smaller than the awful 69% tumble that the much-despised X-Men Origins: Wolverine had in May 2009. Hugh Jackman’s latest turn as the clawed mutant has collected $95M in its first ten days, putting it just below the $98M of First Class over the same span. Produced for $120M, look for The Wolverine to end its domestic run at about the $140M mark.Hollywood’s rocky summer saw another casualty of war open in third place. The kidpic sequel The Smurfs 2 debuted to an estimated $18.2M over the weekend and $27.8M since its Wednesday bow. Even the extended five-day launch came in below the three-day opening of the first Smurfs movie which was also in late July with $35.6M two years ago. Competition was a factor as the leggy Despicable Me 2 was still in eight-digit territory in its fifth weekend while the DreamWorks toon Turbo took away a bit of the family audience too. Parents and kids have had more than their fair share of movies this summer and more new choices are not in demand.Smurfs 2 earned an A- CinemaScore grade which is common for family flicks, however reviews were negative across the board. Insults from critics do not always affect the box office of these types of films, as evidenced by the Alvin and the Chipmunks trilogy, which grossed over $1.1 billion worldwide. Smurfette and her gang are counting on overseas markets to bring in the coin since the last Smurfs movie made a whopping $564M globally with 75% coming from international. The sequel fared better abroad this weekend with an estimated $52.5M from 43 territories for a global opening of $80.3M. Sony reported that the overseas bow was off just 4% from its predecessor with Russia and the U.K. leading the way this weekend with number one debuts of $5.4M and $5.1M respectively.The runaway blockbuster The Conjuring smashed the $100M mark this weekend and continued to hold up well with an estimated $13.7M in its third scare. Off 39%, the Warner Bros. release has now grossed an amazing $108.6M while costing only $20M to produce. The supernatural thriller has become that rare summer film that doesn’t need to rely on international success to become a moneymaker. A final gross of $140-150M is likely from North America alone for the crowdpleasing haunted house flick.Toon behemoth Despicable Me 2 became the first movie this summer to spend five weekends in the top five as it captured another $10.4M, according to estimates, declining by just 37%. The Universal smash’s amazing staying power has resulted in a gold mine for the studio, but competing kidpics over the past month have taken a beating at the multiplexes. The latest Gru pic has amassed a staggering $326.7M making it the year’s second biggest blockbuster in North America after Iron Man 3. The overseas gross surged to $387M putting the worldwide gross at a towering $713.7M on its way past $800M with Russia still to come.Adam Sandler’s latest nine-digit hit Grown Ups 2 followed with an estimated $8.1M in its fourth round, down only 30%, for a $116.4M cume for Sony. The original toon Turbo got hit hard by the arrival of Papa Smurf and company, falling 53% to an estimated $6.4M. The Fox release upped its sum to $69.5M and looks unlikely to reach the $100M mark.Dropping 40% to an estimated $5.7M was the action sequel Red 2 which has banked a not-so-impressive $45.2M to date for Lionsgate. Fox’s sleeper hit The Heat enjoyed another low decline slipping just 32% to an estimated $4.7M with a remarkable $149.6M overall. Rounding out the top ten was the sci-fi pic Pacific Rim with an estimated $4.6M, down 41%, giving Warner Bros. a $93M domestic cume. It also rocked China with a five-day opening of roughly $45M driven by 3D and IMAX success propelling the overseas cume past $200M and the global tally to $293.4M on its way to over $400M worldwide with some key markets still to come.Following its sensational platform bow in six locations last weekend, Woody Allen’s latest film Blue Jasmine enjoyed a good expansion to 50 theaters resulting in an estimated $2M frame for a potent $40,440 average. The Sony Classics cume stands at $3M with another round of cities to launch next weekend. Elsewhere on the indie scene, Fox Searchlight’s comedy The Way, Way Back slipped only 17% to an estimated $2.9M for a solid $13.7M total. The Weinstein Co. saw its Fruitvale Station drop 41% to an estimated $2.7M with $11M overall. Both films are playing in just over 1,000 theaters.With the final month of the summer movie season starting, studio offerings from mid-season are winding down their domestic runs. Current totals for recent big-budget offerings include $258.6M for Monsters University, $195.9M for World War Z, $86.7M for The Lone Ranger, and a lousy $30.4M for R.I.P.D.The top ten films grossed an estimated $120.8M which was up 8% from last year when The Dark Knight Rises remained at number one with $35.7M; but down 22% from 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes opened in the top spot with $54.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"scene, Best, Black, awards, spain, Infographic, directors, the, Pictures, cars, nightmare, PlayStation, boxing, Golden, Christmas","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-2-Guns-Shoots-Its-Way-to-the-Top"},{"id":"47509119449858","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious Leads Record Memorial Day","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Furious Leads Record Memorial Dayby Gitesh Pandya | May 27, 2013 |  CommentsMoviegoers gorged themselves on high-profile sequels powering the North American box office to a record-breaking Memorial Day frame with the top ten films grossing over $250M during just the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the long weekend. The marketplace expanded to incredible levels making for one of the five biggest overall box office weekends ever.The busy frame was led by the high-octane opening of the action smash Fast &amp; Furious 6 which generated the best debut in its 12-year franchise history with an estimated $98.5M over the three-day portion of the holiday frame. Starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Dwayne Johnson, the latest PG-13 installment averaged a muscular $26,927 from 3,658 theaters with no help from any 3D gimmickry. Universal is projecting an eye-popping four-day holiday opening of $122M.Since Diesel’s return to the popular series with 2009’s Fast &amp; Furious (the fourth pic), the opening weekends and final grosses have risen sharply with every new chapter. Producers know to add something new each time to keep customers interested. Instead of franchise fatigue, audiences have become even more excited and international audiences have been contributing more and more. The last film, Fast Five from April 2011, opened to $86.2M on its way to a $209.8M domestic final and $629M worldwide total – all franchise highs. Part 6 is now looking to beat all of those marks. The well-liked Five’s good will is paying dividends now.Three of the four biggest opening weekends in company history for Universal are from the last three Fast installments. So not only is this a critical franchise for the studio, it’s also one that is still growing bigger which bodes well for the years to come.From day one in June 2001, the series has invested in ethnically diverse casts which has broadened the consumer base. Sales from urban youth have always been key. And appeal has been strong with women too. This weekend’s audience breakdown showed a 49% female crowd which is incredibly high for a macho action sequel. 57% were age 25 or older and 32% were Latino. Reviews were generally good and the CinemaScore grade for the $160M budgeted film was a solid A. The ending of the sixquel even sets up the new cast addition for part 7 which is already slated to open on July 11 next summer.Overseas, Furious grossed a whopping $158M this weekend from 59 markets upping the cume to $177M including the U.K. which opened strong a week earlier. Worldwide is $275.5M and rising rapidly with many new franchise records being set. Australia is still to open in June followed by China and Japan in July. By the end of this week, the franchise six-pack will race past the $2 billion cumulative mark.Suffering the opposite franchise trajectory was The Hangover Part III which opened in second place with an estimated $42.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday period which was half of what its predecessor did over the same holiday weekend two years ago. Both sequels opened on the Thursday before Memorial Day weekend although III was moved from a Friday release just recently so not all fans knew it was available earlier. The new chapter grossed $54.2M from Thursday-to-Sunday, down 54% from II. Though a huge commercial blockbuster, the second part was widely criticized by audiences as being a lazy copy of the first film’s plot and that prompted many to lose interest in a third entry.Over three days, the Hangover finale averaged $11,931 from 3,555 locations. Part II was powered by the good will of the first Hangover pic from the summer of 2009 and bowed to a stellar $135M over five days. Part III may not even reach that amount by the end of its run. The 2011 film went on its way to $254.5M domestically and $581.5M worldwide. Reviews were once again negative on the latest sequel and audiences gave a lukewarm B grade from CinemaScore. Overseas, Part III opened at number one in three markets – the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand – grossing $19.2M. Unlike domestic, most international markets will get a one week gap between the Hangover and Furious sequels with over 50 territories launching Part III next weekend.Star Trek Into Darkness fell from its number one spot but held up well in its sophomore frame given the intense competition. The Friday-to-Sunday gross dropped 46% to an estimated $38M pushing the cume up to $146.8M. After opening below expectations, the Paramount release is benefiting from good word-of-mouth with a decline that was commendable for a sci-fi sequel. The domestic gross now has a chance of ending up in the vicinity of $225M (helped by 3D) which would be not far from the $257.7M of its predecessor. International rose to $102.1M and the worldwide take stands at $248.9M with major markets China and Korea to open next weekend. Those are the two highest-grossing overseas markets for another effects-heavy May actioner, Iron Man 3.The animated adventure Epic did not fail and scored with family audiences opening to an estimated $34.2M from 3,882 theaters for a $8,810 average. The PG-rated film had young kids all to itself and is expected to pull in about $44M over the four-day holiday span. Studios have not been serving up enough options for families this year as Epic is the first animated film since March’s The Croods which is now in its tenth weekend of release, and still in the top ten. Both were released by Fox. Reviews were generally good for the leaf people pic and the A CinemaScore grade bodes well for the road ahead especially since the next kidpic doesn’t arrive until June 21 with Pixar’s Monsters University. Epic opened in 20 new international markets this weekend with $23.1M lifting the overseas cume to $44M and the early global take to $78.2M with 26 additional territories launching next weekend.Dropping 46% to fifth place was the year’s biggest hit Iron Man 3 which pulled in an estimated $19.4M in its fourth weekend. The Marvel smash upped its cume to $367.5M putting it at number 22 on the list of All-Time Domestic Blockbusters right behind the $373.4M of 2004’s Spider-Man 2. Disney’s megahit is now the fifth biggest global blockbuster of all-time with a jaw-dropping $1.14 billion, 68% from international markets.Leonardo DiCaprio scored the eighth $100M blockbuster of his career with The Great Gatsby which ranked sixth. The Warner Bros. pic grossed an estimated $13.7M, down 43%, giving the lavish film a solid $114.4M to date. Despite weak reviews and a lackluster audience score, Gatsby has been holding up well against all the competition in part due to an audience of mature women not as interested in the other major offerings. The global gross hit $200M this weekend.The rest of the top ten featured films taking in small morsels. Indie hit Mud eased just 14% to an estimated $1.9M while losing some screens. The Roadside Attractions release has grossed $14.5M to date. Warner Bros. saw its baseball hit 42 take in an estimated $1.2M, off 56%, for a $91M cume.With families flocking to a new toon, The Croods tumbled 60% to an estimated $1.2M making for a total of $179.6M for Fox. The Tom Cruise sci-fi drama Oblivion took in an estimated $815,000, down 65%, with a total tally of $87.3M for Universal. Worldwide sums are $565.6M and $266.8M, respectively.The Ethan Hawke-Julie Delpy indie drama Before Midnight platformed to sensational results thanks to a built-in audience and stellar reviews. Sony Classics opened the pic in New York, Los Angeles, and Austin and grossed an estimated $274,000 from only five locations for a sizzling $54,800 average. Midnight expands out to about 30 total theaters next weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $251.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday span which was up a stunning 90% from last year when Men in Black 3 opened at number one with $54.6M; and up 18% from 2011’s record holiday when The Hangover Part II debuted in the top spot with $85.9M.Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up — follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Box, VICE, Fox, TCA, indie, shows, Trailer, saw, batman, Hulu, spanish, Amazon, adventure, Paramount","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Furious-Leads-Record-Memorial-Day"},{"id":"47509121142539","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Croods, Olympus Drive March Madness","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Croods, Olympus Drive March Madnessby Gitesh Pandya | March 24, 2013 |  CommentsThe North American box office enjoyed a spring surge as two new films both scored terrific debuts bringing in business from different audiences. Families led the way driving the animated comedy The Croods to the top spot while the violent action thriller Olympus Has Fallen opened with authority in second place with better than expected results. Add in hot holdover Oz the Great and Powerful and it was a rare March weekend that saw three films gross north of $20M a piece.DreamWorks Animation, and new distribution partner Fox, had much to celebrate as The Croods bowed at number one with an estimated $44.7M. That was on par with recent March non-sequel toons like How to Train Your Dragon ($43.7M in 2010), Rio ($39.2M in 2011), and the 2D Horton Hears a Who ($45M in 2008) and much better than the performance of the last effort from DreamWorks Rise of the Guardians. That holiday season offering debuted to $23.8M over three days and $32.3M across five days over last Thanksgiving’s holiday frame. Reaching $103.2M total from North America, it caused concern over whether the powerhouse animation factory was losing its touch and producing too much content. The studio has now had three 3D toons over the last nine months.Croods didn’t have an A-list voice actor like Steve Carell or Jim Carrey from Horton and was not part of a top brand with a built-in audience like last year’s The Lorax so the performance was encouraging. Plus the road ahead looks bright for a number of reasons. Easter holidays will give children plenty of time off over the coming two weeks so the target audience will be very available – not only on the weekends but during weekdays too. Croods earned a great A grade from CinemaScore meaning consumers are liking the entertainment on screen so word-of-mouth should be good. Plus, there are no other big-ticket options for kids opening for the rest of March and April so the cavepeople flick will have its audience to itself for a while. Expect good legs here as reaching $170M domestic is possible.Featuring the voices of Nicolas Cage, Emma Stone, and Ryan Reynolds, the PG-rated toon averaged a sturdy $11,048 from 4,046 theaters. Friday kicked off with $11.6M, Saturday surged an impressive 63% to $18.9M, and the studio is estimating a 25% dip to $14.2M on Sunday. The weekend gross ended up in the middle of the same $40-50M neighborhood as the top toons from the last nine months like Hotel Transylvania ($42.5M), Ice Age: Continental Drift ($46.6M), and Wreck-it Ralph ($49M).DreamWorks will be hoping for the kind of legs witnessed by its March 2010 hit Dragon which was seen as a disappointment after its first weekend but then went on to show amazing longevity that resulted in a final domestic take of $217.6M, five times its opening. Croods and Dragon both earned the same grade from CinemaScore, though critics were much more impressed by the latter. Reviews were good for Croods, but not glowing. 3D screens accounted for 38% of the gross, up slightly from the 35% for Guardians. Females made up 57% of the audience while 55% was 25 and older.Worldwide, Croods raked in a towering $108M with $63.3M (including previews) coming from 47 international markets representing 60% of the overseas marketplace. Russia, a red hot market for Hollywood animation, led the way with a superb $12.9M start (74% from 3D screens) followed by Mexico’s $9.5M and the United Kingdom’s $8.3M. The prehistoric family was number one in 44 of those markets this weekend and will open in 19 additional territories next weekend for Easter. With school holidays coming up around the world, and overseas audiences more willing to pay 3D surcharges, the long-term outlook is incredibly promising.Gerard Butler scored his first hit in three years with the presidential kidnapping thriller Olympus Has Fallen which opened in second place with a muscular $30.5M, according to estimates. The R-rated action film about the White House being seized by North Korean terrorists averaged a stellar $9,845 from 3,098 locations and delivered the actor’s second biggest debut ever after the $70.9M of his career-making role in 300. Olympus also gave distributor FilmDistrict its best opening ever.In a year when action films have been underperforming in almost every case, Olympus generated genuine audience excitement and brought out ticket buyers. Reviews were mixed and didn’t help much. Audiences responded instead to the intriguing concept, effective marketing materials, and starpower with Butler back into a gritty hero role joined by Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and Aaron Eckhart. A dose of patriotism added to the success too. Those polled by CinemaScore liked what they paid for as the grade was an encouraging A-.Adult men made up the largest demographic group for Olympus. Studio data showed that 53% was male and 73% was over 25. The opening weekend was especially impressive considering that the action film had to compete with the start of the NCAA college basketball tournament which has been attracting strong ratings everyday all weekend long.Following its two-week reign atop the charts, the megahit Oz the Great and Powerful dropped down to third place but still posted a solid showing with an estimated $22M in business. The Disney smash declined by 47% which was not bad considering all the competition that entered the marketplace this weekend. With $177.6M to date, Oz has captured an additional $178.8M overseas for a potent $356.4M global gross to date with sales split evenly between North America and the rest of the world for this very American story.The kidnapping thriller The Call ranked fifth dropping 49% to an estimated $8.7M for Sony. Halle Berry’s hit film has banked an impressive $30.9M in ten days and could finish with roughly $50M.Moviegoers had little interest in the new comedy from Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, Admission, which debuted to soft results in fifth with an estimated $6.4M. The Focus release averaged a weak $2,984 from 2,160 locations and was hurt by bad reviews which Fey’s more upscale fan base pays attention to. A dull B- CinemaScore indicates a rocky road ahead. Rudd has also struggled at the box office with his film Wanderlust with Jennifer Aniston flopping last spring with a puny $6.5M debut. With bigger options all doing well with adult women right now, Admission faced intense competition and failed to stand out as a must-see film.After a scorching hot platform debut last weekend, Spring Breakers expanded nationwide and landed in the top ten but saw sales slump to just passable levels. The Selena Gomez-Vanessa Hudgens pic grossed an estimated $5M from 1,104 theaters for a lukewarm $4,529 average. Co-starring James Franco – who has two films in the top ten this weekend with Oz seeing much more cash – the R-rated drama has collected $5.4M for distributor A24 and has earned good reviews.Tumbling a troubling 58% in its second weekend, the comedy flop The Incredible Burt Wonderstone grossed an estimated $4.3M for a weak ten-day tally of $17.4M. The Warner Bros. release should end up with a disappointing $25M or so. The studio’s big-budget fairy tale adventure Jack the Giant Slayer also fell sharply dropping 53% to an estimated $3M for only $59.1M to date.The hit comedy Identity Thief followed with an estimated $2.5M, off 43%, for a $128M cume to date. Dwayne Johnson’s first of many 2013 releases Snitch rounded out the top ten falling 45% to an estimated $1.9M and a nice sum of $40.3M for Lionsgate. The wrestler-turned-action-star is now on week five of what could turn out to be a 20-week consecutive streak in the top ten. Next up, G.I. Joe Retaliation attacking over 3,500 theaters Thursday with the first shows at 7:00pm this Wednesday.Some solid debuts occurred in the specialty marketplace. The critically-acclaimed Australian girl-group pic The Sapphires debuted in four locations with an estimated $41,000 for a $10,232 average. The Weinstein Co. will roll out the PG-13 film into more markets this spring. Also getting raves from critics, My Brother the Devil bowed to an estimated $12,000 from a pair of New York sites for a $6,070 average. Released by Paladin and 108 Media, the Sundance award winner expands next to Los Angeles on April 5.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129M which was down 36% from last year when The Hunger Games opened at number one with a record $152.5M; but up 23% from 2011 when Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules debuted in the top spot with $23.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mudbound, italian, Wars","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Croods-Olympus-Drive-March-Madness"},{"id":"47509119456005","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 3 Soars Above the Rest","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 3 Soars Above the RestTony Stark and company have one of the biggest opening weekends in history.by Gitesh Pandya | May 5, 2013 |  CommentsTony Stark obliterated the competition as the much-anticipated super hero sequel Iron Man 3 generated the second biggest opening weekend in box office history and also became the top-grossing global blockbuster of 2013. Domestic audiences spent a jaw-dropping $175.3M this weekend, according to estimates, seeing the third installment in the Marvel franchise including grosses from Thursday night shows starting at 9:00pm. Playing in 4,253 theaters, the PG-13 actioner averaged a scorching $41,218 per location and was helped by surcharges for the 3D conversion.9% of the weekend gross ($16.5M) came from the 326 higher-priced IMAX screens. Overall, 45% of the frame came from 3D screens representing a drop from The Avengers which was 52% a year ago this same weekend. That Marvel assembly of super heroes still holds the all-time record for opening weekend with a staggering $207.4M putting Robert Downey Jr. in the two biggest debuts in industry history. Both films were released by Disney on the first weekend of May kicking off the summer movie season against zero competition.Iron Man 3‘s gargantuan run started off with $15.6M in Thursday night shows from 9:00pm into the post-midnight hours. The full opening day gross (including all Thursday night business) was $68.3M. That stands as the eighth best opening day ever. The real magic for the Stark-vs-Mandarin pic came on Saturday when the film declined by only 9% to $62.2M. By comparison, last year Avengers witnessed a larger 14% dip on Saturday coming off of a Friday gross that did not include Thursday night business starting so early. Iron Man 2‘s Saturday drop was 11%.With threequels usually eroding faster than their predecessors – especially when release weekends are identical – it was extraordinary that Iron Man 3 held up so well in its second day. Disney projected that Sunday would drop by 28% to $44.8M. Sunday falls for Avengers and Iron Man 2 were 18% and 32%, respectively.Iron Man 2 was seen as disappointing creatively by many fans and normally that would have prompted some of the audience to skip out on another chapter in the series. However, Avengers was so well-liked that it erased that bad taste and even expanded the overall fan base which Iron Man 3 capitalized on this weekend. Word of mouth is good so far as the CinemaScore grade was an A and also reviews have been fairly positive. Avengers scored higher in both categories, however for a threequel to earn these marks is terrific and bodes well for the weeks ahead. The next big action tentpole is Star Trek Into Darkness opening on IMAX on May 15 and in conventional theaters on Thursday May 16 so Iron Man 3 has a good week and a half of clear sailing to soar past the $200M and $300M marks. Even if it plays out with the same declines as Iron Man 2, it would break $400M as well by the end of the domestic run.The new blockbuster was once again anchored by superstar Robert Downey Jr. who can now claim to be the only movie star with $500M+ global blockbusters over the last six consecutive years. This comes from three Iron Man films, two Sherlock Holmes movies, and of course Avengers. Once hitting rock bottom in his career, the acclaimed actor has used his immense skills to turn things around and make himself into the world’s top box office draw.Audience breakdown for Iron Man 3 was identical to Avengers when it came to gender – 61% male. But the new Stark movie played a little older with 55% being over 25 compared to 50% for the super hero value pack. As for the entire marketplace, with Iron Man 3 absorbing all the free screens within each multiplex it accounted for a whopping 80% of the entire box office this weekend with no other wide releases daring to open and no holdover hitting double digit millions. Iron Man completely dominated the marketplace. Avengers commanded the exact same share of the box office one year ago this weekend when it crushed its foes.This is the seventh consecutive year that Marvel seized control over the lucrative first weekend in May to kickoff the summer movie season. Though its characters have done it before, the current streak started in 2007 with Sony’s Spider-Man 3 continuing with 2008’s Iron Man, 2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, 2010’s Iron Man 2, 2011’s Thor, and Avengers last year. The comic giant has no intention of giving up this prime piece of box office real estate and has already planted its flag on May 2 next year with Sony’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as well as May 1, 2015 for The Avengers 2 which could conceivably score an opening weekend that breaks the $250M mark. They are essentially telling every other film to backoff. And it would surprise nobody if Marvel and Disney claim May 6, 2016 for a fourth Iron Man film. But next up are super sequels with Thor returning this November and Captain America next April.Iron Man 3 was also a colossal behemoth at the overseas box office this weekend where it played in its second round in most territories. The Marvel hero grossed a stellar $175.9M driven by new openings in China ($63.5M in 5 days), Russia ($21.7M in 4), and Germany ($10M in 5). That boosted the international total to a mammoth $504.8M and the global haul to a jaw-dropping $680.1M in under two weeks. That’s even more than the $655M that Avengers grossed in the same 12 days last year. Release dates were mostly the same as it too opened in most overseas markets one week before domestic to capitalize on the May Day holiday which is not celebrated in the U.S. The main difference is that Iron Man 3 opened in China three days earlier. With local partner DMG involved in producing the film, extra footage for a special version only for Chinese audiences, and Chinese stars added in, the results were record-breaking for Iron Man 3 in that market where it smashed the all-time opening day record on Wednesday with an estimated $21.5M.Trailing lucrative China, the next best results for Iron Man 3 came from two-week cumes in Korea ($42.6M), the U.K. ($38.3M), Mexico ($35.8M), Brazil ($30.1M), Australia ($28.4M), France ($27.8M), and Russia’s $21.7M from just the opening weekend. With nearly two weeks of clear sailing in most offshore markets (Star Trek Into Darkness debuts in six markets next weekend plus previews in others), Iron Man 3 could very well be on a trajectory towards the $1.3 billion mark in worldwide box office.The rest of the top ten featured scraps of spring leftovers fighting over what was left of the box office pie. The Mark Wahlberg-Dwayne Johnson action-comedy Pain &amp; Gain tumbled from the number one spot and lost 63% of its business. Paramount grossed an estimated $7.6M putting the ten-day take at $33.9M. Produced for a reported $26M, the Michael Bay film should end its domestic run with about $45M.The baseball drama 42 held up well dipping 42% to an estimated $6.2M giving Warner Bros. $78.3M to date. Tom Cruise’s sci-fi adventure Oblivion followed with an estimated $5.8M, down 67%, for a $76M domestic total to date for Universal. Hit toon The Croods eased by just 37% to an estimated $4.2M and upped its cume to $168.7M.Dropping 49% was the critically-panned Lionsgate title The Big Wedding with an estimated $3.9M for a lousy $14.2M cume in ten days. Matthew McConaughey’s new film Mud jumped into the top ten in its second weekend of moderate play with an estimated $2.2M from 576 locations for a mild $3,733 per theater. Roadside Attractions added 213 new sites boosting the theater count by 59% following its eleventh place debut last week. The weekend dip in grosses was only 3% and the cume is $5.2M.Also making about as much this weekend as last time was the year’s top domestic blockbuster (for now) Oz the Great and Powerful with an estimated $1.8M, even with last weekend. Disney coupled the fantasy adventure with Iron Man 3 for many drive-in double features nationwide and got to loot some extra cash off of Tony Stark’s popularity. The studio did the same thing with John Carter and The Avengers a year ago. Oz has now banked $228.6M from North America and $485.6M worldwide.Crashing 58% was the spoof sequel Scary Movie 5 with an estimated $1.4M giving The Weinstein Co. $29.6M to date. The Focus title The Place Beyond The Pines rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.3M, down 52%, for a $18.7M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $209.7M which was down 15% from last year when The Avengers debuted at number one with a record $207.4M; but up 37% from 2011 when Thor opened in the top spot with $65.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"composers, streaming, Summer, kong, reviews, History, Fall, harry","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-3-Soars-Above-the-Rest"},{"id":"47509121143564","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Oz Powerful, Burt Not-So-Incredible","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Oz Powerful, Burt Not-So-Incredibleby Gitesh Pandya | March 17, 2013 |  CommentsMoviegoers cared about only one magician as the blockbuster Oz the Great and Powerful easily led the North American box office for a second time while dueling magic men Steve Carell and Jim Carrey saw their new comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone get flat out rejected. Meanwhile, the Halle Berry thriller The Call overperformed and enjoyed a solid second place debut.Disney’s big-budget Wizard of Oz prequel Oz was both great and powerful grossing an estimated $42.2M in its sophomore frame to boost the ten-day cume to $145M. The PG-rated witchfest dropped a moderate 47% which was in line with Johnny Depp’s 3D fairy tale extravaganza Alice in Wonderland from three years ago which declined by 46% in its second weekend which was also in mid-March. That film amassed $209.3M in its first ten days, or 63% of its eventual $334.2M domestic final. Neither Oz nor Alice had a new competing kidpic open on that sophomore session.Overseas, Oz hauled in another $46.6M from 55 territories boosting the international total to $136.8M and the global gross to $281.8M. With audiences generally liking the costly $215M-budgeted fantasy film, the current trajectory puts it on course for $230M-240M from North America and over $550M worldwide.Halle Berry scored a big hit this weekend with her new kidnapping thriller The Call which exceeded expectations and landed in second place with a $17.1M opening, according to estimates. The R-rated film which finds the Oscar-winning actress playing a 911 operator who takes matters into her own hands to capture a serial killer averaged a sturdy $6,821 from 2,507 locations powered by a female audience. Studio data showed that women made up 61% of the crowd while 53% were over 30. Abigail Breslin co-starred.Reviews were lackluster but moviegoers responded to the marketing push of this crime thriller. Berry has had little luck at the box office in recent years when not starring in a franchise film with built-in audiences. In fact, The Call delivered her third best opening ever for a non-franchise pic trailing only 2001’s Swordfish and 2003’s Gothika. The B+ CinemaScore indicates that audiences were generally pleased with what the Sony film had to offer so the long-term outlook seems promising. As an action hero, Berry can now say that she beat out openings this year from The Rock, Mark Wahlberg, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, and Colin Farrell.Barely breaking double digit millions, the all-star comedy The Incredible Burt Wonderstone opened to dismal results in third place with an estimated $10.3M for A-list comic stars Steve Carell and Jim Carrey. The PG-13 flick about an iconic Las Vegas magician threatened by the success of a popular new street performer featured two of the biggest box office names in the world of comedy but failed to excite ticket buyers. Burt averaged a middling $3,261 from 3,160 locations and boasted a cast that also included Steve Buscemi, James Gandolfini, Alan Arkin and Olivia Wilde.Critics slammed the Warner Bros. release and unfunny trailers and TV spots did little to change people’s minds. Over the past decade, Carell has anchored many broad comedy hits while Carrey has done very few spending more time instead on big kidpics and smaller indies. Among wide releases bowing in 2,000+ theaters, Wonderstone was the worst opener ever for Carell and the third lowest for Carrey after the Majestic and Man in the Moon. Studio research showed that Burt skewed 55% male and 56% over 25. CinemaScore audiences gave a disappointing C+ grade indicating a fast fade ahead.With nothing new for kids, the fairy tale adventure Jack the Giant Slayer held up well in its third round with an estimated $6.2M dipping 37%. The pricey Warner Bros. title has still only collected $53.9M from North America on its way to about $70M. Identity Thief, a hit with a much lower cost and much higher gross, followed in fifth place with an estimated $4.5M. Off just 29%, the Universal smash has grossed a terrific $123.7M to date.Dwayne Johnson’s Snitch has been that rare action movie with good legs slipping 31% in its fourth round to an estimated $3.5M for a $37.3M cume to date for Lionsgate. Relativity’s party comedy 21 and Over fell 49% to an estimated $2.6M with $21.9M overall.Oscar contender Silver Linings Playbook dropped 29% to an estimated $2.6M for The Weinstein Co. lifting the total to a sturdy $124.6M. Its been in the top ten for the past nine weekends. The Relativity romance Safe Haven followed close behind with an estimated $2.5M, off 34%, putting the tearjerker at a solid $67M. Rounding out the top ten was the kidpic Escape From Planet Earth which dipped only 28% to an estimated $2.3M. The total stands at $52.2M for The Weinstein Co.Making a spectacular splash in platform release was the bikini-clad-girls-with-guns pic Spring Breakers which sold out shows with an estimated $270,000 from only three theaters (2 in New York, 1 in Los Angeles) for a jaw-dropping $90,000 average. Distributed by A24, the R-rated film stars Disney Channel gals Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens in more sexually provocative roles along with James Franco who this weekend ruled both the mainstream and specialty scenes. Reviews were generally positive and Breakers will expand nationwide this Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $93.9M which was even with last year when 21 Jump Street opened at number one with $36.3M; but off 5% from 2011 when Limitless debuted in the top spot with $18.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ITV, Poppins, cancelled, talk, Sabrina, 2017, composers, Vudu, See","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Oz-Powerful-Burt-NotSoIncredible"},{"id":"47509121140490","title":"Box Office Guru: G.I.

Joe Rocks Easter Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | April 1, 2013 |  CommentsTestosterone ruled the Easter frame as the 3D action sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation opened at number one, but Tyler Perry’s latest offering Temptation also scored a strong debut of its own in third place. The animated holdover The Croods held up well in its second weekend pulling in families over the school holiday helping the box office beat Easter business from the past two years.Paramount topped the charts with the franchise hit G.I. Joe which debuted to an estimated $41.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $51.7M since its launch on Wednesday night with 7:00pm shows. The PG-13 flick averaged a muscular $11,078 from 3,719 locations over the three-day weekend period with 45% of the business coming from 3D screens including 303 IMAX sites which kicked in $4.8M.Though definitely a strong opening, the 4.5-day figure still came in below the $54.7M three-day non-holiday opening of its 2009 predecessor G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. The first pic was released over the busier summer period in 4,000+ locations but the sequel had higher 3D prices and added starpower from Dwayne Johnson and Bruce Willis. Channing Tatum, who played a central role in the first film, had a more supporting role in the followup which was delayed from its original June 29, 2012 date.But Retaliation should still be a big moneymaker thanks to a smaller production budget ($130M vs $175M) and substantial growth from international markets which should more than make up for domestic shortfalls allowing the new film to finish higher than Cobra’s $302M global final.Domestically, the bullet-filled action pic skewed heavily male as expected. Studio research showed that males made up 68% of the crowd while 59% were 25 or older. Reviews were weak – standard for these types of sequels – but audiences liked what they paid for as the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A-.Joe kicked off its run with $10.5M on Thursday, including $2.2M from Wednesday night shows. The Good Friday holiday saw sales climb 48% to $15.5M, Saturday was flat with $15.6M, and Easter Sunday is estimated to dip by 35% to $10.1M. Action sequels like these tend to be front-loaded but the domestic final should be able to break $100M and possibly end near the $110M mark. Cobra grossed $150.2M.Retaliation really saw its good fortune from overseas markets which generated an estimated $80.3M debut resulting in a spectacular global opening of $132M this weekend. Compared to the same markets for Cobra, Retaliation’s opening was nearly twice as big thanks in part to 3D prices and key markets becoming more lucrative since 2009. Russia led the way with $11M, Korea banked $6M, and Mexico scored $6M. The new Joe still has 25% of the world to come including China on April 15 and Japan on June 8 so a worldwide haul of $400M is possible.Families flocked to the animated comedy The Croods over the Easter school holidays as the DreamWorks pic grossed an estimated $26.5M, sliding 39% in its second weekend. Compared to other spring toons with the bunny holiday helping the sophomore frame, the pre-historic family dropped a little harder than 2011’s Rio (33%) and 2010’s How To Train Your Dragon (34%), but fell a little less than 2008’s Horton Hears a Who (45%).With a sturdy $88.6M in ten days, Croods should be able to keep its momentum going for weeks to come since there are absolutely no kidpics with G or PG ratings opening for nearly two months. A final domestic tally of about $160M could result making it the best performance for a DreamWorks Animation non-sequel since Dragon. Overseas, Croods used the holiday to bank a sizable $52.5M from 59 markets shooting the international total to $230M. Global is $296.6M and will smash $300M on Monday.The Tyler Perry brand showed off its strength and durability with the impressive debut of the infidelity drama Temptation which opened to an estimated $22.3M from 2,047 theaters for a stellar $10,894 average. That was almost identical to G.I. Joe’s average. Rated PG-13, Temptation delivered the best opening ever for a Perry film that wasn’t a sequel or featured his signature Madea character. Plus it was the tenth Tyler Perry film (ninth as director) over eight years to debut north of $20M. Despite having so much content, the filmmaker’s fans continue to come out and spend on his new offerings.Temptation was positioned a bit more as an erotic thriller which made it look like something a bit different. The audience breakdown was similar to past films from the mogul – 70% female and 79% 25 and older. Easter has been used successfully many times in the past to launch new Perry films and it worked for Lionsgate yet again as the fan base came out in better than expected numbers. The gross even doubled the opening of last fall’s Alex Cross which featured Perry as just an actor and in the title role. The CinemaScore was an A- and Perry’s fourteen films over the past eight years have now grossed a stunning $696M domestically with all carrying modest budgets.The White House kidnapping thriller Olympus Has Fallen dropped a large 54% thanks in part to a new action tentpole hitting the marketplace. Gerard Butler’s hit film grossed an estimated $14M raising the ten-day total to a sturdy $54.7M for FilmDistrct heading to an impressive final in the $85M vicinity. Flirting with the double century mark, Disney’s Oz the Great and Powerful took in an estimated $11.6M on Easter weekend, down 46%, for a $198.3M domestic total. Thanks to a new opening in China (official figures not yet released, but estimated to be near $10M over three days), the franchise flick grossed an estimated $22.2M from overseas markets boosting the international cume to $214M and the worldwide haul to $412.3M on its way to the $500M mark.The critically-panned sci-fi romance The Host failed to pull in business from Twilight fans and finished outside the top five in sixth place with an estimated $11M. Averaging a dull $3,436 from an aggressive release in 3,202 locations, the PG-13 pic was based on the best-selling book by author Stephenie Meyer which followed her mega-successful vampire saga. Critics trashed the Open Road release and fans decided to skip this one. The target audience consisted of young females and its B- CinemaScore indicated not much satisfaction from those ticket buyers that did come out.The Halle Berry hit The Call dropped 46% to an estimated $4.8M giving Sony $39.5M to date. Tina Fey followed with a similar 47% decline for her new comedy Admission which grossed an estimated $3.3M putting Focus at a disappointing $11.8M.The bikini-girls-with-guns pic Spring Breakers ranked ninth with an estimated $2.8M, off 43%, and a modest $10.1M overall for A24. Tumbling 70% in its third round was the all-star comedy flop The Incredible Burt Wonderstone which collected an estimated $1.3M. Warner Bros. has taken in a weak $20.6M and won’t finish with much more.After being MIA for a year and a half, red hot actor Ryan Gosling returned to the big screen in the platform release The Place Beyond The Pines along with co-star Bradley Cooper and found sensational results with an estimated $270,000 opening from just four theaters for a scorching $67,546 average. Focus will expand beyond New York and Los Angeles next weekend with 13 additional markets and will go nationwide on April 12. The R-rated drama earned good reviews from critics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.7M which was up 20% from last year’s Easter frame when The Hunger Games stayed at number one for a third time with $33.1M; and up 21% from 2011’s holiday when Rio remained in the top spot with $26.3M in its sophomore session.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Amazon, parents, kong, Netflix, Crunchyroll, nightmare, Interview, competition, scary, psychological","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-GI-Joe-Rocks-Easter-Weekend"},{"id":"47509121153809","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Identity Thief Scores Big in Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Identity Thief Scores Big in DebutWarm Bodies slids into second, and Soderbergh's final film nabs third.by Sujit Chawla | February 10, 2013 |  CommentsThis weekend, Universal’s Identity Thief blew onto the scene with a surprisingly strong opening, while Steven Soderbergh’s supposed last directorial effort debuted mildly in third. Returning films held on reasonably well, especially those of the Oscar variety.Exploding into first place was Identity Thief, starring Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy, with an estimated $36.6M from 3,141 theaters, for a potent per-screen average of $11,650. Despite the controversial review of formerly influential critic Rex Reed, audiences dug the film, which outgunned the opening weekends of Bateman’s Horrible Bosses ($28.3M) and McCarthy’s Bridesmaids ($26.2), both from the summer of 2011. Instead Identity Thief opened in line with last year’s spring hit 21 Jump Street which debuted with $36.3M on its way to $138.7M. If last year was the year of Tatum, could this year be the year of McCarthy, who has The Heat co-starring Sandra Bullock on tap for later this summer.Second place belonged to the warm and fuzzy zombies of Warm Bodies. Dipping a reasonable 43% from its debut weekend, the Summit release ate up an estimated $11.5M bringing its cume to $35.5M.Third place belonged to Side Effects directed by Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh, who claims this will be his last film. The thriller, which stars last year’s “It Boy” Tatum, couldn’t live up to the pair’s last collaboration Magic Mike ($39.1M from last summer) and opened mildly with $10M, according to estimates, from 2,605 theaters for a per-screen average of only $3,845. I have a hard time imagining Soderbergh will be happy to go out on a note like this, so I’m betting he’ll be back in the next couple of years.The rest of the top 10 had a familiar look to it as Oscar films continued their push to Super Sunday on the 24th of this month. Leading the pack in its 13th weekend was Silver Linings Playbook, which fell a slim 11% to $6.9M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to $89M. Fifth place belonged to the fairy tale darlings Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters which dropped 39% from last weekend to an estimated $5.8M, bringing its cume to $43M.Sixth place belonged to the horror-thriller Mama which slipped 34% to an estimated $4.3M and a current total of $63.7M, impressive for a horror film. Jennifer Lawrence’s biggest rival for the Best Actress Oscar landed in seventh place as Jessica Chastain and Zero Dark Thirty slid 23% from last weekend to $4M, according to estimates, bringing the war thriller to $83M.On an amazing award winning streak, Ben Affleck’s Argo added 470 theaters this weekend and jumped back into the top 10 in its 18th weekend, adding an additional $2.5M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $123.2M. Fellow Best Picture nominee Django Unchained took in an estimated $2.3M this weekend, bringing Quentin Tarantino’s highest grossing film to $154.2M. And rounding out the top 10 was the Sylvester Stallone flop Bullet to the Head which dropped 56% from its dull opening to an estimated $2M, bringing its miserable total to $7.9M. One other film of note, the 3D IMAX re-release of Tom Cruise’s classic Top Gun debuted just outside the top 10 with $1.9M from 300 screens for a per screen average of $6,333, second best in the top 20.The top ten films grossed $85.8M which was down 49% from last year when The Vow and Safe House both debuted north of $40M; and down 33% from 2011 when the triumvirate of Just Go With It, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never and Gnomeo &amp; Juliet all opened between $25M and $30M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"the, History, review, richard, Month, Channel, Brie, Country, Company, the, finale, Talk, versus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Identity-Thief-Scores-Big-in-Debut"},{"id":"47509121154834","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Heat Up to Warm Bodies","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Heat Up to Warm Bodiesby Gitesh Pandya | February 4, 2013 |  CommentsSuper Bowl weekend was ruled by the adorable undead as the zombie romantic comedy Warm Bodies opened at number one leading a dull frame with lackluster ticket sales. The Big Game routinely crushes ticket sales on Sunday weakening weekend numbers and studios either avoid programming any good films, or use it as an opportunity to counter-program to young women – the demographic least affected by America’s biggest sporting event. The Top 20 sank to just $82M, down a sharp 31% versus last year.Delivering a solid opening weekend, Warm Bodies easily topped the chart with an estimated $20M debut averaging a commendable $6,655 from 3,009 theaters. The PG-13 film about a zombie who develops feelings for a human gal offered an interesting new twist on the decades-old genre and connected with young women. The rating helped especially since six of the next seven films on the chart were rated R. Warm Bodies played to a 60% female audience and 65% were under 25. This demographic has been mostly turned off by the barrage of action films over the last few weeks but responded to something more appealing. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+ for the Summit film and reviews were very positive.Paramount’s chart-topper Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters fell 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.2M giving the studio $34.5M after ten days. A $50M final seems likely for the $50M-budgeted actioner. Academy Award contender Silver Linings Playbook once again enjoyed the best hold in the top ten taking in an estimated $8.1M for a slim 14% decline. The Weinstein Co. has now amassed $80.4M.Down 49% in its third round was the supernatural thriller Mama with an estimated $6.7M and $58.2M to date for Universal. Sony’s Oscar contender Zero Dark Thirty followed with an estimated $5.3M, sliding 45%, to $77.8M thus far.The unlucky streak for action movies continued as audiences steered clear of the new Sylvester Stallone flick Bullet to the Head which crapped out in sixth place with an estimated $4.5M from 2,404 theaters for a dismal $1,872 average. For the aging action hero it was his worst opening for a wide release in over three decades and fell below the dreadful debuts in recent weeks for his Expendables co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jason Statham who anchored The Last Stand ($6.3M opening) and Parker ($7M), respectively.Stallone successfully rebranded himself in recent years with Rocky Balboa, Rambo, and the two Expendables hits. But Bullet featured no beloved character that audiences were familiar with plus no known co-stars to help bring in the loot. The audience skewed older male as studio research showed that men made up 60% of the crowd while 81% were over 25. The CinemaScore was a disappointing B-.Parker followed in seventh with an estimated $3.2M tumbling 54% in its sophomore frame. The FilmDistrict release should end with just $18M. The rest of the top ten was filled up by a trio of blockbuster Oscar nominees for Best Picture with decent holds considering it’s Super Bowl weekend. Quentin Tarantino hopped over the $150M mark for the first time with Django Unchained which grossed an estimated $3M, off 39%, for a $151M cume for The Weinstein Co. Former front-runner Lincoln dipped 38% to an estimated $2.4M while the musical Les Misérables collected the same amount after a 43% decline. Disney has banked an impressive $170.8M for the Daniel-Day Lewis hit while Universal has taken in $141.5M with rival Best Actor contender Hugh Jackman.Among other nominees for Hollywood’s top trophy, awards season juggernaut Argo took 11th place in its 17th weekend of release with an estimated $2.1M after jumping up 16% after adding 47% more theaters to the run. Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis hit has won all three top guild awards from the PGA, SAG, and DGA and is now in a commanding position as Oscar voting begins. However, it does lack the Best Director nomination which has been such a critical component for most – but not all – Best Picture winners. Argo will now follow the path of one of two films. 1995’s Apollo 13 won the same three guild titles only to lose the Best Picture Oscar to Braveheart. It also had no Academy nod for Director. But 1989’s Driving Miss Daisy won Best Picture without even earning a Best Director nomination. One of these rare cases will repeat itself this year.Fox’s Life of Pi, another of this year’s Best Picture contenders, dropped 30% to an estimated $1.8M upping the total to $106.1M. The French-language film Amour expanded screens by 47% and watched its weekend gross inch up 6% to an estimated $497,000. Sony Classics has collected $2.5M so far. By Oscar night, seven of the nine Best Picture nominees could be over the $90M mark. That should drive TV ratings higher since so many of the contenders have been seen by so many people. This year’s crop has a substantial amount of mainstream appeal.Oscar winners Al Pacino, Christopher Walken, and Alan Arkin failed to draw in any sales for their new old-timers dramedy Stand Up Guys which flopped with an estimated opening weekend of just $1.5M, according to estimates. The Lionsgate release averaged a weak $2,276 from a moderate release in 659 locations and attracted lackluster reviews.The top ten films grossed an estimated $64.9M which was down a sharp 26% from last year when Chronicle opened at number one with $22M; and down 5% from 2011 when The Roommate debuted in the top spot with $15M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"WarnerMedia, psycho, The, king, Mudbound","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Heat-Up-to-Warm-Bodies"},{"id":"47509121151760","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Latest Die Hard Leads Presidents’ Day Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Latest Die Hard Leads Presidents' Day Weekendby Gitesh Pandya | February 17, 2013 |  CommentsThe Presidents’ Day holiday frame saw three films generate $20-25M in ticket sales but the action sequel A Good Day to Die Hard made enough to earn the number one spot. Comedy holdover Identity Thief dropped to second place while the new romance Safe Haven bowed in third. Overall box office was down from last year’s robust holiday while Oscar contenders for Best Picture remained popular with moviegoers looking for quality cinema.Bruce Willis anchored his first solo number one hit in thirteen years with his return as John McClane in A Good Day to Die Hard which grossed an estimated $25M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The R-rated Fox release averaged a good but not stellar $7,036 from 3,553 locations and grossed $33.2M since its Thursday launch on Valentine’s Day. The five-day debut including Monday Presidents’ Day should end up about $10M less than the $48.4M five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday opening of the last film in the series, Live Free or Die Hard from June 2007 which was the only PG-13 chapter in the series. The new Russian-set story enjoyed higher ticket prices plus some IMAX premiums. The prior film, 1995’s Die Hard with a Vengeance, bowed to $22.2M which would be roughly $40M at today’s prices.Reviews were dreadful for the poorly-titled Good Day, easily the worst ever for the quarter-century-old franchise. The story found the wisecracking cop heading to Moscow to help his son, a CIA agent in trouble with master criminals. Older action heroes have been rejected by audiences lately with both Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone striking out in recent weeks with The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, respectively. But based on his most popular character, Bruce saw more box office on his opening day of Die Hard than those films took in on their entire opening weekends.A Good Day to Die Hard skewed as expected to older men. Studio research showed that 55% of the crowd was male and 65% was 25 and older. The CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+. While domestic interest in Die Hard has cooled, overseas numbers were hot. The fifth Die Hard grossed $61.5M from 63 markets this weekend upping the international total to $80.1M including some Asian markets like Korea and Taiwan which debuted last weekend. Leading the way were the U.K. with $7.6M, Japan with $6.8M, Russia’s $6.7M, and Germany with $6.4M. Korea stands at $8.8M after its sophomore frame with France and Brazil opening next weekend plus China and Australia launching in March. Many Latin American markets more than doubled the openings of the last Die Hard. A final worldwide cume of over $350M is possible for the new pic. Action franchises like these usually continue on thanks in large part to overseas revenue potential.Last weekend’s muscular number one smash Identity Thief found another sizable audience in its second round with an estimated $23.4M for an encouraging decline of only 32%. Universal has amassed a sizable $70.7M in ten days and could be headed for a finish in the vicinity of $130M. That is an impressive amount for a film that cost only $35M to produce.Young women propelled the new romance Safe Haven into third place with an estimated $21.4M from 3,223 theaters for a solid $6,649 average. The Relativity release debuted at number one on Thursday with $8.8M because of Valentine’s Day but held its own over the weekend too leading to a $30.3M four-day start from Thursday-to-Sunday – just $3M behind the much more expensive Die Hard.Reviews were dreadful, but that is common for romance movies based on Nicholas Sparks novels. Starring Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough, the PG-13 film played to an audience that was 71% female and 68% under 25. Safe Haven’s four-day start was even with the $30.5M three-day debut of 2010’s Dear John, also based on a Sparks book, which had much more starpower with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried.The Weinstein Co. scored a victory in fourth place with the 3D animated film Escape From Planet Earth which bowed to an estimated $16.1M over the three days since its Friday debut. With zero kidpics released by studios so far this year, the PG-rated toon had the family market all to itself and averaged a decent $4,886 from 3,288 locations. The CinemaScore was a B+.Hollywood has programmed an excessive number of R-rated action films into the first two months of the year to go along with the string of adult-skewing Oscar contenders which have been mostly rated R. That created a huge void for this segment of the audience and with schools off for the long holiday frame, parents had no other options. The performance of Escape was especially good for a movie not based on a well-known brand, not from a big supplier of animated movies like Pixar or DreamWorks, and not featuring any major names in the voice cast. The Monday holiday should add plenty more for the long four-day weekend. Reviews were poor.The hit zombie romance Warm Bodies scored a hot sophomore frame dipping only 21% against stiff competition collecting an estimated $9M. The Summit film has now grossed a stellar $50.2M in just 17 days and should continue to see much more thanks to terrific word-of-mouth. Picking up lost business due to last weekend’s east coast blizzard played a factor, but audiences are liking this unique story which is becoming a sleeper hit.Bodies may have siphoned off some of the target audience for the supernatural tale Beautiful Creatures which bombed debuting to just $7.5M from 2,950 locations for a weak $2,529 average. Taking in $10M since its Thursday release, the PG-13 film based on the best-selling young adult novel hoped to connect with young women. But competition was tough and reviews were not encouraging. A middling B CinemaScore does not bode well for a teen-skewing film made to make most of its money upfront.Steven Soderbergh’s drama Side Effects enjoyed a decent hold in its second weekend dipping 32% to an estimated $6.3M pushing the ten-day cume to $19.1M for Open Road. Best Picture contender Silver Linings Playbook once again eased by a scant amount. The Weinstein Co. hit grossed an estimated $6.1M, off only 5%, for a $98.5M total. It will crack nine digits on Monday or Tuesday.Falling 40% to an estimated $3.5M was Paramount’s Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters which has banked $49.7M to date. Rounding out the top ten was Oscar contender Zero Dark Thirty which slipped just 23% to an estimated $3.1M giving Sony $88M overall.In the final full weekend before the Academy Awards, moviegoers kept sampling all the major contenders with four more Best Picture nominees filling up spots on the chart with small declines. Front-runner Argo dipped only 6% to an estimated $2.2M putting Warner Bros. at $126.9M domestically and $204M worldwide. The Ben Affleck hit lands on Blu-ray this Tuesday and is preparing itself for a new audience on multiple platforms should it win Best Picture next Sunday. Lincoln, another big player, eased 10% to an estimated $1.7M for a cume to date of $176.3M. Worldwide is $235.3M.Ang Lee’s Life of Pi declined by only 13% in its 13th weekend to an estimated $1.5M for $110.8M so far in North America and a stunning $577M globally. The Weinstein Co. collected an estimated $1.5M as well for Django Unchained, down 35%, with $157M domestic to date. Worldwide is now up to $365.6M. Les Misérables suffered the worst drop of any Best Picture contender falling 45% to an estimated $855,000 with $145.6M overall. Sony Classics expanded the French-language hit Amour and saw sales surge 92% to an estimated $721,000. Cume is $3.9M.All eight Best Picture contenders that are still in theaters now finished in the Top 20 this weekend. The nine nominees together have grossed a whopping $918M domestically and an eye-popping $2 billion worldwide. Oscar ratings should see a boost this year since so many movie fans have actually seen so many of the top contenders.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121.3M which was down 12% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last year’s Presidents’ Day frame when Safe House climbed into the number one spot with $23.6M; and down 4% from 2011 when Unknown debuted in the top spot with $21.9M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"festival, The, talk","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Latest-Die-Hard-Leads-Presidents-Day-Weekend"},{"id":"47509119465225","title":"Box Office: Evil Dead Possesses America","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: Evil Dead Possesses AmericaPlus, dinosaurs rule IMAX with the release of Jurassic Park 3Dby Gitesh Pandya | April 8, 2013 |  CommentsThe horror remake Evil Dead led a solid session thanks to a number one debut while holdovers G.I. Joe: Retaliation and The Croods fared well giving the marketplace three films grossing north of $20M each. Plus the 3D re-release of the dino-smash Jurassic Park also scored points with audiences driving the top ten to over $125M in ticket sales. Ticket buyers also caught up on recent hits as four films in the top ten enjoyed low declines of 20-30%.Sam Raimi scored his second number one hit of the year, this time as just producer, with the horror remake Evil Dead which topped the box office this weekend with an opening of an estimated $26M. Averaging a sizzling $8,595 from 3,025 theaters, the R-rated fright flick earned good reviews and capitalized on a built-in fan base of genre lovers who idolized the 1983 original which Raimi directed. The filmmaker’s Oz ranked seventh and remains the highest-grossing film of the year.The Evil Dead performance was driven by upfront business and all signs show that sales will drop sharply in the days and weeks ahead. Friday kicked off with $11.9M in opening day business which included $1.8M from shows starting at 10:00pm on Thursday night. Saturday then tumbled a disturbing 26% while audiences gave the remake a lousy C+ grade from CinemaScore indicating low customer satisfaction. Sony estimates that Sunday will dip 40% to $5.3M. Studio research showed that 56% of the crowd was male while 56% was 25 and over.It bested the $21.7M opening of Texas Chainsaw 3D from the first weekend of this year but did nearly match that film’s $8,193 average from about 400 fewer theaters. But Evil did not benefit from any 3D surcharges. Dead nearly matched the $28.4M opening of the PG-13 spookfest Mama from January which remains the top horror opening of the year.Two former number ones held up well and tied for second place with weekend estimates of $21.1M each. Paramount’s G.I. Joe: Retaliation fell 48% which was good for an action sequel raising the cume to $86.7M after 11.5 days. The patriotic flick opened midweek taking opening day business off of Friday, but the Easter holidays helped pump up the Friday-to-Sunday opening frame so the decline was quite respectable given the way the film was launched. Joe should reach $130-140M domestically. Overseas markets grossed an estimated $40.2M boosting the international take to $145.2M and the worldwide tally up to $231.9M with China and Japan still to come. Produced for $130M, Retaliation may find itself with global grosses of $450M or more easily beating the $302M of its 2009 predecessor which cost more to make.Pulling in the same weekend gross, but with a slimmer 21% dip, was the animated hit The Croods from Fox and DreamWorks Animation. The cavepeople pic, still the only toon in town for families, lifted its cume to a stellar $125.8M after 17 days and is now on course to reach roughly $190M from North America. If it continues to post strong holds – no new kidpics open this entire month – then it even has a shot at hitting the $200M mark.Croods is now playing out much like the leggy DreamWorks hit How To Train Your Dragon from three years ago. Opening weekends were $43.6M and $43.7M, respectively. Second weekend declines were 39%/34% and third weekend drops were 21%/14%. After the same number of days, Croods is running less than 6% behind the $133.4M of Dragon which eventually ended with $217.6M. Worldwide, the pre-historic comedy has now amassed $332.6M surpassing the $304M final of the last DreamWorks title, Rise of the Guardians, on its way to the $500M mark and beyond.The 3D re-release of Steven Spielberg’s dinosaur mega-hit Jurassic Park found a sizable new audience grossing an estimated $18.2M from 2,771 theaters for a solid $6,585 average. Compared to recent 3D upgrades, it was better than the $16.7M of September’s Finding Nemo and the $17.3M bow of Titanic from this same weekend last year, but below the $22.5M of Star Wars Episode I from February 2012. An amazingly high 32% ($6M+) of the weekend gross came from 312 IMAX screens. Moviegoers felt this was an experience worth paying extra for. Universal spent $10M to convert the film to 3D.As a brand name, Spielberg remains popular with audiences continuing to pay to see his imaginative and thrilling adventures on the big screen. Studio research showed that 55% of the audience was male and 54% was 25 and older. Jurassic Park grossed $357.1M during its original run in 1993 and now stands at $375.3M lifetime putting it at number 20 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. The 3D re-release was also aimed at re-invigorating the Jurassic Park brand since the fourth chapter in the series will be shot soon for a summer release next year. As with the last installment, Spielberg will produce but not direct.Two spring hits tied for fifth place with $10M a piece, according to estimates. The FilmDistrict actioner Olympus Has Fallen declined by an encouraging 29% in its third round pumping the cume up to a sturdy $71.1M. Look for a final gross of more than $90M with an outside chance of even reaching $100M if positive buzz from action fans keeps spreading. Next weekend will see no new action titles opening. Tyler Perry’s Temptation fell by 54% in its second weekend which was average for the filmmaker. With $38.4M in ten days, Lionsgate could end up with around $55M.Oz the Great and Powerful held up well in its fifth weekend grossing an estimated $8.2M, off just 30%, for a $212.8M cume to date. With international markets kicking in an additional $13.6M, the worldwide total now stands at $454.1M as 2013’s top blockbuster. The sci-fi flop The Host fell 51% in its sophomore round to an estimated $5.2M. Open Road has collected a dull $19.7M in ten days and will finish off with roughly $30M.Female-driven movies The Call and Admission rounded out the top ten with estimated weekend takes of $3.5M and $2.1M, respectively. The Halle Berry thriller dipped only 29% for a healthy $45.5M cume for Sony while the Tina Fey dramedy declined by 37% giving Focus a lackluster $15.4M to date.It was an active weekend in the specialty marketplace. Danny Boyle’s new psychological crime thriller Trance debuted to sparkling results with an estimated $136,000 from only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $34,000 average. Fox Searchlight goes nationwide into nearly 400 theaters on Friday. Sony Classics opened Robert Redford’s newest film The Company You Keep in just five locations grossing an estimated $146,000 for a sturdy $29,200 average. The Shia LaBeouf pic will take a slower path with another 25 sites next weekend, an additional 75 on April 19, and then nationwide on the 26th.Focus enjoyed solid results for its second weekend expansion of the Ryan Gosling-Bradley Cooper starrer The Place Beyond The Pines which went from four to 30 playdates collecting an estimated $695,000 this weekend for an encouraging $23,167 average. Friday marks its national break with about 450 theaters in play.The top ten films grossed an estimated $125.4M which was up 9% from last year when The Hunger Games stayed at number one for a third time with $33.1M; and up 28% from 2011 when Hop stayed in the top spot with $21.3M in its sophomore session.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"SundanceTV, DC, Arts, First, Television, curtis, Dead, Alien, Kids, Month, Broadway, Disney+, your, Winners, cancelled","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Evil-Dead-Possesses-America"},{"id":"47509121165078","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ultraviolent Pics Lead First Weekend of 2013","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ultraviolent Pics Lead First Weekend of 2013by Gitesh Pandya | January 7, 2013 |  CommentsJust as with last year, 2013 kicked off its first frame with an overperforming horror flick debuting at number one as audiences powered Texas Chainsaw 3D to the top spot. Holiday holdovers fared well with most dropping by about 30% from last weekend’s sturdy session.Lionsgate generated a better-than-expected debut for its fright sequel Texas Chainsaw 3D which bowed to an estimated $23M from 2,654 locations for a muscular $8,666 average. The R-rated film which gives a 3D update to the continuing story of horror icon Leatherface played to a young adult audience which had very little product to be excited about in December. Studio research showed that 64% of the crowd was under 25 and 52% was female.Chainsaw attracted business from the horror crowd thanks to a well-known brand but also tapped into urban audiences thanks in part to the casting of musical artist Trey Songz who has over 5 million followers on Twitter and 14 million fans on Facebook. He actively promoted the movie to his fans who came out in huge numbers. $1.15M of the weekend gross came from shows starting at 10pm on Thursday night. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the fright flick a C+ grade.Early January is a lucrative time for Hollywood to open scary movies. The cheery mood of Christmas is over so fans are ready for some creepy violence plus a large number of college students are still on their winter breaks. The Devil Inside smashed expectations a year ago this weekend with its $33.7M debut at number one while the first weekend of next year has already been claimed by The Amityville Horror: The Lost Tapes launching on January 3, 2014.Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained was tops among all holdovers and broke the $100M mark in just its second weekend of play. The R-rated revenge pic declined by only 33% to an estimated $20.1M boosting the 13-day cume since its Christmas Day bow to a sturdy $106.4M. It joined the century club on Saturday in its 12th day of release. With its strong hold and expected Academy Award nominations this week, Django stands a good chance of reaching the $150M barrier and will easily become the director’s highest grossing film ever.Suffering the largest drop of any film in the top ten, three-time box office champ The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey took in an estimated $17.5M falling by 45% from last weekend. The Middle Earth adventure has now grossed $263.8M in 24 days and cracked the quarter-billion mark in only 22 days. Warner Bros. still has a shot at reaching $300M on this one. Hobbit raked in another $57.1M overseas this weekend with the international total climbing to $561M putting the worldwide haul at a towering $824.8M.As former Academy Award host Anne Hathaway prepares her Oscar acceptance speech, her hit musical Les Miserables landed in fourth place in its sophomore frame with an estimated $16.1M with a decent 41% decline. The Universal hit broke the $100M mark after 13 days of release with a cume so far of $103.6M. Cash will keep rolling in over the weeks ahead. On Thursday it will receive many nominations from the Academy which could help broaden appeal and next Sunday it may just sweep the Comedy/Musical category at the Golden Globes which attracts a very large TV viewing audience, especially adult women. Les Miserables grossed an estimated $14.5M overseas from only 17 territories boosting the international total to $81M and the global gross to $184.6M. Korea and Japan lead the way offshore with $28.9M and $25.2M, respectively.Fox’s family comedy Parental Guidance followed in fifth place with an estimated $10.1M, off 30%, raising the cume to $52.8M. Enjoying a similar hold was Tom Cruise’s action title Jack Reacher which slipped 32% to an estimated $9.3M in its third round. Paramount has banked $64.8M to date domestically while 15 new international markets opened this weekend leading to an overseas frame of $22.3M for an international cume of $55.6M and a worldwide tally of $120.4M.The Judd Apatow comedy This is 40 placed seventh with an estimated $8.6M, down 31%, for a sum of $54.4M thus far. Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln spent its eighth straight weekend in the top ten (none at number one) by sliding only 28% to an estimated $5.3M for $143.9M to date for Disney. International openings through Fox will begin soon after it secures its boatload of Oscar nominations this week.Barbra Steisand’s road comedy The Guilt Trip followed by dropping 31% to an estimated $4.5M giving Paramount $31.2M. The Matt Damon drama Promised Land expanded nationwide after a week in limited release but didn’t find many takers with an estimated $4.3M weekend. Focus averaged a weak $2,573 from 1,676 locations and has collected a measly $4.7M to date. Land had no awards buzz, mixed reviews from critics, heavy competition, and featured a big action star that does not sell well in dramas.In limited release, Oscar hopeful Zero Dark Thirty expanded from 5 to 60 theaters in major cities and delivered a rock solid performance with an estimated $2.75M weekend and potent $45,833 average. Sony goes fully nationwide on Friday into 2,400+ locations and aims to get extra ammunition for its marketing assault the day before when Academy nods are announced. Total is now $4.5M.Summit went national with its tsunami drama The Impossible which grossed an estimated $2.8M from 572 sites (up from 15) for a mediocre $4,825 average. Total is just $3.4M. More theaters will be added Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118.8M which was off 1% from last year when The Devil Inside opened at number one with $33.7M; but up 33% from 2011 when True Grit remained in the top spot with $14.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Television, latino, TV, Wars, Kids","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ultraviolent-Pics-Lead-First-Weekend-of-2013"},{"id":"47509122870047","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ralph &amp; Flight Make B.O.

Soarby Gitesh Pandya | November 4, 2012 |  CommentsThe holiday box office season started with a bang thanks to the one-two punch of two new releases that pulled in sold-out audiences – the animated video game comedy Wreck-It Ralph and the Denzel Washington drama Flight. The pair led the top ten to a healthy 19% jump over the same frame last year. And with tens of millions affected last week by the deadly hurricane Sandy, it was questionable what impact theaters would see but compelling product brought people out of their homes and into the multiplexes putting the film industry in a good position going into the final weeks of the year.Disney topped the box office with its video game-inspired 3D toon Wreck-It Ralph which opened at number one with a muscular $49.1M, according to estimates. The PG-rated film about a bad guy from a game who wants to become a hero scored a fantastic result thanks in part to its appeal outside of just kids and parents. The studio launched the pic in 3,752 locations and averaged a potent $13,086 per theater.Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was male and that families made up only 68% of the crowd indicating good business from teens and young adults, many of whom were drawn in by the concept and humor. 38% of the gross came from 3D screens. Reviews were good further encouraging moviegoers to give this one a try and the solid A grade from CinemaScore suggests that word-of-mouth will be strong moving forward. With holidays coming up and no competing family films hitting theaters until Thanksgiving, Ralph should hold up well and could reach the neighborhood of $175M or more from its domestic release alone.Generating the third biggest opening in history for an R-rated film bowing in under 2,000 theaters was Denzel Washington’s pilot drama Flight with an estimated $25M from only 1,884 locations for a spectacular $13,275 average. The Paramount release capitalized on the bankability of its leading man and also benefitted from glowing reviews from major critics as well as Oscar buzz. Also assisting was director Robert Zemeckis who returned to live-action filmmaking after a decade of work in the motion-capture field. The only R-rated films to ever open higher while launching wide in fewer than 2,000 locations were 1999’s The Blair Witch Project ($29.2M) and 2006’s Borat ($26.5M).Washington has proven to be one of the most durable stars in the business who brings out his fan base each and every time and 2012 has been a landmark year for the 57-year-old double Oscar winner. His CIA thriller Safe House opened powerfully with $40.2M last February on its way to $126.2M. Both figures are second best in his career trailing just American Gangster‘s $43.6M and $130.2M from 2007 which, like Flight, launched on November 2. Washington has proven repeatedly that he can draw in millions of fans when playing an anti-hero role.Budgeted at just $31M, Flight carried broad appeal across genders as the split saw just a tiny edge towards males with 51%. Older adults made up the bulk of the crowd as a whopping 89% was over 25. The CinemaScore was an encouraging A- and with holidays ahead, the film stands an excellent chance of reaching the $100M mark. Despite the reduced theater count (Safe House bowed in 3,119 sites), Paramount has no plans to expand next weekend. Competition for adults will get tough soon with Friday’s launch of Skyfall which is expected to follow sensational results in international markets and also open huge. Then Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln debuts wide the following week on November 16.Despite Denzel distracting adults coast to coast, Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis hit Argo still showed exceptional strength dipping a mere 15% to an estimated $10.2M bumping up the total to date to an impressive $75.9M. Warner Bros. should easily cross $100M from North America alone on this one.The martial arts actioner The Man with the Iron Fists made a soft debut in fourth place with an estimated $8.2M from 1,868 locations for a mild $4,400 average. The R-rated action pic from hip hop veteran RZA who makes his feature directorial debut co-stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu and skewed towards young urban males. Budgeted at $15M, the Universal release attracted an audience that was 64% male and 53% under 30. Reviews were not too great and audiences were not especially pleased with their investment of time and money as the CinemaScore grade was a dull C+.In its fifth frame, Liam Neeson’s action sequel Taken 2 showed the kind of stamina that its predecessor enjoyed by slipping just 22% to an estimated $6M. Fox has banked an impressive $125.7M to date driven by older adults. The sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas fell by a reasonable 45% in its second weekend to an estimated $5.3M giving Warner Bros. a dismal $18.3M in ten days. A $30M domestic final seems likely for the $100M+ budgeted project.The fall’s top-grossing film Hotel Transylvania took a direct punch from Ralph and fell 52% to an estimated $4.5M boosting the cume to $137.6M for Sony. Until now, its drops had always been in the range of 25-36%. The horror fourquel Paranormal Activity 4 grossed an estimated $4.3M, down 50%, and has scared up $49.6M to date.Holding up well in its fourth round was the Kevin James comedy Here Comes the Boom which declined by 31% to an estimated $3.6M and a $35.6M total. Rounding out the top ten was the fright flick Silent Hill: Revelation which tumbled 59% during the post-Halloween frame to an estimated $3.3M giving Open Road $13.9M after ten days.Overseas action was once again dominated by James Bond as Skyfall, the 23rd film in the lucrative series, invaded most of the rest of the world in its second weekend grossing a jaw-dropping $156M propelling the international cume to a towering $287M in just ten days. Germany led the new markets with a $23.9M opening which was an impressive 77% bigger than Quantum of Solace, the last in the 007 franchise. The United Kingdom dipped just 25% in its second round to a stunning $25.7M for an amazing ten-day score of $85.8M. Skyfall drops into North America on Friday and will help the Sony release on its way to a global tally of $800M or much more.The top ten films grossed an estimated $119.5M which was up 19% from last year when Puss in Boots remained at number one with $33.1M; but down 13% from 2010 when Megamind opened on top with $46M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Amazon, in, song, El, King, Walt, movies, Office, WGN, Video","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ralph-and-Flight-Make-BO-Soar"},{"id":"47509122866974","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Skyfall Scores Bond’s Biggest-Ever Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Skyfall Scores Bond's Biggest-Ever OpeningSpielberg's Lincoln has a strong limited release bow.by Gitesh Pandya | November 11, 2012 |  CommentsJames Bond won a landslide victory at the North American box office which finally got the latest 007 adventure Skyfall which continued to break franchise records. The 23rd film in the 50-year-old series opened to an estimated $87.8M this weekend from 3,505 theaters for a stunning $25,050 average beating out lofty industry expectations to become the biggest Bond opening ever. Adding in Thursday’s $2.2M from an early full-day launch in 463 premium large format screens (including 320 IMAX) the four-day bow came to an eye-popping $90M. Daniel Craig anchored for the third time, Judi Dench returned for her third decade in the series, and newcomers Javier Bardem and Ralph Fiennes joined the cast in this installment.The Friday-to-Sunday debut was a sturdy 30% bigger than the $67.5M opening of the last Bond picture Quantum of Solace in 2008 and a whopping 115% better than the $40.8M of 2006’s Casino Royale which was Craig’s first turn in the tuxedo. Skyfall also blew away Pierce Brosnan’s best opening as the dashing MI6 agent – $47.1M for 2002’s Die Another Day. These last three 007 films all opened in mid-November and finished with $160-170M domestically.Directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes (American Beauty), Skyfall earned glowing reviews from film critics and also won over ticket buyers with an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore. Add in the 7% jump in sales from Friday to Saturday (fellow sequel Quantum dipped 4%) and the newest Bond is set up well for the weeks ahead as positive word-of-mouth should lead to continued strength into December. Competition from A-list action vehicles is also minimal over the next few weeks. Rival studios were scared away by Skyfall which arrived as the only new wide release this weekend.Friday kicked off with $31.7M, Saturday rose to $33.9M and Sunday is estimated by Sony to slide 35% to $22.2M. A fantastic $13.1M of the weekend business came from IMAX screens marking that company’s best non-summer opening ever. Studio research showed that 60% of the audience was male and 75% was over 25. That marked a much older and more male skew than Quantum which was 54% male and 58% over 25. Due in part to MGM’s bankruptcy issues, a very long four-year gap was created in between 007 films. Brosnan’s first three spy films were released just two years apart while his final one was three years after the previous installment. Together, the four pictures grossed $1.5 billion worldwide making for some mighty big shoes that Craig had to fill, which he has since done with authority.Domestically, Skyfall delivered the seventh biggest November opening in history and the best for anything outside of the Twilight and Harry Potter franchises. The final Bella pic Breaking Dawn Part 2 opens next weekend in over 4,000 locations and will easily swipe the top spot. For 2012, Skyfall was the fourth best debut of the year and was in good company behind The Avengers, The Dark Knight Rises, and The Hunger Games. Based on past Bond trends, Skyfall has a very good chance of climbing past $250M by the end of its domestic run and will beat out every past Bond, Jason Bourne and Mission Impossible film domestically, internationally and worldwide.Speaking of the rest of the planet, Skyfall remained a juggernaut collecting an estimated $89M in its third weekend of international release. That propelled the overseas cume to $428.6M and the global haul to a stunning $518.6M smashing the half-billion-dollar barrier in a mere 17 days. Even more impressive is the fact that this massive tally includes just one weekend from North America and nothing yet from Japan which opens on December 1 and China which is still finalizing release plans. To date, Craig’s trio of 007 blockbusters have grossed a combined $1.7 billion worldwide and counting.On Monday, the new Bond will surpass the $432.2M of Casino Royale to set a new franchise record for international grosses. That pic also holds the global record with $599.6M and that mark should be obliterated next weekend. Also on Monday, Skyfall will become the second biggest blockbuster of all-time in the U.K. trailing just Avatar. It has amassed a towering $117.5M there to date and is holding up exceptionally well with $18.2M, off just 30% in its third frame. The global gross is on course to pass $900M and with such lucrative markets still to come, it may just become the first billion-dollar Bond.For those not interested in Javier Bardem’s bleached blonde hair, another bad guy seized second place with the 3D animated hit Wreck-It Ralph collecting a stellar $33.1M, according to estimates. in its sophomore round. The Disney hit dropped by only 33% and watched its ten-day cume soar to a terrific $93.7M. Compared to original toons opening on the first weekend of November, Ralph‘s second weekend drop was better than the 37% of 2010’s Megamind but on par with the 33% of 2007’s Bee Movie. Wreck-It Ralph will crack the $100M mark later this week thanks in part to Monday’s school closings due to the observance of Veterans Day, and then could end up with $170M+. Direct competition does not arrive until the Thanksgiving release of DreamWorks Animation’s Rise of the Guardians.Paramount saw a respectable hold for its Denzel Washington drama Flight which dropped 39% to an estimated $15.1M lifting the ten-day total to a solid $47.8M from under 2,100 theaters. The R-rated pic expanded slightly in its second weekend upping its theater count by 9%. while the average fell by 44%. A final gross near the $85M mark may result which would be encouraging given that Washington and director Robert Zemeckis lowered their fees to make the pic at a cost of only $31M. In its sophomore round, Flight averaged $7,377 from 2,047 sites.Ben Affleck’s Oscar hopeful Argo dropped 34% (its biggest dip yet) to an estimated $6.7M and raised its cume to $85.7M for Warner Bros. on its way to the century club. Fox’s kidnapping sequel Taken 2 followed with an estimated $4M, off 32%, for a total of $131.3M.Despite the arrival of an 800-pound gorilla in Skyfall, the overall marketplace remained robust with the top five holdovers all declining by less than 40% each. And the top four movies are all big studio offerings that have won plenty of praise from film critics so multiplexes are filled with quality product right now.The rest of the top five featured films in a tight range separated by just $200,000 so the final order may change on Monday when official weekend grosses are reported. Sony’s comedy Here Comes the Boom has been holding up well and took in an estimated $2.55M, down just 28%, putting the sum at $39.1M. Close behind with an estimated $2.53M was the Wachowski flop Cloud Atlas which fell 53% giving Warner Bros. only $22.7M to date which won’t even cover marketing expenses.The martial arts actioner The Man with the Iron Fists collapsed in its sophomore frame falling 68% to an estimated $2.5M and $12.7M in ten days for Universal. The testosterone flick tied with the estrogen comedy Pitch Perfect which bounced back into the top ten thanks to amazing legs. The college comedy enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten easing just 18% pushing the cume up to an impressive $62M. Rounding out the list with an estimated $2.35M was the hit toon Hotel Transylvania which fell 47% and has banked $140.9M to date. It is now the fifth highest-grossing film of Adam Sandler’s career which has included 13 entries into the century club.Steven Spielberg’s much-hyped political drama Lincoln got off to a sensational start in platform release opening to an estimated $900,000 from only 11 locations for a scorching $81,818 average. Earning strong reviews, the PG-13 film stars Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th U.S. president during his time after re-election as he fought with Congress to pass an amendment to abolish slavery. Lincoln was produced by DreamWorks and distributed through its deal with Disney. It expands nationwide this Friday into over 1,500 theaters as it tries to establish itself as a serious Oscar contender that can also play to paying audiences. Spielberg’s subject matter is much more American this time compared to his one-two punch last holiday season when he directed The Adventures of Tintin and the World War I saga War Horse.The top ten films grossed an estimated $159.1M which was up 28% from last year when Immortals debuted at number one with $32M; and up 48% from 2010 when Megamind remained on top with $29.1M.Get earlier box office updates and analysis by following BoxOfficeGuru.com on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"politics, drama, Pet, play, Paquin, Emmys, History, awards, Fall, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Skyfall-Scores-Bonds-BiggestEver-Opening"},{"id":"47509122841369","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Dominates Global Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Dominates Global Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | December 17, 2012 |  CommentsFans of Middle Earth ended their long wait and charged into North American multiplexes powering the new fantasy adventure The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey into the number one spot breaking the December opening weekend record in the process. Audiences around the world made the Peter Jackson film the most popular movie on the planet as no other studio dared to challenge Bilbo Baggins and his gang with any other new releases.The Hobbit scored an estimated $84.8M in ticket sales this weekend accounting for about 60% of the marketplace. Warner Bros. opened the first chapter of this new trilogy in 4,045 total domestic theaters (also a new December record) and averaged a sensational $20,958 per location. The adventure tale was offered in many different viewing formats including 3D, IMAX, and High Frame Rate (HFR) as well as combinations of these formats. 3D was offered in 3,160 of the locations (6,500 total screens) while HFR was in 461 sites and 326 theaters had IMAX. 3D and IMAX screens had higher ticket prices which helped to boost the overall gross. Audiences were evenly split on paying extra for the additional dimension. 2D accounted for 51% of the gross while 49% was from the 3D screens.A new December opening weekend record was set by Hobbit. The previous high was set five years ago this very weekend when Will Smith’s I Am Legend bowed to $77.2M with no help from 3D. Avatar had the biggest December debut for a 3D film with $77M in 2009. Factoring in three years of ticket price increases, Hobbit’s opening weekend audience size was roughly the same as Avatar’s. Both were near-three-hour effects-driven 3D epics from Oscar-winning directors opening on a mid-December Friday.The turnout for the new Gandalf flick was extremely front-loaded. Friday kicked off with $37.5M including a stunning $13M from Thursday night post-midnight shows. Saturday tumbled 25% to $28.2M while the studio is projecting a 32% drop on Sunday to $19.1M. The breakdown over the three-day period was very similar to the debut frame of The Hunger Games from last March which, like Hobbit, had a huge midnight start, did 44% of its weekend gross on Friday and had a 25% drop from Friday-to-Saturday. Both films also earned a solid A grade from CinemaScore. After its front-loaded start, Hunger went on to have strong legs topping the charts for four consecutive weeks. Hobbit has the Christmas and New Year’s holidays still to come plus no competing event films are opening soon so its road ahead looks promising.Males made up 57% of the audience and those over 25 were 58% of the crowd. IMAX venues grossed $10.1M accounting for a solid 12% of the weekend take. This was a brand that fans felt was worth paying extra for. Plus IMAX screenings offered a special preview featuring the first nine minutes of next summer’s Star Trek Into Darkness from Paramount. Last December, it was Paramount’s Mission: Impossible IMAX release which was coupled with the opening scenes of The Dark Knight Rises from Warner Bros. The studio did not have a breakdown for the HFR sales on Unexpected Journey.The Hobbit invaded much of the world this weekend and opened to an excellent $138.2M from 56 international markets since its Wednesday launch in initial territories. That amounts to a worldwide opening of $223M with the holidays still to come. Also, major markets like Russia (December 19), Australia (December 26), and China (TBD) are still to open. 3D was more popular outside of North America where the screens accounted for 60% of the gross. Leading the way were the U.K. with $18.3M, Germany with $16.3M, France with $12.7M, and Korea with $8.5M.Produced with MGM, the new Middle Earth trilogy will continue with The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug which bows this same week next year on December 13, 2013, followed by the final chapter The Hobbit: There and Back Again opening the following summer on July 18, 2014. Warner Bros. has slotted the final Hobbit into the key July frame that the studio found enormous success with in past years with its recent Dark Knight and Harry Potter films.Slipping only 29% and rising into the second place slot was the animated adventure Rise of the Guardians with an estimated $7.4M. Paramount has grossed $71.4M to date and is hoping that strength over the coming Christmas holidays will get it into the century club. After securing seven Golden Globe nominations, the most for any film, Disney expanded the run of its historical drama Lincoln which placed third with an estimated $7.2M. Adding 271 locations, the Steven Spielberg hit dipped only 19% in its sixth round upping the cume to $107.9M. On Thursday, the presidential pic became the director’s 15th $100M+ domestic grosser and the first for Daniel Day-Lewis who is currently seen as the front-runner to win the Best Actor Oscar.The James Bond smash Skyfall followed in fourth with an estimated $7M, down 35%, for a total to date of $272.4M. Agent 007 collected an additional $12.2M overseas boosting the international gross to $678.7M and the global haul to a staggering $951M. It should break the $1 billion mark before the year is up.Off 35% in its fourth round was the 3D epic Life of Pi with an estimated $5.4M giving Fox’s Ang Lee film $69.6M to date. Pi earned three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture – Drama and Best Director. This weekend saw an estimated $11.5M from a limited number of international markets for an overseas total of $129.4M led by China’s humongous $84.3M. The worldwide figure stands at $199M. The vampire juggernaut The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 fell 44% to an estimated $5.2M pushing the cume to $276.9M. It is currently running $10.5M (4%) ahead of Part 1 from this time last year.Hit toon Wreck-It Ralph slipped 33% to an estimated $3.3M giving Disney $168.8M to date. Close behind with an estimated $3.2M was the Gerard Butler flop Playing for Keeps which fell 44% in its second weekend. The FilmDistrict release has banked a puny $10.8M in ten days.Grossing an estimated $2.4M was FilmDistrict stablemate Red Dawn which declined by 44% for a $40.9M cume to date. Rounding out the top ten was Silver Linings Playbook which jumped back onto the list thanks to its scant 4% dip to an estimated $2.1M despite having no extra screens added. The Weinstein Co. release scored four big Globe nods including Best Picture – Comedy or Musical and showed that while the awards may not have much prestige or industry respect, they do make an impact on general moviegoers and studio marketing campaigns and can drive extra ticket sales. Total is now $17M from 371 theaters with an expansion planned for Christmas.The top ten films grossed an estimated $128M which was up 21% from last year when Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows opened at number one with $39.6M; and up 2% from 2010 when TRON: Legacy debuted in the top spot with $44M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"satire, Kemper, cancelled, movies, cooking, Turner, Awards, Comics, Arrowverse, Holidays, DC, Superheroes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Dominates-Global-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509121168151","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Threepeats, Western &amp; Musical Rock","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hobbit Threepeats, Western &amp; Musical Rockby Gitesh Pandya | December 30, 2012 |  CommentsFor a third consecutive frame, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey led the North American box office but this time was joined by a trio of new releases opening on Christmas Day which filled up the next spots on the charts over a red hot final weekend of 2012.Smashing through the $200M barrier, The Hobbit collected an estimated $32.9M in its third journey pushing the 17-day cume up to a sizable $222.7M. Warner Bros. enjoyed a slim 11% decline and fared very well during this past Christmas week. Finishing with $290M seems very likely while reaching the $300M mark remains a possibility as well. Hobbit should surpass $700M globally before the start of 2013.Quentin Tarantino enjoyed the biggest debut of his career with his latest film Django Unchained which took in an estimated $30.7M over the weekend and a superb $64M in the six days since its Christmas Day launch on Tuesday. That’s already bigger than his old career best opening week (first seven days) of $53.7M for his last film Inglourious Basterds which debuted on a summer Friday in 2009.The slave Western starring Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, and Leonardo DiCaprio averaged a strong $10,195 from 3,010 locations making for the best average of any wide release. That is especially impressive for an R-rated film that runs nearly three hours long. Controversy related to Django’s language and violence resulted in extra press coverage and more buzz and multiplexes enjoyed the benefits.The Weinstein Co. is positioning the revenge film as both an awards contender and a commercial blockbuster and so far is succeeding on both fronts. Reviews have been very positive and the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A-. Django Unchained already seems on track to beat the $120.5M of Basterds to become Tarantino’s highest grossing film ever.Finishing close behind in third place was the acclaimed musical Les Miserables with an estimated $28M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a sturdy $67.4M since its Christmas launch. The Universal release averaged a terrific $9,960 from only 2,814 locations and is aiming for a long run ahead thanks to excellent word-of-mouth and upcoming awards activity including Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins which are expected.The Hugh Jackman-led film started off with the second best Christmas Day opening in history with $18.2M on Tuesday trailing only the $24.6M Friday of Sherlock Holmes in 2009. Compared to Django, Les Miserables has seen more erosion over the six-day launch period. But since it is based on a world-famous musical, the run was expected to have a big upfront showing of die-hard fans. Studio exit polls showed that the audience was 67% female with the overall CinemaScore being a glowing A grade.Produced for $61M, the PG-13 film enjoyed international success too with $38.3M this weekend from only eight markets, mostly in the Pacific Rim, for a $48.7M cume and $116.2M worldwide total so far with plenty more to come. Korea accounts for nearly half of the overseas tally with a sensational $20.1M beating the opening of The Hobbit.Opening in fourth place was the Billy Crystal-Bette Midler family comedy Parental Guidance with $14.8M and $29.6M since its Christmas Day bow. The PG-rated pic about grandparents having to care for their modern grandkids averaged a moderate $4,396 over the weekend period. With few clean options this holiday season that the whole family can enjoy together, Guidance connected with its target audience and will now try to keep it going through January when direct competition will still be light. Fox’s $25M production played to a crowd that was 52% female and 55% over 25. Reviews were lousy.Tom Cruise dropped down to fifth place with his latest action entry Jack Reacher which dipped a reasonable 10% to an estimated $14M pushing the ten-day total up to $44.7M for Paramount. Judd Apatow’s new comedy This is 40 climbed up 14% from last weekend and grossed an estimated $13.2M for a ten-day take of $37.1M. The Paul Rudd-Leslie Mann pic picked up steam after Christmas once its target audience became more available, however the Universal title still sits far behind the $65.9M that Knocked Up grossed in its first ten days in 2007.Moviegoers with extra time on their hands caught up with one of the hottest Oscar hopefuls out there, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln. The Daniel Day-Lewis starrer surged 36% from last weekend – the best jump in the top ten – and took in an estimated $7.5M bumping the cume up to a sturdy $132M for Disney. The Republican president has been cleaning up at the box office and has plenty of firepower left especially with the expected boatload of Oscar nominations coming in less than two weeks. Lincoln is now the top-grossing drama of 2012. Another older-skewing film that saw sales climb from last weekend was the Barbra Streisand comedy The Guilt Trip which banked an estimated $6.7M, up 24% from its disappointing debut. The Paramount title has collected only $21.1M in 12 days.Animated films rounded out the top ten. Disney’s 3D re-release of Monsters, Inc. shot up 33% and grossed an estimated $6.4M for $18.5M after 12 days. The Pixar hit’s lifetime total now stands at $274.4M. Rival DreamWorks Animation suffered a 17% decline for its holiday adventure Rise of the Guardians which did an estimated $4.9M upping the cume to $90.2M. Studios missed out on a major opportunity by not releasing any major new toons this Christmas.The James Bond cash cow Skyfall fell from the top ten in its eighth round, however it reached a key milestone by breaking the $1 billion barrier in worldwide box office. Sony’s spy actioner captured an estimated $4.6M domestically, off a scant 2%, raising its sum to an incredible $289.6M. Overseas, Daniel Craig and company took in $10.3M boosting the hefty international tally to $710.6M and the worldwide haul to a cool $1B. In the U.K, Skyfall has become the top-grossing film of all-time and the first blockbuster ever to cross the £100M mark.The Weinstein Co. went fully nationwide with its awards contender Silver Linings Playbook widening the seven-week old comedy from 371 to 745 locations and made an estimated $4.1M for a $5,517 average – commendable for a film this old. The average was higher than last weekend’s despite the expansion which indicates that audiences are still interested in the Bradley Cooper-Jennifer Lawrence pic regardless of the flood of other Oscar hopefuls out there. Cume to date is $27.4M.The acclaimed Osama bin Laden manhunt pic Zero Dark Thirty suffered a 23% drop from its red hot debut last weekend which was unusual for a holiday frame when moviegoers are more available. Still, Sony’s Kathryn Bigelow-directed thriller averaged a sensational $63,000 from only five theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Zero expands to more cities on Friday including San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston and goes nationwide on January 11, one day after Oscar nominations are announced.Lacking awards buzz, Matt Damon’s new film Promised Land attracted a mild debut in limited release grossing an estimated $190,150 from 25 locations for a $7,606 average. Focus plans to expand nationwide on Friday into an aggressive 1,500 theaters which will be challenging given the opening weekend performance and the fact that rival arthouse pic The Impossible – which has earned better reviews and stronger box office – also goes wide on the same day. Reviews have been mixed for Promised Land.The top ten films grossed an estimated $159.1M which was up 18% from last year when Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol was number one with $29.4M; and up 16% from 2010 when Little Fockers remained in the top spot with $25.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Pictures, spanish, 2016, IFC, breaking, Annual, TCM, WGN, psychological, finale, 2019, Channel, Rocketman, Tomatazos, 99%","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hobbit-Threepeats-Western-and-Musical-Rock"},{"id":"47509122857756","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Leads Feeding Frenzy on Record Thanksgiving","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Leads Feeding Frenzy on Record Thanksgivingby Gitesh Pandya | November 26, 2012 |  CommentsMoviegoers across North America stampeded into theaters driving the box office up to a record-breaking Thanksgiving holiday frame led by a mix of commercial hits, family films, and Oscar hopefuls. It was a true team effort as no one film broke through $45M over the Friday-to-Sunday weekend period. However, the top ten did see seven movies in double-digit millions, five over $20M, and four pictures averaging more than $10,000 each. Almost every dish on the turkey menu connected with audiences with the five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday span witnessing a jaw-dropping $290M in consumer spending, not counting the overpriced popcorn.Staying put at number one for a second time was the final chapter of the vampire soap opera The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 with an estimated $43.1M dropping 70%, exactly like Part 1 did one year ago last Thanksgiving. The Summit film has banked an impressive $227M after ten days (up 3% vs. Part 1’s $220.8M at the same point) on its way to a final of about $290M from the domestic market. The five-day Wednesday-to-Sunday tally was an incredible $64M.Overseas, Bella and Bella Junior grossed a stellar $97.4M from 73 territories boosting the international sum to $350.8M and the worldwide haul to $577.7M allowing the five-film franchise to smash the $3 billion mark in cumulative grosses. Part 2 will become the highest-grossing installment in the series with possibly $800M or more from around the world. Four of the five Twilight films were released on the lucrative weekend before Thanksgiving and Summit’s new owner Lionsgate has already planted flags on those frames over the next three years for its remaining Hunger Games films.Another fan of mid-November is James Bond (6 of his last 7 pics launched then) and the secret agent found himself in second place once again with Skyfall grossing an estimated $36M for an encouraging decline of just 12%. That was a better Thanksgiving weekend hold than for past pics. Quantum of Solace fell by 30% (also in its third round) while Daniel Craig’s first outing in Casino Royale saw a 25% dip in its sophomore frame. Audiences are liking Skyfall and it’s the only action movie on a grand scale that is in the marketplace right now. Releasing it everywhere else in the world before America hasn’t stopped it from becoming a megahit here. With a stellar $51M over the long five-day holiday session, the 007 pic raised its domestic total to an amazing $221.7M becoming the first Bond film to crush the double-century mark. It should now be able to surpass $275M and even has an outside chance at hitting $300M.Sony’s international markets grossed an estimated $41.3M on Skyfall this weekend while MGM’s distribution partners did not have updates as of Sunday. Australia generated a hefty $12.5M debut this weekend while the United Kingdom’s cume surged to $144.5M after its fifth round. That put the global gross at over $790M with Japan set to open on Saturday. Craig’s three-pack of Bond films have collectively grossed just under $2 billion.Posting an incredible take for a two-and-a-half-hour historical drama in its second weekend of wide release, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln followed with an estimated $25M over three days and $34.1M across five from only 2,018 playdates. The Daniel Day-Lewis presidential pic rose a healthy 19% from last weekend’s wide break. Part of that was due to the addition of 243 locations but even the per-theater average of $12,398 inched up 5% from a week ago signaling strength with its audience and sustained interest. Lincoln has collected $62.2M to date and Disney should expect a trip to the $100M club, the 15th for Spielberg as a director. With lots of Oscar talk and Day-Lewis seen as the frontrunner to win Best Actor (some industry insiders call him a lock), the sturdy legs should continue into December.A trio of PG-rated 3D films followed. Leading the way among the holiday weekend’s new releases was the DreamWorks Animation offering Rise of the Guardians which came in below expectations with an estimated $24M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and $32.6M over five days. Playing in 3,653 sites, the comedic adventure pic about Santa Claus, Jack Frost, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, and Sandman all teaming up to fight the Boogey Man from hurting kids averaged a mediocre $6,577 per theater. The five-day holiday opening came in below the three-day non-holiday debuts of past DreamWorks films like Puss in Boots, Bee Movie, Over the Hedge, and How to Train Your Dragon. In fact, Guardians suffered the worst opening for a DreamWorks Animation production since the $10.1M five-day holiday launch of the 2003 bomb Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas.With Christmas ahead and Rise having a winter and holiday theme to it, the $145M production could certainly display legs for the rest of the year. But 3D animated movies from the industry’s mightiest players with huge marketing pushes and coveted holiday release slots always do better. Reviews were generally positive and good enough for what these types of family films require. But competition may have been a factor with the next two films on the charts, Life of Pi and the resilient Wreck-It Ralph, taking away some of Guardian’s audience. The animation giant’s distribution deal with Paramount ends this year with Fox taking over the releasing duties in the spring.A glowing A CinemaScore grade bodes well for the future as the toon hopes to benefit from solid recommendations from those who did come out this long weekend. Only 35% of the business was from 3D screens. Rise opened in China last week, Russia this weekend (at the top spot) and invades 50 international markets next weekend for its major overseas push. 3D animated films tend to do significantly more business outside of North America.Opening in fifth place was Ang Lee’s 3D adventure drama Life of Pi which captured an estimated $22M over the weekend from 2,927 theaters and a robust $30.2M over the five-day holiday. Averaging a solid $7,516 over three days, the PG-rated film about a teen from India stranded in the Pacific on a boat with a tiger has earned strong reviews from critics and plenty of Oscar talk in the Best Picture race. A high 68% of the gross came from 3D which was widely praised in reviews.The opening was on par with how Martin Scorsese’s Academy Award-winning Hugo did this same weekend a year ago. Both films were from Oscar-winning directors using 3D for the first time, based on best-selling books, had adolescent protagonists, great reviews, awards chatter, and were set outside of the U.S. The major difference was that Hugo was released in less than half the number of theaters. It bowed in fifth place over the turkey frame as well to the tune of $11.4M from 1,277 theaters for a $8,899 three-day average and $15.4M five-day debut. Given how the more narrow release packs more people into the available showtimes, the difference in averages between Pi and Hugo was not too significant. The Scorsese picture did go on to expand out to 2,600+ locations during December and then re-expand in late January when Oscar nominations were announced while Life of Pi is already very wide and so has less room to widen in future weeks. But the road ahead looks bright since word-of-mouth is good and critics lists and awards nominations can keep momentum going. The CinemaScore grade was an A-, good but not amazing.Studio research showed that Pi skewed 52% male and 60% 25 and older. The film was never an easy sell given that it had no major stars, no American connection, plus the marketplace had no shortage of high-profile options for those looking for a powerful drama or something for the whole family. Overseas, Pi launched in four markets with $17.5M led by $10.5M from China on 4,500 3D screens and $3.4M from India in 697 locations. It rolls out around the world over the weeks ahead with many launching right before Christmas.Still pulling in strong business in its fourth round of play, Disney’s Wreck-It Ralph took in an estimated $16.8M representing a slim 10% slide from last weekend. That was an impressive hold especially with Guardians and Pi both coming into the marketplace as last Thanksgiving’s holdover toons dropped 31-37% each. It was also the best gross all year for any toon in its fourth frame beating out hits like The Lorax and Brave. With a hefty $23M in business across the five-day turkey span, Ralph has now smashed up $149.5M and has plenty more to go as it entertains kids as well as older nostalgia-loving gamers. 19 international territories have added $41.2M so far for a global gross of $190.7M to date.Posting a respectable opening in seventh place was the long-delayed remake Red Dawn with an estimated $14.6M over three days and $22M across the long five-day frame. Produced by MGM and released by FilmDistrict, the PG-13 film starring Chris Hemsworth (Thor) averaged a decent $5,358 over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Males overwhelmingly led the way making up 62% of the audience for the tale of a group of American teens that must defend a small town from an invasion by the North Korean military. 52% were 25 and older. The 1984 original led by Patrick Swayze featured Soviet baddies. With weak reviews and a lukewarm B CinemaScore grade, the road ahead looks bleak.Films in the thick of the race for a Best Picture Oscar nomination rounded out the top ten. Denzel Washington’s Flight held up incredibly well grossing an estimated $8.6M, off a scant 2%, boosting Paramount’s cume to $74.9M. The Weinstein Co. successfully expanded the latest of its handful of awards contenders, the critically-acclaimed Silver Linings Playbook, into wider play and nabbed ninth place with an estimated $4.6M from just 367 locations for a terrific $12,597 average. The Bradley Cooper-Jennifer Lawrence indie comedy has collected $6.5M to date and will continue to expand in December.Rounding out the top ten in its seventh weekend on the list was the Oscar player Argo with an estimated $3.9M, down 4%, giving Warner Bros. $98.1M to date. Ben Affleck’s hostage crisis drama is a week away from breaking into the century club. Overseas, Argo has taken in an additional $50M to date with most of awards season still ahead.The period costume drama Anna Karenina expanded modestly in its sophomore round taking in an estimated $832,000 from 66 locations (up from 16) for a $12,606 average. The figure was solid, but should get diluted down as it rolls out into second-tier markets in the weeks ahead. Fox Searchlight debuted its Anthony Hopkins-Helen Mirren pic Hitchcock on Friday in 17 locations and grossed an estimated $301,000 for a $17,706 average. Reviews have been mixed and not at the level of top awards contenders, although the lead actors have gotten good marks.The top ten films surged to an estimated $198.6M which was up a hearty 34% from last year when The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 held at number one with $41.7M; and up 18% from 2010 when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stayed on top with $49.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Television, live, Mary, high, potter, slashers, Century","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Twilight-Leads-Feeding-Frenzy-on-Record-Thanksgiving"},{"id":"47509122872096","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Argo Leads a Lackluster Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Argo Leads a Lackluster WeekendPlus, none of the new releases performs very well.by Gitesh Pandya | October 29, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, with moviegoers yawning at the four new releases that Hollywood served up, the hit hostage crisis thriller Argo climbed up into the number one spot in its third frame leading an overall lackluster session. Ticket sales took an extra hit on the east coast as people prepared for the arrival of a monster storm set to impact highly populated areas putting an extra dent into an already weak marketplace.Declining by just 25% in its third weekend, the Warner Bros. hit Argo won the box office crown with an estimated $12.4M which boosted the 17-day cume to a solid $60.8M. A final gross at or above the $100M mark still seems possible during its initial run. A re-release in January around the time when Oscar nominations are announced is a possibility which would all but guarantee an invitation to the century club. Argo became the first movie since 2010’s True Grit to rise up to the top spot in its third weekend.Terrific word-of-mouth is helping the Ben Affleck film reach new audiences and its pro-America ending is attracting business from red, blue, and swing states alike. Timing the release to the peak part of the presidential election season was no accident and the strategy is paying off. Upcoming films like Denzel Washington’s Flight, Steven Spielberg’s Lincoln, and the latest James Bond actioner Skyfall will provide stiff competition during the November weeks ahead but Argo hopes to hold its own and capitalize on strong reviews and glowing buzz.It was a tight two-way race for second place but according to Sunday estimates, Sony inched ahead with its blockbuster toon Hotel Transylvania which slipped only 27% to an estimated $9.5M in its fifth weekend. The Sony hit has grossed a stellar $130.4M to date. Over the last 13 years, no September release has grossed more.Opening close behind in third, if estimates hold, was the big-budget sci-fi epic Cloud Atlas which disappointed with an estimated $9.4M launch. The R-rated saga from the Wachowski siblings did manage to score the best per-theater average of any wide release with $4,681 from 2,008 locations including higher-priced IMAX screens. Starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Susan Sarandon, and others, the nearly-three-hour extravaganza turned out to be too experimental for mainstream audiences who could hardly tell from the advertising what the movie was even about.Atlas mixes together multiple stories from various times spanning 500 years with actors playing different roles jumping across race and gender barriers in the various eras. Reviews were mixed but generally more on the positive side. Warner Bros. was hoping that fans of the directors of the Matrix trilogy would come out for their newest adventure. However, these filmmakers have not had a film that truly excited all sci-fi fans since the first Neo pic in 1999 which put them on the map in the first place. The Matrix sequels from 2003 left a bad taste in the mouths of many while their 2008 take on Speed Racer was a commercial and critical bomb.Cloud Atlas will have a difficult road ahead as indicated by its troubling C+ CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that the audience was mostly split evenly with males making up 51% of the crowd. The age breakdown was different as the film skewed much older with 77% being over 25. With a budget of over $100M, the sci-fi pic will be hoping for a sizably better response from international audiences which just may happen. Last year’s period action epic The Three Musketeers, also co-financed by German money, opened in North America to a similarly weak $8.7M but fared well overseas with the rest of the world accounting for a whopping 85% of its global gross.Suffering the worst second weekend drop yet for the franchise, Paranormal Activity 4 crumbled by 70% to an estimated $8.7M and raised its total to $42.6M since opening at 9pm two Thursdays ago. Last October’s third installment in the hit Paramount series tumbled by 65%. Look for the new chapter to end its run quickly in the area of $55M, or about half of the $104M of the last film, putting the domestic total for the four-pack of thrillers at about $350M with combined production costs of only $13M. Paranormal Activity 4 grossed $14.1M overseas this weekend from holdover markets and a dozen new territories. The international total sits at $48.3M while the global tally is now $90.9M with Japan, France and other markets set to open this next week..Two more sequels followed and were tied for fifth place with an estimated $8M each. Liam Neeson’s Taken 2 declined by a reasonable 40% pushing the cume to $117.4M for Fox. Open Road debuted its offering for Halloween with the 3D horror pic Silent Hill: Revelation but was met with a dismal $2,728 average from 2,933 theaters. The sequel came out a long time after its predecessor which debuted to a strong number one showing with $20.2M in April 2006. With a weak brand and ample competition from other fright films like Paranormal and Sinister, Revelation failed to generate any excitement. Poor reviews did not help any.Dropping only 35% was the Kevin James comedy Here Comes the Boom with an estimated $5.5M and a cume of just $30.6M for Sony. Word-of-mouth has been helping the horror hit Sinister which dipped only 43% in its third weekend to an estimated $5.1M for a solid $39.5M to date for Summit and Lionsgate. The companies also saw an estimated $5.1M for their detective thriller Alex Cross which fell a sharp 56% in its sophomore frame. With $19.4M in ten days, look for a $30M final.The Halloween teen comedy Fun Size crashed and burned with a poor tenth place bow collecting an estimated $4.1M from a very wide 3,014 locations for a pathetic $1,347 average. Paramount earned a B CinemaScore from audiences and the crowd was heavily young female. Studio research showed that 67% was female and 73% was under 25 for the PG-13 party pic. Fun Size cost $14M to produce.Following in the footsteps of the other new titles on the menu this weekend, Gerard Butler’s surfing film Chasing Mavericks flopped and was rejected by moviegoers. The Fox release opened to an estimated $2.2M, failed to make the top ten, and generated a dismal $1,099 average from 2,002 theaters. Reviews were bad and the audience was split evenly between men and women. The PG-rated film skewed older with 59% being over 25 while the CinemaScore grade was a respectable B+.Skyfall launched to impressive results in Europe and other territories this weekend with a stellar opening of $77.7M from 25 markets hitting the top spot everywhere. The United Kingdom led the way with $32.4M which was the second biggest Friday-to-Sunday opening in history trailing the final Harry Potter pic which was in 3D. The British debut was 30% higher than Quantum of Solace, the last film in the franchise. Other top openings included $9.1M in France, $8.6M in Russia, $6.5M in Brazil, and $6.1M in Korea. Additional countries get Skyfall next weekend while North America is among the final markets for the Sony smash with its November 9 debut. Bond films typically open stateside in mid-November close to the Thanksgiving holiday when overall moviegoing is robust. Domestically, Quantum opened one week before the first Twilight film while the latest 007 debuts a week prior to the vampire franchise’s closing installment.The top ten films grossed an estimated $75.6M which was down 16% from last year when Puss in Boots debuted at number one with $34.1M; and off 10% from 2010 when Saw 3D opened on top with $24.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"directors, First","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Argo-Leads-a-Lackluster-Weekend"},{"id":"47509124457262","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fourth Ice Age Pic Opens On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fourth Ice Age Pic Opens On Topby Gitesh Pandya | July 16, 2012 |  CommentsIn the calm before the Batstorm, just one new release dared to enter the marketplace. Fox’s 3D animated sequel Ice Age: Continental Drift topped the North American box office in its domestic debut leading a weekend session that fell below year-ago levels. Most holdovers enjoyed relatively low declines with just one title in the top ten falling by more than half. Studios mostly avoided opening anything big in fear of getting pulverized a week later by The Dark Knight Rises.Playing to a young audience that PG-13 comic book pics don’t cater to, Ice Age: Continental Drift opened at number one with an estimated $46M from 3,881 locations for a $11,853 average. It was the fourth chapter of the lucrative series, and second in 3D. The debut did not reach the levels of recent 3D summer toons Brave and Madagascar 3 which bowed to $66.6M and $60.3M, respectively. As the third big-brand offering in this genre over the last six weeks, some families may have felt they did not need to reach into the wallet again so soon for another pricey group outing to the multiplex. Reviews were not too positive but audiences were pleased giving the PG-rated film an A- grade. The demographic breakdown was basically even between males and females, and those over and under 25, indicating a broad audience.Drift opened just like the first installment of the series. The original Ice Age premiered to $46.3M in March 2002 on its way to $176.4M. But ticket prices were a lot lower then and there were no 3D surcharges so admissions on the new installment were much less. However, the prehistoric comedy franchise makes the bulk of its money overseas nowadays and Fox’s international launch two weeks ago got business going early. This weekend, Drift topped the offshore box office with a mammoth $95M propelling the international total to a stellar $339M and the global gross to $385M. Overseas cash for the first three films skyrocketed with the titles going from $207M to $461M to $691M. The entire Ice Age franchise has now raised its worldwide haul to an amazing $2.3 billion and the newest chapter should easily surpass $750M globally at its current trajectory.Sony took second place with its super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man which posted a strong hold in its second weekend taking in an estimated $35M for a 44% decline allowing the 13-day total to top the double century mark with $200.9M. Compared to other tentpoles opening midweek near the Fourth of July holiday, the webslinger fared well beating the 48% drop of 2007’s Transformers, the 49% of 2008’s Hancock, the 51% of 2010’s The Twilight Saga: Eclipse, and the 52% of last summer’s Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Of course, none of them faced a humongous juggernaut like The Dark Knight Rises in its third frame so chances are Amazing will get flattened from this Thursday night onwards. Still, a domestic final of around $280M could result.As with so many action franchises and 3D event films, The Amazing Spider-Man is seeing robust results around the world. It ranked second at the overseas box office with $66.6M pushing the offshore tally to $320.4M and global gross to $521.3M on its way to more than $800M. This weekend, the four-installment Spider-Man franchise broke the $3 billion mark in global box office.Leading the way among non-franchise films was the runaway hit comedy Ted which posted another terrific hold grossing an estimated $22.1M for a slender 31% decline. The R-rated hit smashed the $150M mark in just 16 days and has banked an incredible $159M to date. The $50M production is benefitting from strong word-of-mouth, low competition from raunchy comedies, and the starpower of Seth MacFarlane. If you’re a grown-up and want to laugh, there have hardly been any other good options this summer. A final gross of around $215M seems likely putting it ahead of such higher profile and more expensive summer offerings like Men in Black 3, Prometheus, and Snow White and the Huntsman. Early in its international run, Ted is doing gangbusters in Australia with $25.5M after its second weekend at number one, plus a slim sophomore slide.With a new 3D toon in town, Pixar’s Brave dropped 46% to an estimated $10.7M putting the 24-day sum at $195.6M. The Scottish princess continues to play like the animation studio’s 2008 flick WALL?E which dropped 46% to $10.1M in its fourth frame in July 2008 when it faced the opening of The Dark Knight. Brave looks capable of reaching more than $230M domestically.Male beefcake landed in fifth place as Channing Tatum and pals collected an estimated $9M with their stripper flick Magic Mike, off 42%, giving Warner Bros. $91.9M to date. The R-rated hit will cross the $100M mark in another week. Oliver Stone’s latest film Savages enjoyed a decent sophomore hold dropping 45% to an estimated $8.7M for a ten-day total of $31.5M. The $45M production is playing to an older more patient audience and had zero competition from newcomers so Universal’s decline was not exactly fabulous.Lionsgate followed with Madea’s Witness Protection which took in an estimated $5.6M, down 45%, for a $55.6M cume. Falling 48% in its second weekend was the music doc Katy Perry: Part of Me with an estimated $3.7M for a total of just $18.6M in 11 days.Enjoying the best hold by far in the top ten was Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom which continued to please the smarthouse crowd with an estimated $3.7M slipping a mere 19% in its eighth round. Focus has grossed an impressive $32.4M to date on its way to $45M+. Suffering the worst drop in the top ten was the 3D toon sequel Madagascar 3 which fell an understandable 54% to an estimated $3.5M as it took a severe hit from Scrat. But the Paramount release broke the double century mark and has now banked $203.7M domestically and $473.8M worldwide.The top ten films grossed an estimated $148.1M which was down a steep 40% from last year when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 opened at number one with an industry record $169.2M; and down 13% from 2010 when Inception debuted on top with $62.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Nominations, X-Men, Wars, FX, book, indiana, E!, rt, Out, Television, Podcast, The","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fourth-Ice-Age-Pic-Opens-On-Top"},{"id":"47509124451115","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne and The Campaign Dethrone the Batman","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Bourne and The Campaign Dethrone the Batmanby Gitesh Pandya | August 12, 2012 |  CommentsUniversal scored its industry-leading third number one opening of the summer with its franchise spy thriller The Bourne Legacy which knocked The Dark Knight Rises out of the top spot after a three-week reign atop the North American box office. Moviegoers also came out in healthy numbers for two new star-driven comedies as the political comedy The Campaign starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis and the marital tale Hope Springs with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones both connected with their target audiences. After back-to-back weekends when the Top 20 was down by more than 25% from last year, the marketplace rebounded back to normal levels for this time of year.Jeremy Renner anchored a solid, but not spectacular, opening for his latest franchise pic The Bourne Legacy which debuted to an estimated $40.3M from 3,746 theaters for an encouraging $10,749 average. The PG-13 film pulled in action fans despite the fact that star Matt Damon who played the title character of all three previous films, and director Paul Greengrass who helmed the last two installments, were gone this time. Adjusting for ten years of ticket price increases, Legacy sold roughly 400,000 more tickets on opening weekend than the first film in the franchise The Bourne Identity from June 2002.But given the cast and crew changes, Renner having no track record of anchoring a major film, and being among the last in a long line of summer action offerings, Legacy’s performance was reasonably good. The weekend gross was also close to the $40.8M of 2006’s Casino Royale which asked James Bond fans to forget Pierce Brosnan and accept newcomer Daniel Craig. Universal’s decision to bump its release date back a week from August 3 to August 10 certainly paid dividends as it would have split the action crowd with Total Recall last weekend. Plus the juggernaut The Dark Knight Rises was a week older this frame.Legacy played well across gender lines with men making up 52% of the crowd, according to studio research. Those 30 and older were a very high 69% as teen appeal was not strong. Produced for $125M, a reasonable cost for today’s franchise action films, The Bourne Legacy earned mixed reviews from film critics and audiences alike. The CinemaScore grade was a B which means word-of-mouth going forward will probably be only so-so. And the Friday-to-Saturday bump of 6% was just slightly better than the one posted last week by Recall which fell apart in its second weekend. Also challenging its legs will be the opening of another adult-skewing action sequel this Friday in The Expendables 2.Opening to good results in the runner-up spot was the Will Ferrell-Zach Galifianakis political comedy The Campaign with an estimated $27.4M from 3,205 theaters for an impressive $8,562 average. It was the third best opening of the year for an R-rated comedy behind only the $54.4M of surprise smash Ted, and the $36.3M of 21 Jump Street. Ferrell, who has not been seen on-screen with a major film in two years, flexed some starpower and fans eager to see him again turned out. The story involving rival bumbling political candidates provided very relevant subject matter which sparked interest in comedy fans. Plus the marketplace had almost nothing else offering laughs for grown-ups and reviews were better than necessary to sell this type of broad comedy.Produced for $60M, The Campaign will have no problem reaching a domestic gross that beats its production cost. Legs may not be that great as the CinemaScore grade of B- indicates that consumers were not terribly satisfied so word-of-mouth should be mixed. Campaign opened much like Ferrell’s last R-rated comedy Step Brothers which opened four years ago in late July with $30.9M when it also faced competition from both a Dark Knight hit and the Summer Olympics. Ferrell does have fans around the world and huge global crowds saw Galifianakis in both Hangover films so international potential is there, although a story about the world of American elections is not an easy sell.It was two for Batman Begins, four for The Dark Knight, and now The Dark Knight Rises ends its reign at the top of the box office at three weeks. With another franchise action film making a solid debut, the final Batman film from Christopher Nolan dropped 45% to an estimated $19.5M boosting the domestic total to $390.1M after 24 days for Warner Bros. Its 2008 predecessor enjoyed a smaller 39% decline in its fourth frame despite having to compete with the start of the Beijing Olympics. TDKR rose up to number 15 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $381M of last summer’s final wizard flick Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 which had the benefit of 3D surcharges.The Bane blockbuster is running 12% behind the pace of the Joker flick and still seems to be on a trajectory to end with roughly $445M from North America. Overseas, Rises made $34.2M, off a troubling 49%, for an international total of $445.3M and global haul of $835.4M. Nolan’s Gotham City trilogy has now amassed an incredible $2.2 billion worldwide and counting.Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones enjoyed a respectable start for their relationship comedy Hope Springs which bowed to an estimated $15.6M from 2,361 playdates for a $6,607 average. The PG-13 film about a middle-aged couple seeking counseling to enliven their marriage grossed $20.1M since its Wednesday release and played, as expected, to the Meryl crowd. Studio research showed that the audience was overwhelmingly adult female – 66% were women and 69% were 40 or over. Reviews were positive but not very enthusiastic and paying audiences were not especially excited as the CinemaScore grade was a B.Older skewing films tend to have good legs so Sony is hoping to keep Springs in theaters until the fall and make its grosses over the long-term. The studio has utilized the first half of August to target older women before with 2009’s Julie &amp; Julia starring Streep which debuted to $20M representing only 21% of its final gross of $94.1M, and 2010’s Eat Pray Love with Julia Roberts which opened to $23.1M which was 29% of its $80.6M total. Both were adapted from best-selling books, though, whereas Hope came from an original screenplay. Plus with Sunday’s close of the Olympics, the target audience will become more available in the days ahead. Sony and MGM acquired domestic rights for a fee in the mid-teen millions and Sony handled marketing and distribution duties.A pair of sophomores followed with each dropping on a different trajectory. Fox’s kid sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days fell a reasonable 44% to an estimated $8.2M pushing the ten-day total to $30.6M. A final take close to the $52.7M of the last installment of the series should result. Sony’s much more expensive sci-fi remake Total Recall was not as lucky and tumbled by a troubling 68% to an estimated $8.1M. By comparison, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1990 original opened at the same level but dropped only 41% to $15.1M in its second weekend. The Colin Farrell actioner has collected a disappointing $44.2M in ten days and looks headed for a $60-65M finish from North America putting even more pressure on international markets to deliver big crowds. An overseas expansion this weekend into new territories like Russia, Japan, and Mexico resulted in an estimated $18.7M frame from 38 markets raising the offshore cume to just $27.5M.The top ten’s only toon Ice Age: Continental Drift held up well again with an estimated $6.8M, off a slender 22%, lifting the sum for the 3D Fox pic to $144.1M. Universal’s hit comedy Ted followed with an estimated $3.3M, down 42%, and a cume to date of $209.9M. 3D dance sequel Step Up Revolution fell 52% to an estimated $2.9M giving Lionsgate $30.2M to date.Two films tied for the ten spot with estimates of $2.2M each. Fox’s alien comedy The Watch crumbled 66% and has banked only $31.4M to date while Sony’s 3D super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man fell 50% with a domestic total of $255.5M thus far.The reality stunt pic Nitro Circus the Movie 3D debuted to poor results outside of the top ten with an estimated $1.2M from 800 locations for a dismal $1,460 average. Since debuting on Wednesday, the R-rated Jackass-type flick aimed at young men has grossed $2.2M in five days. Opening to good results in platform release was Spike Lee’s Red Hook Summer with an estimated $42,100 from four New York locations for a $10,525 average. The Variance/40 Acres release earned decent reviews and expands to new markets later this month.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.2M which was even with last year when Rise of the Planet of the Apes stayed at number one with $27.8M; but up 5% from 2010 when The Expendables debuted on top with $34.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ABC, discovery, based, 21st, CBS, comics, Dark, Amazon, comic, universal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Bourne-and-The-Campaign-Dethrone-the-Batman"},{"id":"47509124460335","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Amazing Spider-Man Leads Six-Day Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Amazing Spider-Man Leads Six-Day FrameThe latest Spider-Man film makes $65M for the weekend, and $140M in six days.by Gitesh Pandya | July 8, 2012 |  CommentsThe summer of super heroes continued with the top spot debut of The Amazing Spider-Man which captured the number one spot over its extended holiday opening in North America. Sony’s 3D reboot of the lucrative movie franchise grossed an estimated $65M over the Friday-to-Sunday frame and an exceptional $140M over the six days since its Tuesday launch. It was the fifth best extended opening over the Independence Day holiday trailing Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($180.7M in 6.5 days in 2011), Spider-Man 2 ($180.1M in 6 days in 2004), The Twilight Saga: Eclipse ($176.4M in 6 days in 2010), and Transformers ($155.4M in 6.5 days in 2007). Comparisons are not entirely fair since films debut in different ways with the actual 4th of July holiday falling on a different day each year.Amazing averaged $15,053 from 4,318 locations over the weekend portion. Appeal was broad but older males led the way. Studio research showed that 58% of the crowd was male and 54% was 25 and older. 44% of the gross came from 3D screens which was not too high. $14.3M came from IMAX screens accounting for 10% of the six-day box office. The overall results were solid especially for a property being rebooted so soon. The first Spider-Man opened one decade ago in May 2002 swiping the all-time opening weekend record from Harry Potter while the most recent webslinger flick bowed just five years ago in May 2007 when Spider-Man 3 also set a new all-time opening weekend record taking the crown from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. Amazing told the origin story once again before heading into a new hero tale. Many fans felt there was no need to reboot the series at this point in time but actively making a new film allowed Sony to retain the rights to the movie franchise. The studio has the sequel already set for release on the first weekend of May in 2014.The Andrew Garfield-led tentpole began its run with a $35.9M opening day on Tuesday. Sales fell 35% to $23.3M on Wednesday for the 4th of July and then dipped 32% to $15.8M on Thursday giving it $75M in the bank before the weekend period began. Friday rose 31% to $20.7M, Saturday climbed 15% to $23.9M and Sunday is estimated to fall 14% to $20.5M. Reviews were mixed but generally upbeat and audiences were happy with what they paid to see as the CinemaScore grade was an A-. The webslinger has 11 days of super hero business to itself before the July 20 launch of The Dark Knight Rises which is expected to deliver the second largest debut of the year crushing all foes in the process.Overseas, where The Amazing Spider-Man could really mint most of its money, results were strong with an estimated $129.1M this weekend from 70 markets boosting the international total to $201.6M and the worldwide haul to $341.2M. Top new debuts were $18.1M in the U.K., $10.8M from Russia, Mexico with $9.6M, $8M in France, and Australia at $7.5M. Holdover cumes were led by $25.2M in Korea and $20.7M in Japan.Last week’s top film Ted enjoyed a solid sophomore hold despite the arrival of a super hero tentpole grossing an estimated $32.6M for second place. The Seth MacFarlane comedy is benefiting from good word-of-mouth and a lack of competition for comedies for grown-ups right now. Dropping only 40%, the Universal release has upped its ten-day tally to $120.2M and seems headed for an amazing finish near the $200M mark. Ted cost only $50M to produce. Also faring well was the 3D animated hit Brave which slipped 41% to an estimated $20.2M in its third round holding steady in the bronze medal position. The Disney/Pixar release has collected an impressive $174.5M to date.Oliver Stone was back with his latest film Savages which opened in fifth place with a solid $16.2M, according to estimates. The Universal release averaged $6,150 from 2,628 locations and played to mature adults and the director’s fan base. It was the third biggest career debut for Stone after last fall’s Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and 2006’s World Trade Center. Produced for $45M, the drug thriller Savages was based on the best-selling novel and stars Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro and Salma Hayek. Reviews were mixed. The R-rated film skewed older with 61% of the audience being 30 and older while the gender split was even with females accounting for 51% of the crowd. A troubling C+ CinemaScore puts into question the road ahead, however no new films aimed at adults will open next weekend.Channing Tatum’s hit stripper drama Magic Mike fell badly in its second weekend dropping 60% to an estimated $15.6M. The Warner Bros. pic tumbled 41% in its second day of release last weekend hinting at a rocky road ahead and the sophomore performance fell sharply as expected. With $72.8M in ten days, Mike will need to hold up better in the days ahead in order to finish with $100M.Madea’s Witness Protection suffered the usual steep sophomore fall that Tyler Perry films see. The Lionsgate pic fell 60% to an estimated $10.2M boosting the cume to $45.8M on its way to a $60M conclusion. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation followed with their 3D winner Madagascar 3 which took in an estimated $7.7M, off just 35%, for a cume of $196M thus far.The 3D pop music doc Katy Perry: Part of Me bowed in eighth place with modest results grossing an estimated $7.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday span and $10.3M since opening on Thursday. The Paramount release was aimed at teen and tween girls and failed to make it past the multi-platinum singer’s fan base. Playing in 2,730 theaters, the PG-rated pic averaged a dull $2,619 over the weekend. Reviews were good but mostly irrelevant from a commercial perspective since the target audience puts zero value into what middle-aged film critics have to say.The studio saw much better results from pop prince Justin Bieber last year when his 3D concert biopic Never Say Never bowed to $30.3M. Katy had similar marketing gimmicks like special advance showings and interactive engagement with fans over social media. Studio research showed that 81% of the audience was female and 72% was under 25. What little good news the film saw was from its A CinemaScore and low $12M budget.Wes Anderson’s critical darling Moonrise Kingdom eased a scant 6% to an estimated $4.6M giving Focus $26.9M to date. The upscale crowd is still turning out for this as the top smarthouse choice of the moment. Woody Allen’s latest offering To Rome With Love expanded nationwide in its third frame and grossed an estimated $3.5M from 806 theaters for a modest $4,345 average. It was a weaker showing than the veteran filmmaker’s hit from last summer Midnight in Paris which made $5.8M in its first weekend of wide play last June in its fourth round. Rome has met with far less love from critics than Paris did and sits at a total of $5.3M for Sony Classics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $182.7M which was up 30% from last year when Transformers: Dark of the Moon remained at number one with $47.1M; and was even with 2010 when Despicable Me debuted on top with $56.4M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cars, films, Walt, BAFTA, on, Movies, Esquire, spider-man, Globe, supernatural, lord, Avengers, of, archives, movie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Amazing-SpiderMan-Leads-SixDay-Frame"},{"id":"47509124453164","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Dark Knight Rises Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Dark Knight Rises AgainTotal Recall and Wimpy Kid take #2 and #3 in another sluggish weekend.by Gitesh Pandya | August 6, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, a pair of new franchise films could not stop Bane and Batman from ruling the North American box office for a third straight time as The Dark Knight Rises continued to reign supreme, once again taking the gold medal position. The big-budget sci-fi remake Total Recall took home the silver while the bronze went to the kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days. Neither of the new releases showed major muscle and the overall Top 20 slumped 27% from last year’s levels as overall moviegoing continued to be affected by a lack of exciting titles and the ongoing drama of the London Olympics.For a third consecutive weekend, audiences made The Dark Knight Rises the most popular film in the land as the super hero saga grossed an estimated $36.4M, down a reasonable 41% from last weekend. The Warner Bros. smash has now grossed a mammoth $354.6M in only 17 days with $48M of that sum (14%) coming from 332 IMAX locations.If estimates hold, the decline will be slightly less than the 43% dip that 2008’s The Dark Knight suffered during its third frame while on the same calendar. That mega-smash did face stiffer competition as the new action release that weekend, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, bowed to $40.5M which was $14M higher than Total Recall‘s debut. But with threequels often eroding faster, the solid hold Rises saw this weekend could be partly due to moviegoers that skipped the film in the aftermath of the Colorado shooting coming out now. New action sequels are scheduled to launch on the next two weekends, but The Dark Knight Rises could be on course to reach $440-450M domestically.Currently, Rises is running 10% behind the pace of its predecessor which banked $393.8M in its first 17 days with a $42.7M third-weekend gross. The Bane flick has tied Avatar as the third fastest film in history to break the $350M barrier. Only The Avengers and The Dark Knight have done it faster in 10 and 14 days, respectively. TDKR shot up to number 21 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $352.4M of last summer’s 3D tentpole Transformers: Dark of the Moon.Another impressive weekend gross was collected from overseas markets where the latest Batman film captured an estimated $67M from 58 markets, down a sizable 47%, boosting the international total to $378.4M and the global gross to $733M making it the second largest worldwide hit of 2012 after Avengers which grossed twice as much. The offshore cume is only about a week away from matching the $469M of TDK. Rises is now playing in most major markets around the world, however Italy is still to open at the end of the month and China – which has a quota on foreign films – has not yet been set. Breaking the $1 billion global box office mark seems very possible, putting the Christopher Nolan trilogy on course to gross a combined $2.4 billion or more.The big-budget sci-fi remake Total Recall debuted in second place with an estimated $26M and failed to generate too much excitement with action movie fans. Averaging $7,220 from 3,601 theaters, the PG-13 redo opened only a hair above the $25.5M bow of the 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger hit despite having ticket prices that were nearly twice as high and playing in 1,500 more theaters. The effects-driven film skewed 58% male while 53% of the audience was 30 and older, according to studio research. A lack of female appeal prevented it from attracting a broader crowd.The Colin Farrell pic never did electrify ticket buyers too much and played out as yet another remake that people did not ask for. Critics and audiences agreed on the quality of the film. Reviews were mostly negative and moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave it a pitiful C+ grade. And with The Bourne Legacy set to open this Friday and The Expendables 2 on the following weekend, large declines should be in order putting the $150M-budgeted pic on course to reach the neighborhood of $70M from North America. Recall opened at number one in a number of Asian markets this weekend collecting a modest $6.2M from a dozen territories led by Taiwan and Malaysia.Opening in third place was the tween sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days with an estimated $14.7M from 3,391 locations for a mild $4,335 average. The third chapter in the film franchise debuted well below the levels of the first two which each launched in mid-March over the past two years to $22.1M and $23.8M. The summer vacation storyline drew an upfront audience as Saturday sales tumbled 14% from Friday’s opening day score. As a threequel, it could indicate a rocky road ahead although those polled by CinemaScore liked the film which earned an A- grade.Reviews were mostly negative which is common for a kidpic franchise going into its third installment. Studio research showed that the audience was 58% female and 62% under 25. Dog Days cost only $22M to produce and summer yields stronger midweek grosses since students are out of school so surpassing the $50M mark like the last two films is still possible.Two more Fox titles followed. The 3D animated comedy Ice Age: Continental Drift slipped 37% to an estimated $8.4M for a cume to date of $131.9M from North America. Overseas grosses vaulted to an incredible $587M putting the worldwide figure at $718.9M. The studio’s underperforming alien comedy The Watch fell 50% from its opening weekend despite no new comedies for adults entering the marketplace. With $25.4M in ten days, the Ben Still-Vince Vaughn pic should end with just $40M.The film that has really been getting grown-ups to laugh this summer, Seth MacFarlane’s Ted starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, smashed the $200M mark this weekend and enjoyed a major expansion into international waters. Domestically, Universal’s leggy hit dipped only 26% to an estimated $5.5M for a total of $203.4M. But a potent $32M was made from 20 overseas markets boosting the offshore total to $77.3M and the global tally to $280.7M. Ted generated a sensational top spot debut in the U.K. with $14.3M and was also number one in a handful of other new markets like Germany and Russia.The dance drama Step Up Revolution tumbled 55% in its sophomore round to an estimated $5.3M pushing the ten-day total to $23.1M for Lionsgate-owned Summit. The decline was similar to the 56% drop that the last film in the franchise, Step Up 3D, suffered two summers ago when it banked a better $29.8M in its first ten days. Look for Revolution to finish with less than $35M.Sony’s super hero reboot The Amazing Spider-Man crossed the quarter-billion threshold in North America this weekend thanks to its estimated $4.3M take in its fifth weekend. Down 36%, the big-budget Sony tentpole upped its sum to $250.6M. Overseas added $6.1M this weekend for a new international haul of $427.1M giving the studio $677.7M worldwide.Two more summer blockbusters rounded out the top ten, one for daughters and the other for moms. The Disney/Pixar hit Brave grossed an estimated $2.9M, off 33%, for a $223.3M cume. With $16.5M from overseas, the Scottish princess broke the century mark internationally with $118M for a worldwide take of $341.3M. Channing Tatum’s Magic Mike fell 47% to an estimated $1.4M giving Warner Bros. $110.9M to date.Opening well in platform release was the Andy Samberg-Rashida Jones relationship comedy Celeste and Jesse Forever which debuted to an estimated $112,000 from only four houses for a sparkling $28,000 average. Sony Classics will expand into San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago, and Washington D.C. on Friday and adds more major cities throughout August before going nationwide over Labor Day weekend. Reviews have been good and indie comedies have been hot this year so the road ahead seems promising.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.2M which was down 28% from last year when Rise of the Planet of the Apes opened at number one with $54.8M; but up 4% from 2010 when The Other Guys debuted on top with $35.5M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Tubi","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Dark-Knight-Rises-Again"},{"id":"47509124444968","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Possession Opens #1 As Summer Ends","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Possession Opens #1 As Summer Endsby Gitesh Pandya | September 3, 2012 |  CommentsThe summer of super heroes came to a close with a pair of new releases taking the top two spots at the North American box office over the four-day Labor Day holiday frame while comic book hits continued their global domination passing new milestones. The horror pic The Possession debuted at number one, the period crime drama Lawless bowed in second place and holdovers filled up the rest of the top ten with mostly small declines thanks to Monday being a holiday. Overall ticket sales were on par with what the industry has seen recently over this summer-ending frame.Lionsgate enjoyed a solid opening for its supernatural thriller The Possession which spooked up an estimated $21.3M over the long Friday-to-Monday period from 2,816 locations for a sturdy $7,564 per-theater average over four days. The three-day portion was $17.7M. The PG-13 film about a demon living in a creepy box became the first fright film in five years to open at number one over Labor Day weekend. The last was 2007’s Halloween remake with $26.4M over three days and $30.6M over the four-day holiday span. This is the second best opening ever for any film over this holiday after the Michael Myers redo.As with many creepy thrillers of this type, young females drove the business. Studio research showed that 59% of the audience was female and 54% was under 25. Producer Sam Raimi’s name was heavily promoted and a targeted campaign aimed at Latinos also paid dividends. Reviews were negative and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave a mediocre B grade.Opening with modest results in second place was the crime drama Lawless with an estimated $13M from 2,888 locations for a mild $4,501 average across four days. $10M came from the three-day portion. The Weinstein Co. release starring Shia LaBeouf, Tom Hardy, and Gary Oldman collected $15.1M since its Wednesday launch. Reviews were generally positive but overall consumer interest was never very high for the Prohibition-era tale. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+.After its two-week run in the top spot, the action sequel The Expendables 2 dropped to third place with an estimated $11.2M. That gave Lionsgate a cume of $68.6M in 18 days. Universal’s own franchise actioner The Bourne Legacy held up better slipping to an estimated $9.4M over the long weekend upping the cume to $98.4M. It will join its three predecessors in the century club later this week.PG-rated kidpics followed. The Focus toon ParaNorman dropped to an estimated $8.9M while Disney’s dramedy The Odd Life of Timothy Green jumped up to an estimated $8.5M. With the extra time off, Labor Day weekend is often a popular time for parents to go to the movies with their kids before the new school year gets busy. Totals stand at $40.2M and $38.4M.Batfans came out again for The Dark Knight Rises which in its seventh round collected an estimated $7.9M propelling the domestic cume to $433.2M. The four-day gross rose 10% compared to last weekend’s three-day score. That was slightly better than the 6% uptick that The Dark Knight posted over Labor Day weekend four years ago when it cracked the half-billion mark. A final North American haul of roughly $450M seems likely for Rises.Worldwide, the Bane flick cracked the $1 billion mark thanks in part to a solid debut in China this past week. The Christopher Nolan smash collected a rough estimate of $28.5M there across the seven-day opening of Monday-to-Sunday finishing behind the $33.3M launch over the same period for The Amazing Spider-Man which was in 3D and released at the exact same time. For this current weekend in all 64 markets – including Italy which also launched – Rises took in an estimated $46.4M lifting the international take to $574M and the worldwide haul to $1.007 billion edging out the final global gross for 2008’s Joker hit.Another super hero flick hitting a milestone this weekend was The Avengers which crossed the $1.5 billion barrier – only the third movie in history to reach this level and the first one not from James Cameron. Disney re-released it, along with Brave, into over 1,700 theaters for an extra round of cash pushing the domestic figure to $620.3M. Most theaters split one screen programing showtimes for both films. It was a summer of super heroes as the three comic book behemoths grossed a combined $3.25 billion across the globe. To no surprise, a string of new super hero films are already scheduled on the calendar for the coming years including next summer’s Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel.After a stellar nationwide expansion last weekend, the political documentary 2016 Obama?s America fizzled out in wider play grossing an estimated $7.1M for a $4,057 average over four days. The Rocky Mountain release widened from 1,091 to 1,747 theaters but saw its three-day weekend gross drop 22% which was a larger decline than many films in the top ten which had no expansion. The bigger footprint and the buzz coming out of last week’s Republican National Convention was expected to give more of a boost. Still, 2016 has grossed an impressive $20.3M to date and may be headed for the neighborhood of $30M which would be enormous for a documentary.Will Ferrell’s election comedy The Campaign followed with an estimated $7M for a $74.6M cume to date for Warner Bros. Rounding out the top ten with a good hold was Sony’s Hope Springs with an estimated $6M over the long weekend and $53.4M overall.Finding no takers this weekend was the new kidpic The Oogieloves which debuted outside the Top 20 with a pitiful $602,000, according to estimates, over four days. The G-rated film for pre-schoolers averaged a dismal $279 from 2,160 theaters which averaged out to about three tickets sold per showtime.Two new films opening in limited release posted respectable numbers. The phone sex comedy For a Good Time, Call… bowed to an estimated $186,000 from 23 sites for a $8,090 average for Focus. Indomina’s martial arts epic Flying Swords of Dragon Gate starring Jet Li took in an estimated $125,000 from 15 of AMC’s IMAX 3D venues averaging $8,333.With another big movie season coming to an end, the top five domestic blockbusters ended up being The Avengers ($620.3M), The Dark Knight Rises ($433.2M), The Amazing Spider-Man ($260M), Brave ($232.3M), and Ted ($216M).The top ten films grossed an estimated $100.3M over four days which was up a scant 1% from last year when The Help was number one for a third straight frame with $19.9M; and up 7% from 2010 when The American opened on top with $16.7M.Follow Gitesh on The Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"batman, Cannes, america, spider-man, franchise, york, black, hist, green","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Possession-Opens-1-As-Summer-Ends"},{"id":"47509124462384","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Have Wild Time with Ted and Mike","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Have Wild Time with Ted and Mikeby Gitesh Pandya | July 1, 2012 |  CommentsA pair of new R-rated films dominated the North American box office sending ticket sales soaring to a new record for the biggest June weekend in history. The comedy Ted and the drama Magic Mike both overperformed and connected with their target audiences while Tyler Perry’s latest effort Madea’s Witness Protection delivered his usual potent numbers. Overall, it was the third best weekend of 2012 as success came from a handful of original movies and not from one big franchise juggernaut opening. The marketplace is now in great shape entering what will be a gigantic July.Family Guy fans came out in droves for creator Seth MacFarlane’s directorial debut Ted which debuted at number one with an estimated $54.1M from 3,239 theaters for a sizzling $16,705 average. The raunchy buddy comedy about a man and his talking teddy bear scored the third largest opening ever for an R-rated comedy behind two major brand-based hits – The Hangover 2 ($85.9M) and Sex and the City ($56.8M). An original story not based on a well-known brand doing this level of business is incredible and reinforces the starpower of MacFarlane. Actors Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis also added star wattage and positive reviews helped too.The Universal release cost $50M to produce and skewed towards men as expected. Studio research showed that males made up 56% of the crowd while 52% were 30 and older. The CinemaScore grade was a good A-. While distributors only retain a portion of the gross, and marketing costs are additional expenses, it is always good news to a studio when its opening weekend gross is higher than its film’s budget. Friday saw a spectacular $20.7M bow, Saturday dipped 14% to $17.9M, and Universal is optimistically projecting a 13% slide on Sunday to $15.5M. Most other studios are estimating 20-30% declines for their films on Sunday. But with the Independence Day holiday falling on Wednesday and many young adults having extra leisure time this week, Ted should find its way to a solid showing in its first full week even though Tuesday sees the debut of the summer tentpole The Amazing Spider-Man which will start damaging competitors on Monday night when it begins its first midnight shows.Channing Tatum scored his third hit of the year with the much-talked about male stripper movie Magic Mike which opened in second place with an estimated $39.2M from 2,930 locations for a sturdy $13,363 average. Women dominated the audience and business was incredibly front-loaded thanks to girls-night-out crowds that planned opening day outings. Friday premiered to a dazzling $19.4M which eventually accounted for half of all the weekend sales. Saturday tumbled by an alarming 41% to $11.4M while Warner Bros. expects Sunday to dip down 26% to $8.4M.But the promise of beefcake with the likes of the red hot Tatum and co-star Matthew McConaughey was enough to spark excitement and good reviews didn’t hurt either for the Steven Soderbergh-directed drama loosely based on producer/star Tatum’s real-life stint as an exotic dancer. Studio data showed that 73% of the crowd was female and 57% was under 35. The CinemaScore grade was just a mediocre B. 2008’s Sex and the City also saw a massive opening day rush from its audience of adult women. Its Saturday decline was 34% and its female share was 85%. If Magic Mike can hold up and keep attracting customers, it will become Tatum’s third $100M+ grosser in six months. He’s already seen his February romance hit The Vow reach $125M and his March buddy cop comedy 21 Jump Street make $138.3M.Ted and Magic Mike offered a one-two punch of raunchy fun which paying audiences found irresistible as the overall box office broke the record for the biggest June weekend in history beating the last frame of June 2009 which saw the massive launch of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Even more impressive was that the top three films this weekend were not sequels and the top five had no action tentpoles. The R-rated newbies proved that young adults will still come out and pay for original stories that truly excite them.Those looking for clean family-friendly entertainment found it in the Disney/Pixar hit Brave which dropped from first to third place with an estimated $34M. The 49% decline was sizable given how the film is not a sequel and that the new releases provided virtually zero competition. It also pleased crowds on opening weekend earning an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore. Brave has grossed $131.7M in its first ten days and has performed much like Pixar’s 2008 offering WALL?E which debuted in late June to $63.1M, fell 49% in its sophomore session to $32.5M for a ten-day start of $127.2M. Brave had the advantage of some 3D surcharges while the robot pic had the Independence Day holiday help it. With a big holiday week coming up, Brave may find its way to the neighborhood of $235M by the end of its domestic release.Tyler Perry scored yet another hit film with the Lionsgate comedy Madea’s Witness Protection which debuted in fourth with an estimated $26.4M from 2,161 theaters for a potent $12,193 average. The filmmaker’s fourth movie with Madea in the title played to his loyal fan base which continued to come out. This was Perry’s first summer release as most of his offerings went out in the spring or fall. Witness Protection’s debut was in line with the $25.1M bow of the last Madea pic Big Happy Family.Holding up well again in its fourth round was Paramount’s animated sequel Madagascar 3 which collected an estimated $11.8M, off just 40%. The DreamWorks Animation hit has now taken in $180M domestically matching the gross of its 2008 predecessor. Europe’s Most Wanted will surpass the $193.2M of 2005’s original Madagascar next weekend and find itself going past $200M too. International markets saw an estimated $16.2M pushing the overseas haul to $244.2M for a global take of $424M.In its second weekend, the action-horror-history mashup pic Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter suffered a steep 63% tumble to an estimated $6M for $29M in ten days for Fox. Four films rounded out the top ten falling into the $4-5M range. Fox’s sci-fi epic Prometheus took in an estimated $4.9M, down 50%, raising its total to $118.3M. The global haul now stands at $284.8M. Wes Anderson’s indie hit Moonrise Kingdom jumped into the top ten for the first time thanks to an expansion from 395 to 854 theaters with an estimated $4.9M as well. The Focus release averaged $5,706 and has banked an impressive $18.4M to date with much more to come as its cume should double in the coming weeks.Universal’s effects-heavy fairy tale adventure Snow White and the Huntsman dropped 46% to an estimated $4.4M with $145.6M domestic to date. Disney’s uplifting drama People Like Us was dead on arrival in its debut just barely making the top ten with an estimated $4.3M from 2,055 locations for a pitiful $2,095 average. With mixed reviews, the PG-13 pic starring Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks failed to excite any demographic and should fade away quickly.Two big July tentpoles kicked off their global releases this weekend overseas ahead of their U.S. openings. Fox’s animated comedy Ice Age: Continental Drift – the fourth installment in the franchise and second in 3D – debuted to an estimated $78M from 34 markets ranking number one in all of them. In some Latin American markets like Argentina and Columbia it broke the all-time opening weekend box office record. Drift is the latest chapter in a lucrative franchise that has now broken the $2 billion mark this weekend in global box office. Though results in North America have been mostly flat over the years, overseas growth has been mammoth with international grosses soaring from $207M to $461M to a stunning $691M for the last film Dawn of the Dinosaurs which accounted for 78% of its global tally. All signs indicate that interest for the Ice Age franchise – overseas at least – remains quite high. It opens domestically on July 13.Over in Asia and parts of Europe this weekend, Sony’s reboot The Amazing Spider-Man set off fireworks of its own with a $50.2M debut from 13 territories led by Korea’s $13.4M and Japan’s $11.4M. The results were phenomenal with the 3D webslinger crushing the opening for Avengers in both Korea and India by more than 70%. The Andrew Garfield starrer hits U.S. screens this Tuesday one day before the 4th of July holiday. Sam Raimi’s trio of Spider-Man films – all in 2D – grossed a combined $2.5 billion worldwide from 2002 to 2007.After eight long weeks in the domestic top ten, the super hero sensation The Avengers finally dropped from the list finishing in eleventh place with $4.2M and a total of $606.3M from North America and $1.45 billion worldwide. Following in the footsteps of other recent franchises, Sony’s newest alien installment Men in Black 3 will end up as the lowest-grossing pic in the series domestically, but will be the top title globally thanks to growth in international markets for action and 3D films. Will Smith’s comeback vehicle stands at $169.6M from North America and will conclude with $175-180M including 3D surcharges and today’s higher ticket prices. The first two MIB flicks did $250.1M in 1997 and $190.4M in 2002. But the overseas tally on MIB3 rose to $429.8M putting the global take at $599.4M with the $600M barrier ready to fall on Monday. The first Agent J pic sold more tickets but its worldwide gross from fifteen years ago was $589M.Summer moviegoers continued to flock to new independent films as Fox Searchlight’s Sundance award-winner Beasts of the Southern Wild debuted to terrific results in its platform bow in New York and Los Angeles with an estimated $169,000 from four locations for a powerful $42,309 average per theater. Cume since the Wednesday launch was $220,000. It was especially impressive given that it had no stars and was from a first-time director. The critically acclaimed drama adds more markets this week on Wednesday and Friday and then goes much wider on July 13.Woody Allen’s latest European postcard To Rome with Love fared well in its second weekend expansion grossing an estimated $750,000 from 29 playdates (up from five last week) for a $25,862 average. The Sony Classics title has banked $1.3M to date and is scheduled to widen across the country this Friday. With Moonrise Kingdom heading to $35M+ and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel already above $40M, independent films this summer have carved out solid sales from upscale moviegoers interested in movies with more substance in a sea of mindless popcorn flicks.The top ten films grossed an estimated $189.9M which was up 2% from last year when Transformers: Dark of the Moon opened at number one with $97.9M; and up 6% from 2010 when The Twilight Saga: Eclipse debuted on top with $64.8M. Both of those frames were helped by the 4th of July holiday.Folllow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"2015, Arrowverse, Television, movies, cults","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Have-Wild-Time-with-Ted-and-Mike"},{"id":"47509124448042","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Expendables Seizes #1 spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Expendables Seizes #1 spotby Gitesh Pandya | August 20, 2012 |  CommentsElderly adrenaline ruled the North American box office as the bullet-filled action sequel The Expendables 2 opened at number one although with less muscle than its predecessor. Three other new films, each targeting a specific segment of the moviegoing public, also debuted and attracted respectable but not stellar grosses. But the variety of content from new and holdover pictures worked together to deliver a strong overall performance as the marketplace was substantially larger than normal for the middle of August with seven different movies breaking double-digit millions over the weekend.Sylvester Stallone rounded up his boys and packed the guns for his latest action offering The Expendables 2 which captured the top spot with an estimated $28.8M opening weekend. The R-rated mega-pack of testosterone and lead averaged a good $8,670 from 3,316 theaters and played to the same older male fan base that powered its 2010 predecessor to a beefier $34.8M bow in mid-August of that summer. The new Lionsgate release tried to add more to the table. Joining returning stars like Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren were action heroes from yesteryear like Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme along with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis who took on bigger roles and more screen time. Stallone did not direct this $90M production as the chair was given to Simon West (Con Air, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).The original Expendables was the first of its kind to combine so many macho action heroes under one roof. But that novelty was gone with the sequel which essentially followed the same formula adding some new faces to the mix for action fans that loved the machine gun flicks of the 1980s. Recent audience sensitivity to guns in the wake of several shootings around the country, and bomb scares at Carmike Cinemas on opening day, may have had some contribution to the 17% drop in opening weekend sales for the latest Expendables installment. But it is impossible to tell how much. Overall marketplace conditions may also have had an impact as every action movie over the past two months has opened either at or below expectations.Demographics were about the same this second time around with males making up 63% of the audience, compared to 61% for the first flick. 65% were 25 or older. For a Stallone action sequel, reviews were actually quite good. And those that paid to see Expendables 2 did like it as the film earned an encouraging A- grade from CinemaScore. The first all-star combo pack went on to gross an impressive $103.1M domestically and $274M worldwide. This one too should rely on overseas audiences to kick in the bulk of the cash.Rival August action pic The Bourne Legacy settled for second place and took a sequel-like fall of 55% to an estimated $17M. Universal has banked $69.6M in its first ten days for the new Jeremy Renner installment in the spy series. The last two Matt Damon films did slightly better in their second weekends with declines of 53% for 2007’s The Bourne Ultimatum and 54% for 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy although those were at or above the $100M mark by the sophomore session. Look for Legacy to end its run with roughly $115M as it joins this summer’s latest chapters for Spider-Man, Ice Age, Step Up, and Men in Black as the lowest-grossing installment domestically of its franchise.Focus gave a big launch to its 3D toon ParaNorman and scored a third place debut with an estimated $14M from a very wide 3,429 locations for a mild $4,085 average. The PG-rated stop-motion flick about a young boy who sees ghosts won rave reviews from film critics and had to compete with multiple other choices for kids from Disney and Fox. The CinemaScore was a respectable B+. With nothing new for youngsters next weekend, ParaNorman hopes to keep playing to its target audience until schools reopen for the new academic year.Will Ferrell’s political comedy The Campaign dropped 50% in the polls and collected an estimated $13.4M in its second term boosting the ten-day tally to $51.7M. The Warner Bros. release should end its run with about $85M which would be a solid result for an R-rated comedy.Sony’s summer recycling program of sequels, reboots, and remakes continued with the musical drama Sparkle which debuted in fifth with an estimated $12M from 2,244 theaters for a decent $5,348 average. Starring American Idol champ Jordin Sparks and the late Whitney Houston in her final role, the PG-13 film played overwhelmingly to an older female crowd as studio research showed that the audience was 74% female and 62% over the age of 35. A remake of the classic film from 1976, Sparkle earned mixed reviews from critics but truly won over paying audiences. Its CinemaScore grade was a solid A. But despite that high score, sales slipped on Saturday and the overall weekend average was not as high as those for many other films aimed at mature African-American women. Direct competition is minimal over the next couple of weeks so it may have a chance to hold up giving the low cost $14M production a profitable run.Super hero juggernaut The Dark Knight Rises fell out of the top five in its fifth frame with an estimated $11.1M, off a respectable 41%. The Warner Bros. threequel smashed the $400M mark on Friday in its 29th day of release and has upped its domestic total to $409.9M allowing Bane and his goons to climb up to number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters passing the $407.7M of last spring’s blockbuster The Hunger Games. A sensational $58.8M of the Batgross has come from IMAX locations. Overseas, Rises rose up to $487.8M surpassing the $469.7M lifetime international gross of The Dark Knight while stabilizing its decline to 42%. The worldwide haul now stands at $897.7M with Greece, Italy, and the key Chinese market still to open over the next two weeks.Opening in seventh place was the tween dramedy The Odd Life of Timothy Green with an estimated $10.9M over the weekend and $15.2M over the five days since its Wednesday launch. The PG-rated film averaged a lukewarm $4,199 from 2,598 sites over three days and played mostly to moms and kids. Families made up 53% of the crowd while females were 68%. Reviews were not too good but moviegoers were satisfied with their experience as the Disney pic earned an A- from CinemaScore. Opening head-to-head against ParaNorman certainly split some of the family crowd which already had other brand-based options to choose from.Sony’s older-skewing comedy Hope Springs with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones held up well in its second weekend as expected slipping 38% to an estimated $9.1M for a ten-day total of $35.1M. A final of $60-70M could result. Fox’s kid sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days tumbled 52% to an estimated $3.9M while Sony’s remake Total Recall rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.5M falling a steep 56%. Cumes stand at $38.8M and $51.8M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.7M which was up 27% from last year when The Help climbed into the number one spot in its second weekend with $20M; and up 21% from 2010 when The Expendables remained on top with $17M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"competition, Pet, impossible, fresh, watch, Reviews, space","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Expendables-Seizes-1-spot"},{"id":"47509126047549","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hunger Games Still #1, Breaks $250M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hunger Games Still #1, Breaks $250Mby Gitesh Pandya | April 2, 2012 |  CommentsDespite a big drop, the teen-killing-teen epic The Hunger Games remained the most popular film leading the box office with more ticket sales in its second frame than the two new releases combined. The 3D action sequel Wrath of the Titans debuted in second place while the Snow White pic Mirror Mirror opened in third leading the marketplace to another sizable lead over year-ago levels.Falling a large but understandable 60% from its record bow, The Hunger Games scored another $61.1M this weekend, according to estimates, propelling the ten-day cume to an eye-popping $251M. That allowed the Lionsgate release to break Avatar’s record for the fastest non-sequel to break the quarter-billion mark. The Na’vi pic needed 12 days in December 2009 including the Christmas frame whereas Hunger had no holiday help. In fact, only three films in box office history have ever reached the milestone faster – The Dark Knight in eight days as well as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen which both did it in nine days. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest did it in ten days. All four were July releases when weekday numbers were much stronger thanks to students being out of school and the Potter figures included a boost from 3D surcharges.The fact that Games could collect so much in such a short period of time outside of summer is nothing short of incredible. Overall, it was the seventh best performance for any film in its sophomore weekend and fourth biggest among non-sequels behind Avatar ($75.6M), Spider-Man ($71.4M), and Alice in Wonderland ($62.7M). Among second weekends, Hunger beat out every installment of the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises although the first wizard flick sold more tickets in its Thanksgiving-boosted sophomore round.Katniss and pals saw a daily breakdown of $18.9M on Friday, $25M on Saturday (up 33%), and $17.3M on Sunday (-31%). At its current trajectory, the final domestic tally should reach the vicinity of $375M. Hunger Games just may stay at number one for a third weekend in a row as next weekend it will face the blast-from-the-past debuts of American Reunion in 3,200 locations and the 3D re-release of Titanic which sets sail on Wednesday in 2,500 sites. The Good Friday holiday should keep Games above the $30M mark in its third round putting the $300M barrier within reach by Easter Sunday after 17 days.Overseas, The Hunger Games saw a 41% decline to an estimated $34.8M lifting the international total to $113.9M and the worldwide cume to $364.9M. Top market cumes are $17M in Australia, $13.1M in the U.K., and $11.3M from Russia. A final global gross near $600M is possible for the $75M production.Opening in second place was the big-budget 3D action sequel Wrath of the Titans with an estimated $34.2M representing a sharp 44% fall from the $61.2M of its predecessor Clash of the Titans this weekend two years ago. The PG-13 Greek God pic averaged $9,647 from 3,545 theaters and saw an impressive 14% of the gross come from its 292 IMAX screens and 65% from all 3D venues (including IMAX). Clash, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name, was a massive box office hit grossing $163.2M domestically and $493M worldwide. However, its 3D conversion was widely panned as the film was conceptualized to be in 2D and was only converted at the last minute in order to generate higher grosses in the post-Avatar era. Many who came out and were disappointed in Clash skipped out on Wrath this time. Still, not many action films open north of $30M in the March-April corridor and this one is more intended for a global audience. The breakdown saw no surprises as males made up 66% of the crowd while 55% were over 25. Reviews were mostly negative and audiences gave a decent B+ grade from CinemaScore.Overseas and worldwide, Wrath of the Titans stole the number one spot from Hunger Games. A massive launch across 60 markets resulted in a weekend bow of $78M for a worldwide opening weekend of $112.2M. With Hollywood’s action and 3D titles performing extremely well overseas, and Wrath having a non-American setting and international cast, Warner Bros. is hoping to keep the grosses going over the coming weeks. Easter holidays will give students and adults extra time off too so more potential lies ahead. Red hot Russia led the way with $14M with China estimated to follow as second biggest although exact figures were not available because of holidays. Mexico ranked third with a $5M debut and Japan, the only major territory to not open this weekend, launches three weeks from now.The fairy tale adventure Mirror Mirror starring Julia Roberts landed in third place with an estimated $19M in its first weekend in theaters. The PG-rated telling of the Snow White story averaged a respectable $5,273 from 3,603 and played to a more female-skewing family audience. Studio data showed that the audience was three-fourths female and 63% 25 and older. Produced for over $80M, the lavish fantasy pic earned mixed reviews from critics and a moderate B+ grade from CinemaScore. With the top two films in the country featuring high death counts, and The Lorax having been out for a month now, families with younger children found Mirror Mirror to be the only major game in town. Boys, not surprisingly, were hard to reach. Though the opening weekend was not exceptionally high, the long-term outlook is encouraging since many schools will be closed over the next two weeks for spring breaks and Easter holidays plus direct competition will be light.Still pleasing the crowds was the action-comedy 21 Jump Street which slipped only 27% to an estimated $15M giving Sony $93.1M to date on its way to the century club by the end of the week. Soon to join the double century club, Universal’s hit 3D toon The Lorax grossed $8M, down 39%, for a $189.6M cume to date. The big-budget actioner John Carter continued its rapid descent falling 61% to an estimated $2M for a total of only $66.2M to date. The Disney pic has suffered declines of 55-63% each weekend.The British fly-fishing drama Salmon Fishing in the Yemen expanded again in its fourth week of play and jumped into the top ten at number seven with an estimated $1.3M. Averaging a mild $2,638 from 483 locations, the CBS Films title took advantage of weak grosses from current holdovers to make it so high on the chart. Before Hunger Games arrived last week, no film all year made it into the top ten with less than $2M on the weekend. This weekend there were five films at or below that level. Salmon’s sum stands at $3.2M.The low-budget Navy SEAL flick Act of Valor followed with an estimated $1M, off 51%, for $67.7M for Relativity. Eddie Murphy’s latest flop A Thousand Words has amazingly spent four straight weeks in the top ten. The Paramount release took in an estimated $915,000, down 53%, for a weak cume of only $16.5M. Rounding out the top ten with only $835,000, according to estimates, was the adventure sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which has banked $98.5M so far.The critically acclaimed documentary Bully got off to a good start in platform release opening to an estimated $115,000 from only five theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a solid $23,000 average. The figure included a very optimistic 15% Saturday-to-Sunday dip as reported by The Weinstein Co. so the final gross may end up somewhat lower. Manufacturing a controversy out of its R rating led to plenty of nationwide publicity which helped fuel ticket sales. Harvey and company similarly spun PR gold out of their unsuccessful MPAA appeal for Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 which smashed box office records for docs. Although all kids can be admitted to an R-rated film as long as they are accompanied by someone 17 or older, the campaign pushed the notion that students were being deprived from getting an important message because of the MPAA. The fight-the-system plan worked wonders connecting to the activism element in the target audience. Bully expands Friday to six more markets including San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.The top ten films grossed an estimated $143.3M which was up 30% from last year when Hop opened in the top spot with $37.5M; but down 14% from 2010 when Clash of the Titans debuted at number one with $61.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"best, 2019, stand-up, Starz, spanish, diversity, King","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hunger-Games-Still-1-Breaks-250M"},{"id":"47509124485942","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Avengers‘ Reign Continues","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Avengers' Reign ContinuesIn other news, people like blood sausage too.by Gitesh Pandya | May 21, 2012 |  CommentsDominating the box office for a third weekend in a row and turning all competitors into casualties of war, The Avengers held on firmly to the number one spot breaking more records in the process. Audiences were not very excited about the new releases as the big-budget action tentpole Battleship suffered a poor opening in second place, the Sacha Baron Cohen comedy The Dictator failed to match the raunchy funnyman’s past performances, and the all-star pregnancy comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting debuted in fifth with weak results. It was the first time in fourteen years that the normally-busy weekend before the Memorial Day holiday frame failed to deliver any $35M+ openings causing the top ten to fall below both last year’s and 2010’s levels.The shawarma-loving super heroes continued to rule the box office as The Avengers grossed an estimated $55.1M in its third weekend on top, dropping a reasonable 47%. Disney’s Marvel juggernaut has now amassed an eye-popping $457.1M in 17 days and broke two more speed records breaking $400M in 14 days and $450M after 17. The Dark Knight held both of those milestones before with 18 and 27 days, respectively. The S.H.I.E.L.D. team zoomed up to number six on the list of all-time-domestic blockbusters sitting right behind the $461M lifetime of Star Wars with a final North American take of near $600M likely.Moviegoers have been loving Avengers and really have not been moved by all the other offerings that Hollywood has programmed into May. Studios knew that it would be a heavy hitter so they avoided slotting in any high-profile sequels into the first three weeks of its run for fear of being crushed. But the Iron Man-led film opened much stronger than expected and has been holding up very well utterly dominating the movie conversation and reaching beyond the core fan base of comic book geeks.Avengers enjoyed the second largest third weekend gross in history trailing only the $68.5M of Avatar which had help from the New Year’s holiday that frame. Both films enjoyed a boost from 3D surcharges although more of those screens are installed now. 2002’s Spider-Man grossed $45M ten years ago this weekend while in its third session but actually sold about 30% more tickets than Avengers. 2008’s The Dark Knight grossed $42.7M which was about even with Avengers in terms of tickets sold on the third weekend. The Batpic enjoyed a slightly better hold with its 43% decline.With Avengers grossing so much, industry eyes will shift to the highly-anticipated The Dark Knight Rises which opens July 20. Being a 2D film, it’s not expected to break the $207.4M record opening of Avengers. However, with stronger midweek grosses when students are out of school in July, its final tally could challenge the Marvel team’s especially if it can hold up like its predecessor. While the gross is unprecedented, the Avengers audience size is not record-setting. Four years ago, Dark Knight pulled in $393.8M in its first 17 days which would equate to roughly $440M at today’s 2D prices. Factor in 3D surcharges and the rough admissions totals would be 55 million for Dark Knight and 50 million for Avengers. Of course, Rises will not have the Heath Ledger factor but the good will created by the last Knight will certainly pay dividends this July.Overseas, The Avengers banked another $56M in its fourth round for a $111.1M global weekend. The international cume has rocketed to $723.3M bringing the worldwide tally to a staggering $1.18 billion putting it at number four on the all-time global list right behind Avatar, Titanic, and the final Harry Potter. In another week or so, Nick Fury and pals will beat the Hogwarts clan and settle into what should be its final resting place with a bronze box office medal. Leading markets continue to be the U.K. ($72.3M), China ($69.3M), Mexico ($56.2M), and Brazil ($51.9M). Avengers has become the top-grossing movie of all-time for Disney which expects more cash to come from future films from Marvel which it owns.Universal suffered a pricey misfire with the big-budget action film Battleship which just didn’t connect with moviegoers. Costing at least $209M to produce with no other studios sharing the financial risk, the PG-13 naval adventure opened to only $25.4M, according to estimates, with an average of only $6,870 from 3,690 theaters. It would barely be a respectable performance for a film costing half as much. Audiences in the mood for a large-scale effects-driven action picture had Avengers to see – even if it was for a second time – and Battleship just did not stand out as a must-see film.Critics and audiences were not too thrilled with what Battleship delivered. Reviews were mixed but more on the downbeat side while patrons polled by CinemaScore gave the film a mediocre B grade. As expected, the alien attack film loosely based on the alien-less board game skewed towards men as studio research showed that 57% of the crowd was male while 55% was 30 or older. An aggressive marketing campaign including Super Bowl spots failed to excite audiences who felt that the pic basically looked like Transformers at sea without Michael Bay at the helm. The cast included Liam Neeson, pop singer Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker, and Taylor Kitsch who after John Carter now enjoys the distinction of starring in the year’s two biggest flops. The more expensive Carter opened to $30.2M including 3D surcharges and has stalled at $283M worldwide for Disney.Battleship set sail over a month ago in international waters where it found more success. Entering most markets at least two weeks before Avengers it was able to scoop up a decent amount of cash before getting pummeled by a superior action film. This weekend saw an estimated $6.5M bumping the offshore take to $226.8M and the global sum to $252.1M. But given its current grosses and the calendar ahead, the worldwide figure looks to finish in the neighborhood of $325M which will be a big disappointment given the massive production and marketing investments which add up to nearly the same amount.Also underperforming and costing a lot (for its genre) was Sacha Baron Cohen’s latest comedy vehicle The Dictator which bowed to an estimated $17.4M over the weekend and $24.5M since debuting on Wednesday. The three-day average was $5,790 from 3,008 locations. Over five days, the R-rated film grossed less than the three-day openings of the last two films the funnyman anchored. 2006’s sleeper hit Borat opened to $26.5M from just 837 theaters while 2009’s Brüno bowed to $30.6M from 2,756 locations. Both R-rated comedies landed at number one and were based on popular characters that Cohen had developed on his television series. Dictator brought some of the same brand of raunchy satire to a new character, an eccentric tyrant that ruled a fictitious North African oil-rich nation.Reviews were generally good, however audiences were not pleased with what they paid for as the Paramount release earned a troubling C grade from CinemaScore. Brüno scored the same grade and quickly eroded away at the box office tumbling 73% in its sophomore frame. Cohen has been promoting his film in character on numerous talk shows and at prestigious film events like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards in an attempt to make his product stand out as something buzzworthy. But American audiences may be getting tired of the same humor from the British comedian. And the budget of $65M was high for a comedy not driven by special effects or having a proven star like Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell.Studio research showed that a steep 65% of the crowd was male and 56% was under 25. The Dictator had extremely limited female appeal and males had two huge effects-driven action films to go and see so competition took its toll. Political comedies usually skew older but Cohen’s bold humor led to a young adult crowd taking interest. But with low customer satisfaction ratings and Men in Black 3 opening Friday, the domestic road ahead looks grim.However, The Dictator fared well elsewhere in the world. The Wadiya pic debuted to an estimated $30.3M overseas from 29 markets – most of which are not among the world’s top-grossing territories – taking the number one spot in 25 of them. Cohen’s home market of the U.K. led with $7.2M over five days followed by Australia with $5.7M in five days. Both opened smaller than Brüno, though. Germany debuted to $4.5M which was bigger than the fashionista pic. The underwhelming American response may end up meaning little in the long run if international markets continue to embrace the film and perform well. With $54.8M globally in its first extended weekend, and France, Italy and Japan still to come over the months ahead, The Dictator seems positioned to recover its costs.Johnny Depp and Tim Burton saw their fans flee this weekend as their latest project Dark Shadows tumbled 57% in its sophomore round to an estimated $12.8M. Word-of-mouth has not been very good for the pricey film which cost an estimated $150M+ to produce. Warner Bros. has collected a disappointing $50.9M in ten days and looks headed for a $70-75M domestic finish putting tremendous pressure on international markets to deliver. Overseas, Shadows grossed an estimated $30.4M this weekend from 52 markets including a $5M debut in Japan boosting the international cume to $81.3M and the worldwide gross to $132.2M.Lionsgate tried to offer counter-programming for adult women not interested in testosterone action tentpoles by releasing the all-star pregnancy comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting but was met with modest results. The PG-13 film starring Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, Chris Rock, Dennis Quaid, and Brooklyn Decker in her second new film of the weekend bowed to an estimated $10.5M from 3,021 theaters for a sluggish $3,476 average. Reviews were more negative than positive but often times with these comedies starpower can trump bad buzz from critics. That wasn’t the case here. With men being repelled by the subject matter, Johnny Depp taking in more money from adult women, and Avengers still sucking up all business from broad audiences, What to Expect failed to generate much excitement with its intended audience despite being based on a best-selling book. A B- CinemaScore for the $30M film indicates that the film should exit theaters soon.The indie comedy The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel expanded once again by doubling its run from 178 to 354 theaters and climbed up two spots to number six with an estimated $3.3M. The Fox Searchlight release averaged a solid $9,181 per location raising its total to $8.2M. Hotel is connecting with a crowd not interested in big studio tentpoles (all films above it on the chart are playing in 3000+ theaters) and is carving out its own piece of the box office pie. The ensemble hit will go nationwide on Friday for the long Memorial Day holiday frame reaching more than 1,100 playdates.Lionsgate’s franchise flick The Hunger Games held up well again dropping only 33% to an estimated $3M putting the stellar cume at $391.6M as it inches closer to the quadruple-century mark. Sony’s hit comedy Think Like a Man followed with an estimated $2.7M, off 54%, for a $85.9M cume.Falling 57% was the romance The Lucky One with an estimated $1.8M while Sony’s 3D toon The Pirates! Band of Misfits dropped 54% to an estimated $1.5M. Totals stand at $56.9M and $25.4M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $133.3M which was down 15% from last year when Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides opened at number one with $90.2M; and down 6% from 2010 when Shrek Forever After debuted on top with $70.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"razzies, theme, rom-coms, nbcuniversal, fresh, anime, festival, Lifetime, Plus","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Avengers-Reign-Continues"},{"id":"47509126055744","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Lorax Holds on to Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Lorax Holds on to Top SpotPlus, John Carter trails behind, and Silent House takes #4.by Gitesh Pandya | March 12, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hollywood studios suffered failures of every kind with their new releases. The pricey actioner John Carter debuted in second place putting it far from where it needed to be to recover its enormous costs, the horror entry Silent House scored the lowest audience grade of the year, and Eddie Murphy’s latest comedy A Thousand Words earned the worst reviews of 2012 from film critics. Instead, moviegoers once again made the animated comedy The Lorax the most popular film in North America and the overall box office continued to beat out last year’s levels, although by a narrow margin.Easily leading all movies in the marketplace, Universal held onto the number one spot with the Dr. Seuss toon The Lorax which slipped an acceptable 44% to an estimated $39.1M. The PG-rated hit averaged a sensational $10,430 in its second weekend from 3,746 theaters and continues to play to families and beyond. 3D and IMAX ticket prices have helped along the way and on Sunday, Lorax became the highest-grossing film of 2012 after just ten days of release with a cume of $122M. Breaking the $200M barrier should be no problem for the $70M production.Landing in second place in its opening weekend was the mega-budgeted 3D sci-fi epic John Carter with an estimated $30.6M from 3,749 theaters for a $8,163 average. The gross itself was not all that bad for a sci-fi actioner releasing at this time of year. But it was far from what was needed to make a project with such a mammoth cost become a financial winner. Conservative estimates put the production cost alone at $250M while some industry insiders put it higher. Add in a lavish global marketing and distribution push and the total cost to make and release this PG-13 adventure came to nearly $400M. That eye-popping level is often reached by Hollywood tentpoles but with known brands like Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, and Harry Potter which result in billion-dollar global grossers. Last summer saw all three of those franchises come out with their first-ever 3D installments and each reached ten digits at the worldwide box office.Disney’s risky investment featured Pixar guru Andrew Stanton directing his first live-action film after his wildly successful toons Finding Nemo and WALL-E. The source material was a century-old novel which is cherished only in the hardcore sci-fi world and virtually unknown elsewhere. Reviews were mixed at best and the trailers and TV spots failed to generate much excitement with a broader action audience. Females had incredibly low interest and there was no starpower to pull in mainstream crowds. Overall, John Carter from the start had little in its arsenal to become a giant hit making the insanely large budget hard to justify.Of course, international markets drive global box office and 3D action films are tops among those that work well overseas so the studio is counting on moviegoers around the world to show up. Carter‘s international debut was indeed impressive with an estimated $70.6M this weekend from 51 markets. All major territories bowed day and date except for China and Japan which are sure to contribute solid numbers in the months ahead.In North America, John Carter played mostly to adult men. Studio research showed that 63% was male and 59% was over 25. IMAX 3D represented 16% of the gross ($4.9M) and overall, 64% ($19.6M) came from 3D screens which was an encouraging ratio by today’s standards. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Friday kicked off slowly with $9.8M while Saturday enjoyed a healthy 25% boost. Sunday is estimated to drop by only 31% to $8.5M.Other effects-driven action films released in the spring have opened in the $30M range like 10,000 BC ($35.9M), Constantine ($29.8M), The Scorpion King ($36.1M), and Jumper ($27.4M). However, none carried the towering budget of John Carter and none had 3D surcharges. Disney even released its red planet pic Mission to Mars this very weekend in 2000 to the tune of $22.9M which at today’s 2D ticket prices would put it ahead of Carter. Last year this weekend, the studio had a costly bomb with Mars Needs Moms which bowed to a pitiful $6.9M weekend and $2,218 average. Chances are the company will stay away from opening Mars movies in March for the time being.Those young men that didn’t show up for the Mars flick were busy partying it up with the raunchy comedy Project X which held up surprisingly well in its second weekend with an estimated $11.6M representing a 45% decline. With a Friday-to-Saturday drop on opening weekend and lackluster exit polls, the Warner Bros. title was expected to fall harder the way these types of films do. Instead, the target audience was uninterested in the three new offerings and showed up for this one which has now banked $40.1M in just ten days. Project X cost only $12M to produce and should finish with a promising $65M or so, joining Chronicle and The Devil Inside as low-cost found-footage pics that scored big bucks this year from young adult audiences.Audiences hated the ending and gave a dismal F CinemaScore grade to the new horror pic Silent House which debuted in a tie for fourth place with an estimated $7M. The Open Road release averaged a weak $3,300 from 2,124 locations and saw no growth in sales on Saturday from opening day. The R-rated chiller starring Elizabeth Olsen as a young woman terrorized in her family cabin earned mixed reviews but featured a twist ending that ticket buyers were not at all entertained by. CinemaScore grades are often affected by the mood that polled moviegoers are in immediately after walking out of a theater so many vote on how satisfied they were with the final parts of the film. Devil Inside from January also met with an F before collapsing 76% in the second weekend.Also collecting an estimated $7M this weekend was former number one Act of Valor which fell by 48% which was the largest decline in the top ten. Relativity has taken in a stellar $56.1M for the low-budget action film.Eddie Murphy’s latest career embarrassment came in the form of his new comedy A Thousand Words which tanked in its debut grossing only $6.4M, according to estimates. The Paramount release about a fast-talking agent that must refrain from speaking or else he will die (yes, that’s the plot) failed to excite moviegoers and averaged a weak $3,360 from 1,890 theaters. The PG-13 film was eviscerated by critics and had the rare distinction of earning a Rotten Tomatoes score of 0%. Postponed for years, the DreamWorks production cost $40M to produce.If there was any good news for Murphy it was that Words beat the openings of his recent box office disasters Meet Dave and Imagine That — both PG-rated summer pics — which bowed to $5.2M and $5.5M, respectively. This would be the only thing that could count as good news. The audience breakdown was 55% female and 61% 25 and older while the CinemaScore was a B-.Universal’s action hit Safe House followed with an estimated $5M, off 33%, for a $115.8M cume with solid legs going into its fifth frame. The Sony smash The Vow also held up well dropping only 34% to an estimated $4M raising the total to $117.6M. Channing Tatum aims for his second number one hit in as many months with Friday’s release of 21 Jump Street.Reese Witherspoon’s action-romance This Means War is another film that audiences continue to flock to. The Fox title wasn’t super strong out of the gate but has been posting good holds each week. This weekend saw a 33% dip to an estimated $3.8M lifting the sum to $46.9M. Yet another action title followed as Journey 2: The Mysterious Island collected an estimated $3.7M, off 44%, giving the Warner Bros. sequel $90.7M to date.A pair of indie films enjoyed solid results in their limited debuts. The relationship comedy Friends With Kids opened in 374 theaters and landed in the number 13 spot nationwide with an estimated $2.2M and a good $5,799 average which was third best in the entire Top 20. Starring Maya Rudolph, Kristin Wiig, and Jon Hamm, the R-rated film from Roadside Attractions earned mostly positive reviews.The Ewan McGregor-Emily Blunt pic Salmon Fishing in the Yemen opened in just 18 locations but took in an estimated $240,000 for a solid $13,333 average. Reviews were generally good for the CBS Films release which played to older women as exit polls showed that the audience was 61% female and 71% over 50. Yemen widens in existing markets Friday and then expands to new markets on the following weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $118M which was up 5% from last year when Battle: Los Angeles opened in the top spot with $35.6M; but down 9% from 2010 when Alice in Wonderland remained at number one with $62.7M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hidden, Games, singing, Awards, watch, to, Video, MTV, elm, Comics, films","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Lorax-Holds-on-to-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509126038330","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Is New #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Think Like a Man Is New #1Plus, The Lucky One takes #2, and The Hunger Games finally falls.by Gitesh Pandya | April 23, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, proving for the umpteenth time that African American casts can bring in the big bucks, Sony’s Think Like a Man exploded into the top spot at the box office while the romance of The Lucky One debuted solidly in second. Both films knocked 4-time champ The Hunger Games from the top slot.Based on the bestselling book by Steve Harvey, Think Like a Man dominated the box office with a stellar $33M opening this weekend, according to estimates, for a powerful $16,377 per screen average. Starring Michael Ealy, Regina Hall, Kevin Hart and Taraji P. Henson (amongst others), the film managed to make back its entire production budget (approximately $12M) in its first day in theaters. The industry should no longer be surprised when a film starring a primarily African American cast proves successful at the box office, but instead should be asking why more of them aren’t made. There is obviously a large audience ready to devour these films. Reviews were mixed but audiences dug what they saw, giving the film an A grade at CinemaScore. This was also the fourth number one film of the year for Sony, following Underworld: Awakening, The Vow and 21 Jump Street.Debuting in second place was the latest film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, The Lucky One which brought in an estimated $22.8M this weekend, for a per screen average of $7,228. As expected, the film played mostly to young women, with an audience breakdown of 76% female, and 52% under the age of 25. Reviews were mostly poor, but people who are suckers for romance didn’t care as the film garnered a CinemaScore grade of a B+.Making it a book-to-film trifecta, following its four-week reign at the top — the first film since Avatar to do that — the spring juggernaut The Hunger Games continued to pull in solid business by sliding only 31% to an estimated $14.5M in its fifth round. The Lionsgate smash upped its cume to a staggering $356.9M allowing Katniss and pals to rise up to number 19 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just ahead of the $352.4M of last summer’s 3D threequel Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The next films to fall to the icy stare of Katniss will be Jurassic Park ($357M), and then Jesus himself in The Passion of the Christ ($370.8M).Disney’s yearly Earth Day documentary Chimpanzee opened nicely at number four this weekend with an estimated $10.2M. The film opened higher than the Earth Day films from the past three years which included Earth in 2009 ($8.8M opening/$32M total), 2010’s Oceans ($6M/$19.4M) and last year’s African Cats ($6M/$15.4M). I fully expect next year for Disney to hit their pinnacle with a documentary on puppies and kittens putting the past behind them and living together in harmony.The Three Stooges stumbled to fifth place dropping 46% to an estimated $9M giving Fox $29M after ten days. Look for a final gross in the $45M range for Larry, Moe and Curly (but not Shemp). Falling 47% in its sophomore round was the horror flick The Cabin in the Woods with an estimated $7.7M for a $27M ten-day cume for Lionsgate. Look for a finale in the $40M range. Universal’s comedy fourquel American Reunion collected an estimated $5.2M, off 50%, and has lifted its tally to $48M, which is about what American Pie 2 made in its opening weekend nearly 11 years ago.James Cameron’s Titanic 3D fell a steep 58% to an estimated $5M and has collected $53M for Paramount during this run. Somehow I don’t imagine Cameron or the studio feel too badly about the dip as the lifetime total now stands at $653M. Sony’s hit comedy 21 Jump Street fared well again dropping only 30% to an estimated $4.6M for an impressive $127M take to date. The stylish fairy tale adventure Mirror Mirror declined by 40% grossing an estimated $4.1M for a $55M sum.The top ten films grossed an estimated $116M which was up 1.6% from last when Rio stayed in the top spot with $26.3M; and up 35.6% from 2010 when How To Train Your Dragon reclaimed number one with $15.4M in its fifth frame.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"IFC, Fox, composers, Network","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Think-Like-a-Man-Is-New-1"},{"id":"47509124480821","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Men in Black III Dethrones The Avengers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Men in Black III Dethrones The AvengersThreequel debuts on top for the four-day weekend, albeit to lower attendance than its predecessors.by Gitesh Pandya | May 28, 2012 |  CommentsWill Smith made his long-awaited return to multiplexes and seized the number one spot at the North American box office with his new sci-fi sequel Men in Black 3 which booted The Avengers down to second place in its fourth weekend. But fewer people came out to greet the 3D alien comedy compared to the two previous installments prompting the top ten to fall by a troubling 31% from last year’s four-day Memorial Day holiday session.Sony topped the box office with Men in Black 3 which opened to an estimated $70M over the long Friday-to-Monday weekend and an estimated $55M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion. Boosted by higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screens, the PG-13 film averaged $12,947 over three days and $16,478 over four days from an ultrawide 4,248 theaters. Comparisons to the first two Men in Black films are uneven since those both debuted mid-week ahead of the Fourth of July holiday frames. Plus they did not have 3D surcharges and ticket prices were significantly lower back in 1997 for the original film and 2002 for the first sequel. Still, those Friday-to-Sunday debuts were $51.1M and $52.1M respectively indicating a big drop in admissions this time around for the aging franchise.Reviews were fairly good for MIB3 which reunited Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and director Barry Sonnenfeld with Josh Brolin added to the cast of the new time-travel story. The production cost is estimated to be $230M which is to be expected for a star-driven threequel. Smith has not had a film since the flop Seven Pounds from December 2008 and has not had a number one hit, or any action movie, since Hancock from July 2008. The new alien pic earned a good B+ grade from CinemaScore.Rejuvenating a franchise after a decade-long absence was a challenge as was attracting audiences when The Avengers is doing so well with action-hungry moviegoers. The four-day opening does not even rank among the top ten best Memorial Day weekend debuts despite the help from 3D prices. Historically, sequels debuting over this holiday are very front-loaded putting Agents J and K on course to finish their third domestic trip in the $150-175M range which would be the lowest tally of the trilogy.Sony reported that Men in Black opened at number one in 104 international territories this weekend too with an overseas bow of $133.2M and global launch of $203.2M. A series of red carpet premieres in Asia and Europe helped to drive excitement with the leading markets being China ($19.5M), Russia ($18.9M), Korea ($8.5M), and Japan ($8M). Thanks to growth overseas since the last MIB, domestic shortfalls could be made up from strong international sales.Dropping out of the number one spot didn’t stop The Avengers from racking up more impressive numbers and breaking additional records. The assembly of super heroes took in an estimated $46.9M in its fourth weekend with the three-day portion of $36.8M declining by only 34% making for a terrific hold as holiday moviegoers caught up on the most-talked-about movie of the year. With “see it again” ads hitting the marketplace for the long weekend, movie fans of all types are responding by seeing a blockbuster film that delivers the escapist entertainment people are looking for.After 25 days, the amazing cume shot up to $523.6M and broke the half-billion domestic mark on Saturday in a record 23 days. Avatar previously held that record with 32 days so this was quite a fast achievement. Avengers is now on track to surpass The Dark Knight’s $533.3M by next weekend to take over the number three spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters trailing the James Cameron double feature.International crowds are still coming out spending an estimated $28.1M this weekend in the fifth round boosting the overseas haul to $781.9M and the global gross to $1.305 billion. Currently the fourth biggest worldwide grosser, the Marvel gang will soon surpass Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 to take the number three spot on a global basis too. Avengers may just end its run with close to $1.5 billion. Pleasing movie fans everywhere, the Disney juggernaut has been sucking the life out of the worldwide box office for a month now.Following its weak launch, the mega-priced action tentpole Battleship just could not stay relevant with moviegoers and plunged 57% over the Friday-to-Sunday period to an estimated $10.9M which was a sizable drop given that Sunday was stronger than usual with a holiday following it. The four-day weekend was $13.8M. After 11 days, the board game pic has grossed only $47.3M and is on course to end its domestic run with a very disappointing $70M or so. With a production cost of at least $209M, that just isn’t what the studio needed to turn it into a moneymaker, much less a franchise. Sandwiched in between Avengers and MIB3, Battleship did not become a must-see action pic for summer audiences this month. Overseas grosses rose slightly to $232.7M putting the worldwide total at $283M which is still lower than what a costly project like this needed. The final global tally won’t go too much higher than $300M.The Dictator, another big May offering from Hollywood that isn’t exciting too many ticket buyers, fell in its second weekend to an estimated $11.8M over the long weekend putting the 13-day sum at $43.6M. Paramount will struggle to get its final domestic gross to match the $65M production cost. Overseas audiences also fled from the Sacha Baron Cohen political satire with an estimated $11.8M from 29 international markets, down 53%. With $50.3M from outside of North America, Dictator’s worldwide total rose to $94M. Johnny Depp’s vampire comedy Dark Shadows followed with an estimated $9.4M across four days for a total of only $64.9M for the expensive Warner Bros. release.The new horror pic Chernobyl Diaries opened poorly with an estimated $9.3M over the long weekend from 2,433 theaters for a slow $3,822 average over four days. Audiences instantly disliked the Warner Bros. film as Saturday sales tumbled 33% from the opening day with the CinemaScore grade being a horrible D+. Fright films rarely succeed in the month of May when much bigger summer popcorn movies are rolling out for young adult audiences.Lionsgate’s underperforming all-star comedy What to Expect When You’re Expecting dipped to an estimated $8.9M and has collected just $23.9M in 11 days. Expanding nationwide, Fox Searchlight’s indie hit The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel climbed up to an estimated $8.2M over four days doubling its weekend gross after widening to 1,233 locations. The British pic averaged $6,671 per location and has banked $18.4M so far.The blockbuster The Hunger Games placed ninth with an estimated $2.9M remaining a popular choice for fans in its tenth weekend. With $395.9M to date, the Lionsgate smash looks set to break the $400M mark. Sony’s hit comedy Think Like a Man rounded out the top ten with an estimated $1.8M over four days for a $88.7M total.Focus generated a spectacular platform debut for Wes Anderson’s latest film Moonrise Kingdom which opened in just four theaters with an estimated $669,000 over four days for a jaw-dropping average of $167,372. Generating buzz from its opening night slot at the Cannes Film Festival, the quirky dramedy was loved by critics and will expand in the weeks ahead becoming a major force on the indie scene. The filmmaker’s loyal fans in New York and Los Angeles routinely come out for his latest stories and soon it will test the waters in more parts of the country.The top ten films grossed an estimated $182.9M over the Friday-to-Monday period which was down 31% from last year when The Hangover Part II opened at number one with $103.4M over the long weekend; but even with 2010 when Shrek Forever After stayed on top in its second frame with $57.1M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"critic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Men-in-Black-III-Dethrones-The-Avengers"},{"id":"47509127072582","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Grey Takes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Grey Takes the Top SpotPlus, Underworld holds at #2, and One for the Money takes third.by Gitesh Pandya | January 30, 2012 |  CommentsThis weekend, audiences turned out for Liam Neeson’s latest thriller The Grey which topped a busy frame that saw three new action entries attack a North American box office that already had plenty of action offerings. Marking the first number one debut for rookie distributor Open Road, the R-rated Alaskan survival pic bowed to an estimated $20M from 3,185 theaters for a solid $6,279 average. Following Taken and Unknown, Neeson has emerged as a more cerebral action hero and has now anchored three number one hits over the past three years which is more than most other Hollywood stars like Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, Matt Damon, or Denzel Washington.Reviews were favorable for The Grey but audiences were not too thrilled with the outcome as the wolf attack flick earned a disappointing B- grade from CinemaScore. Social media chatter on Twitter included plenty of disappointment from people who thought that Neeson would have a bigger presence in the film given his prominence in the advertising campaign. But after the shocking $24.7M debut of Taken over Super Bowl weekend in 2009 and the brawny $21.9M debut of Unknown over last year’s Presidents Day holiday frame, it made sense that Neeson was far and away the top commercial selling point for the $25M production which boasted no other major stars. Coming up on his 60th birthday, the busy Irish actor could possibly star in a whopping five number one hits this year thanks to the February 10 re-release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, the March 30 bow of Wrath of the Titans, the May 18 launch of Battleship, and the July 20 release of The Dark Knight Rises.Despite all the action competition, last week’s box office champ Underworld: Awakening held up incredibly well dropping 51% to an estimated $12.5M for the lowest sophomore decline in the history of the four-film franchise. The first three pics each fell by 55-65% after their debuts and generally fourth chapters in a sci-fi or horror series draw such a big part of the built-in audience upfront that they crumble in the second frame. Sony has taken in $45.1M after ten days with its Kate Beckinsale vehicle and can expect a final take in the $65-70M range helped in part by 3D surcharges.Katherine Heigl landed in third place with a respectable debut for her latest film One for the Money which bowed to an estimated $11.8M from 2,737 sites for a decent $4,293 average. Lionsgate refrained from screening the PG-13 action-comedy for critics but reviews that eventually came out were brutal making it the front-runner for next year’s Razzie Awards at this early stage in the race. Heigl’s films routinely open in double digit millions despite horrible reviews and lame plots although this one lacked a notable male lead. Money, which finds the actress playing a bail bondswoman hunting down an old flame, skewed heavily towards women with studio research showing that the audience was 79% female and 74% over 25. With a lackluster B- CinemaScore, the road ahead looks grim.The fighter pilot actioner Red Tails dropped 45% from its impressive debut and took fourth place with an estimated $10.4M. Fox’s release of the George Lucas production has collected $33.8M in ten days and a final tally of $55-60M seems likely which is more than most expected.Scoring the worst opening of the frame’s three new releases, but the best audience feedback, was Summit’s Man on a Ledge with an estimated $8.3M. The PG-13 film averaged a weak $2,752 per theater from 2,998 locations and just couldn’t compete with the wide range of other action offerings in the marketplace. Reviews were dull and lead actor Sam Worthington has never anchored an action hit outside of pre-existing brands like Clash of the Titans or James Cameron. But Ledge did have broad appeal with men and women represented equally and 56% of the crowd being under 25. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+ and the Friday-to-Saturday increase was 44% – both tops among the freshmen.A pair of Oscar nominees for Best Picture followed, each exploiting the nominations in a different way. The Tom Hanks-Sandra Bullock drama Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close dipped only 29% to an estimated $7.1M in its second weekend of wide release to raise the cume to $21.1M. Warner Bros. has used a Million Dollar Baby-style strategy with this 9/11 pic by opening in just a small number of theaters in late December in order to qualify and then waiting until nomination time to go nationwide letting others duke it out during awards season in hopes that it will be a fresh new option for voters and mainstream audiences alike. The plan worked for Baby which triumphed over the presumed front-runner The Aviator that year. But it may not be repeat this time as Loud only scored one other Academy Award nomination and was left out of the Director race. Still, the Oscar heat could help the film’s legs at the box office over the next few weeks as mature audiences catch up on Academy-endorsed films.George Clooney’s The Descendants expanded on Friday more than tripling its run on the heels of earning five Oscar nods and jumped back into the top ten at number seven with an estimated $6.6M. Now getting a second life in its 11th week of release, the Fox Searchlight film boosted its theater count by 257% from 560 locations to 2,001 and watched its weekend gross jump 176% although its average fell by 23%. The Alexander Payne-directed pic has banked $58.8M to date and could rake in a lot more thanks to the Oscar heat and the fact that it has some star power and mainstream appeal.Former number one Contraband followed with an estimated $6.5M, down 46%, giving Universal $56.4M to date for the Mark Wahlberg actioner. Disney’s 3D makeover of Beauty and the Beast dropped 39% to an estimated $5.3M for $41.1M so far. The animated film’s lifetime gross including the 1991 original release plus the 2002 special edition is now $212.5M. Rounding out the top ten was Steven Soderbergh’s action thriller Haywire which fell a sharp 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $4M putting the Relativity title at $15.3M in ten days.Oscar nominees all hustled this past week to turn nominations into extra box office. Distributors worked hard to cash in as Academy endorsements and media hype can translate into broader moviegoer interest, especially for smaller films that need more convincing. But with this game comes added expenditures as more prints are needed and additional advertising is purchased so the net “Oscar bump” is nearly impossible to calculate.The undisputed front-runner The Artist expanded from 662 to 897 theaters and saw its weekend take rise 40% to an estimated $3.3M giving The Weinstein Co. a total of $16.7M with plenty more to come. Its average of $3,696 was not too impressive but it did inch up 3% from last weekend. A near-impossible sell in the U.S. market, The Artist is now fully in the spotlight and positioned to pull in audiences that would not have purchased tickets before. There will still be resistance to the silent 1930s-set French-produced film from the broader mainstream crowd so the cume will only rise so high. But with numerous wins including the top film prizes from both the PGA and DGA, the Golden Globe for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical, Critics Choice awards for Picture and Director, plus ten Academy Award nominations, The Artist is clearly the film to beat and can extend its box office fortunes past Feb 26 if it pulls off a big victory.Martin Scorsese’s Hugo, which led all films with 11 Oscar nods, enjoyed a similar expansion from 650 to 965 sites and grossed an estimated $2.3M. Its boost of 143% was much greater as the 3D film is more accessible and includes characters speaking to each other. Paramount’s total is $58.7M. The incredibly expensive production did not fare too well during its initial run but now has a chance add to its cume by reaching those who missed it the first time around. Fellow Best Picture contender War Horse did not benefit much as the Spielberg pic fell 37% to an estimated $2M raising the sum to $75.6M. The war drama lost nearly 700 screens but also saw its average drop too.Following its qualifying run, Glenn Close’s Albert Nobbs opened in limited release after nabbing three Oscar nominations and grossed an estimated $773,000 from 245 theaters for a sluggish $3,155 average. The overall cume is $823,000 for Roadside Attractions and reviews have been mixed for the film but solid for Close’s performance as a woman playing a man.Elsewhere below the top ten, Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol achieved a pair of notable milestones this weekend. The domestic haul broke the $200M mark with $202.6M thus far while the international run continued to shine raising the overseas tally to $369M. The action hit is now the top-grossing installment of the popular franchise with a global gross of $571.6M and counting thanks in part to a solid debut in China where it raked in $12.7M in only two days more than quintupling the opening of the last Mission: Impossible picture there. The $600M barrier will be crushed soon.The top ten films grossed an estimated $92.5M which was up 6% from last year when The Rite opened in the top spot with $14.8M; but down 11% from 2010 when Avatar stayed at number one yet again in its seventh frame with $31.3M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"vampires","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Grey-Takes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509127270215","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Contraband Steals Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Contraband Steals Box Office Crownby RT Staff | January 15, 2012 |  CommentsMark Wahlberg’s action-thriller Contraband took control of the box office this weekend, while the latest Disney 3D re-release did relatively well and last weekend’s champ crashed and burned in its second go around.Giving off some good vibrations this weekend was Universal’s Contraband, which opened with an estimated $24.1M this weekend from 2,863 playdates, for a per screen average of $8,418. Wahlberg is a surprisingly strong draw at the box office, with all of his wide releases over the last decade opening in the double digits. His box office history reminds me of a poor man’s Denzel Washington, just without the accolades. Audiences dug the film as evidenced by its A- grade from Cinemascore.Second place went to the 3D re-release Beauty and the Beast, which follows last year’s huge re-release of The Lion King. Beast opened with $18.5M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $7,044. It didn’t quite reach the heights of The Lion King, which opened last September to $30.2M, but for a 20 year old film, it’s still pretty strong, especially when you consider the 3D Blu-ray has been on sale for 3 months already. Beast also now holds the record for highest opening weekend for an animated film in January, taking down Hoodwinked from this weekend in 2006. If there’s any company that knows how to milk their products for all they’re worth, it’s Disney. They’ve got Finding Nemo ready for 3D later this year.Tom Cruise’s latest impossible mission fell to number three this weekend, with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol taking in $11.5M, according to estimates, a drop of 42% from last weekend. Its total now stands at $186.7M, with the $200M barrier ready to fall.The musical notes of Joyful Noise opened in fourth place this weekend, with an estimated $11.3M, for a per screen average of a decent $4,148. Starring Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah, the film also received an A- from Cinemascore, meaning that it might have some legs over the next few weeks.A franchise star arrived in the next spot. Robert Downey, Jr. (star of not one, but two current major franchises) landed in fifth place this week with Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows which dipped 39% to an estimated $8.4M, bringing its cume to $170M after five weeks.And the moment we’ve been waiting for… last weekend’s shocking box office champ The Devil Inside completely collapsed in its second weekend tumbling 76.6% to an estimated $7.9M. The drop was one of the worst in box office history, which isn’t surprising considering a) horror films generally are front-loaded and b) the reviews were downright horrible (which still may be too nice). Still, with a total take of $46.2M so far, Paramount is laughing all the way to the bank, and we can expect to see even more of these low budget, found footage films in the future.Seventh place belonged to Craig, Daniel Craig and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which fell 40% to an estimated $6.8M, bringing its total up to $88M. Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked followed in eighth place with an estimated $5.8M, a drop of 39% from last weekend, bringing its cume to $118.8M after five laps. Ninth place belonged to even more animals as the Steven Spielberg-directed War Horse brought in $5.6M, according to estimates, bringing its total up to $65.8M.Meryl Streep’s latest bid for a third Oscar, the Margaret Thatcher political drama The Iron Lady, did well in its nationwide expansion after two weeks of platform release. The Weinstein Co. title grossed an estimated $5.4M from 802 sites (up from 5) averaging a solid $6,716 per theater. It was almost identical to last weekend’s expansion of another British political drama Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy which debuted in 809 locations for a similar $6,772 average playing to an older upscale crowd.The top ten films grossed an estimated $105.3M which was down 2% from last year when The Green Hornet opened in the top spot with $33.5M; and down 29% from 2010 when Avatar remained at number one with $42.8M in its fifth frame.Follow Gitesh on Twitter!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"SDCC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Contraband-Steals-Box-Office-Crown"},{"id":"47509127287630","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Immortals Debuts at the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Immortals Debuts at the TopPlus, Jack and Jill and J. Edgar aren't far behind, and Puss in Boots stays hot.by Gitesh Pandya | November 14, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Greek Gods conquered the North American box office as the 3D adventure epic Immortals opened at number one while Adam Sandler’s new comedy Jack and Jill and two-time chart-topper Puss in Boots fought over second place with virtually identical grosses. The new FBI biopic J. Edgar opened more like a Clint Eastwood film than a Leonardo DiCaprio one, settling into fifth place in its first weekend. Overall the marketplace saw healthy double digit gains over last year, thanks in part to the Veterans Day holiday falling on Friday instead of Thursday this year. Multiplex activity is set to go even higher very soon with the Twilight juggernaut right around the corner.Relativity Media shot to number one with Immortals, which bowed to an estimated $32M from 3,112 theaters for a muscular $10,283 average. It was the third biggest opening this year for an R-rated film — and best for a non-sequel — trailing The Hangover Part II and Paranormal Activity 3, which debuted to $85.9M and $52.6M, respectively. Opening above industry expectations, Immortals received mixed reviews from critics but connected with action and fantasy fans who powered the opening day Friday to $15M. Saturday sales dropped a sharp 32% from Veterans Day and Sunday is estimated to slide by another 33% to $6.8M.Original action films that are not part of an existing brand like James Bond or The Lord of the Rings rarely open above $30M during the football season when millions of males are occupied on Saturdays and Sundays. Studio research showed that the stylishly violent war epic played to an audience that was 60% male, and 75% was under 35. 70% of the business ($22.4M) came from non-white audiences while the CinemaScore grade was a B. 3D was a popular option for Immortals as 66% of the grosses came from the higher-priced format.Produced for $75M, Immortals also opened overseas in 35 territories this weekend including Japan, Germany, the U.K., China, and Russia grossing an estimated $36M for a global debut of $68M.If estimates hold, Adam Sandler’s latest laughfest Jack and Jill will open in second place with an estimated $26M, a figure that rival studios believe is too optimistic. The Sony release averaged $7,563 from 3,438 theaters and did not make it into the $30-40M range that the funnyman usually finds himself in with broad comedies. Friday started with $9.9M, Saturday eased 2% to $9.6M while Sunday is estimated to drop by only 32% to an estimated $6.5M. That would be a small Sunday drop for a Sandler comedy during the football season, although this PG-rated pic is hoping for family business which would yield a stronger-than-usual Sunday performance.Critics slammed Jack and Jill with some of their harshest words of any film this year. Moviegoers were only somewhat satisfied with what they got as the pic got a B CinemaScore grade. Studio research showed that the childish humor played broadly as the audience was 52% female, 57% 25 and older, with 53% being families. Despite the atrocious reviews, Jack could continue to bring in respectable grosses as no new mainstream comedies will open over the next three weeks.Following close behind according to estimates but hoping to finish in second place when final figures are tallied on Monday was two-time box office leader Puss in Boots, which dipped only 23% to an estimated $25.5M. The 3D toon smashed the $100M mark on Saturday in its 16th day of release and has grossed a stellar $108.8M to date. Tougher competition will start on Friday with the arrival of the rival 3D animated kidpic Happy Feet Two followed five days later by The Muppets, but a final domestic haul of $160M or more still seems likely. Paramount has had a red hot year in 2011 and has now seen eight of its eleven wide releases join the century club, while the ones that didn’t have performed well too.Only $500,000 separated Jack and Jill and Puss in Boots according to studio estimates. Final numbers to be released on Monday will include actual sales figures for Sunday and could see the two films switch positions, making Jack that rare broad comedy from Sandler that opens outside of the top two positions.Universal’s action-comedy Tower Heist fell a moderate 45% to an estimated $13.2M in its second weekend and has raised its ten-day tally to a decent $43.9M. The $85M Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy vehicle could end its domestic run at about $70M meaning a strong overseas run will be needed.Clint Eastwood’s latest film debuted in fifth place. The biopic J. Edgar headlined by Leonardo DiCaprio bowed to an estimated $11.5M from 1,910 locations for a solid $6,005 average. The opening was on par with the nationwide debut of the director’s last film Hereafter which opened to $12M and a $5,510 average in October of last year on its way to a disappointing $32.7M final. Reviews were mixed with many top ones being negative and audiences also were not too thrilled as the R-rated drama earned only a B grade from CinemaScore. J. Edgar platformed in seven theaters in top markets on Wednesday to get a jump on the weekend, putting the total at $11.6M for Warner Bros.The stoner threequel A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas suffered an understandable 55% drop in its second weekend collecting an estimated $5.9M putting the ten-day tally at $23.2M. Produced for only $20M, the Warner Bros. release fared a bit better than its predecessor, Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, which tumbled 59% in its sophomore frame, although it faced the opening of the superhero juggernaut Iron Man, which stole the attention of young men. Christmas looks set to finish with about $35M putting it just behind Guantanamo‘s $38.1M but ahead of the $18.2M of 2004’s Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle.Fox’s sci-fi thriller In Time declined by 45% in its third round to an estimated $4.2M giving Fox $30.7M in 17 days. Paramount’s horror hit Paranormal Activity 3 joined the century club with its estimated $3.6M weekend, off 57%, putting the low-cost $5M chiller at $100.8M and counting. It should finish near the $107.9M of the first film in the highly profitable series.The studio’s dance remake Footloose followed with an estimated $2.7M, down 39%, for a $48.9M sum. Rounding out the top ten was Hugh Jackman’s boxing hit Real Steel which dropped 42% to an estimated $2M and $81.7M to date for Disney. The robot flick is now the actor’s second-biggest non-Wolverine hit after 2004’s Van Helsing, which grossed $120.1M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.6M which was up a healthy 18% from last year when Megamind remained in the top spot with $29.1M; and up 2% from 2009 when 2012 opened at number one with $65.2M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"jones, Television, TV, toronto, CW, movies, canceled, Amazon, TCA, Fire, E3, christmas, awards, Superheroes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Immortals-Debuts-at-the-Top"},{"id":"47509127277385","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sherlock Holmes Wins the Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Sherlock Holmes Wins the WeekendPlus, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Mission: Impossible take #2 and #3.by Gitesh Pandya | December 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, three big Hollywood sequels led the North American box office pumping in some badly needed new content but that didn’t stop the overall marketplace from suffering double digit losses over last year and the year before. Studios are hoping that audiences are just busy right now with holiday shopping and end-of-year activities and that their films will be well-positioned to take advantage of the extra free time people will soon have in the days ahead.Doing what its predecessor couldn’t, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows debuted at number one with an estimated $40M from 3,703 theaters for a solid $10,807 average. The $145M-budgeted Warner Bros. sequel debuted 36% below the $62.3M of the first Holmes which launched in second place behind Avatar on the Christmas frame two years ago over what was the largest weekend in box office history. Since audiences are historically less available in mid-December, the follow-up was never expected to open at the same heights. Shadows earned good reviews from critics and an encouraging A- grade from moviegoers polled by CinemaScore. Sales on Saturday, however, showed virtually no growth over Friday’s opening day. The marketplace for adults will get crowded very quickly in the days ahead so early positive buzz will be crucial as audiences start making up their decisions for what to see over the upcoming holiday break.Sherlock entered only six international markets day and date with domestic and grossed an estimated $14.7M from 2,113 screens including $5.8M in the United Kingdom where it ranked number one by a wide margin. Italy was close behind with $5M while Korea and Germany open later this week.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248329[/rtimage]Opening in second place was Fox’s kidpic threequel Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked which took in an estimated $23.5M from 3,723 locations for a $6,312 average. It was well below the debuts of its two predecessors as the first Alvin gave families something new and fresh on the same weekend of 2007 with a $44.3M debut while the second installment launched over the lucrative Christmas frame with $48.9M in 2009. Chipwrecked opened while kids were still in school and parents were busy with holiday shopping so it was expected to have a softer bow. And aside from a cruise ship storyline, Chipwrecked offered almost nothing new to the table. Last year this weekend Yogi Bear bowed to $16.4M and finished with over six times that amount after playing through the holidays.But while the start was slower, the road ahead looks promising since most films rolling into theaters this holiday season are aimed at adults and there are no new G-rated films for kids opening for the rest of the year. Fox is hoping to capture the family crowd as more children get out of school and more parents get time off to take trips to the multiplexes for some holiday fun. PG-rated competitors will include Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin which is based on a brand that is less familiar to American kids and Matt Damon’s We Bought a Zoo which is less zany for kids looking for laughs. Studio research showed that females made up 54% of the crowd and the film earned a good B+ overall grade from CinemaScore.Chipwrecked opened overseas on 3,800 screens in 38 markets and grossed an estimated $14.5M with only a handful of the major markets debuting like the United Kingdom, Korea, and Spain.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248330[/rtimage]Paramount found itself in third place with a unique limited release of its action tentpole Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol which grossed an estimated $13M from only 425 locations which included about 300 IMAX venues plus other large-format sites. The $145M-budgeted Tom Cruise spy flick averaged a sensational $30,588 per location helped by the higher ticket prices. Including the first shows on Thursday evening starting at 6:00pm, the total was $13.6M. It was a sensational start for an unorthodox move designed to showcase the action film with limited availability in only the biggest possible screens in hopes of sparking strong word-of-mouth that would fuel interest for the film’s regular nationwide run which begins this Wednesday. Adding to the grosses was the special prologue for the Warner Bros. tentpole The Dark Knight Rises which played on selected full large-screen IMAX sites.The tactic was needed for three reasons. First, the franchise is old having been around for over 15 years with the last installment underperforming in 2006. This helps to eventize the film adding to the excitement. Second, Cruise has suffered from serious popularity issues over the last several years with many moviegoers being repelled just by his name alone. He is not the box office draw that he used to be and this special IMAX release allows action fans to focus on the high-octane entertainment and thrills they get and shifts attention away from the star. Indeed, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol earned the best reviews of any action film this year. And third, the marketplace for grown-up fare will be super-competitive this holiday season so this release aims to get buzz going so audiences choose it first instead of other franchise offerings flooding theaters.The studio’s $13M weekend estimate was quite aggressive as it includes a projected dip of only 13% on Sunday. That is unusually low especially for an action film during the football season when adult males become less available on Sundays. Last weekend, the smallest Saturday-to-Sunday drop in the top ten was 36%. The limited nature of the release has led to sell-outs which would cause more business than usual to spill over into Sunday, however the final gross to be reported on Monday could very well see this figure go down and closer to $12M. The resulting average would still be north of $28,000 and incredibly impressive.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248331[/rtimage]Overseas results were spectacular with the new Mission: Impossible ruling the international box office with an opening of an estimated $68.2M from 6,079 theaters across 36 markets with many seeing the IMAX version open a few days ahead of conventional screens. Leading the way was Korea with a stellar $11.1M, Japan with $9M, Russia with $6.1M, and India with $4M. Cruise and company have been on a worldwide tour hosting premieres and generating plenty of publicity to help drive in business. Much of Latin America will see openings this coming week including Mexico and Brazil.With box office down once again versus last year, 3D became a much smaller part of the picture this year. Last year, four of the top five films this weekend enjoyed 3D surcharges. But this frame, the top seven films were all presented in 2D only and just one new opener for the rest of the year will be a 3D one – Tintin.Dropping from first place was the star-packed holiday comedy New Year’s Eve which fell a reasonable 43% to an estimated $7.4M giving Warner Bros. a mere $24.8M in ten days. A final gross near the $50M mark seems likely. Fellow underperforming sophomore comedy The Sitter tumbled 55% to an estimated $4.4M bumping its ten-day take to only $17.7M. Look for Fox to end its run with the Jonah Hill pic at $30M. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 followed with an estimated $4.3M, off 45%, putting Summit’s total at $266.4M.Four films each squeezed into the $3-4M range filling up the rest of the slots in the top ten with estimates that were within $200,000 of each other. Final grosses to be reported on Monday should show a change in the chart positions.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248332[/rtimage]Taking seventh place, for now, was the Charlize Theron film Young Adult with an estimated $3.7M while expanding nationwide from eight to 986 theaters in its second weekend. Averaging a dull $3,702 per site, the $12M-budgeted Paramount release fell below the wide breaks of past end-of-year expansions for director Jason Reitman. His last film Up in the Air, also released by Paramount, fared much better with $11.3M and $5,947 average from 1,895 theaters over the Christmas holiday frame in 2009 while 2007’s Juno did $10.6M and a $10,436 average on the session in between Christmas and New Year’s. Both widened later in their runs in their fourth round. Paramount reported a projected 17% Saturday-to-Sunday decline for Young Adult which was very modest so the final gross and chart position may come out lower. Total stands at $4.1M including the limited run and a wider release is planned for January 13.The studio’s acclaimed Martin Scorsese film Hugo, which earned three Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, dropped 40% to an estimated $3.6M giving the pricey train station saga $39.1M to date. With chipmunks stealing away kids, Arthur Christmas fell by its largest amount yet falling 45% to an estimated $3.6M giving Sony only $38.5M so far. The 3D toon grossed an additional $9.7M overseas this weekend to raise the international sum to $72.8M and global tally to $111.3M. Rounding out the top ten was Disney’s The Muppets with an estimated $3.5M, down 51%, for a $70.9M total.With moviegoers about to get extended breaks from work and school this week, the marketplace is about to get awful crowded, awful fast. Studios are hoping to mine the riches as weekday sales will soon start to get stronger with an assortment of high-profile films hitting theaters in the coming days. Wednesday will see Sony release The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in 2,800 locations while Paramount debuts Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin in 3,000 houses and expands Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol into a full wide release in 3,400 total sites. On Friday, Fox opens the Matt Damon starrer We Bought a Zoo in 3,000 theaters which will be followed on Sunday by the Christmas Day bows of Spielberg’s other offering War Horse from Disney in 2,300 and Summit’s suspense thriller The Darkest Hour in 2,200 locations. Plus, many awards contenders will open or expand throughout the next two weeks.[rtimage]siteImageId=10248333[/rtimage]Opening to good but not stellar results in platform release was the Sony Classics release Carnage with an estimated $86,000 from five houses for a $17,139 average. Based on the hit play about two sets of parents dealing with trouble between their kids, the Roman Polanski film starring Jodie Foster, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Christoph Waltz earned good reviews but has not been a major player during awards season outside of its recent double Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical for Foster and Winslet.Other indie films continued to expand. The Focus thriller Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy widened from four to 16 theaters and grossed an estimated $452,000 for a strong $28,250 average and $852,000 cume. The Artist, which led all films with six Globe nods, expanded slightly from 16 to 17 sites and collected an estimated $287,000 with a $16,882 average. The Weinstein Co. has taken in $1.3M so far.David Cronenberg’s A Dangerous Method took in an estimated $159,000 from 17 playdates for a $9,353 average while the Michael Fassbender drama Shame averaged $5,980 with an estimated $305,000 from 51 locations. Totals stand at $728,000 and $1.2M, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107M which was down 14% from last year when TRON: Legacy opened in the top spot with $44M; and down 15% from 2009 when Avatar debuted at number one with $77M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Elton, cults, rings, 2020","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Sherlock-Holmes-Wins-the-Weekend"},{"id":"47509127282507","title":"Box Office Guru: Breaking Dawn Threepeats Over Weak Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru: Breaking Dawn Threepeats Over Weak Frameby RT Staff | December 5, 2011 |  CommentsThe annual post-turkey blues smacked the North American box office as The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 topped a sluggish frame that saw no new films open in wide release. The rest of the top ten featured the same Thanksgiving leftovers although in different positions thanks to some awards contenders that expanded into more theaters. Overall, ticket sales slumped to their second lowest level of 2011 beating only the weekend after Labor Day which often is the worst session of the entire year. Hollywood is hoping this was the calm before the storm as the final wave of new movies for the holiday season begins this Friday.Breaking Dawn became the first Twilight movie to ever rule the box office for three weeks in a row with its $16.9M frame, according to estimates. The Summit blockbuster fell 60% from its Friday-to-Sunday take over the Thanksgiving holiday which represented a better hold than 2009’s New Moon which fell by 64% in the exact same situation. With $247.3M in 17 days, Dawn is running 3% behind its predecessors Eclipse and Moon which each had just over $255M in the bank in the same number of days despite being released in different seasons of the year. The Bella-and-Edward wedding flick now ranks as the fourth biggest grosser of the year trailing fellow sequels Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($381M), Transformers: Dark of the Moon ($352.4M), and The Hangover Part 2 ($254.5M). A final North American gross of roughly $290M seems likely.The fourth Twilight installment was still a big player at the overseas box office taking in another $40.2M in its third weekend. That boosted the international total to a stellar $341M while the worldwide tally climbed up to $588.3M. The four films in the franchise have now grossed a combined $2.4 billion globally averaging an amazing $600M per film.Staying put in the runner-up spot was Disney’s The Muppets which tumbled 62% to an estimated $11.2M bumping the cume to $56.1M after 12 days. The Kermit-and-Piggy pic suffered the worst fall of any film in the top ten despite winning a solid A grade from CinemaScore last week. The well-known brand and the Black Friday school holiday contributed to a very strong showing upfront and now business is fading away. Muppets should stabilize next weekend since no new kidpics are opening and find its way to a final gross in the $80-90M range.Martin Scorsese’s big-budget 3D film Hugo rose two spots to third place thanks to a wider expansion plus strong word-of-mouth and reviews. The PG-rated film went from 1,277 locations to 1,840 and grossed an estimated $7.6M for an average of $4,144. The director’s acclaimed use of the 3D format continued to find audiences as 76% of the weekend’s gross came from 3D screens – the highest rate for any film in the format currently. Hugo upped its profile in the Oscar race on Thursday when it was named the best picture of 2011 by the National Board of Review with Scorsese taking the director prize too. If it earns top nominations next week from the Golden Globes, the Paramount release can continue to stay in the game at the box office at least until the next wave of family films arrives with Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked on December 16 and Steven Spielberg’s The Adventures of Tintin on December 21. But with $25.2M in 12 days, Hugo should be able to cross the $50M domestic mark.Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten for a film not expanding, Sony’s holiday toon Arthur Christmas placed fourth with an estimated $7.4M in its second weekend dipping only 39%. The 3D kidpic has taken in a modest $25.3M in its first 12 days but its yuletide theme should allow it to have good legs for a few more weeks. Both of next weekend’s new wide releases – New Year’s Day and The Sitter – will play to adults and not hurt the family marketplace too much. A final domestic take in the neighborhood of $50M seems likely. Overseas, where Arthur Christmas has been playing longer, the weekend saw a haul of an estimated $11.4M putting the international sum at $45.3M and the worldwide figure at $70.6M.Warner Bros. saw an estimated $6M for its expensive animated sequel Happy Feet Two which collected an estimated $6M in its third round. With $51.8M in 17 days, the 3D toon is running a disturbing 57% behind the pace of its predecessor which held the number one spot during all three of its first weekends. The domestic final should reach about $65M and the studio will hope for much better results from international markets where 3D animation can deliver much stronger results. This weekend, the penguin pic opened in Russia, the U.K., Germany, and Spain and collected an estimated $16.3M from 40 markets for an international total of $34M and a worldwide take of only $85.8M.Finishing in sixth place was Adam Sandler’s latest Razzie hopeful Jack and Jill which made an estimated $5.5M, down 45%, for a cume to date of $64.3M. The Sony release looks to end with $75-80M making it one of the actor’s worst-performing broad comedies.George Clooney’s dysfunctional family saga The Descendants continued to score big points with ticket buyers in moderate release rising two spots to number seven with an estimated $5.2M. For the third weekend in a row, the Fox Searchlight release posted the best per-theater average in the top ten with a sturdy $9,059 from 574 locations, up 141 from last weekend. All other films in the top ten averaged between $1,100 and $4,200. The Hawaii-set film earned a handful of nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards this past week including best picture and director and will continue to add new theaters throughout December. Descendants saw its gross dip by only 29% and its average fall by 47% thanks to the expansion. The current cume of $18.1M is sure to double by the end of the month.Dropping 51% in its fourth attack was the 3D actioner Immortals which collected an estimated $4.4M pushing the Relativity Media film’s domestic gross past its $75M budget to $75.6M. Overseas, the Greek mythology adventure has taken in north of $100M. Look for the North American figure to end up at around the $85M mark.The Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy action-comedy Tower Heist held up surprisingly well sliding only 42% to an estimated $4.1M. Universal has banked $70.8M so far and could be headed for a $80M finish. Rounding out the top ten was the 3D animated pic Puss in Boots which tumbled 59% to an estimated $3.1M and $139.5M total. The second highest grossing film since Labor Day after Twilight, the Paramount release will end up in the $145-150M range putting it in the same company as last year’s November offering from DreamWorks, Megamind, which grossed $148.4M. Puss grabbed an estimated $23M overseas this weekend to raise the international sum to $89.2M and the global tally to $228.7M.Platforming in just 10 theaters in six top markets and generating plenty of heat was Fox Searchlight’s Shame which debuted to an estimated $361,000 for a potent $36,100 average. The NC-17 film starring Michael Fassbender as a New York bachelor addicted to sex has won positive reviews as well as universal praise for its leading man who is currently one of the favorites in the competitive Best Actor Oscar race. Shame will take a slow and steady approach to its roll-out expanding to nine more theaters on Friday in such markets as Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, and Philadelphia.Awards hopefuls in limited release continued to reach out to arthouse crowds with mixed results. Fassbender saw encouraging results from his other indie release, David Cronenberg’s Sigmund Freud pic A Dangerous Method co-starring Viggo Mortensen and Keira Knightley, which collected an estimated $123,000 from four sites for a solid $30,750 average for Sony Classics. The Weinstein Company’s silent film The Artist, which last week won best picture and director honors from the New York Film Critics Circle, widened slightly in its second weekend from four to six houses and grossed an estimated $206,000 for a strong $34,333 average. Cumes are $416,000 and $496,000, respectively.The biopic My Week with Marilyn saw a more subdued response from audiences grossing an estimated $1.2M from 244 theaters for a mild $4,836 average. The Weinstein Co. has taken in $3.9M to date for the Michelle Williams film which should earn the actress plenty of nominations in the coming months from various awards givers.The top ten films grossed an estimated $71.4M which was down 5% from last year when Tangled rose to the top spot with $21.6M; and down 17% from 2009 when The Blind Side climbed into number one with $20M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, Office, Family, hollywood, venice, television, See, child's, Schedule, Star, christmas, fast","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Breaking-Dawn-Threepeats-Over-Weak-Frame"},{"id":"47509126065987","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Washington Rules Presidents Day with Safe House","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Washington Rules Presidents Day with Safe Houseby Gitesh Pandya | February 21, 2012 |  CommentsThe long Presidents Day holiday frame saw a close battle between four films competing for the top spot but it was Denzel Washington who audiences selected as commander-in-chief of the box office as his action holdover Safe House beat all competitors in its second weekend to claim first place. The next two spots also went to two of last week’s overperforming films which both remained popular with North American ticket buyers. Rounding out the top five were new releases with Nicolas Cage’s Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengenace targeting males in fourth and Reese Witherspoon’s This Means War playing to women in fifth. The overall marketplace over the four-day Friday-to-Monday period once again beat last year’s levels as spending was spread out across a variety of titles with no one film dominating the scene.Washington’s action thriller Safe House led the long weekend as Universal’s CIA pic grossed an estimated $28.4M thanks to a 41% decline over the Friday-to-Sunday span. The 11-day total surged to $82.6M and the film marked the first time a holdover ruled Presidents Day weekend since 2005’s Hitch. House’s ten-day take of $78.1M was just a bit off from the $80.4M that his 2007 hit American Gangster made over the same period of time. That film’s $130.2M total stands as the Oscar winner’s career best, however Safe House has a shot at beating it if it continues to play well in the coming weeks.Swapping positions from last weekend’s close race, The Vow settled for the runner-up spot this time with an estimated $26.6M including a 44% drop over the three-day period. Sony has banked a stellar $88.5M after 11 days easily beating the $56.1M that Channing Tatum’s 2010 romance Dear John grossed over the same span. A finish near the $130M mark could result for this hit as well. Vow cost about $30M to produce, though, which was about one-third as much as Safe House’s $85M budget.Posting the best hold in the top ten was the effects-driven adventure sequel Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which slipped to an estimated $26.4M for a three-day decline of only 27%. The Warner Bros. franchise film starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has banked an impressive $59.5M in its first 11 days and could end up beating the $101.7M of its 2008 predecessor which was headlined by Brendan Fraser. This is the second consecutive action franchise that The Rock has stepped into with encouraging results. Last April’s Fast Five went on to score the highest gross ever in the decade-long series and this summer the former wrestler steps into G.I. Joe: Retaliation hoping to give that series a boost too.Leading the weekend’s new releases was the Nicolas Cage sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance which landed in fourth place with an estimated $25.7M over four days. Averaging $8,097 from 3,174 theaters, the 3D action pic took in half the business of its 2D predecessor which opened a year ago shattering the Presidents Day opening weekend record with $52M over the four-day session. According to studio research, the audience was 61% male and 52% over 25 while the CinemaScore grade was a poor C+. The new Rider installment was reportedly produced for a lower cost than the first film.Opening in fifth place was the romantic action-comedy This Means War starring Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, and Tom Hardy with an estimated $20.4M. The Fox release about a pair of CIA studs using their agency tricks to compete for the same woman averaged $6,397 from 3,189 theaters. Reviews were dismal but audiences were mostly satisfied with what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a good A-. As expected, adult women made up the primary audience as studio research showed that the crowd was 65% female and 60% 25 and older. The three-day take of $17.4M was in the same neighborhood as the openings for some of Witherspoon’s previous starring vehicles like the $16.8M of last year’s Water for Elephants and the $16.4M of 2005’s Just Like Heaven.Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace 3D fell sharply in its second weekend to an estimated $10.2M for an 11-day total of $36M. In lifetime box office terms, that allowed the Jar Jar Binks tale to surpass the original Star Wars for the number four spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters with $467.1M. The sci-fi pic Chronicle held up well in its third round with an estimated $9.2M for a $52.7M cume for Fox.Following in eighth with an estimated $8.1M was the Miyazaki animated film The Secret World of Arrietty which debuted in 1,522 locations for a mild $5,323 average for Disney. The supernatural thriller The Woman in Black grossed an estimated $7.9M for a $46.5M total. Rounding out the top ten was Liam Neeson’s The Grey with an estimated $3.8M and a cume to date of $48.7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $166.6M over the four-day holiday frame which was up 11% from last year when Unknown opened in the top spot with $25.5M; but down 22% from 2010’s holiday when Valentine’s Day debuted at number one with $63.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"romance, Marvel, news, Larson, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Washington-Rules-Presidents-Day-with-Safe-House"},{"id":"47509127286605","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Destroys the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Twilight Destroys the CompetitionPlus, Happy Feet Two takes second, and The Descendants cracks the top ten.by Gitesh Pandya | November 21, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the wedding of the year attracted Bella and Edward fans around the world as the highly anticipated vampire sequel The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 crushed the competition across the globe debuting at number one. Not as warmly received in their return were the animated penguins of Happy Feet Two which opened in second place with only half the debut of its predecessor ahead of what will be a very competitive holiday season for kidpics. George Clooney’s The Decendants rocked the specialty box office and even made it into the top ten despite playing in very few theaters. Overall, Twilight led the marketplace to a healthy improvement over last year which is quite a statement given that a new Harry Potter film launched at that time.Delivering the second biggest opening of the year, and the fifth best of all-time, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 triumphed at the box office grossing an estimated $139.5M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. The fourth film in the lucrative Summit series averaged a stunning $34,351 from 4,061 locations despite having no help from 3D or IMAX, which have boosted grosses for many of the largest debuts of all-time. The bow was just 2% behind the $142.8M of New Moon from two years ago this same weekend. Both films played to the Twilight faithful, were only in 2D, and were released in just over 4,000 locations. The new pic, though, carried a much higher budget of $110M.Breaking Dawn Pt. 1 now sits at the number five spot on the list of the biggest opening weekends ever trailing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($169.2M), The Dark Knight ($158.4M), Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M), and New Moon. The weekend began with a $72M opening day which included $30.3M from Thursday night’s post-midnight shows. That was the second best post-midnight ever after Deathly Hallows 2 ($43.5M) and the third highest opening day after Hallows 2 ($91.1M) and New Moon ($72.7M). Breaking Dawn‘s Saturday suffered an understandable 43% plunge to $40.7M while Summit is estimating a 34% decline on Sunday to $26.8M. New Moon, which had the exact same type of calendar, fell a nearly identical 42% Saturday and then 34% on Sunday. Given the rise in 2D ticket prices over the last two years, it seems that the Twilight audience has declined by 8-10% between New Moon and Breaking Dawn.As with previous films in the series, women dominated the audience. Studio research showed that a whopping 80% of the crowd was female which was in line with New Moon‘s 80% and the first Twilight‘s 75%. The only summer title in the franchise — last year’s Eclipse which released in late June — had a broader audience that was 65% female. It was also the only pic released in IMAX and still stands as the top-grossing installment with $300.5M. The series will conclude this weekend next year with the launch of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Pt. 2, which opens on November 16, 2012.Sales were red hot overseas too this weekend. The roll-out into 54 international territories resulted in an estimated $144M from 9,950 venues since mid-week bows in certain markets putting the global debut at a stellar $283.5M. Top markets included the U.K. ($22M), Russia ($15M), France ($14.5M), Australia ($12.2M), Italy ($12M), Spain ($11.6M), and Brazil ($10.2M). With Breaking Dawn Part 1, the Twilight franchise this weekend shattered the $2 billion global box office mark.The animated penguin sequel Happy Feet Two finished the weekend in second place as expected but generated sales that were below expectations. The PG-rated film bowed to an estimated $22M from 3,606 theaters (including a super-wide 293 IMAX 3D venues) averaging a moderate $6,108 and came in at roughly half the level of the $41.5M debut of the first Feet from this same very weekend five years ago. That film topped the charts for three weeks in a row on its way to $198M. Reviews for the followup were mostly bad.The Feet debut was also well below those of other big studio toon offerings this year like Rio ($39.2M), Puss in Boots ($34.1M), Gnomeo &amp; Juliet ($25.4M), and The Lion King 3D ($30.2M), as well as sequels like Kung Fu Panda 2 ($47.7M) and Cars 2 ($66.1M). Parents have spent heavily on 3D toons this year and Happy Feet Two may have been too little, too late. 49% of the penguin gross came from the 3D screens which was about even with the 51% of Puss a few weeks ago. Warner Bros. will try to catch up with kids and families over the coming Thanksgiving week, however there will be stiff competition for this audience with studios unwisely launching three more PG-rated films aimed at families on Wednesday — Disney’s The Muppets, Paramount’s Hugo, and Sony’s Arthur Christmas.Last week’s top film Immortals fell sharply in its second weekend grossing an estimated $12.3M, down 62%. Most holdovers suffered larger than usual declines as last Friday was the Veterans Day holiday when most schools closed. The Relativity Media release has collected $53M in ten days and looks headed for the $75M vicinity.Adam Sandler’s latest helping of immature humor lost the usual half of its audience in the second weekend coming in fourth place. Jack and Jill fell 52% to an estimated $12M and has laughed up $41M in ten days heading to what should be a final gross in the neighborhood of $70M for Sony.The leggy toon Puss in Boots took a tumble in its fourth round thanks in part to the arrival of Happy Feet Two and dropped a steep 57% to an estimated $10.7M for a cume to date of $122.3M. Previous declines were only 3% for the sophomore session and 25% for the third weekend which included Veterans Day. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation were widely criticized for moving the release date earlier from November 4 to October 28, but the move paid off with a stellar $111.6M banked before the penguin pic arrived in the marketplace.Universal’s action-comedy Tower Heist followed with an estimated $7M, down 46%, giving the Ben Stiller-Eddie Murphy project $53.4M to date. Clint Eastwood’s political biopic J. Edgar did not hold up well in its second weekend falling 47% to an estimated $5.9M raising the cume to only $20.7M for Warner Bros. Clint pics used to show strong legs at the box office thanks to good word-of-mouth and an older audience. But recent projects have earned mixed feelings from critics and audiences alike with second weekend drops being 47% for last year’s Hereafter and 51% for 2009’s Invictus.Dropping 51% in its third try was the stoner sequel A Very Harold &amp; Kumar 3D Christmas which grossed an estimated $2.9M with $28.3M in 17 days so far. Fox’s sci-fi pic In Time fell apart crumbling 59% to an estimated $1.7M and $33.4M overall.George Clooney’s critically-acclaimed film The Descendants became the year’s smallest release to reach the top ten. The Fox Searchlight pic bowed in just 29 locations but grossed an estimated $1.2M for a hefty $42,138 average, putting the awards contender into the number ten spot. Only one other film this year made the top ten by playing in fewer than 500 theaters — Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, which jumped up to number six in its second frame while in 58 playdates over Memorial Day weekend. The Descendants, a likely Oscar contender in picture, actor, and other races, will quickly expand to most major markets on Wednesday when it reaches over 425 theaters for the long five-day Thanksgiving frame as an alternative option for adult audiences at a time when kidpics will be flooding the marketplace.The top ten films grossed an estimated $215.2M which was up a healthy 17% from last year when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 opened in the top spot with $125M; but down 13% from 2009 when The Twilight Saga: New Moon opened at number one with $142.8M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on, films, all-time, Oscars","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Twilight-Destroys-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509127295827","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Is the Real Deal","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Is the Real DealPlus, The Ides of March finished 2nd, and Dolphin Tale holds onto 3rd.by Gitesh Pandya | October 10, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hugh Jackman scored an easy victory over George Clooney in the battle of People magazine’s former sexiest men alive as the robot boxing actioner Real Steel punched up a number one debut well ahead of the political thriller The Ides of March which played in one-third fewer theaters. Overall box office during the Columbus Day holiday weekend was decent but not exceptional with holdovers filling up the rest of the top ten.Topping the charts for six of the last eight weeks, Disney enjoyed another number one hit with the big-budget pic Real Steel which bowed to an estimated $27.3M marking the third largest opening ever over the Columbus Day holiday frame. The PG-13 film starring Jackman averaged a muscular $7,936 from 3,440 theaters and got some help from higher-priced tickets from its 270 IMAX locations. Produced for more than $100M by DreamWorks, Steel follows the sleeper sensation The Help in the Spielberg company’s recent rebound after a string of films that struggled at the box office.Jackman also found good news from the opening as his past non-Wolverine roles have never generated big numbers in the American market. Mixed but generally positive reviews from critics helped but audiences mostly responded to the exciting look of the marketing of the picture. Plus it was the first major action film with broad appeal to hit theaters since the summer. According to studio research, males made up 66% of the audience while 70% were under 35. Real Steel earned an encouraging A CinemaScore grade which could bode well for the long-term run of the film.Overseas, the robotic pic grossed an estimated $22.1M from 19 territories making for a $49.4M global debut. Russia, where the cast and crew traveled to for a lavish premiere, led the way with $6.9M while Jackman’s home country of Australia saw a $5.3M bow. Given that the star and the action genre play much better abroad, Real Steel could continue to post impressive global numbers as it rolls out into more markets. That will be crucial to the film breaking even since the marketing push has been elaborate and pricey.Opening in second place with a good but not stellar performance was the political thriller The Ides of March with an estimated $10.4M from 2,199 theaters for a respectable $4,729 average. The R-rated election pic starring Ryan Gosling, George Clooney (who also directed), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti, and Evan Rachel Wood earned very good reviews from critics, however it did not wow paying audiences as the Sony release scored only a B grade from CinemaScore. Ides played exactly like a Clooney vehicle as its gross and average were in line with the actor’s recent films including The American ($13.2M opening, $4,668 average), Michael Clayton ($10.4M, $4,131), The Men Who Stare At Goats ($12.7M, $5,201), and Up in the Air ($11.3M, $5,947). Without Brad Pitt at his side adding extra box office muscle, the polarizing actor/director’s films only sell to so many people.Sony is expecting a strong multiple given the Oscar buzz for Ides and the fact that Clayton also opened to the same gross in mid-October finishing with $49M for a multiple of nearly 5. However, $10M of that figure was collected during the film’s re-release when Oscar nominations were announced. The lawyer flick grossed $39.4M during its initial run giving it a multiple of 3.8 in that period. Sony’s other fall awards contender Moneyball is on course to finish its run with a multiple of about 3.7 while last fall’s well-reviewed dramas The Town and The Social Network enjoyed multiples of 3.9 and 4.3, respectively.Ides, the story of a press spokesman for a presidential candidate who finds himself swept into the vicious world of politics, is a lower cost film so it carries less financial risk thanks to a production cost of only $12.5M. Sony acquired domestic rights to the title for an undisclosed amount and paid for the marketing. Having Clooney and Gosling certainly upped the female interest as exit polls showed that a very high 58% of the audience consisted of women. The thriller skewed much older as 60% was over 35. Over the last three months, Gosling has won raves from critics for his performances in Ides, Drive, and Crazy, Stupid, Love but still eluding him is the abiliity to draw in a sizable crowd at the multiplexes. If Ides succeeds in earning a Best Picture nomination, a January re-release would certainly be possible especially since it would be right at the start of the 2012 presidential primaries.For the third weekend in a row, Seven co-stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were side by side on the charts with their inspirational films which have grossed the same amount of money over the last 17 days. The Warner Bros. release Dolphin Tale dropped from first to third with an estimated $9.2M, off 34%, for a $49.1M cume. Sony’s Moneyball fell 38% to an estimated $7.5M giving the baseball drama $49.3M to date. Both look set to end up with around $70M.The cancer comedy 50/50 enjoyed the best hold among last weekend’s four new releases dipping only 36% to an estimated $5.5M. The Summit release has collected a modest $17.3M in ten days and hopes to reach the $30M vicinity. The faith-based fatherhood pic Courageous lost 49% of its crowd and took in an estimated $4.6M giving Sony $15.9M. The low-budget $2M drama is headed for $25M or so.Two-time chart-topper The Lion King 3D followed with an estimated $4.6M tumbling a steep 57% now that the updated film is available in stores on Blu-ray. Still, the re-release has banked an impressive $86M to date boosting the lifetime total for Simba and pals to $414.5M. Later this week, it will surpass the $415M of last year’s Toy Story 3 to reclaim the title of top-grossing animated film ever for Disney. 2004’s Shrek 2 from DreamWorks still holds the crown for all toons with $436.7M.Universal’s spookfest Dream House dropped 45% after its lousy debut to an estimated $4.5M for a ten-day tally of only $14.5M. Falling 44% from its dismal start was the Anna Faris comedy What’s Your Number? which collected an estimated $3.1M and $10.3M across ten days. Final totals should reach $25M and $15M, respectively. Taylor Lautner’s action vehicle Abduction rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M, down 48%, for a $23.4M sum for Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed $79.4M which was up 3% from last year when The Social Network remained in the top spot with $15.5M; but down 14% from 2009 when Couples Retreat debuted at number one with a new Columbus Day weekend record of $34.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"superman, school","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Real-Steel-Is-the-Real-Deal"},{"id":"47509128839006","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: New Comedies Can’t Stop Transformers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: New Comedies Can't Stop TransformersAutobots fend off Horrible Bosses and a Zookeeper.by Gitesh Pandya | July 10, 2011 |  CommentsA pair of star-driven comedies couldn’t keep the 3D juggernaut Transformers: Dark of the Moon from holding onto the number one spot at the worldwide box office as the Autobots held up well for an action sequel coming off of a holiday putting it on course to possibly reach the $1 billion global box office mark. The Michael Bay behemoth grossed an estimated $47M in its second weekend falling 52% from its debut frame – not bad for the third chapter in a sci-fi tentpole franchise. Last weekend’s Friday-to-Sunday take did not include the opening day which helped keep the decline manageable, but still the hold for this type of film was commendable. The third Transformers flick has now banked a stellar $261M in under two weeks making it the top-grossing domestic blockbuster of 2011.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244596[/rtimage]Moon is running 11% behind the pace of the last chapter Revenge of the Fallen which had banked $293.4M in 2009 after its second weekend. A final North American take of $350-360M could result putting Optimus Prime and pals in a position to possibly finish the year as the box office champ. Next weekend, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 invades and will give Transformers a major challenge. Each of the last four installments finished near the $300M mark, though 3D surcharges and fan excitement over the conclusion of the franchise should take this new one higher. Also giving a challenge will be November’s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 which follows a pair of chapters that also collected about $300M a piece.Overseas, the new Transformers continued its red hot run with an estimated $93M boosting the international take to $384M and the global haul to $645M. Some key markets showed amazing strength like Korea which dipped by 33%, the United Kingdom which slipped only 27%, and Brazil which eased just 29%. However, Russia tumbled 58%, France fell 56%, and Germany dropped 51%. Helped by 3D – both with grosses and audience excitement – Moon looks on track to smash through $600M from outside of North America.Among non-robot films, the raunchy revenge comedy Horrible Bosses led the way opening in second place with strong results to the tune of $28.1M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release averaged a sturdy $9,247 from 3,040 theaters with an opening that fell in between recent successful R-rated summer comedies Bad Teacher ($31.6M) and Bridesmaids ($26.2M). With an all-star cast including Jason Bateman, Jason Sudekis, Charlie Day, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Farrell, and Jamie Foxx, Horrible Bosses offered an intriguing concept about three men fed up with their bosses who conspire to kill them. Reviews were mainly favorable helping the film reach its target audience of adults and paying ticket buyers were generally pleased with the product as its CinemaScore grade was a B+.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244594[/rtimage]The Kevin James comedy Zookeeper enjoyed a respectable debut in third place with an estimated $21M from 3,482 theaters for a $6,031 average. Directed by Frank Coraci (The Wedding Singer, Waterboy), the PG-rated entry marks only the second major film for James to anchor solo following the sleeper hit Paul Blart: Mall Cop which debuted to a heftier $31.8M on its way to $146.3M. But the magic didn’t work this time as the critically-panned summer laugher scored a decent debut, but did not reach the kind of heights needed for an expensive $80M comedy. Rosario Dawson co-stars along with the voices of Adam Sandler, Cher, and Sylvester Stallone who take on the roles of the talking animals.Originally produced at MGM with an expensive script, financial turmoil at the studio led to Zookeeper shifting over to Sony. The story of an animal caretaker that gets dating advice from his zoo attractions scored a mediocre B+ grade from audiences polled by CinemaScore. 53% of the crowd was female while 59% was over 25. James did, however, fare better than the last big-name comedian offering an animal-oriented kidpic beating the $18.4M bow of last month’s Mr. Popper’s Penguins. That Jim Carrey project earned better reviews plus a higher CinemaScore grade and is on course to end with 3.5 times its opening weekend tally.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244597[/rtimage]After hitting the brakes in its second lap, the 3D toon Cars 2 stabilized in its third weekend dropping 42% to an estimated $15.2M boosting the 17-day total for Disney and Pixar to $148.8M. That puts it 5% behind the $156.7M of the first Lightning McQueen pic from the summer of 2006. Though a small gap, it will quickly get bigger as the first Cars banked a stronger $23M in its third frame and the Fourth of July holiday didn’t occur until later. Cars 2 looks on course to finish its domestic run in the same vicinity as Ratatouille‘s $206.4M which was the lowest-grossing Pixar film from the last dozen years.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244595[/rtimage]Cameron Diaz’s comedy Bad Teacher followed with an estimated $9M, off a good 38%, for a $78.8M total for Sony. It looks set to become the 11th $100M+ grosser for Diaz. Tom Hanks, another star with a string of hits making it into the century club, saw a large decline for his directorial flop Larry Crowne which fell 52% to an estimated $6.3M. Universal was hoping that the older-skewing dramedy would have legs since mature adults don’t rush out on opening weekend, but bad word-of-mouth ruined the day. With only $26.5M in ten days, Crowne should fizzle out with a disappointing $40-45M by the end of its run.The J.J. Abrams sci-fi hit Super 8 slipped 39% to an estimated $4.8M giving Paramount $118.1M to date. Led by young stars but not filling up theaters, Fox’s Monte Carlo dropped 49% to an estimated $3.8M in its sophomore session. With only $16.1M in ten days, the Selena Gomez vehicle should end up with about $25M.Fading fast, the super hero pic Green Lantern fell 52% to an estimated $3.1M lifting the underwhelming cume for the big-budget production to only $109.7M. Rounding out the top ten was Jim Carrey’s kidpic Mr. Popper’s Penguins with an estimated $2.9M, down 49%, for a $57.7M sum.The critically-acclaimed music documentary Beats, Rhymes and Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest platformed to solid results in just three New York theaters and a solo Los Angeles house grossing an estimated $120,000 for an impressive $30,004 average. Fans rushed out upfront as the opening day accounted for 38% of the weekend – high for a specialty film – while Saturday dropped by 16%. Showered with glowing reviews, the R-rated hip hop film expands Friday to 15 more sites and will continue to reach more markets through August.The top ten films grossed an estimated $141.2M which was down 23% from last year when Despicable Me opened in the top spot with $56.4M; but up 7% from 2009 when Brüno debuted at number one with $30.6M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"live, Disney, Office, Disney, TCA, Turner, TBS, Guide, and","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-New-Comedies-Cant-Stop-Transformers"},{"id":"47509128827740","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America is Super","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Captain America is SuperHarry Potter, Friends With Benefits round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 25, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the fourth and final super hero film of the summer arrived and like its predecessors, Captain America: The First Avenger also debuted at number one although this one had to defeat the Harry Potter juggernaut in the process. Fellow freshman entry Friends With Benefits, a new sex comedy starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, debuted in third place. In between was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which suffered a steep fall in its second weekend but still posted a near-record 10-day cume. The overall box office was robust thanks to the recent wave of franchise films.The final piece of the Avengers puzzle fell into its place as Captain America scored a muscular opening weekend with an estimated $65.8M from 3,715 locations for a powerful $17,719 average. If the estimate holds, it will edge out by a slim margin the $65.7M bow of the season’s first comic book pic Thor from the first weekend of May. Both are Marvel films distributed by Paramount and presented in 3D. The extra dimension did not prove to be too popular for Captain America as only 38% of the weekend take came from 3D screens whereas Thor‘s rate was a much higher 60%. With Captain being the ninth 3D film this summer alone, with more still to come, audiences have been growing tired of the format and have become more choosy in selecting which films truly warrant the extra cost.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244935[/rtimage]The super soldier easily beat out the $53.2M opening of last month’s Green Lantern which was also in 3D as well as the $55.1M of the 2D pic X-Men: First Class which like Captain was a period film. Studios took a big risk programming four super hero origin films into a three-month period. Thor has done the best with $180.1M to date and over $445M worldwide while X-Men performed moderately well with $144.2M. Captain America should approach Thor‘s domestic tally although it could be less popular overseas. All three are Marvel projects. The big-budget Green Lantern from DC Comics was the sole casualty with $113.9M to date and little traction from its international openings so far. Next summer is sure to be a record breaker for comic book movies with top characters like Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and the Hulk all returning to the big screen in The Dark Knight Rises (July 20), The Amazing Spider-Man (July 3), and The Avengers (May 4).Directed by Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park III) and starring Chris Evans (Fantastic Four), Captain America skewed to adult men as expected with exit polls showing that the audience was 64% male and 58% over 25. The PG-13 film scored generally positive reviews from critics. Friday kicked off with $25.8M including $4M from Thursday night’s midnight grosses and all-day showings Thursday at a San Diego theater during Comic-Con. Saturday dropped 15% to $21.9M and Paramount is projecting a 17% Sunday slide to $18.2M. An encouraging A- CinemaScore could be good news for the days and weeks ahead. Thor and X-Men, which both did better with critics, each earned a B+ while Green Lantern scored a B.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244936[/rtimage]After breaking almost every box office record in the industry, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 took an understandable freefall in its second weekend since most fans came out already in the first week for the can’t-miss franchise closer. The Warner Bros. title tumbled 72% to an estimated $48.1M boosting the ten-day total to $274.2M. Only studio stablemate The Dark Knight has ever grossed more in the first ten days with $313.8M in July 2008. The last Voldemort pic Part 1 fell 62% in its second weekend, but that tally was helped by Thanksgiving and a Friday that was a day off for most people.Past July Potter films also saw large declines in the second weekend only to stabilize in subsequent weekends with 40-50% declines. The second Hallows is likely to be more front-loaded but the final domestic tally may still end up in the $360-380M range which would give it a shot at surpassing the newest Transformers to become the highest-grossing film of 2011.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244734[/rtimage]Overseas, the wizard film was still doing gangbusters. The international weekend brought in an astounding $121.3M, down 61%, boosting the cume to a jaw-dropping $560.4M That puts the 12-day global haul at a mesmerizing $834.6M. With China still to open on August 4, the final Potter may be able to reach the $1.2 billion mark by the end of its run.The R-rated romantic comedy Friends With Benefits opened in third place with an estimated $18.5M following a long line of raunchy laughers this summer. Though a commendable debut, the figure did not reach the levels of this season’s past offerings like Bridesmaids, Bad Teacher, and Horrible Bosses which all bowed in the $26-32M range. Averaging $6,323 from 2,926 theaters, the Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis pic about pals that try to keep feelings out of a sex-only relationship may have seen some of its target audience stay away thanks to its similarity to No Strings Attached with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher which basically offered the same story six months ago. That R-rated film bowed to $19.7M on its way to $70.7M. The Friends debut was still good though and reviews were better with many critics highlighting the chemistry between the two leads.Adult women made up the primary audience as studio research showed that 62% of the crowd was female while 56% was over 25. The CinemaScore grade was a decent B+. Strong word-of-mouth will be needed as each of the next three weekends will see a new comedy contender for adults enter the marketplace with Steve Carell’s Crazy, Stupid, Love, The Change-Up starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, and the Ben Stiller-produced 30 Minutes or Less.Placing fourth with an estimated $12M was the year’s top-grossing film Transformers: Dark of the Moon which declined by 44% in its fourth battle. The Paramount release has now grossed a brawny $325.8M and is on course to end its domestic run with $350-360M. Shooting with actual 3D cameras has helped it win over more audiences than action films converted in post-production as 3D shares of this weekend’s grosses were 50% for the latest Autobots pic compared to 42% for Potter and 38% for Captain America.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244736[/rtimage]With China re-opening its doors to American films this weekend, Transformers scored a record $40M debut — the best ever for a U.S. picture there. That led the international frame which delivered an estimated $62M allowing the overseas total to climb to $556.6M which represented a new company high for Paramount outside of North America. The latest Michael Bay effort has now grossed a stunning $882.4M worldwide and has Japan opening this coming weekend which will help it pass the billion dollar barrier.Despite the arrival of a new R-rated comedy, the workplace laugher Horrible Bosses held up well again in its third frame dipping only 34% to an estimated $11.7M for a 17-day cume of $82.4M. Warner Bros. will probably see a larger gross with this title than it will with its big-budget gamble Green Lantern which is heading for a $115M final.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244594[/rtimage]Three kidpics with small declines followed. The Kevin James comedy Zookeeper dipped only 29% to an estimated $8.7M and has banked $59.2M in 17 days for Sony. The Disney/Pixar vehicle Cars 2 followed with an estimated $5.7M, off just 32%, for a $176.4M cume. In its sophomore frame, the G-rated toon Winnie the Pooh slipped only 35% and grabbed an estimated $5.1M. The ten-day total for Disney is $17.6M.Adults looking for laughs rounded out the top ten with a pair of popular comedies. The Cameron Diaz pic Bad Teacher fell 50% to an estimated $2.6M bumping its tally to $94.4M for Sony. Sony Classics continued its phenomenal run for Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris which inched up 1% to an estimated $1.9M despite losing 85 theaters. Cume is at $44.9M and will easily break the $50M mark.The top 10 films grossed an estimated $180.2M which was up 20% from last year when Inception remained in the top spot with $42.7M; and up 30% from 2009 when G-Force debuted at number one with $31.7M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, transformers, rt, composers, comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Captain-America-is-Super"},{"id":"47509128812378","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Mighty in #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Apes Mighty in #1 Debutby Gitesh Pandya | August 8, 2011 |  CommentsAudiences all hailed Caesar as the primate at the center of the sci-fi prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes conquered the North American box office with an opening that rose well past industry expectations. Conversely, the latest in this summer’s parade of R-rated comedies The Change-Up generated a lackluster debut finishing in fourth place. But the overall marketplace remained robust thanks to the incredible breadth of titles. For the first time all year, seven different films made over $10M over the weekend.Fox scored another solid top spot debut this summer with a franchise origin story as Rise of the Planet of the Apes soared to an estimated $54M opening weekend. Playing in 3,648 theaters, the PG-13 film averaged a muscular $14,803 and ranked as the third best debut of the summer for a 2D-only film after The Hangover Part II ($85.9M) and X-Men: First Class ($55.1M) which like Apes revisited a popular sci-fi franchise by exploring the origins. Both X-Men and Apes were well-liked by critics.Starring James Franco as a scientist that discovers a way to boost intelligence in chimpanzees, Apes lacked any major starpower and was the twelfth action film of the summer leading to expectations not being too high. But an exciting marketing push and strong reviews helped to spark interest allowing Apes to generate the fifth biggest August opening in history. The new technique of a human actor playing the apes through motion-capture technology created intrigue too. An encouraging A- CinemaScore grade bodes well for the road ahead and next weekend does not have any new action films opening so Rise may not fall the way most pics of this genre do. With a reported budget of $93M, the revenge-against-humans pic got off to a terrific start.Internationally, Rise debuted in 25 markets and bowed to an estimated $23.4M. Most of the markets were not major. Bigger territories like Germany, France, and the United Kingdom open next week.Sony’s family hit The Smurfs enjoyed a terrific hold in its second weekend dropping only 41% to an estimated $21M for a solid ten-day start of $76.2M. With no new choices for parents, and opening weekend audiences spreading positive word-of-mouth all week, the PG-rated comedy remained the most popular item for kids as they near the end of their summer vacations. Smurfs, which can continue using “#1 Comedy in America” in its ads for another week, should find its way past the $125M mark and could go much higher if it continues to show strong August legs. The pint-sized gang made a big splash overseas where it debuted in much of the world this weekend with an estimated $45.2M from about three dozen international territories for a $52.7M cume including the early launch in Spain. The worldwide tally for the $110M production sits at $128.9M.After opening last weekend a bit ahead of Smurfs, the sci-fi Western hybrid Cowboys &amp; Aliens fell a much larger 57% in its second outing to an estimated $15.7M giving Universal $67.4M after ten days. The Daniel Craig-Harrison Ford actioner may break $100M domestically, but won’t go much higher. That makes for a disappointing run for the expensive $163M budgeted production which involved top-tier Hollywood names like Jon Favreau, Steven Spielberg, and Ron Howard. By comparison, Spielberg’s other sci-fi production this summer Super 8 fell by only 39% in its sophomore session after an opening weekend that was about even with Cowboy‘s. With a much more modest $55M budget, that creature feature broke the $200M global box office mark this weekend.Opening in fourth place to disappointing results was Universal’s body-switching comedy The Change-Up which grossed an estimated $13.5M from 2,913 locations for a mild $4,635 average. It was the latest in a long line of R-rated summer comedies and many moviegoers felt they had enough already. Plus bad reviews told audiences that this was not some special film worth taking another trip to the multiplex for. Ticket buyers have already spent an incredible $760M+ this summer on Crazy, Stupid, Love, Friends With Benefits, Horrible Bosses, Bad Teacher, The Hangover Part II, Midnight in Paris, and Bridesmaids. All are comedies aimed at adults, most with R ratings. The Change-Up was too little, too late.Starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds as friends with different lives who swap bodies, the raunchy pic carried a cost of $52M which is high for a comedy. Females made up 59% of the audience while those over and under age 30 were evenly split. A discouraging B CinemaScore indicates a rough road ahead, especially with four new releases hitting theaters next weekend including yet another R-rated comedy, 30 Minutes or Less. Bateman and Reynolds both scored $100M+ grossers earlier this summer with Horrible Bosses and Green Lantern, respectively. But Reynolds is surely having a summer he would like to put behind him as Lantern has been a big-budget dud with only $160M worldwide to date. Cameron Diaz has made more with her comedy Bad Teacher which has banked over $180M globally with only a fraction of the budget.Close behind in fifth with an estimated $13M was the super hero flick Captain America: The First Avenger which declined by 49% in its third frame. Paramount’s domestic total stands at $143.2M. International markets brought in an estimated $27.5M this weekend sending the overseas cume into nine-digit territory with $103M for a worldwide gross to date of $246.2M. Marvel’s three-pack of comic book pics this summer – Thor, X-Men: First Class, and Captain America – have now smashed the $1 billion mark in combined global box office. Next summer is sure to be even bigger with The Avengers kicking off the season on May 4 and reboot The Amazing Spider-Man landing on July 3.Ranking sixth was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which also became the top-grossing global hit of 2011. The final wizard pic dropped 45% domestically to an estimated $12.2M elevating the 24-day total to a massive $342.8M putting it at number 18 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters just behind the latest Transformers. Overseas delivered huge numbers again thanks to a robust opening in China. Official estimates were not available for that market but the studio reported a rough count of $25.5M contributing to the international weekend haul of $61.8M allowing the cume to surge to $791.1M. Potter’s worldwide total rose to a stunning $1.13 billion surpassing the $1.04 billion of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides to become 2011’s number one global grosser. In addition, the 3D franchise closer now ranks third on the all-time worldwide box office list behind the James Cameron duo Avatar and Titanic. A final haul north of $1.3 billion seems likely.A trio of comedies aimed at adults followed. Steve Carell’s Crazy, Stupid, Love held up very well in its second weekend slipping only 37% to an estimated $12.1M for a solid ten-day tally of $42.2M. A final gross in the neighborhood of $75M could result for Warner Bros. Sony’s Friends With Benefits fell a sharp 49% to an estimated $4.7M bringing the 17-day gross to $48.5M. The revenge tale Horrible Bosses followed with an estimated $4.6M, off 36%, for a $105.2M cume for Warner Bros.Falling 51% in its sixth round was the worldwide smash Transformers: Dark of the Moon with an estimated $3M lifting the domestic haul to $344.2M. That puts Michael Bay’s latest robot warfare flick at number 17 on the all-time list. Overseas, the Autobots film kept rising with an estimated $17.5M for an international haul of $693.5M and a mammoth global gross of $1.04 billion. The biggest market outside of the United States continues to be China which has now banked a stunning $137M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $153.8M which was up a healthy 43% from last year when The Other Guys opened in the top spot with $35.5M; and up 22% from 2009 when G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra debuted at number one with $54.7M.Follow Gitesh on Twitter: @giteshpandya","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"78th, Family, Emmy, action, Awards, movie, Cartoon, shows, travel, Association, historical, Black, Islander","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Apes-Mighty-in-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509127292753","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Paranormal Activity 3 Scares Up A Huge Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Paranormal Activity 3 Scares Up A Huge OpeningReal Steel and Footloose round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | October 24, 2011 |  CommentsScaring up more business than the rest of the films in the top ten combined, the horror prequel Paranormal Activity 3 shattered records with its top spot debut proving that the low-budget fright franchise still has a lot of life in it. But despite the massive debut and low declines for most holdovers, the overall box office was still down compared to last year as other newcomers like the adventure film The Three Musketeers and the comedy sequel Johnny English Reborn failed to contribute much to the North American marketplace.Paramount kept growing its found-footage-based horror series as Paranormal Activity 3 opened ahead of expectations with a staggering $54M, according to estimates, leaping 33% ahead of the $40.7M debut that its predecessor enjoyed exactly one year ago this weekend. Landing in 3,321 locations, the R-rated chiller averaged an astounding $16,266 which was a 29% improvement over last year’s installment. Also going up was the production cost from $3M to $5M. While horror films tend to be low cost anyway, the Paranormal films have carried the lightest of budgets with the first pic being made for a cool $15,000.Set in 1988 and telling the story of the sisters from the first two films when they were young girls, Activity 3 kicked off its record scare with $26.3M on Friday including $8M from Thursday night’s 10pm and midnight shows. Saturday dropped 35% to $17.2M and the studio is projecting a 39% fall on Sunday to $10.4M. Part 2 witnessed an identical Saturday decline and a slightly larger 42% fall on Sunday. The $54M weekend figure broke the records for the biggest October opening ever and the best debut for a horror film. Last year’s Paramount double feature of Jackass 3D and Paranormal Activity 2 held those respective records with their bows of $50.4M and $40.7M. It can be argued that films like 2002’s Signs ($60.1M) and 2001’s Hannibal ($58M) were sold as scary movies, but neither was a true horror film.The Paranormal Activity franchise has fully replaced the Saw series as the public’s favorite fright brand during the Halloween season with the first two chapters reaching totals of $107.9M and $84.8M and also seizing the number one spot this very weekend each year. The first Paranormal was a sleeper hit thanks in part to one of the most brilliant marketing and distribution campaigns in recent years that allowed the fear to build over time resulting in it climbing into the top spot in its fifth frame. That forced the latest Jigsaw pic Saw VI to lose fans prompting that franchise’s worst opening ($14.1M) and lowest overall gross ($27.7M). Saw 3D closed out that series last year and Paranormal Activity 3 is now in a marketplace that not only is lacking a Saw competitor for the first time, but has no other horror films whatsoever coming up allowing Paramount to have full control over the market for scary movies this Halloween.Horror threequels are notoriously front-loaded but Activity 3 amazingly saw its opening day account for the same 49% share of the whole weekend gross that part 2 did despite the new installment having many more screens offer the Thursday night shows. Also notable was how the new chapter succeeded in bringing in older adults. The over-25 crowd was 47% of the audience, up from 40% for last year’s installment. The studio credited the very positive reviews it received which again were astonishingly good for a horror threequel. A low C CinemaScore grade, however, meant many fans were underwhelmed with their experience. Activity 2 saw 48% of its total gross come from the opening weekend, however it also faced a new Saw chapter in its second weekend. With a larger opening and weaker competition, Activity 3 may become that rare fright film to top the $100M mark joining the first installment.Paramount rolled out its new chiller into 42 overseas markets this weekend and banked an estimated $26M for a stellar worldwide debut of $80M. The three-part series has now grossed a staggering $450M worldwide in cumulative grosses while the combined production costs have amounted to a puny $8M.Two-time box office ruler Real Steel stepped down into second place but still witnessed a very healthy hold dipping only 31% to an estimated $11.3M. The Disney release has collected a brawny $67.2M in 17 days and could be headed for a final tally in the $90-100M range. Also sliding one spot while enjoying a low decline was the dance remake Footloose which grossed an estimated $10.9M in its sophomore frame for a dip of only 30%. Younger skewing movies typically fade fast but the Paramount pic is generating strong buzz and giving many women a fun, non-violent form of entertainment. A $55-60M final could result.Summit’s 3D period adventure The Three Musketeers struggled in its North American launch opening to just $8.8M, according to estimates, from 3,017 theaters for a dull $2,917 average. The PG-13 film starring an ensemble cast including Milla Jovovich, Orlando Bloom, and Christoph Waltz saw 55% of its gross come from higher-priced 3D screens. With the extra-dimensional format and the cast members holding much more weight around the world, international numbers have been — to no surprise — much stronger. Musketeers has taken in $64.4M overseas so far from more than 50 markets for a global tally to date of $73.2M. The pricey production plans to keep the run going since there have been so few high-profile action titles this fall internationally. Domestically, the swashbuckling pic earned a B CinemaScore grade and played to an audience that was 64% 25 or older and evenly split between males and females.George Clooney’s political thriller The Ides of March held up well again dipping only 31% to an estimated $4.9M for a $29.2M total for Sony. Dolphin Tale followed with an estimated $4.2M, off just 33%, giving Warner Bros. $64.4M to date. Brad Pitt’s baseball pic Moneyball was once again right next to the Morgan Freeman drama and eased only 26% to an estimated $4.1M putting the Sony release at $63.7M overall.The Rowan Atkinson spy sequel Johnny English Reborn failed to connect with American movie fans as the comedy debuted to weak results in eighth place with an estimated $3.8M. The Universal release averaged a poor $2,450 from 1,552 locations and didn’t even reach half of the opening weekend tallies for the actor’s previous films Johnny English and Mr. Bean’s Vacation. Reviews were lackluster. But overseas, where the star and character are much more popular, Reborn vaulted past the $100M mark thanks to an estimated $13.5M frame from 44 territories with 15 international markets still to open. The $45M-budgeted film has now collected $104.5M offshore after a month of play and $108.3M worldwide. Domestically, the PG-rated film played to an audience that was 57% male and included lots of kids and families. The CinemaScore grade was a B.Rounding out the top ten were the horror flop The Thing which plunged 63% to an estimated $3.1M and the cancer dramedy 50/50 which took in an estimated $2.8M slipping only 34%. Totals are $14.1M for Universal and $28.8M for Summit.Outside of the top ten, the inspirational softball drama The Mighty Macs struck out with audiences debuting to only $1.1M, according to estimates, from 975 theaters for a dull $1,090 average. The Carla Gugino starrer was released by Quaker Media and failed to connect with moviegoers the way many other inspirational true stories have this fall.In limited release, the smarthouse thriller Martha Marcy May Marlene enjoyed a solid debut grossing an estimated $138,000 from only two theaters a piece in New York and Los Angeles for a strong $34,500 average. The Fox Searchlight release scored very positive reviews including glowing notices for lead actress Elizabeth Olsen and will expand to ten more major markets on Friday.Roadside Attractions enjoyed a good start for its financial thriller Margin Call which opened wider in 56 locations grossing an estimated $582,000 for a commendable $10,393 average. Reviews were encouraging and the performance was especially impressive given that it was also made available day and date on numerous cable video-on-demand systems plus other digital platforms like iTunes, Amazon, PlayStation, and YouTube.Pedro Almodovar’s latest film The Skin I Live In In fared well in its second weekend expansion grossing an estimated $261,000 from 21 sites for a healthy $12,429 average. The Sony Classics release expanded from its original four playdates and has banked $569,000 so far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.9M which was down 8% from last year when Paranormal Activity 2 debuted in the top spot with $40.7M; but up 7% from 2009 when Paranormal Activity climbed into the number one spot with $21.1M.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"cults, nature, Christmas, thriller, mission:, joker, festival, tv, aapi, space, Lucasfilm, game-of-thrones, cats, Holidays, psycho","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Paranormal-Activity-3-Scares-Up-A-Huge-Opening"},{"id":"47509128802136","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Helps Itself to #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Help Helps Itself to #1Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Spy Kids round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | August 22, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the sleeper hit The Help ruled the North American box office in its second weekend climbing into the number one spot beating out four new releases which all stumbled in their debuts. The book-based drama grossed an estimated $20.5M slipping a mere 21% in its sophomore session setting up what will be a long-lasting run into blockbuster territory. The Disney release averaged a stellar $7,613 from only 2,690 theaters and raised its 12-day cume to a solid $71.8M. Help should have no problem making its way to $130M and could even soar much higher beating out many of this summer’s big-budget action offerings. Great reviews and strong word-of-mouth have made it into an event film for adults and appeal has been expanding beyond older females with more demographics discovering the story.After two weekends on top, Fox’s Rise of the Planet of the Apes dropped down to second place with an estimated $16.3M. Off 41%, the sci-fi pic upped its total to $133.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245608[/rtimage]Leading the four-pack of new wide releases was the only kid-friendly one, Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D, which generated an estimated $12M from 3,295 theaters for a $3,648 average. Presented in 4D (a 3D film with scratch-n-sniff cards that give off story-related aromas, the PG-rated film played to a family audience but was met with dismal reviews which turned many parents off. Plus the core fan base for the first three films which were released from 2001 to 2003 has grown too old to care anymore so targeting a new generation proved too difficult for the Robert Rodriguez pic.Another new 3D film not exciting moviegoers was Conan the Barbarian which debuted in fourth with an estimated $10M from 3,015 locations for a not-so-muscular $3,317 average. The R-rated remake was the summer’s 13th action film and audiences did not feel that the expensive production was worth the money in the late days of summer. 3D screens did account for a good 61% of the gross for the Lionsgate release though.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245609[/rtimage]Another piece of 1980s nostalgia followed as the horror remake Fright Night did little to attract fans of scary movies opening to an estimated $8.3M. The Disney release invaded an aggressive 3,114 theaters but averaged a weak $2,665 per site. 61% of the gross came from 3D screens which was the one bit of good news. Reviews were mostly favorable, but competition for horror fans came from Final Destination 5 which just bowed last week with its own style of branded 3D chills.Sony’s The Smurfs grossed an estimated $8M, down 42%, boosting the hit film’s cume to $117.7M. The horror sequel Final Destination 5 followed by falling 57% to an estimated $7.7M giving Warner Bros. $32.3M in ten days. A $45-50M final seems likely. 30 Minutes or Less dropped by 53% in its second weekend taking in an estimated $6.3M. With a ten-day sum of $25.8M, look for a $40M final for Sony.[rtimage]siteImageId=10245610[/rtimage]The fourth and final new wide release of the weekend, the Anne Hathaway drama One Day, failed to make much of a dent with women debuting to only $5.1M, according to estimates. The Focus release averaged a mild $2,980 from 1,721 theaters and faced intense direct competition from The Help which has much more must-see buzz surrounding it. Reviews were very negative too.Rounding out the top ten was the comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love with an estimated $5M, off just 30%, for a $64.4M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $99.2M which was down 3% from last year when The Expendables remained in the top spot with $17M; and off 7% from 2009 when Inglourious Basterds debuted at number one with $38.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"animated","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Help-Helps-Itself-to-1"},{"id":"47509127298900","title":"Box Office: It’s Good To Be The Lion King","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office: It's Good To Be The Lion KingMoneyball, Dolphin Tale also strong; Abduction, Killer Elite weak.by Gitesh Pandya | September 26, 2011 |  CommentsMultiplexes across North America were busier than normal for this time of year as the hit re-release The Lion King 3D held onto the number one spot for a second frame driving the box office to a new record high for the month of September. Moviegoers also lined up for Seven partners Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as their new releases Moneyball and Dolphin Tale both debuted higher than expected in a close battle for second place. For the first time in history, three different films grossed north of $20M on the same September weekend as the Top 20 soared to a stellar $115M – a new record for the back-to-school month.Thanks to a remarkable sophomore hold, The Lion King 3D ruled over the charts for a second weekend in a row just as the original blockbuster did back in June 1994. The G-rated re-release slipped only 27% and grossed an estimated $22.1M boosting its ten-day cume to a fantastic $61.7M. Despite intense competition for kids and parents, the Hakuna Matata pic remained wildly popular with a wide array of moviegoers allowing it to cling to the number one spot. King’s lifetime total (including 2003’s IMAX release) climbed to $390.2M putting it at number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters.Stunted as a two-week-only event, the updated Lion King is scheduled to leave theaters this Thursday and hit Blu-ray 3D the following week on October 4. However, the studio’s past two-week runs for Toy Story and Miley Cyrus films were extended and the same is expected for Simba given how much money it is still making. Despite its current home video availability, people still want to experience the beloved film on the big screen and many are introducing it to a new generation of children or just reliving their younger days. An extended theatrical run could deposit another $40M+ into Disney’s vault and allow the re-release to surpass the $100M barrier.Actor/producer Brad Pitt clinched second place but still scored a major victory with crtics and movie fans alike with his baseball drama Moneyball which opened to an estimated $20.6M. The Sony release averaged a solid $6,883 per site from 2,993 locations and played to a much older adult crowd although the gender split was about even. Studio research showed that 64% of the audience was over 35 while males made up 51%. Based on the true story of how the 2002 Oakland A’s rebuilt their team after losing their best players, Moneyball earned high praise across the board from film critics. Moviegoers were equally pleased with the PG-13 pic earning a promising A CinemaScore.With strong reviews, stellar word-of-mouth, and an older audience not likely to rush out on opening weekend, Moneyball is well-positioned to enjoy solid legs in the weeks ahead. Baseball is about to start its post-season so the film will remain topical for weeks to come. Plus Pitt is earning plenty of Oscar buzz for his acting performance which will keep the film hot too. Overseas prospects are promising too despite the baseball theme because of Pitt’s incredible box office pull around the world. With a reported $50M production cost, Moneyball may be able to find its way to $250M or more worldwide.Another uplifting film based on a true story opened close behind in third. The Warner Bros. release Dolphin Tale scored big points with audiences collecting an estimated $20.3M this weekend averaging a good $5,777 from 3,507 locations. Playing in 2D and 3D, the PG-rated tale about an injured dolphin and the people who help her saw 50% of its gross come from the extra-dimensional screens. Reviews were very good and audiences loved what they saw giving Tale an amazing A+ CinemaScore grade. Saturday saw a tremendous 70% leap in ticket sales over opening day giving it the best jump in the top ten. Strong legs will keep this feel-good film going in the weeks ahead. Starring Morgan Freeman, Harry Connick Jr., and Ashley Judd, Dolphin Tale’s performance was especially impressive given how much of the family audience is already distracted by The Lion King right now.If none of next weekend’s four new releases truly pop then Moneyball and Dolphin Tale could find themselves in another fierce battle – this time for the number one spot. Breaking the $100M mark this fall is certainly a possibility for each film.Teen girls came out in lukewarm numbers for their favorite shirtless wolf Taylor Lautner who saw an estimated $11.2M opening for his first starring vehicle Abduction. Lionsgate went very wide with the PG-13 thriller going out in 3,118 theaters which resulted in a mild $3,592 average. The distributor rarely releases a film in 3,000+ playdates. Studio research showed that the audience was 68% female and 56% under 25 indicating that the critically-panned film struggled to find appeal outside of its primary young-female quadrant. But at least Lautner found more success than his Twilight co-stars and broke double digit millions. Kristen Stewart’s Adventureland bowed to just $5.7M while Robert Pattinson’s Remember Me debuted to $8.1M. The vampire heartthrob did score a nice hit earlier this year with the romance Water for Elephants which opened to $16.8M, however that film was led by bankable Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.Rookie distributor Open Road saw a slow start with its first release Killer Elite which posted the worst opening among the four new films this weekend with an estimated $9.5M. The R-rated actioner starring Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro averaged a weak $3,182 from 2,986 theaters. Its 9% Friday-to-Saturday bump was also the lowest for any freshman flick. Reviews from critics were mostly negative but audiences were somewhat kinder to film which earned a mediocre B grade from CinemaScore.Holdovers rounded out the top ten with mixed results. The virus thriller Contagion held up well with an estimated $8.6M, off 41%, for a $57.1M cume for Warner Bros. All the love showered by critics on the crime drama Drive failed to do much as the FilmDistrict release fell 49% to an estimated $5.8M giving the Ryan Gosling starrer $21.4M in ten days. That may seem like a lot for an art film, but its 2,900-theater release does not come with low P&amp;A expenses. Drive averaged a slow $1,987 per location this weekend from 2,904 sites.The Help followed with an estimated $4.4M, down just 32%, giving Disney $154.4M to date. Sony’s remake Straw Dogs collapsed in its second outing tumbling 59% to an estimated $2.1M and a measly $8.9M in ten days. Also rejected by moviegoers, Sarah Jessica Parker’s comedy I Don’t Know How She Does It dropped 53% to an estimated $2.1M. The Weinstein Co. has taken in a paltry $8M.Gerard Butler’s Africa-set drama Machine Gun Preacher got off to a good start in platform release with an estimated $44,000 from two theaters each in New York and Los Angeles for a $11,000 average. Drawing mixed reviews, the R-rated film expands to 15 major markets on Friday through Relativity Media.The top ten films grossed a September record $106.6M which was up 20% from last year when Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps opened in the top spot with $19M; and up 34% from 2009 when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs remained at number one with $25M in its second weekend.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Action, video, Superheroe, chucky, Trek, Esquire, Spring, japanese","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Its-Good-To-Be-The-Lion-King"},{"id":"47509127293778","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Holds Off Footloose","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Real Steel Holds Off FootlooseAlso, The Thing takes third, and Ides drops to fourth.by Sujit Chawla | October 17, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the worldwide protests against remakes came out in full force as the robot boxers of Real Steel squeaked out a victory over the 80s remakes of Footloose and The Thing, while the weekend’s other new release The Big Year crashed and burned. Overall the box office dropped nearly 37% from last year.Holding on for a second straight weekend at the top of the charts was the Hugh Jackman robot boxing family drama Real Steel which fell a respectable 40% from last weekend to an estimated $16.3M, bringing its total to $51.7M. With two more weeks before Puss in Boots comes gunning for the family audience, a final in the $90-100M range is likely, with that century mark a definite possibility.The heavily hyped remake Footloose landed in second place this weekend with an estimated $16.1M from 3,549 dance halls, for a per screen average of a so-so $4,536. The film opened at #1 on Friday, but lost steam as the weekend went along and families came out to see Real Steel, which was #1 on Saturday and Sunday. With a CinemaScore of an astounding A, it seems the people who actually went out to see Footloose really liked it, but getting past the stigma of remaking a beloved 80s classic was apparently a bit too much to overcome for Paramount.Another 80s remake landed with a thud in third place as Universal’s horror flick The Thing grossed an estimated $8.7M from 2,996 screens, for a per screen average of a very sad $2,904. Other horror remakes have done reasonably well with tremendously front-loaded opening weekends before falling apart (Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street to name a couple) but it seems the name recognition of The Thing didn’t have quite the cache of the others. With a CinemaScore of a B-, expect The Thing to see a quick trip to DVD.Holdovers took the next five spots on the charts, each falling less than 31% from last weekend. Fourth place belonged to George Clooney with his political thriller The Ides of March which dropped a slim 28% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.5M, bringing its cume to $22M. A final in the $50M range seems likely unless it manages to pick up a bunch of year-end awards, at which point the idea of a re-release (or re-expansion) seems likely to happen, which could push its total higher. Fifth place went to the dolphin tale Dolphin Tale, which took in an estimated $6.3M bringing its total to $58.7M. And the film it’s been running neck and neck with since their openings last month came in close behind in sixth as Moneyball took in $5.5M, according to estimates, seeing its total rise to $57.7MTwo tales of courage took seventh and eighth this weekend. The cancer dramedy 50/50 had the lowest drop in the top 10, falling only 23.7% to an estimated $4.3M, bringing its cume to $24.3M. And the religious-themed Courageous held on well in its third weekend, falling 30% to an estimated $3.4M, bringing its total to $21.4M for distributor Sony.We had to take out a pair of binoculars to see the Steve Martin/Owen Wilson/Jack Black comedy The Big Year on the charts, but there it is, tucked into 9th place this weekend with an estimated $3.3M from 2,150 screens, for a dismal per screen average of $1,547. With a CinemaScore of a B- this is another film that won’t last very long in theaters. Apparently it’s not just sequels and remakes that people are protesting against. Rounding out the top 10 was the animated mega-hit The Lion King which roared its way to an estimated $2.7M in the 5th weekend of its 2-week limited release. Its total for the re-release is $90M, with its overall total now at $419M, putting it at #9 on the all-time blockbuster list, just ahead of Disney stablemate Toy Story 3 ($415M in 2010) and just behind yet another Disney film, 2006’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($423.3M).Outside of the top 10, Sony Picture Classics had a limited release for the Pedro Almodovar thriller The Skin I Live In starring Antonio Banderas. Released on only 6 screens, the film grossed an estimated $231,000 for a scorching per screen average of $38,500.The top ten films grossed $74.2M which was down 36.6% from last year when Jackass 3D opened in the top spot with a new October record of $50.4M; and down 40.5% from 2009 when Where the Wild Things Are debuted at number one with $32.7M.Compared to projections, Footloose, The Thing and The Big Year all debuted below Gitesh’s respective predictions of $20M, $13M and $6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"park, doctor, Disney+, disaster, Masterpiece, on","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Real-Steel-Holds-Off-Footloose"},{"id":"47509128833885","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Breaks Weekend Records","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Harry Potter Breaks Weekend RecordsPlus, Transformers falls, and Winnie the Pooh debuts at No. 6.by Gitesh Pandya | July 18, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, box office records of all kinds were demolished by the wildly anticipated franchise closer Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which generated the biggest opening in Hollywood history. The eighth and final chapter in the decade-long fantasy series opened to an eye-popping $168.6M from North America, according to estimates, plus an additional $307M from overseas markets which began running the film on Wednesday leading to a scorching worldwide launch of $475.6M. All three figures broke the all-time records beating The Dark Knight‘s $158.4M domestic opening weekend in July 2008, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides‘ $260.4M international bow this past May, and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince‘s $394M global debut in July 2009.Domestically, the new Potter also smashed records for the best ever midnight launch with $43.5M on late Thursday night including 3:00am shows that many theaters added, and a colossal $92.1M opening day including those midnights. The previous records were held by the Twilight franchise with last summer’s Eclipse having a $30M midnight bow and 2009’s New Moon posting a $72.7M first day. Like a boxer unifying multiple titles, Harry Potter pulled off a remarkable feat setting new box office records in five major categories.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244733[/rtimage]The new Potter installment opened ultrawide in 4,375 theaters – including a record 274 IMAX venues – and was the first in the franchise to be presented in 3D which helped to boost the grosses. As with most action epics, North American moviegoers were less interested in the 3D conversion as 43% of the weekend gross came from the extra-dimensional screens while overseas the rate was much higher at 61%. The domestic per-theater average stood at a sturdy $38,526.The concluding chapter’s opening weekend was a healthy 35% bigger than the $125M bow last November of Part 1 which was in 2D and went on to finish with $295M. The first seven Potter films have grossed a sizzling $6.36 billion worldwide and the franchise now sits at $6.84 billion with the launch of the final saga. The series will shatter the $7 billion mark in a matter of days.Critics and audiences both loved the new Deathly Hallows. Reviews were not only among the best for the series, but also rank as among the most positive for any wide release this year. Warner Bros. will be hoping that the regular Oscar attention it receives for the wizard franchise will this time go beyond the technical categories and into other areas including Best Picture. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the PG-13 pic an overall A grade. This does not necessarily mean the film will have legs as Potter pics are always heavily front-loaded with this one being even more so.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244734[/rtimage]The historic frame began with the stunning $92.1M Friday which included the intense demand from fans to see right away how the saga ends on the big screen. Saturday sales crumbled by a very high 54% to $42.9M which did not come close to breaking the record for the largest Saturday. Spider-Man 3 still holds that distinction with $51.3M from May 2007. The studio estimated a 22% dip on Sunday to $33.6M. With such upfront demand, Friday accounted for a whopping 55% of the three-day gross.IMAX also broke domestic and global records with the new Hallows. Fans spent $15.5M from the North American sites beating the $12.2M of last weekend’s Alice in Wonderland and $23.5M from 394 screens worldwide beating the most recent Transformers which did $20.4M. The previous recordholders were also in 3D.Being a global phenomenon, it was no surprise that grosses around the world were sensational for Harry’s last stand with nearly a half-billion dollars collected in just five days. The jaw-dropping $307M overseas debut came from 20,000 screens across 59 countries with China still to come on August 4. Leading the way this weekend (with different numbers of days depending on local launches) were the United Kingdom with $36.6M, Australia with $26.7M, Germany with $25.7M, France with $23.9M, and Japan with $21.5M. Like in the U.S., the U.K. and Australia set all-time opening weekend records too.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244735[/rtimage]Despite rising ticket prices over the years, the first film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (Philosopher’s Stone overseas) still holds the series records for total domestic and worldwide grosses with $317.6M and $970M, respectively. Those could crumble too as Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 may find its way north of $325M from North America and $1 billion globally.Michael Bay took a hit by the teen wizard as his latest action juggernaut Transformers: Dark of the Moon fell 55% in its third frame to an estimated $21.3M. But the latest Autobots film burst through the triple century mark finishing the weekend at $302.8M. Declines for previous chapters when a new Potter debuted were lower with 48% in 2007 and 44% in 2009. However, both of those Hogwarts films debuted on a Wednesday diluting the weekend figures. With both new chapters of Transformers and Harry Potter being in 3D, the fight for those special screens also played into this weekend’s showdown.With rival summer action films Captain America: The First Avenger, Cowboys &amp; Aliens, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes opening over each of the next three weekends, more large declines are likely in the weeks ahead putting Dark of the Moon on course to finish with about $360M domestically. Overseas, Transformers felt the heat of Hogwarts too with the weekend take falling 58% to an estimated $39M. With the international cume now up to $460M – a new high for the franchise thanks in part to 3D prices – the global tally surged to a stunning $762.8M with China and Japan still to open. Korea has led all overseas markets with $61.6M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244736[/rtimage]The Warner Bros. comedy Horrible Bosses held up quite well in its second weekend grossing an estimated $17.6M for a relatively low 38% decline. The R-rated workplace pic has banked an impressive $60M in just ten days and could end up breaking the $100M mark. Fellow sophomore comedy Zookeeper fared well too dipping only 39% to an estimated $12.3M. Sony has taken in $42.4M in ten days with the expensive Kevin James project and could be on the way to around $75M.A pair of G-rated toons from Disney followed. The Pixar sequel Cars 2 fell 45% to an estimated $8.3M for a $165.3M sum to date. By comparison, the first Cars enjoyed a $14.6M gross in its fourth lap. Breaking $200M may be a tough mission to accomplish for Mater and pals who may end closer to the $190M mark. The Mouse House saw a soft debut for its well-reviewed animated tale Winnie the Pooh which debuted to an estimated $8M from 2,405 locations for a mild $3,326 average.The Cameron Diaz comedy Bad Teacher dropped 42% to an estimated $5.2M giving Sony a solid $88.5M to date. Diaz’s My Best Friend’s Wedding co-star Julia Roberts, who is also on screen now as a bad teacher, followed with the Tom Hanks film Larry Crowne which suffered another steep fall sliding 57% to an estimated $2.6M. Universal has collected a mere $31.6M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10244737[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten with estimates of $1.9M each were the sci-fi drama Super 8 and the Woody Allen comedy Midnight in Paris. The Paramount actioner tumbled 60% with Potter‘s arrival putting the cume at $122.2M. The Sony Classics release dipped only 28% and has taken in $41.8M so far making it the veteran director’s all-time top-grossing film passing the $40.1M of 1986’s Hannah and her Sisters. Of course, Hannah and films like Annie Hall and Manhattan all sold a much larger amount of tickets.New domestic totals for top summer grossers outside the top ten include $251.9M for The Hangover Part II, $237.3M for Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, $209.1M for Fast Five, $179.5M for Thor, $161.3M for Bridesmaids, $160.1M for Kung Fu Panda 2, $143.4M for X-Men: First Class, $112.7M for Green Lantern.The top ten films grossed an estimated $247.7M which was up a potent 46% from last year when Inception opened in the top spot with $62.8M; and up a huge 65% from 2009 when Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince debuted at number one with $77.8M over the weekend and $158M over five days.Written by Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"fiction, Company, E3, comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Harry-Potter-Breaks-Weekend-Records"},{"id":"47509128874851","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: X-Men Is First Class","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: X-Men Is First ClassThe Hangover Part II and Kung Fu Panda 2 round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | June 6, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend Fox rebooted its mutant super hero franchise and scored a top spot launch with the comic book pic X-Men: First Class which stood as the frame’s only new wide release. The PG-13 film debuted to an estimated $56M over the weekend from 3,641 theaters for a solid $15,380 average. It was in line with other Marvel super hero films of the same type, most notably 2008’s reboot The Incredible Hulk which debuted to $55.4M in June of that summer. Both followed films that were widely disliked and featured new directors, cast, and storylines in hopes of winning back fans.First Class also reached about the same number of people as last month’s Thor which bowed to $65.7M which included higher-priced tickets from 3D and IMAX screens that helped to boost the grosses. Take out those extra fees and the two films were very close in opening weekend sales. The new X-Men was only presented in 2D and lacked any big star names that would attract a broader crowd like Thor‘s Natalie Portman and Anthony Hopkins.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243797[/rtimage]The new tale that documented the origins of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto played to an adult male crowd. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male while 54% was over 25. Reviews were terrific while the CinemaScore grade from paying moviegoers was just a decent B+.First Class attacked most of the international marketplace this weekend and hauled in an estimated $64M from 74 territories for a robust $120M worldwide debut. The first four X-Men films showed steady growth in the international share of the global total and the latest installment is continuing that trend with 53% of its global opening coming from overseas this weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243622[/rtimage]Following its record-breaking holiday opening, the comedy sequel The Hangover Part II tumbled 62% in its second weekend to an estimated $32.4M lifting the 11-day total to a hefty $186.9M. The drop was understandable given the upfront demand for the Warner Bros. film and the fact that it was coming off of a holiday. The Bangkok-set film is on track to finish in the neighborhood of $250M. Overseas, the Hangover pic took in an estimated $62M thanks to new openings in Germany and Russia. The international cume rose to $151.5M while the worldwide tally stands at $338.4M.Kung Fu Panda 2, the other sequel that launched over Memorial Day weekend, grossed an estimated $24.3M falling by a moderate 49%. Paramount has banked $100.4M after 11 days and looks headed for the $160M vicinity from North America. Overseas, the Jack Black vehicle took in an estimated $40M giving the 3D toon an international total of $125M and $225.4M worldwide.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243625[/rtimage]Continuing with its rapid erosion domestically and hefty numbers overseas was Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which approached the $800M global mark. The Johnny Depp adventure fell 55% to an estimated $18M for a North American cume of $190.3M. The international take was still huge with $69.4M this weekend bumping the massive total to $600.4M. Worldwide, the latest Pirates is at a towering $790.7M with a hearty 76% coming from offshore.Kristin Wiig scored her first $100M+ grosser as a lead with Bridesmaids which still showed fabulous legs with an estimated $12.1M, off only 27%, for a $107.3M total. Universal’s sleeper hit now looks likely to reach $140M if not more.The pair of action hits that kicked off the summer movie season followed. Paramount’s Thor dropped 56% to an estimated $4.2M while Universal’s Fast Five grabbed an estimated $3.2M falling 49%. Totals are now $169.1M domestic and $427.1M worldwide for the super hero flick and $202.1M and $568.6M for the racing sequel.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243626[/rtimage]Still doing stellar business in limited release was Woody Allen’s indie comedy Midnight in Paris which is expanding nicely with an estimated $2.9M from 147 playdates. The Sony Classics film averaged $19,837 and raised its sum to $6.9M with many more markets yet to open.Wedding comedies that have been side-by-side on the charts rounded out the top ten. Sony’s Jumping the Broom grossed an estimated $865,000, down 53%, while Something Borrowed fell 55% to an estimated $835,000 for Warner Bros. Cumes are $35.9M and $36.7M, respectively.Opening to good results in platform release was the Ewan McGregor pic Beginners which bowed to an estimated $135,000 from only five sites for a $27,000 average. Focus will expand throughout June. Fox Searchlight saw a strong expansion for its Terence Malick film The Tree of Life which widened from four to 20 theaters for a weekend estimate of $621,000 and a solid average of $31,050. Total is $1.3M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $154.9M which was up a healthy 29% from last year when Shrek Forever After remained in the top spot for a third time with $25.5M; but off 2% from 2009 when The Hangover debuted at number one with $45M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Grammys, anthology, streaming, Pictures, Walt, The, TV, spider-man, superhero, Esquire, Review, Emmys, Purge","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-XMen-Is-First-Class"},{"id":"47509128867682","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Super 8 Captures #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Super 8 Captures #1 SpotGo Super 8 OK.by Gitesh Pandya | June 13, 2011 |  CommentsExceeding expectations, the new kid-driven monster movie Super 8 shot straight to number one at the North American box office while fellow newcomer Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer failed to make a dent with a weak debut in seventh place. Most holdovers fared well as the overall marketplace fell from last year’s numbers, but only by a small margin.Paramount scored a hit with its 1979-set sci-fi action-drama Super 8 which opened impressively with an estimated $37M this weekend from 3,379 theaters for a solid $10,950 average. The PG-13 film about a group of middle school kids trying to solve the mystery behind a train crash that unleashes a creature in their small town had no starpower and instead relied on the brand names of director J.J. Abrams and producer Steven Spielberg who both worked overtime promoting the $50M production. The studio opened the film one day early in over 300 theaters on Thursday, including all 239 IMAX sites, and grossed an estimated $1M that day giving Super 8 a cume of $38M. IMAX accounted for 12% of the gross, or about $4.5M and a sparkling $19,000 average.Reviews were mostly positive and the marketing campaign purposely held back much about the film so audiences would be intrigued and then experience all the excitement inside the theater. It was a risky move in today’s world of information overload, but it paid off. Opening day audiences gave the creature feature a B+ grade which was good, but not exceptional. But Saturday sales rose 15% from $12.2M to $14M. Even for an original film with no real built-in audience, it indicates a promising road ahead.Super 8 played much older than most other films in the marketplace. The audience was 71% over 25 and 56% male which was similar to the crowd for the well-reviewed summer action entry Thor which played 72% over 25. The Abrams film did better with cross-gender appeal as Thor was 63% male. Older moviegoers do not rush out on the first weekend as much as younger ones do and with an original non-franchise film like Super 8, there could be substantial sales still to come.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243962[/rtimage]The opening of Super 8 was very close to the $37.4M debut of another recent one-word-one-number summer monster movie – 2009’s District 9. Though it was rated R, took place in another country, and was centered on adult characters, the Sony film won praise from critics with an original story about regular people coping with odd beasts in their town. That film fell 51% in the second weekend before ending its run with a terrific $115.6M – a little more than three times its opening.Overseas, Super 8 had a limited bow in just nine markets with Australia being the only major one. The estimate was $6.7M and next weekend will see the first major overseas showing with numerous marketing opening including Russia and Korea.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243960[/rtimage]Dropping from number one in its second weekend was the super hero reboot X-Men: First Class which fell by an understandable 55% to an estimated $25M giving Fox $98.9M in ten days. The PG-13 origin flick earned good reviews and positive buzz which helped it hold up relatively well for this type of film. Plus it had a competing sci-fi film also playing to adult men to deal with. It was a smaller drop than the 60% fall that Universal witnessed in June 2008 with its Marvel reboot The Incredible Hulk and beat out the 59% slide that Fantastic Four suffered in July 2005. However it was larger than the 47% dip that Thor experienced last month in its sophomore session. That pic introduced a brand new character to the screen and did not have a major action film opening against it in the second weekend. Look for the domestic total to end with around $140M. The overseas weekend brought in an estimated $42.2M, down just 33%, for a $124.2M cume and $223.1M worldwide tally.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243958[/rtimage]The Bangkok mayhem of The Hangover Part II attracted an estimated $18.5M worth of business for a reasonable 41% fall in the third session. Warner Bros. smashed the $200M mark on Friday after just 16 days setting a new speed record for live-action comedies. The old record of 19 days was held by 2004’s Meet the Fockers. The new Hangover pic has now reached an impressive $216.6M in 18 days and could be headed past $260M. Global audiences are also having fun with the hungover boys as holdover markets overseas dropped by just 37%. The weekend brought an estimated $38.3M pushing the international take past the double century mark as well to $215.5M. Worldwide, The Hangover Part II has grossed $432.1M. While the film’s domestic final may end a bit short of its predecessor’s, the international figure has already zoomed past the $191.6M of the first Hangover.Despite facing two new films with kids as their lead characters, the animated comedy Kung Fu Panda 2 held up very well dropping only 30% to an estimated $16.6M in its third weekend. The Paramount/DreamWorks title has now banked $126.9M in 18 days and could be headed past the $170M mark. Panda opened at number one in 17 international territories fueling a strong $56.5M offshore frame lifting the overseas gross to $205M and the global take to $331.9M. Top spot bows this weekend in the U.K., Mexico, and Brazil helped keep the global roll-out going and an amazing hold in China has propelled the local total to a stellar $71.2M. The Panda sequel debuts in a number of European markets next weekend including France and Germany. Adding foreign to domestic, Kung Fu Panda 2 was the world’s most popular film this weekend.Dropping 40% to fifth place was Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides with an estimated $10.8M boosting Disney’s take to $208.8M. The latest Johnny Depp adventure is the second biggest domestic grosser of the year behind the Wolf Pack, however overseas business remained red hot with the film collecting an estimated $41.1M boosting the international haul to an eye-popping $678M. That makes Tides the sixth biggest blockbuster of all-time overseas. By the end of the week, the Fountain of Youth pic will sail past the $690.1M of Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs and the $690.2M of Depp’s own Alice in Wonderland to take the number four spot trailing only the third Lord of the Rings and a pair of James Cameron megahits. The new Pirates now stands at a towering $886.8M worldwide with a steep 77% coming from overseas and the one billion mark likely within reach. Top international markets are Japan ($74.5M), Germany ($66.7M), China ($65.2M), Russia ($60.7M), and the United Kingdom ($48M).For the fourth straight weekend, Bridesmaids posted the lowest decline in the top ten slipping a mere 16% to an estimated $10.2M. If the estimate holds, the Kristin Wiig hit will become the only film of 2011 to gross over $10M for five weekends. With $123.9M, the Universal sleeper hit is cashing in on great word-of-mouth as more audiences continue to discover the raunchy wedding comedy. Bridesmaids should have no problem breaking the $150M mark now and may even reach the $164M of The Proposal from two summers ago which was PG-13.[rtimage]siteImageId=10243957[/rtimage]Stumbling into seventh place with an estimated $6.3M in its opening weekend was the tween girl comedy Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer which didn’t excite too many kids. The PG-rated film starring Jordana Beatty and Heather Graham averaged a weak $2,483 from 2,524 theaters and could not carve out a big audience despite being based on a popular series of books. The budget was under $20M with producer Smokewood Entertainment paying that plus the marketing tab. Relativity distributed the critically-panned film in the U.S. for a fee. The overall CinemaScore grade was a B+ and females made up 78% of the audience. Playing mostly to moms and daughters, Judy generated 88% of its business from children under 12 plus their parents.After three sizzling weeks in limited release, Woody Allen’s new hit comedy Midnight in Paris accelerated its expansion plan and went nationwide this weekend taking in an estimated $6.1M from 944 locations for a good $6,511 average. Sony Classics has taken in $14.2M to date and could have a lot more to go as it positions the Owen Wilson starrer as an alternative choice for mature adults in a marketplace dominated by sci-fi actioners, sequels, and kidpics. Critics have been singing praises so the PG-13 film could enjoy good legs in the weeks ahead as buzz spreads and the long Fourth of July holiday weekend approaches.Rounding out the top ten were the summer kickoff films that went head-to-head around the world. The 3D comic book pic Thor fell 44% to an estimated $2.4M for $173.6M to date for Paramount with $434M worldwide. Universal’s bigger hit Fast Five grossed an estimated $1.7M, off 46%, putting the domestic cume at $205.1M and the worldwide tally at a muscular $583.4M. The Vin Diesel vehicle is now the third biggest domestic grosser of the year but second highest globally behind only the Pirates sequel.Top-tier specialty films continued to perform well as they expanded to more markets. Terence Malick’s The Tree of Life starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn went from 20 to 47 theaters and grossed an estimated $875,000 for a solid $18,617 average for Fox Searchlight. Focus widened its Ewan McGregor pic Beginners from five to 19 playdates and collected an estimated $255,000 for a $13,421 average. Totals stand at $2.4M and $465,000, respectively.The top ten films grossed an estimated $134.6M which was off 4% from last year when The Karate Kid opened in the top spot with $55.7M; but up 4% from 2009 when The Hangover remained at number one with $32.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"winner, History, Reality, Review, of, what, Originals, book, chucky, TIFF, romantic, Nickelodeon","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Super-8-Captures-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509130433384","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fast Five Finishes First","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Fast Five Finishes FirstProm and Hoodwinked Too! don't fare so well...by Gitesh Pandya | May 2, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, the summer movie season got off to an early and explosive start with the record-breaking debut of the action sequel Fast Five which raced to the top of the North American box office with an opening that was miles ahead of any other film’s from this year. But the two other new offerings were flat out rejected by ticket buyers as the high school comedy Prom and the 3D toon Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil sparked no interest from audiences. Overall ticket sales were up sharply versus last year which came as great news for the industry which is trying desperately to generate momentum going into the potent month of May.Universal scored the biggest opening in studio history with Fast Five which debuted to a stunning $83.6M, according to estimates, leading the marketplace with a sturdy 54% market share. The PG-13 film averaged a muscular $22,950 from 3,644 theaters including a record 243 IMAX sites where tickets cost as much as $19 each. 10% of the weekend gross came from those large-format screens. The opening was critical for Universal which has struggled over the last couple of years at the box office. Fast Five broke the long-standing opening weekend record for the studio which was set back in May 1997 by Steven Spielberg’s The Lost World which took in $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its Memorial Day weekend launch setting the all-time industry record at the time. Of course, ticket prices were much lower back then.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242969[/rtimage]By bringing back the main cast members of the first movie – 2001’s The Fast and the Furious – the franchise got re-energized two years ago when the fourth installment Fast &amp; Furious opened to a stunning $71M proving there was still solid interest in the franchise. Fast Five improved on that by an impressive 18% and plans are developing for a sixth installment. Universal made sure it was offering something new and exciting by reuniting stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker with actors from previous chapters like Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‘Ludacris’ Bridges, and Sung Kang. Plus the sequel got taken to another level with the casting of Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson creating a high-octane testosterone vehicle that had to be experienced on the big screen. Critics helped out too giving what were by far the best reviews the series had seen yet.Fast Five also generated the biggest opening ever in April, beating out Fast &amp; Furious, and more than doubled 2011’s previous best debut – Rio‘s $39.2M. During the January-to-April periods in 2009 and 2010 there were five films each year that opened north of $40M. This year saw none until Five rolled in.The busy weekend started off with $34.5M on Friday including $3.7M from Thursday night’s post-midnight showtimes. The Brazil-set heist film then fell 12% on Saturday to $30.2M which was commendable given that the last film in the franchise tumbled 19% on Saturday. Universal is estimating a 37% Sunday decline to $18.9M. Five earned a great A CinemaScore grade as fans have been liking what they have been seeing. The usual sophomore tumble is likely next weekend, especially since rival action entry Thor is opening, but good word-of-mouth may prevent the declines that the last Furious suffered.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242970[/rtimage]Produced for $125M after counting tax rebates and other incentives, the adrenaline-pumping actioner played to an audience that was 56% male, 52% under 25, and 65% non-Caucasian. Overseas, Fast Five was a big ticket item too and grossed an estimated $45.3M from just 14 markets boosting the international total to $81.4M and the global gross to $165M with much more to come. All ten new markets opened at number one including Russia, Germany, and Spain. Even more encouraging for Universal, the new chapter posted franchise record debuts everywhere just as it did domestically meaning the road ahead is lucrative for the series. 45 more international territories open next weekend as Fast Five may have enough fuel to reach the $500M mark worldwide.Moviegoers wanting a less violent trip to Brazil lined up for the animated hit Rio which fell to second after two weeks at number one and grossed an estimated $14.4M. The 3D film dropped by only 45% and crossed the century mark after 17 days of release with a cume to date of $103.6M for Fox. A trajectory towards about $140M seems likely as no films aimed at families will open over the next two weeks. Rio‘s overseas total has now climbed to $263M putting the global take at $366M with a whopping 72% coming from outside of North America. Brazil, home to the director and the film’s setting, has contributed a stellar $36M to date.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242971[/rtimage]Tyler Perry suffered a predictable 60% sophomore fall for his latest comedy Madea’s Big Happy Family which ranked third with $10.1M, according to estimates. Lionsgate has banked $41.1M in ten days and should end up with $50-55M. The Reese-and-Robert romance Water for Elephants followed with an estimated $9.1M dropping by a moderate 46% in its second round. Fox has collected $32.3M in ten days and should finish with about $55M as well.The weekend’s two new releases not involving high-speed theft both stumbled at the box office failing to excite moviegoers. Disney’s high school comedy Prom bowed to an estimated $5M from 2,730 locations for a weak $1,832 average. The PG-rated story about teens preparing for their big dance was aimed at the tween audience and girls in particular. Reviews were not too strong and Prom had no major star to anchor the project.Parents told Hollywood that there are way too many 3D toons these days by ignoring the animated sequel Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil which debuted in sixth place with an estimated $4.1M from 2,505 theaters. Averaging a dismal $1,653, the PG-rated follow-up to The Weinstein Company’s 2006 hit lacked must-see buzz and faced intense competition from other kidpics like Rio. Critics also savaged the Hoodwinked sequel.[rtimage]siteImageId=10242972[/rtimage]Sony’s inspirational drama Soul Surfer held up nicely again slipping 39% to an estimated $3.3M for a sum of $33.8M so far. The horror hit Insidious fell to an estimated $2.7M, down 48%, and has grossed $48.3M for FilmDistrict.Box office gravity caught up with the hit kidpic Hop. After surging last weekend in its fourth frame thanks to the Easter holiday, the Universal release plunged 79% this time to an estimated $2.6M for a cume to date of $105.3. Rounding out the top ten was the action pic Source Code with an estimated $2.5M, off 50%, and a $48.9M total.Overseas, Paramount’s super hero epic Thor made a mighty splash opening in dozens of major markets with an estimated $83M from 56 territories making for the year’s top wide international debut weekend. The pricey 3D action pic opened last weekend in star Chris Hemsworth’s home country of Australia and dipped 42% this weekend in its second frame for a sizable local cume of $13.1M. Fast Five fell a similar 41% in its second round Down Under and has taken in $20.9M. Thor has raked in a total of $93M from all markets so far and will invade well over 3,500 theaters across North America this Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $137.4M which was up a mighty 56% from last year when A Nightmare on Elm Street opened in the top spot with $32.9M; but down 6% from 2009 when X-Men Origins: Wolverine kicked off the summer debuting at number one with $85.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TCA, king, show, Paramount, venice, documentary, Hulu, Paquin, Trophy, Columbia, Animation, Kimmy, Kids, deadpool","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Fast-Five-Finishes-First"},{"id":"47509130443628","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Rules First April Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Rules First April WeekendSource Code, Insidious open to decent numbers.by Gitesh Pandya | April 4, 2011 |  CommentsNew releases all fared well as the April box office kicked off with the Easter-themed hit Hop which powered its way to number one playing well to family audiences. Older adults drove the action thriller Source Code to a second place debut while fright fans lined up for the new horror pic Insidious which finished in third. But overall ticket sales continued to struggle as last year’s top four films alone grossed more than all films this weekend combined.Universal delivered the biggest opening ever for a kidpic in April with its Easter Bunny flick Hop which bowed to an estimated $38.1M. The PG-rated hybrid of animation and live-action averaged a potent $10,650 from a very wide launch in 3,579 theaters and connected with its target audience of children and their parents with a debut that exceeded pre-release expectations. Universal and its promotional partners attacked the marketplace from all angles with marketing tie-ins designed to engage consumers – and especially those all-important decision-making moms – in numerous ways. The estimate matched the bow of Rango which currently holds the record for 2011’s largest opening weekend. Final numbers to be released on Monday will determine if the rabbit film can edge Johnny Depp’s lizard toon.With no huge stars appearing on screen or providing voices, the $63M-budgeted Hop was promoted as being from the producer of Despicable Me and the director of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Those overachievers grossed a combined $469M from North America alone and were crowd-pleasers with kids so families felt safe coming out for this new offering. A familiar Easter Bunny storyline and colorful trailers helped too as did a release date a few weeks before the family-friendly holiday. With a CinemaScore grade of A- and no new kidpics slated for next weekend, the road ahead looks promising although the 3D toon Rio will cause a major distraction on April 15. Overall, Hop enjoyed the fifth-biggest opening ever for April which generally is a slow month at multiplexes.The well-reviewed sci-fi film Source Code opened in second place with an estimated $15M from 2,961 theaters for a good $5,076 average. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a soldier that takes multiple trips back in time in hopes of preventing a train disaster, the PG-13 film attracted some of the best reviews of the year for an action film and debuted just a few notches behind recent adult-skewing thrillers like Limitless ($18.9M), The Adjustment Bureau ($21.2M), and Unknown ($21.9M). But its B CinemaScore suggests that the coming weeks may not be smooth sailing. Produced for $32M, Source Code played to older men with studio research showing that 54% of the audience was male and 64% was over 30.New distributor FilmDistrict got off to an encouraging start with its first release, the horror picture Insidious, which bowed to an estimated $13.5M in third place. The PG-13 chiller averaged a good $5,605 from 2,408 locations and took advantage of a severe lack of competition as 2011 has barely seen any scary movies be released. Marketed as being from the makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw helped it to reach its target audience and the rating certainly broadened the appeal to younger teens looking for a non-gory scare. Reviews were quite good for this genre and Saturday sales enjoyed a 12% bump – something not often seen with horror titles. Insidious debuted ahead of expectations establishing FilmDistrict as a distributor to watch for.Tumbling 57% from its top spot debut was the kidpic sequel Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules which took in an estimated $10.2M in its second weekend for fourth place. The Fox release, which cost just $20M to produce, has grossed a solid $38.4M in ten days and is headed for the vicinity of $55M, or just slightly below the $64M of its predecessor from last spring.The Bradley Cooper-Robert De Niro hit Limitless followed with an estimated $9.4M, off only 38%, for a $55.6M total in 17 days for Relativity. Lionsgate’s Matthew McConaughey legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer also held up well in its third round slipping only 34% to an estimated $7.1M for a $39.6M cume to date. Both films are benefiting from strong word-of-mouth.On the other hand, audiences abandoned the stylish action fantasy Sucker Punch which collapsed in its sophomore outing falling a steep 68% to an estimated $6.1M. The pricey $75M production has banked just $29.9M in ten days and is not likely to collect much more with a $35-40M final likely for Warner Bros. Rango, the year’s top-grossing title, dropped 53% and took in an estimated $4.6M pushing Paramount’s sum to $113.8M.Alien flicks Paul and Battle: Los Angeles were once again neighbors on the box office chart and this time rounded out the top ten. Universal’s comedy collected an estimated $4.3M, down 45%, and has taken in $31.9M to date. Sony’s action pic fell harder with a 54% decline to an estimated $3.5M. The invasion film’s domestic total stands at $78.5M while the overseas tally crossed the century mark this weekend with $100.7M putting the global cume at $179.2M.In limited release, Sony Classics platformed this year’s Oscar and Golden Globe winner for best foreign language film In A Better World in four sites in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $35,400. The Danish film averaged a respectable $8,850 per theater and earned mostly good reviews from U.S. film critics. The bullying drama played numerous film festivals like Toronto and Sundance and was released in Scandinavia last fall.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.8M which was down a sizable 33% from last year when Clash of the Titans opened in the top spot with $61.2M; and off 24% from 2009 when Fast &amp; Furious debuted at number one with $71M. The two films still stand as April’s biggest opening weekends by a wide margin.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"curtis, Purge, parents, supernatural, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hop-Rules-First-April-Weekend"},{"id":"47509130441579","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Stays On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Hop Stays On TopArthur and Hanna round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | April 10, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend Universal’s hit kidpic Hop became the first film of 2011 to spend back-to-back weeks at number one as the bunny pic fended off competition from four new wide releases to remain the most popular film in North America. Its star Russell Brand also claimed second place with his comedy remake Arthur making the British comedian that rare star to hold the top two spots at the box office. The frame’s other debuting titles had mixed results with the teen girl-led films Hanna and Soul Surfer faring well while the raunchy fantasy comedy Your Highness failed to make much of a splash. As usual, the overall box office was down by double digits compared to last year.Dropping a reasonable 42% in its second turn with moviegoers, Hop grossed an estimated $21.7M boosting its ten-day total to a healthy $68.2M. The Universal release cost only $63M to make so the studio has a solid moneymaker on its hands that could possibly find its way to $120-130M from North America alone. So far the animation/live-action hybrid is following the same path as Johnny Depp’s Rango from early March. After a similar $38.1M debut, the lizard toon declined by 41% putting its ten-day tally at the exact same figure as Hop’s. Rango now sits at $117.5M after its sixth session on its way to $120M+. Hop follows an eleven-week streak of new films opening at number one each frame.Russell Brand’s Arthur remake finished in second place for the weekend thanks to the widest release of any new title and grossed an estimated $12.6M. The PG-13 redo of the 1981 Dudley Moore hit averaged a lackluster $3,848 per theater from 3,276 locations. Slammed by critics, the Warner Bros. release was meant to bring the story of a rich lovable drunk playboy to a younger audience by using the British comic as the anchor. But unfunny trailers and Brand’s not-so-sizable box office power led Arthur to a disappointing debut as moviegoers stayed away for the most part. The actor’s only other lead role in a film came in last summer’s Get Him To The Greek which carried an R rating and bowed to a better $17.6M on its way to $61M. Arthur co-starred Helen Mirren and Jennifer Garner who also failed to contribute commercial muscle. Though it ranked second overall, the comedy placed fifth in the top ten when comparing per-theater averages. The reported production budget was $40M with a hefty marketing tab added on top of that.Focus landed in third with a commendable performance from its new action title Hanna which debuted to an estimated $12.3M from 2,535 playdates. The PG-13 espionage thriller averaged $4,861 and was the only action film in the top five. Starring Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, the pic earned strong reviews from critics which helped it appeal to upscale adult audiences looking for something without talking bunnies or bumbling drunks. Few films are anchored by a teen girl assassin so the fresh feel and the strong marketing push helped Hanna stand out as an option paying top dollar for.The inspirational family drama Soul Surfer exceeded expectations and debuted in fourth with an estimated $11.1M. Posting the best average among the new titles, the PG-rated true story of a teen surfer who gets her life back on track after a shark bites off her arm averaged a good $5,014 from 2,214 sites. Sony’s TriStar unit handled distribution while FilmDistrict took marketing duties. Starring AnnaSophia Robb, Dennis Quaid, Helen Hunt, and superstar singer Carrie Underwood in her film debut, earned mixed reviews from critics. Moms and daughters made up a big portion of the audience. Exit polls showed that a whopping 80% of the crowd was female and 56% was under 25. Soul Surfer earned an A+ grade from CinemaScore which is rare these days so word-of-mouth should allow the pic to play well for the rest of the spring season especially with the Easter holiday still to come.The horror film Insidious posted a shockingly low second weekend decline of only 27% and ranked fifth with an estimated $9.7M in ticket sales. Fright films routinely lose over half of their opening weekend take in the sophomore frame so this result is indeed rare. With a solid $27.1M in its first ten days, rookie distributor FilmDistrict’s first release could find its way to an impressive $50M or more. With Insidious, four of the top five films had one-word titles.Faring worst among the weekend’s four new wide releases was Universal’s fantasy comedy Your Highness which bowed to an estimated $9.5M from 2,769 locations for a dull $3,438 average. The R-rated action laugher starring Danny McBride, James Franco, and Natalie Portman tried to attract older teens and young adults by mixing an effects-driven Medieval quest with crude sexual humor but failed to impress. The $50M production skewed towards young men with 58% of the audience being male and 55% being 25 and older. A weak C+ CinemaScore and horrible reviews indicate a fast fade in the weeks ahead. Saturday sales dropped 9% while all other new releases – even rival comedy Arthur – enjoyed increases.The sci-fi thriller Source Code dropped 39% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.1M. Holding up well despite plenty of competition, the Summit release has grossed $28.6M in ten days and looks headed for a $50M finish. Relativity’s action pic Limitless fell by an identical 39% to an estimated $5.7M boosting the impressive cume to $64.4M.The kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules tumbled 51% to an estimated $4.9M giving Fox $45.5M to date. Lionsgate’s The Lincoln Lawyer enjoyed another moderate drop with an estimated $4.6M, off only 33%, for a $46.5M sum rounding out the top ten.New films in limited release did not fare very well over the weekend. The IMAX 3D animal documentary Born To Be Wild debuted in 206 locations and took in an estimated $850,000 for a mild $4,126 average per site. The G-rated pic about orangutans and elephants was narrated by Morgan Freeman. Running only 40 minutes in length, Born played to regular ticket prices despite being an IMAX 3D presentation. Many exhibitors were able to squeeze in seven or eight showtimes per day meaning each showing attracted just 20-25 people. Reviews were terrific across the board. Lionsgate released the Spanish-language romantic comedy No Eres Tu, Soy Yo (It’s Not You, It’s Me) in 226 theaters but averaged a weak $2,655 with its estimated $600,000 take.The top ten films grossed an estimated $101.2M which was down 14% from last year when Clash of the Titans remained in the top spot with $26.6M; and off 17% from 2009 when Hannah Montana The Movie debuted at number one with $32.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Superheroes, service, fresh, Disney, PlayStation, renewed","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Hop-Stays-On-Top"},{"id":"47509130425189","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pirates Attacks With Huge Global Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Pirates Attacks With Huge Global DebutJack gets some nice booty.by Gitesh Pandya | May 22, 2011 |  CommentsJohnny Depp and his jolly pals seized control of the North American box office with the adventure tentpole Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides which registered the year’s biggest opening while internationally the latest Captain Jack saga commanded much more power smashing records with the largest overseas opening of all-time. Most holdovers suffered large drops, however the hit comedy Bridesmaids took advantage of sensational buzz to post a fantastic hold putting it on track to break the $100M mark.&nbsp;Disney scored its first number one hit of the year with the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series which opened with an estimated $90.1M from an ultrawide launch in 4,155 theaters for a mighty $21,685 average. The PG-13 pic was the first in the franchise to be presented in 3D and the grosses were also helped by a record launch in 256 IMAX locations which charged as much as $20 per ticket. Opening on the lower end of industry expectations, Tides enjoyed the biggest opening of 2011 beating the $86.2M of last month’s Fast Five which was only in 2D but did include IMAX sales. But moviegoers were cautious with their dollars as less than half of the Tides weekend gross came from 3D screens with more opting for the 2D version.&nbsp;The Tides bow was down 22% from the $114.7M debut of the last installment, At World’s End. But that figure was part of the long Memorial Day holiday session and the film was the cliffhanger finale after 2006’s massively successful Dead Man’s Chest. Widely disliked by many critics and fans, End prompted many moviegoers to skip the new chapter which also featured a new director in Rob Marshall and new cast members Penélope Cruz and Ian McShane while bringing back fan favorites Geoffrey Rush and Depp who stands to collect one of the largest compensation packages in Hollywood history since ticket buyers would not show up without him. Reviews were mostly negative and a moderate B+ CinemaScore grade suggests that the road ahead should be on par with what tentpole sequels normally see.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243451[/rtimage]Starting out the weekend, Friday took in $35M including $4.7M from Thursday night’s post-midnight shows. Saturday dipped by only 8% to $32M – good for a poorly-reviewed fourth chapter of an action series – and Sunday is estimated to drop by only 28% to $23.1M.&nbsp;What Tides lost out on domestically, it more than made up for in international waters which have always been friendly to this franchise. Since attacking its first wave of markets on Wednesday, the new Pirates grossed a stunning $256.3M over five days overseas setting a new all-time record by beating the five-day $236M launch of 2009’s Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. 3D and IMAX certainly helped as did several star-studded red carpet premieres in Cannes, London, Madrid, Munich, and most importantly Moscow. Russia, which is fast becoming one of Hollywood’s most important overseas markets, led all international territories with an eye-popping $28.6M over five days (an all-time industry record) which already is more than what the last Pirates did there during the entire life of its run. Look for more action tentpoles to plan premieres in the Russian capital.&nbsp;Another emerging market that was red hot was China where Tides opened to a robust $20M in three days which again is already better than the local lifetime take of the last Pirates which co-starred Chow Yun-Fat. Russia and China delivered the top two overseas openings for Tides beating out the usual big three – Japan, Germany, and the U.K. – which contributed $18-20M each during their respective debut periods. Significant film industry growth in Russia and China since 2007 when the last Captain Jack flick opened is now being taken advantage of.&nbsp;Globally, Tides hauled in a massive $346.4M since Wednesday making it the fourth largest worldwide launch of any film behind Half-Blood Prince ($394M) and the 2007 threequels Spider-Man 3 ($381.6M), and At World’s End ($357.2M). It should be noted that these figures include openings on different days in different countries so they are not for the exact same time periods.&nbsp;Clearly, Disney was looking at the world and not specifically the U.S. when developing and marketing On Stranger Tides. The first three Pirates saw an increasing share of the global gross come from overseas from the 53% of Curse of the Black Pearl, to the 60% of Dead Man’s Chest, to the 68% of At World’s End. Tides, which cost a reported $250M to produce, will likely see more than 70% of its worldwide haul come from outside North America and another global tally north of $900M could certainly result.&nbsp;The wedding comedy Bridesmaids officially became a sleeper hit thanks to its incredible second weekend hold. Kristin Wiig’s raunchy R-rated pic dipped by only 20% and collected an estimated $21.1M lifting Universal’s ten-day tally to a robust $59.5M. The sophomore gross was more than what most expected from the first weekend. The decline was less than those seen by past leggy R-rated comedies like Wedding Crashers (24%), The 40-Year-Old Virgin (24%), and The Hangover (27%). Instead, the Bridesmaids drop was identical to the decline seen by 2003’s Old School which made 49% of its overall total in the first ten days, though it was earlier in the year when college students were in school during weekdays. The Wiig pic has the benefit of having a major holiday next weekend so it could be on course to finish with at least $125M giving Universal its third $100M+ grosser in two months after Hop and Fast Five.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243449[/rtimage]Rival action films fell sharply against Pirates which stole away numerous 3D and IMAX screens. Paramount’s Thor dropped 55% in its third frame to an estimated $15.5M giving the super hero saga $145.4M in 17 days. The street racing sequel Fast Five raced past the $500M worldwide mark this weekend thanks to terrific business overseas. Domestically, the Universal hit grossed an estimated $10.6M, down 48%, pushing the 24-day sum to $186.2M. Overseas markets kicked in an additional $25M this weekend putting the offshore tally at $320M bumping the global gross to a stellar $506.2M.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243448[/rtimage]Finishing in fifth was the 3D toon Rio with an estimated $4.7M, down 44%, for a $131.6M total for Fox. Sony’s supernatural thriller Priest collapsed in its second weekend tumbling 69% to an estimated $4.6M giving the vampire pic $23.7M in ten days. A $30M final seems likely.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243447[/rtimage]A two-pack of wedding comedies followed. Off 48%, Jumping the Broom grossed an estimated $3.7M for Sony while Something Borrowed fell 50% for Warner Bros. Totals are nearly identical after 17 days standing at $31.3M and $31.4M, respectively.&nbsp;The Fox romance Water for Elephants placed ninth with an estimated $2.2M, down 49%, giving the Reese Witherspoon film $52.4M to date. Rounding out the top ten was Lionsgate’s comedy Madea’s Big Happy Family which dropped 55% to an estimated $1M for $51.8M overall.&nbsp;Making a spectacular debut in platform release was Woody Allen’s latest romantic comedy Midnight in Paris which opened in the number twelve spot nationwide despite playing in only six theaters. The Sony Classics release collected an estimated $579,000 for a jaw-dropping average of $96,500. Starring Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, and Adrien Brody, the PG-13 film opened only in four New York houses and a pair of Los Angeles sites and earned glowing reviews from critics. All theaters had multiple screens offering up to 20 showtimes daily. Midnight expands to 29 more theaters on Friday for the holiday weekend including markets such as San Francisco, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston, and Washington D.C.&nbsp;[rtimage]siteImageId=10243450[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $156.8M which was up 11% from last year when Shrek Forever After opened in the top spot with $70.8M; but down 7% from 2009 when Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian debuted at number one with $54.2M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the Memorial Day holiday session.&nbsp;Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"OWN, BAFTA, canceled, Cannes, award, fast, worst, Universal, show, emmy, Western, streaming, hispanic, globes, target","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"box-office-guru-wrapup-pirates-attacks-with-huge-global-debut"},{"id":"47509132354425","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Narnia Leads Lackluster Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Narnia Leads Lackluster WeekendAlso, The Tourist nabs #2, and Black Swan opens wide.by Gitesh Pandya | December 13, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, two big-budget new releases topped the North American box office but moviegoers were not too enthusiastic about either one. Debuting at number one was the fantasy sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader while the Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie spy flick The Tourist opened in second place. The overall marketplace remained sluggish as ticket buyers continued to wait for that one blockbuster that truly excites them.The third installment in the Narnia franchise opened at number one with an estimated $24.5M but failed to reach even half of the debut weekend grosses of its two predecessors. Released by Fox and presented in 3D, the new chapter averaged $6,892 from 3,555 locations. Openings for the first two 2D films, which were distributed by Disney, were $65.6M for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from this same weekend in 2005 and $55M for Prince Caspian from May 2008. Dawn Treader even opened below the $25.8M of 2007’s The Golden Compass, another effects-heavy fantasy adventure debuting in early December. That pic failed to triple its opening weekend and ended its domestic run with $70.1M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239211[/rtimage]December films tend to have better legs than those released in the other eleven months since holiday shopping makes moviegoing a lower priority earlier in the month and the Christmas holidays boost attendance in the final week. But sequels and films with built-in audiences tend to have weaker legs. Fox reported that the audience for Dawn Treader was broad with 51% being female and 52% being under 25. The CinemaScore was a good A-. Overseas markets saw much better results with an estimated $81M for a healthy global bow of $105.5M. The production cost was an estimated $150M.Opening in second place was the Johnny Depp-Angelina Jolie vehicle The Tourist which collected an estimated $17M from a more narrow release in 2,756 theaters for a similar $6,168 average. Boasting more starpower than what should be allowed by law in Hollywood, the PG-13 pic tells of an American math teacher visiting Venice who is lured into a dangerous world by a seductive British agent. The Sony release earned lackluster reviews and instead was sold on the star wattage of the leads who are undoubtedly among the world’s most popular superstars.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239212[/rtimage]But with a generic story that wasn’t properly explained in the trailers, audiences hesitated. The debut for the $100M-budgeted pic fell a little short of the star-driven spy pic Knight &amp; Day from this past summer which bowed to $20.1M and a $6,501 average on its way to $76.4M. Tourist also debuted with less than half of the $36M that Jolie’s last film Salt opened to in July. A weak B CinemaScore indicates a shaky road ahead. Exit polls showed that the crowd was 55% female and 53% over 30.Rapunzel dropped from first place but the 3D toon Tangled held up well sliding only 33% to an estimated $14.6M in its third weekend. Disney has grossed $115.6M to date with its hit princess pic and the road may lead to about $175M after the holidays.Dropping 50% in its fourth round was the wizard hit Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 which took in an estimated $8.5M lifting the 24-day cume to $257.7M. It was the lowest fourth-weekend gross for any film in the long-lasting franchise despite the fact that it enjoyed the highest ticket prices. The last film Half-Blood Prince did $8.9M in August 2009 while the last holiday season chapter Goblet of Fire managed $10.3M in December 2005 which coincidentally also featured the top spot debut of a Narnia film. The first 24 days accounted for 84% of Goblet‘s $290M total and 89% of Prince’s $302M final. Even with the Christmas and New Year’s holiday boosts around the corner, Deathly Hallows still looks on course to finish its domestic run at or just shy of the $300M mark.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238691[/rtimage]Denzel Washington’s leggy action hit Unstoppable dipped 37% in its fifth frame to an estimated $3.8M with Fox’s sum rising to $74.3M.Fox Searchlight orchestrated a wildly successful expansion of its awards contender Black Swan by widening from 18 to 90 theaters and jumping up to number six. Films with so few theaters almost never get this high on the charts. The Natalie Portman ballet thriller grossed an estimated $3.3M for an incredible $37,022 average becoming only the second film of the last two years to crack the national top ten while playing in less than 100 theaters. Cyrus, the distributor’s indie comedy hit from July, was the other. With more cities to come this Friday, and with Portman likely to score awards and nominations from various industry groups in the days and weeks ahead, look for Swan to remain a major box office force in the long-term. So far, it has beaten the numbers of last December’s Up in the Air which was released in a similar manner over the same weeks with better averages on the first weekend ($80,212 vs $78,763) and second ($37,022 vs $33,255).Sony’s musical Burlesque followed with an estimated $3.2M, down 48%, for a $32.6M tally to date. Fox’s comedy Love and Other Drugs grossed an estimated $3M, down 47%, and put its total at $27.6M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238692[/rtimage]Comedies rounded out the top ten with the Robert Downey Jr. film Due Date taking in an estimated $2.5M, down 38%, for a $94.9M cume and the 3D toon Megamind dropping 49% to an estimated $2.5M raising Paramount’s total to $140.2M.Paramount generated an explosive platform debut for its Oscar hopeful The Fighter starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale which grossed an estimated $320,000 from just four theaters in three markets for a scorching $80,000 average. Based on a true story of half-brothers that were both boxers, the R-rated film played in New York and Los Angeles plus Boston and Lowell, Massachusetts which is where the brothers are from. Reviews have been very positive and Bale is already being touted as the front-runner to win all the Best Supporting Actor trophies this awards season. Rather than expand the film gradually and let word-of-mouth build over time, the studio is quickly going nationwide on Friday into more than 2,200 theaters over a very competitive frame that will see rival films Tron: Legacy, How Do You Know, and Yogi Bear all entering the ring. The Fighter is hoping for some Golden Globe nominations this week as it goes into its wide break.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239213[/rtimage]Disney platformed Miramax’s Helen Mirren-led The Tempest in five theaters and bowed to an estimated $45,000 for a solid $9,000 average. The Julie Taymor-directed film met with weak reviews and expands to 20 locations on Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.9M which was even with last year when The Princess and the Frog expanded nationwide and hit the top spot with $24.2M; but up 6% from 2008 when The Day the Earth Stood Still opened at number one with $30.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"true","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Narnia-Leads-Lackluster-Weekend"},{"id":"47509134074766","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Eclipse Lights Up 4th of July","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Eclipse Lights Up 4th of JulyLast Airbender #2, demonstrates young males still eager to waste parents money.by Gitesh Pandya | July 5, 2010 |  CommentsVampires and werewolves, and a certain mortal gal in between, ruled theIndependence Day holiday frame as The TwilightSaga: Eclipse exploded with a massive top spot debut. Also generatingmuscular results by bringing a property with a large built-in fan base to thebig screen was TheLast Airbender which counter-programmed Bella and company by appealingto boys resulting in a strong finish in the runner-up spot despite some of theyear’s worst reviews. With Toy Story 3 stillattracting large crowds, the overall marketplace swelled delivering spectacularresults to kick off the second half of 2010.Summit’s crown jewel kept getting bigger. Eclipse,the third installment of the lucrative five-film Twilight franchise,debuted to heated anticipation and generated a stunning $161M in ticket sales inits first five days of release from Wednesday to Sunday, according to estimates.The figure consisted of $92M during the week on Wednesday and Thursday and $69Mover the Friday-to-Sunday period. The weekend figure, which matched the debut ofthe first Twilight pic from 2008, was deflated by the mid-week bow whichpushed the intense upfront demand to Wednesday, but the overall extended startis truly remarkable. Summit is estimating another $20M on Monday which is aholiday for many bringing the six-day tally to an estimated $181M which,conveniently, would break the record for the biggest Fourth of July openingedgiing past the $180.1M six-day score of Spider-Man 2 from 2004 when thecalendar was exactly the same. Ticket prices have risen significantly sincethen, though.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Still,the PG-13 Eclipse flexed major muscles with a stellar $68.5M on Wednesdaybecoming the second largest opening day in box office history trailing just the$72.7M Friday of The Twilight Saga: New Moon from last November. Eclipseset a new benchmark as the widest release ever playing in 4,468 locations. Theweekend average hit $15,443. Exit polls showed a broadening of the audience withthe new pic’s crowd being 65% female compared to 80% for New Moon.Eclipse was also the first in the series to play on IMAX screens which helpedout the grosses too. That format has pulled in a remarkable $8.2M to date from193 playdates.Overseas, Eclipse was red hot too with an estimated $100.2M sinceWednesday from 42 territories with major markets like the UK, France, Germany,Japan, and Korea still to come. New Moon grossed $709M worldwide and thisnew saga could beat it.M. Night Shyamalan enjoyed the best opening – and total gross – for any film insix years with the 3D fantasy adventure The Last Airbenderwhich debuted in second place with an estimated $40.7M over theFriday-to-Sunday period. The PG-rated film based on the popular Nickelodeoncartoon series aveaged a sturdy $12,827 from 3,169 locations and has collectedan impressive $58M in its first four days since its Thursday launch. Paramountreported an early five-day estimate of $70M for the extended Thursday-to-Mondaydebut which would put it ahead of the director’s last two films The Happeningand Lady in the Water which grossed $64.5M and $42.3M, respectively.All three share a common trait – they were all panned by critics. Airbender,with a reported production cost of $150M, has been met with the worst reviews ofthe filmmaker’s career, but the target audience of young males came out onopening weekend anyway for the special effects and the franchise’s brand name. Alate-in-the-game upgrade to 3D added to the ticket prices too. Despite whatshould be large declines in the days and weeks ahead, market share leaderParamount should still score its fifth $100M+ grosser of2010.[rtimage]MapID=1213190&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Bumped downto number three over the holiday weekend was Toy Story 3 whichpulled in an estimated $30.2M in its third frame. Down 49%, the Disney/Pixarsensation watched its cume soar to an amazing $289M putting it at number 42 onthe list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $290M of 2005’s HarryPotter and the Goblet of Fire. Toy Story 3 could shatter the $300M mark onMonday after only 18 days and may still reach the $400M barriertoo.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=42&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adam Sandlerand his comedy pals landed in fourth with Grown Ups whichgrossed an estimated $18.5M, down an understandable 54%. The decline was similarto the 52% fall the funnyman’s 1999 hit Big Daddy suffered in its secondweekend when Independence Day also fell on a Sunday. Grown Ups could beheaded for a final tally in the neighborhood of $140M proving that Sandler stillhas what paying audiences want.[rtimage]MapID=1223577&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Onthe other hand, Tom Cruise is learning that moviegoers are losing interest inhim as his latest entry Knight and Dayis turning into one of the lowest-grossing action films of his career. The Foxrelease dropped 49% to an estimated $10.2M this weekend and lifted its 12-daysum to only $45.5M.

With no other movies opening in wide release, most holdovers in the top ten remained strong with three enjoying drops of less than 30%. The top ten generated the best showing over the Halloween or pre-Halloween frame in six years thanks in part to a pair of 3D sequels in the top five charging higher ticket prices.Lionsgate trapped audiences over the pumpkin frame with Saw 3D which opened to an estimated $24.2M from 2,808 locations for a potent $8,618 average. The R-rated torturefest enjoyed a healthy 71% boost over the weak $14.1M bow of last October’s Saw VI which was crushed by competition from the first Paranormal Activity movie. The new Jigsaw flick was slotted into the calendar a week after Paranormal Activity 2 so it would have less competition. Saw 3D’s debut was well below the $40.7M launch of the latest Activity.As one of the most popular fright franchises of all time, Saw 3D supposedly marks the end of the series. Being the so-called “final chapter” was a key part of the marketing campaign as was the extra dimension. First shows for the seven-quel began on Thursday at 8:00pm, but Lionsgate chose to bundle those ticket sales into the Friday figure which was $10.7M which included $1.7M from Thursday night. But the Thursday night take cannot be fully removed from the Friday figure since it includes shows from 12:01am onwards which are considered part of Friday. Saturday fell a sharp 26% to $7.9M while Halloween Sunday is estimated to drop by 30% to $5.6M. Saw 3D was not screened for the press ahead of time, but critics that reviewed it upon release slammed the film with some of the worst reviews of the series.Following its terrifying top spot debut last week, the supernatural sequel Paranormal Activity 2 tumbled 59% to an estimated $16.8M claiming the second spot over Halloween weekend. Paramount’s ten-day total stands at $65.7M and a final gross of $80-85M looks possible. Though the new demon flick won’t match the $107.9M of last year’s first Paranormal, it will still end up extremely profitable thanks to a slim $3M production cost. Marketing expenses were extra. The thriller’s sophomore drop is in line with how horror sequels perform, especially when another fright flick enters the marketplace.Holding steady in third place was the action-comedy Red starring Bruce Willis and Morgan Freeman with an estimated $10.8M in its third weekend. The Summit release slipped only 28% thanks to great word-of-mouth and has taken in a strong $58.9M in 17 days. At its current pace, a final tally of $80-90M seems likely.Paramount’s hit sequel Jackass 3D broke through the $100M mark this weekend with the help of 3D surcharges. Johnny Knoxville and pals took in an estimated $8.4M, down 61%, and boosted the cume to $101.6M after just 17 days. Produced for under $20M, Jackass has easily beaten the $64.3M and $72.8M final totals of the first two films in the series. All three have sold roughly 11 million tickets, though the new pic’s admissions figure is still rising.Clint Eastwood isn’t seeing the kind of audience love he normally gets for his latest film Hereafter which fell 47% to an estimated $6.3M for a total of $22.2M to date. The director often enjoys strong legs for his films but his latest is not getting strong word-of-mouth and Matt Damon’s name is doing little to bolster the numbers. A disappointing $35-40M final seems likely for Warner Bros.On the other hand, Disney’s feel-good horse movie Secretariat continues to show exceptional legs thanks to positive buzz and little direct competition. The Diane Lane starrer slipped only 28% in its fourth lap to an estimated $5.1M raising the total to $44.8M.The David Fincher hit The Social Network followed with an estimated $4.7M, off 35%, for a $79.7M cume for Sony. The comedy Life As We Know It declined by 35% to an estimated $4M and lifted its cume to $43.5M.Warner Bros. stablemate The Town made off with an estimated $2M in its seventh weekend dropping only 29% for a $87.6M total to date. Jumping into the top ten for the first time was Hilary Swank’s legal drama Conviction which expanded in its third weekend from 55 to 565 theaters grossing an estimated $1.8M. The Fox Searchlight film averaged a mild $3,230 and has collected $2.4M thus far.Opening with decent but not stellar numbers in limited release was the Swedish film The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest which bowed to an estimated $915,000 from 153 theaters for a moderate $5,980 average. The third installment in the acclaimed Millennium trilogy enjoyed a wider North American launch than its predecessors. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo debuted in 34 sites in March while the first sequel The Girl Who Played With Fire debuted in 110 locations. Reviews were mixed for Hornet’s Nest.The top ten films grossed an estimated $83.8M which was up 8% from last year when This Is It opened in the top spot with $23.2M; and up 21% from 2008 when High School Musical 3: Senior Year stayed at number one for a second weekend with $15.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"toy, dramedy, E!, movie, 2019, versus, rt, universal, Larson, Britbox, Paramount","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Saw-3D-Traps-The-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509132373885","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Seizes #1 Spot Over Busy Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Megamind Seizes #1 Spot Over Busy WeekendDue Date and Colored Girls deliver.by Gitesh Pandya | November 8, 2010 |  CommentsThe holiday movie season started off with a bang as three new releases pumpedin over $100M in ticket sales allowing the top ten to surge to its highest levelsince July. Leading the charge was the animated comedy Megamind whichdidn’t have a mega opening, but still delivered a solid debut at number one.Premiering in second place with strength was the R-rated comedy Due Date while theTyler Perry film For Colored Girls enjoyed a sturdy debut of its own in third place.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238235[/rtimage]DreamWorks Animation scored its third number one 3D hit of the year with the Will Ferrellvehicle Megamindwhich bowed to an estimated $47.7M from 3,944 locations for a strong $12,082average. The PG-rated film earned generally good reviews and played to a broadaudience of families and young adults. Tina Fey andBrad Pittalso lent their voices to the tale of a supervillain who discovers how to be agood guy. The opening was only slightly better than the $43.7M debut of thestudio’s March release HowTo Train Your Dragon, which had less star wattage but much betterreviews, and well below the $59.3M of its 2009 offering Monsters vs.Aliens. All were 3D toons that took advantage of higher ticket pricesalthough Megamind arguably had the most starpower. The company’s Shrek Forever Afterdebuted to $70.8M in May, however it was a franchise film with a built-inaudience.Even older non-sequel Pixar films launching on the first weekend of November didbetter than Megamind like the $70.5M of 2004’s The Incrediblesand the $62.6M for 2001’s Monsters Inc.Ticket prices were much less back then and they didn’t benefit from 3Dsurcharges. In fact looking at admissions, the superhero toon Incrediblessold twice as many tickets on opening weekend than the blue supervillain.Paramount and DreamWorks invested heavily into the film’s extensive marketingcampaign but the long-term picture does look bright. 3D toons tend to have goodlegs and play amazingly well overseas and having Brad Pitt involved certainlywill give a boost around the world. A final global gross in the area of $500M ormore is certainly possible.Those looking for more racy laughs lined up for the R-rated road trip comedy Due Date whichdebuted in second place with terrific results grossing an estimated $33.5M.Playing in 3,355 sites, the Warner Bros. release starring RobertDowney Jr. and ZachGalifianakis averaged a muscular $9,985 per location. Reviews were nottoo upbeat and certainly did not match those for director ToddPhillips‘ last film The Hangoverwhich enjoyed a bigger debut with $45M in June 2009. Starpower and a priceymarketing tab helped to open Due Date, but word-of-mouth will decide thefate from here on out.[rtimage]siteImageId=10238234[/rtimage]Tyler Perryventured into new territory by directing someone else’s story and making anR-rated film with For Colored Girls which debuted in third place with an estimated $20.1M.The Lionsgate release averaged a stellar $9,450 from 2,127 locations and likethe filmmaker’s prior work played heavily to black adult women. According tostudio data, 82% of the crowd was female, 87% was over 25, and 81% was AfricanAmerican. Based on the popular play, Girls covered disturbing subjectmatter but brought out a large targeted audience thanks to the brand names ofthe director and the play, plus starpower from cast members likeJanet Jackson,Thandie Newton,PhyliciaRashad, andWhoopiGoldberg. The gross was just somewhat below the $23.4M bow of Perry’s lastfall release I Can DoBad All By Myself from last year.Leading all the holdovers was the four-week-old geezer action hit Red which slipped only18% to an estimated $8.9M boosting the cume to a sturdy $71.9M. The Summitrelease now looks to have a shot at breaking the $100M mark. Tumbling 66% in itssecond weekend was the horror sequel Saw 3D which fell fromfirst to fifth with an estimated $8.2M. Recent installments have generated about80% of their totals in the first ten days so with $38.8M in the bank so far, theLionsgate fright flick should finish with just under $50M making it thesecond-lowest-grossing film in the seven-part series ahead of just last year’sSaw VI.Rival horror sequel ParanormalActivity 2 suffered a big loss of its own declining by 56% in its thirdsession to an estimated $7.3M. Paramount has scared up $77.2M to date. Studiostablemate Jackass 3Ddropped by only 40% to an estimated $5.1M putting the total for this fall’stop-grossing blockbuster at $110.8M.Two older-skewing dramas tied for eighth place with estimates of $4M each.Clint Eastwood‘sHereafterslipped by 37% while the Disney sports drama Secretariat easedby just 20%. Cumes stand at $28.7M and $51M, respectively. Sony rounded out thetop ten with its acclaimed Facebook film The Social Networkwhich grossed an estimated $3.6M, off a slim 20%, for a $85M sum.Opening to an avalanche of business in just four theaters was the mountainclimber drama 127 Hourswhich bowed to an estimated $266,000 for a sizzling $66,481 average per locationplaying exclusively in New York and Los Angeles. Directed by Oscar winnerDanny Boyle (SlumdogMillionaire, Trainspotting),the R-rated film starring James Francoin the true story of a young man’s remarkable survival story while trapped alonein a canyon earned rave reviews across the board and generated industry buzzearlier this fall screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.

The comedy The Dilemma anchored by a different dynamic duo — Vince Vaughn and Kevin James — debuted in second place with not-so-impressive numbers. Awards contenders rounded out the top five with each posting solid results.Driving into the number one spot with an estimated $40M over the Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend was The Green Hornet starring Seth Rogen as the crime-fighting anti-hero with a supercharged sense of humor. The 3D action flick opened very wide in 3,584 theaters and averaged a commendable $11,161 per site over four days with 3D surcharges helping along the way. If estimates hold for the PG-13 pic, that would be the second best MLK debut ever trailing the $46.1M four-day tally of Cloverfield from 2008. Should the estimate prove to be too aggressive, it may fall to third behind the studio’s own Paul Blart: Mall Cop which bowed to $39.2M two years ago.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239899[/rtimage]Regardless of where it ends up ranking, Hornet successfully connected with its target audience of young males. According to studio research, 61% of the crowd was male. Appeal was broad across different age groups with 50% being under 25. Reviews were mixed and the CinemaScore grades were a good B+ overall and an encouraging A- for under 25 patrons.Hornet‘s opening was still below the numbers posted by other expensive super hero films released in the early part of the year. 2007’s Ghost Rider bowed to $52M over four days while 2003’s Daredevil debuted to $45M across four days as well. Both were February titles launched over Presidents Day weekend and had lower ticket prices and no 3D surcharges. However, they also came from the pages of Marvel comic books and had larger built-in audiences. Studios often use the first quarter of the year to launch super hero films that are not strong enough to compete with the big boys of summer.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239900[/rtimage]A whopping 69% of the weekend gross came from 3D screens which were offered in 2,704 playdates including 174 IMAX 3D sites. Outside of TRON: Legacy, there have been no major action movies for teens and young adults to be excited about over the past month so Hornet took advantage of an audience that was underserved. Super hero films usually burn out fast at the box office so Sony is trying to take in as much cash as it can upfront for the pricey movie which carries a production cost of at least $100M. With French director Michel Gondry at the helm and Asian star Jay Chou in the sidekick role, Hornet hopes to earn significant amounts around the world where action movies sell very well.Vince Vaughn and Kevin James saw a mediocre start to their new comedy The Dilemma which debuted in second with an estimated four-day take of $20.7M from 2,940 theaters for a moderate $7,041 average. The PG-13 film about a man who learns of his best friend’s wife’s infidelity also starred Winona Ryder, Jennifer Connelly, Channing Tatum, and Queen Latifah and was directed by Ron Howard who has been away from the comedy genre for over a decade. Over the Friday-to-Sunday period, Universal’s gross was estimated to be $17.4M. The debut was well below the opening weekend figures of Vaughn’s recent efforts like Four Christmases ($31.1M), Couples Retreat ($34.3M), and The Break-Up ($39.2M). It also did not come close to the $32.5M four-day gross of 2004’s Along Came Polly starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston which was another relationship comedy launching over MLK weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239901[/rtimage]Budgeted at a hefty $70M with big paychecks for all the actors, The Dilemma played as expected to an adult crowd that skewed more towards women. Studio research showed that 60% of the audience was female and 58% was 30 and older. Reviews were bad and moviegoers felt mostly the same way as the CinemaScore grade was a disappointing B. Trailers and TV spots were unfunny leading many fans of the stars to skip this one. Vaughn has been able to sell tickets despite being slammed by critics before, but the magic didn’t work this time. Plus an abundance of critically-acclaimed awards contenders playing to adults provided plenty of stronger alternatives.The hit Western True Grit dropped from the top spot but still held up well slipping to an estimated $13.1M over four days boosting the total to $128.3M. Paramount’s acclaimed drama has now entered the Top 20 list of 2010’s highest-grossing releases and should have much more to collect in the weeks ahead.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239746[/rtimage]Colin Firth’s The King’s Speech finally expanded into wide national play with its expansion this weekend from 700 to 1,543 locations which resulted in an estimated $11.2M over the extended Friday-to-Monday span. Ranking fourth for the frame, the Weinstein Co. release averaged a solid $7,247 in its eighth frame and has banked $46.7M to date. The distributor patiently waited out the holidays and chose Golden Globes weekend to expand fully in hopes of capitalizing on awards buzz. Plus it will be a newer film in many markets when Oscar nominations are announced next week. Another expanding awards contender followed as Black Swan grossed an estimated $10.4M over four days with its $8.4M three-day score inching ahead of its Friday-to-Sunday gross from last weekend. Fox Searchlight widened the ballet thriller from 1,584 to 2,328 sites and has taken in an impressive $75.2M so far.Universal’s comedy threequel Little Fockers took in an estimated $8.4M in its fourth round for a $135.5M cume. Holding up well over the school holiday was Yogi Bear which grabbed an estimated $7.4M raising the sum for Warner Bros. to $84.2M. The kidpic has now grossed over five times its opening weekend take and may finish just below the $100M mark. The sci-fi reboot TRON: Legacy followed with an estimated $6.8M boosting the tally to $158.1M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10239417[/rtimage]Dropping slightly was the acclaimed boxing drama The Fighter with an estimated $6.2M giving Paramount $66.8M thus far. Disney’s Tangled charmed up an estimated $5.5M and has taken in $182.5M to date. Nicolas Cage’s latest action offering Season of the Witch tumbled in its second weekend grossing an estimated $5.3M for a 11-day tally of just $18.8M. Luckily for Relativity, the production cost was just $40M. A final domestic gross of about $25M seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.6M over four days which was down a sharp 29% from last year when Avatar stayed in the top spot with $54.4M; and down 30% from 2009 when Paul Blart: Mall Cop opened at number one with $39.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Star, Valentine's, Reality, york, Mindy, Worst, thriller, disaster, Film, ABC, latino, renewals","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Green-Hornet-Buzzes-To-The-Top"},{"id":"47509132324723","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Roommate Moves To The Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Roommate Moves To The TopSanctum and No Strings Attached round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | February 7, 2011 |  CommentsWith the Packers and Steelers squaring off in the Super Bowl, moviegoers avoided the multiplexes as the North American box office slumped to the third worst frame of the past two years. Of the two new releases that dared to compete against football, the collegiate thriller The Roommate fared well opening at number one by targeting young females but the older-skewing 3D action film Sanctum debuted poorly in second. The NFL championship game always commands the attention of the entire nation but this weekend’s Top 20 plunged to just $84.2M falling well below recent Super Bowl sessions from the past three years.Teenage girls and young women, the demographic least affected by football, turned out in solid numbers for the college-set thriller The Roommate which debuted at number one with an estimated $15.6M. The PG-13 film about a freshman gal with a creepy obsession with her new living partner averaged a good $6,156 from 2,534 theaters and marked Sony’s eighth film over the past eleven years to bow on top over Super Bowl weekend. Most were suspense thrillers from the studio’s Screen Gems unit like Roommate which play to this dependable audience.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240435[/rtimage]Produced for just $16M, The Roommate drew in its target audience with a relatable storyline and starpower from TV stars Leighton Meester (Gossip Girl) and Minka Kelly (Friday Night Lights). Studio research showed that 65% of the crowd was female and 61% was under 21. A targeted marketing campaign made sure that too much wasn’t spent on other demographic groups that would never come out anyway. Moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the pic a weak B- average grade.The underwater survival actioner Sanctum sank in its opening weekend grossing just $9.2M, according to estimates, despite playing very wide in 2,787 locations including over 2,000 3D screens and 178 IMAX venues. Averaging a weak $3,310, the R-rated film failed to spark much interest with ticket buyers despite being heavily promoted as a project from James Cameron who was one of the executive producers. In fact, Sanctum opened just below the $9.3M debut of the Oscar-winning director’s 1989 underwater adventure The Abyss which had significantly lower ticket prices, no 3D surcharges, and 1,200 fewer theaters.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240436[/rtimage]Universal and Relativity Media paid only $12M to acquire distribution rights (and paid for marketing) so the $30M-budgeted Sanctum should not turn into too problematic of a title financially. IMAX screens accounted for 17% of the gross, but overall moviegoers showed that paying a premium for this particular film was not worth it. The aquatic actioner suffered one of the worst openings for a live-action 3D film during the format’s current era and was about even with the two-day $6.3M bow of Gulliver’s Travels this past Christmas. According to studio research, females made up 53% of the audience and 65% was 30 and over so the film skewed much older than other titles. A poor C+ CinemaScore grade indicates a quick fade in the weeks to come. Reviews were mostly lackluster. Overseas, Sanctum debuted in second place in Australia with $1.6M and in fifth place in the U.K. with $1.5M.With only one new release generating good results and most holdovers fading away, the Top 20 suffered troubling declines compared to recent Super Bowl weekends – 23% vs. 2010, 29% vs 2009, and 30% vs. 2008. The aftermath of last week’s massive blizzard also played a role as people in many top markets in the Midwest and Northeast were still digging themselves out of the latest round of winter snow.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240049[/rtimage]The Natalie Portman-Ashton Kutcher romantic comedy No Strings Attached remained a popular item with audiences sliding only 37% in its third session to an estimated $8.4M. Paramount’s sex comedy has laughed up an impressive $51.8M in 17 days and is playing as effective counter-programming for women against all the football hoopla.Stepping closer to the $100M mark, Oscar front-runner The King’s Speech ranked fourth with an estimated $8.3M enjoying the smallest drop in the top ten with its 25% dip. The Weinstein Co. has reached $84.1M and will join the century club before the February 27 awards.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240050[/rtimage]The Green Hornet fell 46% to an estimated $6.1M placing fifth for the weekend giving Sony $87.2M to date for 2011’s top-grossing new release. Last week’s top performer The Rite suffered the worst drop of any film plunging 62% to an estimated $5.6M in its sophomore scare. Bad buzz and competition from a new fright flick contributed to the steep tumble. Warner Bros. has grossed $23.7M for its Anthony Hopkins supernatural thriller and should end up with $30-35M.Jason Statham’s latest action platform The Mechanic plunged 53% to an estimated $5.4M in its second weekend. The CBS Films release has grossed $20.1M in ten days and should end with about $30M. Jumping the $150M mark this past week was Oscar contender True Grit which took in an estimated $4.8M, down 37%, for a cume to date of $155M for Paramount. Along with TRON: Legacy, Jeff Bridges has raked in a stellar $324M this winter from his pair of blockbuster hits.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240052[/rtimage]Dropping 39% to ninth place was Vince Vaughn’s comedy The Dilemma with an estimated $3.4M bumping the total to $45.7M for Universal.

Still, his comedy Just Go With It and the 3D concert flick Justin Bieber: Never Say Never each pulled in over $30M and were joined by the 3D animated film Gnomeo &amp; Juliet which exceeded expectations to power the marketplace to its best showing of 2011.Adam Sandler’s latest comedy Just Go With It didn’t soar to the heights of his summer offerings, but it delivered a sturdy debut nonetheless with an estimated $31M. Sony’s latest PG-13 vehicle from one of the industry’s most bankable stars averaged a sturdy $8,737 from a very wide 3,548 sites. Dennis Dugan directed his sixth Sandler vehicle and Jennifer Aniston co-starred in the story of a single doctor who must stretch a lie about being married with kids to extreme levels. As with most Sandman projects, critics piled on the insults.Just Go debuted well behind the $40.5M of the comedian’s last film Grown Ups but beat out the $22.7M of his previous offering, the R-rated Funny People. Non-summer debuts for Sandler in years past have been better like the $42.2M for Anger Management from April 2003 and the $39.9M for 50 First Dates from Valentine’s Day weekend in 2004. Just Go played to an older adult crowd with 60% of the audience being over 25 and 58% being female. The film’s budget was about $80M which on par with other comedies starring top A-list talent. It was the eleventh number one hit for Sandler who has been a consistent draw at the box office with $100M hits in 10 of the last 13 years.If estimates hold, teen pop sensation Justin Bieber will narrowly miss out on a number one opening with his 3D concert biopic Justin Bieber: Never Say Never which debuted impressively with an estimated $30.3M this weekend. Powered by his tween girl fan base, and their moms, the G-rated film averaged a stellar $9,746 from 3,105 theaters playing in 443 fewer locations than Sandler’s pic. A very high 84% of the gross came from 3D screens which included extra surcharges. Including $743,000 in sales from special Wednesday night previews held in selected cities, the total stands at $31M. Ticket packages for those shows were sold at $30 and included fan merchandise too so Paramount only counted a portion of that towards the box office gross.Budgeted at a mere $13M, Never Say Never tells the story of how a young Canadian kid turned himself into an internet sensation and then a multi-platinum superstar in just a couple of years. The audience was exactly as expected with females making up 84% of the crowd and 67% being under 25. Reviews were the best among the weekend’s four new releases and audiences liked what they got as the CinemaScore grade was a solid A. Despite the high score, sales are likely to decline fast as they generally do with movies that tap into intense fan demand. But with Valentine’s Day Monday expected to be a strong day and next weekend’s Presidents’ Day holiday frame, Never Say Never will certainly end up being a very profitable venture.Breaking down the days, Friday saw an easy Bieber victory with $12.4M compared to Just Go With It‘s $9.6M. The films swapped positions on Saturday with Sandler surging 41% to $13.5M and the teen singer dropping 13% to $10.8M. Sony is projecting a 41% decline on Sunday to $8M for Just while Paramount is estimating a 35% dip to $7M for Justin.Disney scored a solid debut for its 3D animated comedy Gnomeo &amp; Juliet which bowed to an estimated $25.5M by playing to families that have had very few good options this year. The G-rated pic about two feuding groups of garden gnomes set to the classic Shakespeare tale averaged a healthy $8,517 from 2,994 locations. Reviews were mixed but generally decent for what has become the biggest toon opening in February ever. With the Presidents’ Day holiday next week and many schools taking winter breaks this month, the road ahead seems bright and a run to the $100M mark cannot be ruled out.Opening to disappointing results in fourth was Channing Tatum’s historical epic The Eagle which grossed an estimated $8.6M from 2,296 theaters for a soft $3,741 average. The PG-13 film came nowhere near the $30.5M bow of the actor’s hit drama from last year Dear John and even fell below the $11M of his action film Fighting from April 2009. Reviews for Eagle were not too kind.Last weekend’s number one film The Roommate fell down to fifth place but fared well given all the competition dropping 44% to an estimated $8.4M. With $26M in ten days, Sony’s $16M-budgeted thriller should finish with $35-40M.Two weeks away from what The Weinstein Co. hopes will be the biggest night in the young company’s history, The King’s Speech remained popular with moviegoers dipping a mere 4% to an estimated $7.4M in its twelfth weekend. With ticket buyers continuing to catch up with what is the most likely film to win the Best Picture Oscar, the Colin Firth hit has raised its cume to $93.9M and should reach $100M before Presidents’ Day. It also swept the BAFTAs winning seven awards including Best Film.Natalie Portman’s golden touch helped her sex comedy No Strings Attached which slipped only 30% to an estimated $5.6M giving Paramount $59.9M to date. Universal’s 3D underwater adventure Sanctum tumbled 46% to an estimated $5.1M in its second weekend. With just $17.5M in ten days, the James Cameron pet project should finish with a disappointing $27-30M putting it at around half of the $54.2M of 1989’s The Abyss.The blockbuster Western True Grit grossed an estimated $3.8M, down 19%, putting Paramount’s sum at $160.3M. Sony’s super hero flick The Green Hornet followed falling 40% to an estimated $3.6M and $92.3M overall. With $107.2M overseas, the Seth Rogen film will jump the $200M global mark on Monday.In limited release, the indie comedy Cedar Rapids debuted to an estimated $311,000 from just 15 theaters for a solid $20,733 average for Fox Searchlight.The top ten films grossed an estimated $129.3M which was down 29% from last year when Valentine’s Day opened in the top spot with $56.3M; and down 15% from 2009 when Friday the 13th debuted at number one with $40.6M. However, both of those frames were during the lucrative Presidents’ Day holiday session.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!twitter.com/giteshpandya","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Rom-Com, 71st, Calendar","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Sandler-Beats-Bieber"},{"id":"47509132333941","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Strings Attached Wins Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: No Strings Attached Wins WeekendPlus, The Way Back fails to crack the top ten.by Gitesh Pandya | January 24, 2011 |  CommentsThis weekend, Hollywood’s current princess Natalie Portman reigned supreme over the North American box office as her new comedy No Strings Attached debuted at number one giving the Black Swan actress two films in the top ten a week after her big Golden Globe win. With no other films opening in wide release, most holdovers fared well with awards contenders enjoying the best legs thanks to strong word-of-mouth and buzz. But overall, the marketplace remained in poor shape falling below last year’s levels for the eleventh consecutive weekend.Audiences came out in healthy numbers for the sex comedy No Strings Attached spending an estimated $20.3M on its opening weekend. The R-rated film starring Portman and Ashton Kutcher about a couple that tries to have a sex-only relationship played heavily to young adult women. The debut was slightly better than the openings for R-rated non-summer comedies like I Love You, Man ($17.8M) and Forgetting Sarah Marshall ($17.7M) and matched the $20.2M bow of Kutcher’s PG-13 summer comedy What Happens in Vegas co-starring Cameron Diaz. That film went on to reach $80.3M. Portman has only opened one other film at number one while in the lead role – V For Vendetta which bowed to $25.6M in March 2006.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240049[/rtimage]According to studio research, women made up a whopping 70% of the audience while 60% were over 25. Critics gave mixed reviews and audiences felt the same as Strings scored a not-so-impressive B CinemaScore grade. Starpower and a lack of exciting films aimed at young women right now helped the top spot performance. Produced for just $25M, the Paramount release may come close to tripling that amount in its final domestic tally. Female-skewing comedies are often programmed into January as an alternative option for older teen girls and young women during a time when the football playoffs are taking lots of men out of the picture. Sunday’s games are expected to have a big impact on the multiplexes, especially in the Northeast and Midwest where the four Super Bowl-hopeful teams are from.Last week’s top film The Green Hornet fell to second and experienced a decent hold for the superhero genre falling 46% to an estimated $18.1M. Sony has collected $63.4M in ten days for its Seth Rogen action comedy and may find its way to just over the $100M mark domestically. Overseas, the 3D pic grossed an estimated $18.7M thanks to some new countries opening upping the international take to $37.4M and the global gross to $100.8M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240050[/rtimage]Universal suffered a larger-than-hoped-for drop for its Vince Vaughn-Kevin James buddy comedy The Dilemma which fell 45% to an estimated $9.7M for a ten-day total of $33.4M. Upon opening last weekend to a soft $17.8M, the studio was comparing the Ron Howard-directed film to adult comedies like Something’s Gotta Give and As Good As It Gets which had sophomore declines of 29% and 3% respectively. Budgeted at $70M, The Dilemma may end its run with about $60M.Awards contenders all hoping for Best Picture nominations on Tuesday from the Academy followed with each showing sturdy legs. The King’s Speech, which surprised the industry Saturday by upsetting The Social Network for the prestigious PGA prize, grossed an estimated $9.2M matching its performance from last weekend. With no decline and another frame in the number four slot, the Colin Firth-Geoffrey Rush period drama pushed its cume up to $58.6M and is now on track to jump the $100M mark if it can land the wide range of Oscar nods it’s expected to get.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240051[/rtimage]The Weinstein Co. projected an aggressive estimate projecting a slim 20% Saturday-to-Sunday drop when other adult dramas were forecasting 40-50%. Speech is hoping to be a strong upscale alternative to football on Sunday but even a final take of under $9M would keep it in fourth place. The royal drama is following a strategy similar to Million Dollar Baby by waiting until later in the race to expand nationally and become a bigger part of the Oscar conversation thus making it a fresher film to vote for over an overexposed front-runner. The King’s Speech wants to do to The Social Network what the Clint Eastwood pic did to The Aviator six years ago.Western powerhouse True Grit placed fifth with an estimated $8M, off only 27%, upping Paramount’s take to $138.6M. Natalie Portman popped up again with her second film in the top ten with the red hot Black Swan which took in an estimated $6.2M in its eighth round. Off just 26%, the Fox Searchlight film has banked $83.6M thus far. Paramount’s brother tale The Fighter, which won both supporting acting Golden Globes last weekend, dipped a mere 12% to an estimated $4.5M and has punched up a solid $73M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240052[/rtimage]The King’s Speech and Black Swan are both on course to join True Grit in the $100M+ club and Fighter could break in too proving that quality adult dramas can sell tons of tickets, especially during awards season. The quartet of acclaimed films has already grossed a combined $354M and will probably reach $475M or more. The combined production costs for the four hits is under $100M. Best Picture nominations will open the doors to more moviegoers curious to see the year’s best films so expect these titles to stick around for a while. And with very few exciting new releases scheduled between now and Oscar night, there is plenty of mileage left.Christmas leftovers rounded out the top ten. Universal’s comedy Little Fockers fell 39% to an estimated $4.4M raising the cume to $141.2M. Despite today’s higher ticket prices, the third pic in the series will end as the lowest-grossing installment finishing below the $166.2M of 2000’s Meet the Parents and well below the $279.2M of 2004’s Meet the Fockers.[rtimage]siteImageId=10240053[/rtimage]Warner Bros. enjoyed another good hold from Yogi Bear which grossed an estimated $4.1M, off 24%, for a $88.9M total. A lack of competing kidpics is helping the 3D pic head towards $100M. TRON: Legacy did well too slipping 35% to an estimated $3.7M for an impressive $163.3M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $88.2M which was down a troubling 27% from last year when Avatar stayed in the top spot with $34.9M; and down 26% from 2009 when Paul Blart: Mall Cop remained at number one with $21.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Crunchyroll, tv, CW, TV, thirty, WGN, movie, game, killer, Nat, renewed, SXSW, Christmas, 20th","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-No-Strings-Attached-Wins-Weekend"},{"id":"47509134073741","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences show love for Despicable Me","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences show love for Despicable MePlus, Twilight holds on at #2, and Predators knocks Toy Story down to fourth.by Gitesh Pandya | July 12, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers flooded the multiplexes spending plenty of cash on a variety of movies led by the better-than-expected opening for the 3D animated comedy Despicable Me which easily took control of the number one spot. The sci-fi action pic Predators also debuted well taking third place while most holdovers showed considerable strength suffering only small declines. The top ten surged to its second best showing of the year with a powerful $191M in ticket sales.Steve Carell’s evil plan for world domination worked as his new toon Despicable Me hauled in an estimated $60.1M this weekend from 3,476 theaters for a muscular $17,295 average. For struggling Universal, it was the best opening for the studio in the 15 months since Fast and Furious bowed to $71M in April 2009. Expected to debut in the $30-40M range, the PG-rated pic took advantage of great reviews plus highly effective trailers and TV spots that made the film appeal to both families as well as teens and young adults. Parents with kids under 12 made up only 55% of the crowd while the CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A. The performance was especially impressive considering the fact that Toy Story 3 and The Last Airbender are pulling in kids and together grossed nearly $40M this weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despicable Me outgunned the openings of other non-sequel 3D toons like How to Train Your Dragon and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs which bowed to $43.7M and $30.3M, respectively. Both were embraced by critics and audiences alike and went on to gross four to five times their opening weekend grosses. With Despicable‘s summer play period, its domestic gross could easily go on to triple the $69M production budget in North America alone and add much more from overseas markets plus worldwide home video.Following an explosive opening week that saw a staggering $187M in seven days, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse fell to second place in its sophomore weekend collecting an estimated $33.4M propelling the 12-day haul to a massive $237M. The third Cullen pic dropped only 49%. The decline was not too high since the Friday-to-Sunday period last week did not include the opening day turnout. But Summit should be very happy with the hold as it was much lower than the sophomore falls for the last two highly anticipated Harry Potter films which also launched on summer Wednesdays. 2007’s Order of the Phoenix dropped 58% and last year’s Half-Blood Prince fell 62%.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Overseas, Eclipse banked an additional $81.1M from 63 markets and boosted the overseas cume to $219M and the global haul to $456M. In North America, the latest Bella tale should be able to beat New Moon‘s $296.6M and finish in the neighborhood of $310M.Fox’s sci-fi reboot Predators landed in third place opening to an estimated $25.3M from 2,669 theaters for a sturdy $9,479 average per location. The R-rated action film was produced by Robert Rodriguez and starred Adrien Brody and Laurence Fishburne. Budgeted at just under $40M, the ultraviolent pic took advantage of a marketplace dominated by movies for women and kids leaving a big opportunity that a franchise-based testosterone flick could take advantage of. The weekend was heavily frontloaded with Friday accounting for 41% of the three-day gross and Saturday falling 19% from the opening day. Reviews were quite good for this genre.[rtimage]MapID=1229154&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despite another 3D toon stealing away potential business, Toy Story 3 held up very well in its fourth frame grossing an estimated $22M slipping only 27%. The Woody threequel upped its total gross to a stellar $340.2M after only 24 days making it the highest-grossing film ever for Pixar edging past the $339.7M of 2003’s Finding Nemo. The fish flick has sold about 40% more tickets, though, as prices were lower seven years ago and there were no 3D surcharges added in to its tally. Toy Story 3 rose up to number 17 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $340.7M lifetime take of 2002’s The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.Paramount’s The Last Airbender suffered the worst drop in the top ten tumbling 58% to an estimated $17.2M in its second weekend. The M. Night Shyamalan-directed sci-fi actioner raised its 11-day total to a solid $100.2M making it the director’s first film to break the century mark since 2004’s The Village. Airbender could conclude its domestic run in the vicinity of $140M.[rtimage]MapID=1213190&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adam Sandler crossed the $100M mark for the eleventh time in his career over the weekend as his latest comedy Grown Ups enjoyed a sensational hold slipping only 14% to an estimated $16.4M boosting the 17-day tally to $111.3M for Sony. Despite the usual dreadful reviews, audiences are continuing to turn out for this dose of mindless summer laughs. Tom Cruise won’t be joining the century club with his action-comedy Knight and Day which slipped 25% to an estimated $7.9M for $61.9M to date for Fox.80s pals The Karate Kid and The A-Team have spent all five of their weeks next to each other on the charts. Sony’s Kid fell 29% to an estimated $5.7M while Fox’s Team dropped 44% to an estimated $1.8M. Totals thus far are $164.6M and $74M, respectively.Holding onto tenth place was the indie hit comedy Cyrus which expanded from 77 to 200 locations and watched its weekend gross climb 78% to an estimated $1.4M. The Fox Searchlight release averaged a solid $6,875 and has banked $3.5M to date with many more cities to open in the coming weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1223778&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]There was plenty of good news to go around for other independent films in limited release too. Focus enjoyed sensational results for its Sundance acquisition The Kids Are All Right which platformed in only seven locations but grossed an estimated $505,000 for a scorching $72,143 per theater. Winning praise from critics, the R-rated film about teen children of a lesbian couple wanting to meet their biological father was picked up for nearly $5M after wowing the film industry in Park City in January.Also performing very well was the Swedish thriller The Girl Who Played With Fire which opened at number eleven nationwide with an estimated $965,000 from only 110 locations for a strong $8,773 average. Fire is the sequel to March’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which has grossed $9.3M to date. Other notable indie holdovers include Roadside Attractions’ Winter’s Bone with an estimated $507,000 and $4,783 average in its fifth weekend with $2.6M to date, and Anchor Bay’s Solitary Man with an estimated $457,000 and $3.5M cume.[rtimage]MapID=10012413&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $191.1M which was up 45% from last year when Brüno opened in the top spot with $30.6M; and up 37% from 2008 when Hellboy II debuted at number one with $34.5M. This is the third year in a row that Universal opened a new film at number one on this particular frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"History, Marvel, TV, Certified, dogs, HBO, Travel, Paramount, visit, TV, Black, Apple, AMC, movies, adaptation","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-show-love-for-Despicable-Me"},{"id":"47509134060421","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Resident Evil Guns Down Big Opening at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Resident Evil Guns Down Big Opening at #1The American takes a tumble.by Gitesh Pandya | September 13, 2010 |  CommentsThe 3D zombie sequel ResidentEvil: Afterlife easily topped the North American box office on itsopening frame leading a sluggish marketplace that delivered the worst ticketsales in over two years.

The fright flick The Last Exorcismgrossed an estimated $3.5M, off 53%, and has scared up $38.2M to date. SylvesterStallone’s action flick The Expendablesinched closer to the century club with an estimated $3.3M, down 51%, for a$98.5M total.Spending its ninth weekend in the top ten, the sci-fi thriller Inception slipped34% to an estimated $3M giving Warner Bros. $282.4M thus far. Surpassing $290Mshould be easy but reaching $300M seems unlikely without some sort ofre-release.

Among new releases, the Steve Carell-Paul Rudd comedy Dinner for Schmucks delivered a good opening in the runnerup spot while the 3D family film Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore and the teen melodrama Charlie St. Cloud both disappointed in their debuts.Christopher Nolan’s mind games on moviegoers continued with Inception pulling in an estimated $27.5M in its third weekend to rule the box office once again. The Warner Bros. sensation dropped only 36% and boosted its 17-day total to a stellar $193.3M with the $200M barrier set to fall on Tuesday in its 19th day of release. The average was a solid $7,763 from 3,545 sites with 247 theaters being shed. It was only the third new release of the year to threepeat following Alice in Wonderland and Shrek Forever After, and the first 2D film to do so since 2008’s Tropic Thunder which followed the four-week reign of Nolan’s last film The Dark Knight.[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Inception has become the second biggest hit ever for DiCaprio after just Titanic and has surpassed Clash of the Titans to become the studio’s top-grossing film of the year. Warners can sure use it since its other summer bets Sex and the City 2, Splice, and Jonah Hex have all been underperformers. With good legs, Inception still has a chance at reaching $300M from North America alone. Overseas, the mind-bending thriller grossed an estimated $53.7M from 51 markets lifting the international tally to $170M and the worldwide gross to a huge $363M.Paramount’s star-driven comedy Dinner for Schmucks opened in second place with a respectable bow of $23.3M, according to estimates. The Steve Carell-Paul Rudd pic averaged $8,004 from 2,911 locations and came in close to Carell’s last live-action hit Date Night which debuted to $25.2M and a $7,471 average in April. With its more accessible PG-13, Schmucks also opened better than Rudd’s recent R-rated ventures like I Love You, Man ($17.8M) and Role Models ($19.2M).[rtimage]MapID=1223752&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Summer has been surprisingly light on star-driven broad comedies with many of the laughs coming from cartoons or action titles instead. At this point last summer, The Hangover and The Proposal had grossed a combined $405M. Dinner came in and played to an underserved audience. Produced for about $60M, Schmucks played to a crowd that was 55% male and 54% over 25. The CinemaScore grade was just a B and this Friday’s arrival of the Will Ferrell comedy The Other Guys will provide direct competition so the road ahead will not be an easy one.Angelina Jolie enjoyed a solid second weekend for her spy thriller Salt which dropped 47%, reasonably low for a summer action movie, to an estimated $19.3M in third place. Sony has banked $70.8M in ten days and looks headed for the vicinity of $120M coming close to the $134.5M of her 2008 stylish effects-heavy action title Wanted. Overseas, Salt’s roll out continued this weekend with top spot bows in South Korea, Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ukraine, and the Philippines. The international take over the frame was $24.5M upping the cume to $32.8M for a global gross of $103.6M to date with much more to come. With a production cost north of $100M, the stunts-heavy pic could be heading for a worldwide tally of $300M or more.[rtimage]MapID=1213717&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despicable Me spent its fourth weekend in the top five collecting an estimated $15.5M for another slim decline of 34%. Universal has taken in an impressive $190.3M in just 24 days and is less than a week away from scoring its first double-century smash in three years. The studio’s spy sequel The Bourne Ultimatum scored a $227.5M gross in the summer of 2007 and it’s been a rough ride since for the distributor.Proving that parents can’t be fooled into seeing just any 3D kids movie, Cats &amp; Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore opened poorly in fifth place with an estimated $12.5M from a very wide 3,705 theaters for a weak $3,381 average despite the added surcharges collected for the format. The followup to the 2001 hit which grossed $93.4M generated little interest and with the target audience of families already having paid large sums of cash for this year’s numerous other 3D kidpics, Kitty Galore just didn’t warrant the extra expenditure. The opening was on par with the $11.6M of June’s Marmaduke, another franchise pet movie that nobody asked for.Debuting outside the top five was Zac Efron’s starring vehicle Charlie St. Cloud which bowed to an estimated $12.1M from 2,718 sites for a mediocre $4,465 average. The PG-13 film was extremely front-loaded drawing the bulk of its young female audience on opening day with $5.5M on Friday. Saturday tumbled a disturbing 32% to $3.8M and Sunday is projected by Universal to dip by 30% to $2.7M. Produced for $44M, pricey for this type of drama, Charlie drew an audience that was 79% female and 59% under 25. Reviews were terrible.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney and Pixar dropped to seventh with Toy Story 3 which grossed an estimated $5M in its seventh session, off 44%, for a $389.7M total. Adam Sandler broke the $150M mark for the fourth time in his career with the leggy comedy hit Grown Ups. The Sony release fell 39% to an estimated $4.5M lifting the cume to $150.7M. The comedian’s only bigger grossers were 1999’s Big Daddy ($163.5M), 1998’s The Waterboy ($161.5M), and 2005’s The Longest Yard ($158.1M).Nicolas Cage’s The Sorcerer’s Apprentice suffered the worst decline in the top ten tumbling 55% to an estimated $4.3M for a weak $51.9M sum for Disney. The Twilight Saga: Eclipse rounded out the top ten with an estimated $4M, down 45%, and $288.2M to date.In the limited release world, the César Award-winning French film The Concert enjoyed a good platform debut grossing an estimated $20,121 from a pair of theaters for a solid $10,061 average for The Weinstein Company. Focus expanded its indie hit comedy The Kids Are All Right nationwide to 847 locations and grossed an estimated $3.5M for a decent $4,090 average. Total stands at $9.6M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $128.1M which was up 20% from last year when Funny People opened in the top spot with $22.7M; but down 9% from 2008 when The Dark Knight remained at number one for a third consecutive weekend with $42.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Horse, TLC, indiana, Now, visit, Christmas, cancelled, Disney","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Inception-Beats-Schmucks-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509134070667","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Retains the Top Spot","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Retains the Top Spot\n                        Plus, Salt performs well, while Ramona and Beezus debuts at #6\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | July 26, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis weekend, Warner Bros. enjoyed a sensational second weekend for its sci-fi thriller Inception which capitalized on amazing buzz to remain the most popular film in North America. Angelina Jolie’s new action pic Salt had to settle for second place but the spy thriller still generated a healthy opening. Like last weekend, funny films had the best holds while everything else dropped harder.\n\n\nDeclining by a slim 31%, Inception topped the charts once again with an estimated $43.5M rocketing its ten-day tally to a stellar $143.7M. It was the second lowest drop witnessed all year for a wide release in its sophomore frame and put the Leonardo DiCaprio hit on track to break the $250M mark and possibly the $300M barrier as well. Playing in 3,792 theaters, including 197 IMAX sites, the mind-bending film averaged a muscular $11,473 which was tops among all wide releases.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nInception has an incredible road ahead of it. Word-of-mouth is amazing, repeat business is solid, competition over the coming weeks is not too fierce, and midweek sales have been enormous. It may even extend its streak to three weeks at number one. The hold was especially impressive given the arrival of another star-driven action thriller in Salt.\n\n\nThat Angelina Jolie starrer debuted well in the runner-up spot with an estimated $36.5M from 3,612 locations for a meaty $10,105 average. The Sony espionage thriller about a CIA agent on the run when suspected of being a Russian secret agent played to an adult audience and had cross-gender appeal. Studio research showed that 53% of the crowd was female and 59% was over 25. Reviews were mixed and moviegoers responded to the starpower of the lead and the promise of action and stunts. Unlike Inception, Salt featured very few special effects.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1213717&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nThe media gave extensive coverage to the fact that Tom Cruise passed on doing the film and opted for another spy flick, Knight and Day, instead. But paying customers were more excited by Jolie as Salt grossed more in its first 3 days than Knight did in its first 9 days. Cruise’s latest project is set to end its domestic run with less than $80M while Salt stands a great chance of breaking $100M.\n\n\nAudience favorite Despicable Me held up remarkably well in its third frame sliding only 27% to an estimated $24.1M boosting the 17-day total to a stunning $161.7M. Universal’s highest-grossing film in three years, the 3D toon is well on its way to reaching at least $225M and could go even higher as competition in the coming weeks is not too strong for its target audience.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nDisney’s big-budget misfire The Sorcerer’s Apprentice fell to fourth place with an estimated $9.7M failing to break double-digit millions in its second weekend in theaters. With only $42.6M in 12 days, the effects-driven Nicolas Cage action title looks to reach $70-80M which would be only half of its production cost.\n\n\nGiving the Mouse House better news was Toy Story 3 which still had good legs dipping only 25% to an estimated $9M in its sixth round. The 3D toon has banked $379.5M rising to number 12 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind the $380.3M of 2005’s Star Wars Episode III. The $400M barrier will come crashing down in August.\n\n[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\n\nFox bowed its new girl pic Ramona and Beezus in sixth place with a quiet $8M, according to estimates. The G-rated film based on the popular children’s books by author Beverly Cleary averaged a mild $2,942 from 2,719 theaters and played mostly to young girls and their moms. The low cost $15M production attracted an audience that was 69% family and 75% female. Reviews were generally upbeat.\n\n\nSony’s ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TCA, Red, children's, talk, Syfy, Shondaland, female, Elton, boxing, Amazon, Diego, football, YA, Exclusive","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Inception-Retains-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509134071692","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Soars to No. 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Inception Soars to No. 1Despicable Me and The Sorcerer's Apprentice round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 19, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, moviegoers were in the mood for using their brains as the smart sci-fi thriller Inception debuted atop the North American box office chart while the generic effects-driven action pic The Sorcerer’s Apprentice was utterly rejected stumbling into third place with a weak showing. Funny holdovers held up well while most others fell sharply as the overall marketplace remained strong.Following much anticipation, Warner Bros. unleashed its Leonardo DiCaprio-led crime thriller Inception and was met with a strong response from ticket buyers taking in an estimated $60.4M in its opening weekend. The studio released the Christopher Nolan-directed pic in 3,792 theaters including a record 197 IMAX sites and averaged a sizzling $15,928 per location. It was the actor’s biggest opening ever beating out the $41.1M of Shutter Island from just five months ago. Inception also delivered the third biggest opening of the year for a 2D film following the high-profile summer sequels Iron Man 2 and The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.[rtimage]MapID=1217219&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans had been waiting for Nolan to follow up on his 2008 megahit The Dark Knight and Inception provided a thinking person’s pic thanks to an original story written by the director. Films with openings like this are usually based on some kind of pre-existing source material or are headlined by stars that routinely open pictures at this level. Reviews and word-of-mouth so far have been very strong and the complex storyline does encourage repeat viewing so the road ahead could be promising. The PG-13 pic cost $150M to produce.Overseas, Inception premiered in Nolan’s native U.K. plus a half-dozen Asian territories to a solid estimate of $15.6M and rolls out into 29 more markets this coming weekend including Japan, France, Mexico, Australia, Korea, and Russia. Thirteen more countries including Germany open on the following frame.[rtimage]MapID=1214097&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=34&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Knocked down to number two but still packing quite a punch was the 3D toon Despicable Me which grossed an estimated $32.7M in its second weekend. The Universal hit fell just 42% which represented a terrific hold considering all the summer competition. Steve Carell’s turn as a lovable supervillain has pulled in a stellar $118.4M in its first ten days and with strong midweeks could very well be headed past the $200M mark. The struggling studio has had only two other films join the double-century club over the last five years — King Kong and The Bourne Ultimatum — and is now well-positioned as one of the last major studio players in the lucrative animation world.Superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer suffered one of the worst openings of his career with the weak launch of the big-budget adventure film The Sorcerer’s Apprentice which bowed to just $17.4M in third place, according to estimates. With $24.5M in the five days since its Wednesday start, the PG-rated pic managed to average $4,958 from 3,504 theaters. Apprentice stars Nicolas Cage as a wizard that takes on a protégé to help him in his long battle with a rival wizard.[rtimage]MapID=1212688&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The performance was about even with the producer’s 2004 summer adventure King Arthur which also bowed midweek in July in third place and opened to $15.2M over the weekend ($4,923 average) and $23.6M in five days. That film, still ranking as one of Bruckheimer’s biggest failures, sold about 13% more tickets in its five-day debut and ended its domestic run at just $51.9M.Reportedly costing around $150M to produce, the flop follows Bruckheimer’s other pricey summer action offering Prince of Persia which has been a disappointment in North America grossing less than $90M to date despite a budget that was much higher. The veteran producer has long been a steady supplier of hits for Disney but this summer marks a rare case of back-to-back clunkers from his signature genre of loud and expensive summer action movies. Apprentice offered impressive special effects, but its generic feel prevented audience members from getting any excitement.[rtimage]MapID=1210749&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Summit’s teen smash The Twilight Saga: Eclipse cracked the Top 50 chart of all-time domestic blockbusters this weekend. The vampire pic dropped 57% to an estimated $13.5M bumping the total to an impressive $264.9M putting the third installment of the franchise at number 48 behind Shrek which grossed $267.7M in 2001. Toy Story 3 rose up to number 15 on the all-time list this weekend with its estimated $11.7M three-day take. Off 44%, the Disney/Pixar smash has hauled in $362.7M to date and now sits behind The Passion of the Christ‘s $370.3M.Sony’s Grown Ups still played well as the summer’s big broad comedy grossing an estimated $10M in its fourth frame, down 37%, boosting the cume for the Adam Sandler pic to $129.3M. Fantasy flick The Last Airbender fell 55% in its third weekend to an estimated $7.5M giving Paramount $114.8M in 18 days.[rtimage]MapID=1229154&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=11&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Producer Robert Rodriguez’s Predators collapsed in its sophomore frame tumbling 73% to an estimated $6.8M and lifted its ten-day total to a decent $40.1M. Fox stablemate Knight and Day took in an estimated $3.7M, off 52%, for a $69.2M cume. Sony’s reboot hit Karate Kid dropped 59% to an estimated $2.2M and has taken in a terrific $169.2M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $165.9M which was up 10% from last year when Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince opened in the top spot with $77.8M; but down 34% from 2008 when The Dark Knight debuted at number one with a record $158.4M. This is the third year in a row that Warner Bros. opened a new film at number one on this particular frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hollywood, cinemax, Calendar, Horror, jamie, Central, psychological, criterion, godzilla, scene, TV, Country, spinoff","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Inception-Soars-to-No-1"},{"id":"47509134057347","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wall Street Is In The Money","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Wall Street Is In The MoneyLegend of the Guardians and The Town round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | September 27, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, Michael Douglas and director Oliver Stone reteamed for the financial crisis drama Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps and scored the best openings of their careers with an estimated $19M topping a sluggish box office that saw the top ten fail to break $90M for the fifth consecutive weekend. The PG-13 film marking the return of corporate raider Gordon Gekko (a role that won Douglas the Best Actor Oscar) averaged a decent $5,330 from 3,565 theaters for Fox. Stone’s previous best opening was $18.7M for World Trade Center which bowed on a Wednesday in August 2006 while Douglas beat his previous high (in a lead role) of $17.1M for the kidnapping thriller Don’t Say A Word which bowed this very weekend in 2001 when it led a box office resurgence just weeks after the 9/11 attacks.Co-starring Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, and Josh Brolin, the Wall Street sequel was met with mixed reviews from film critics who didn’t love it as much as the first one which opened in December 1987, just two months after the stock markets crashed. The new Gekko pic marked Fox’s first number one opener of 2010, something the studio was waiting some time for. It did, however, top the first five weekends of the year with 2009’s Avatar. Wall Street played to an older crowd with 65% of the audience being over 30 while males and females were evenly split. Formidable competition for review-reading adults came from last week’s acclaimed champ The Town which held up quite well in its sophomore frame.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237401[/rtimage]Warner Bros. landed in second place with the opening of its 3D adventure film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga’Hoole which bowed to an estimated $16.3M from a very wide 3,575 theaters. The PG-rated kidpic based on the popular book series averaged $4,569 per location which was not too strong considering the higher ticket prices at the more than 2,400 3D locations including 193 IMAX 3D sites. Reviews were mixed and starpower from the voices of Geoffrey Rush, Helen Mirren, and Sam Neill did little to excite families. Plus, how many owl movies soar at the box office?The book series did not come with as large of a built-in fan base as other literary properties have had when making the move to the multiplexes. The Ga’Hoole launch amounted to about half of the bows from last fall’s book-turned-kidpics Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Where the Wild Things Are which opened to $30.3M and $32.7M, respectively.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237261[/rtimage]Strong word-of-mouth is helping Ben Affleck’s bank robbery thriller The Town become that elusive type of film that all studios want — the durable box office winner with legs. The Warner Bros. hit suffered the smallest decline among all wide releases dipping only 33% to an estimated $16M in its second weekend for a solid ten-day score of $49.1M. That puts the Boston-set drama not far behind the pace of the studio’s Martin Scorsese winner The Departed which dropped 29% in its sophomore outing with a $57M take in ten days. Town lags by just 14% in terms of gross sales. The critically acclaimed film also scored the weekend’s best per-theater average among wide releases with $5,556 in its sophomore session edging out Wall Street and others. Affleck and company should easily be able to make off with $90M in the end and may even reach nine-digit territory.The high school comedy Easy A followed in fourth with an estimated $10.7M dropping a respectable 40% in its sophomore frame. With $32.8M in ten days, the Sony release could be headed for $55-60M.Opening one spot below was another female-driven comedy that mines high school for laughs — You Again. The PG-rated pic starring Kristen Bell, Jamie Lee Curtis, Sigourney Weaver, and Betty White debuted with an estimated $8.3M from 2,548 locations for a mild $3,257 average. Despite the starpower, the Buena Vista release was affected by direct competition from Easy A which still pulled in a sizable number of young women. Even the male-driven dramas Wall Street and The Town have been seeing about half of their business come from females. Critics gave You Again unfavorable marks.The M. Night Shyamalan production Devil fell 47% in its second weekend — not too bad for a horror film — and grossed an estimated $6.5M. After ten days, the Universal release has collected $21.7M and should finish with $32-35M.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237263[/rtimage]Falling 51% in its third weekend was Sony’s 3D zombie sequel Resident Evil: Afterlife with an estimated $4.9M for the frame and $52M total. International markets brought in an additional $24M boosting the overseas cume to an impressive $150.7M for a stellar global tally of $202.7M and counting. Afterlife is now the top-grossing Resident Evil pic both domestically and worldwide, thanks to higher 3D ticket prices and continued fan interest in the franchise.Proving that not all 3D films are big sellers, the animated pic Alpha and Omega dropped 48% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.7M for a ten-day take of only $15.1M. The Lionsgate release looks to end with around $24M. Sony’s hit heist film Takers followed with an estimated $1.7M, off 46%, for a $54.9M total.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237403[/rtimage]Christopher Nolan’s Inception became the only 2010 release to spend eleven weekends in the top ten thanks to its estimated $1.2M frame. The long-running Warner Bros. smash eased by only 37% and raised its sum to $287.1M from North America.In limited release, the documentary Waiting for Superman which examines the pitfalls of the American educational system earned a terrific grade in its platform debut with an estimated $141,000 from just four locations for a scorching $35,250 average. Winning the Documentary Audience Award at Sundance earlier this year, the PG-rated film from the director of An Inconvenient Truth bowed in only New York and Los Angeles this weekend and expands to the top ten markets on Friday. Reviews have been overwhelmingly positive and Paramount used an aggressive online pledge campaign to boost interest and engage moviegoers in the release.Lionsgate saw a solid debut for its horror entry Buried starring Ryan Reynolds which scared up an estimated $104,500 from just 11 locations for a $9,500 average. The R-rated chiller opens wider on October 8 against Wes Craven’s 3D fright flick My Soul to Take splitting the Halloween month’s horror crowd that weekend.[rtimage]siteImageId=10237402[/rtimage]The Will Ferrell-produced sex comedy The Virginity Hit failed to score with audiences opening to a pathetic $300,000, according to estimates. Sony’s no-budget pic averaged a puny $429 from an unusually wide release in 700 theaters and showed no signs of being a breakout hit deserving so many playdates.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89.3M which was up 13% from last year when Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs stayed in the top spot with $25M; and up 9% from 2008 when Eagle Eye debuted at number one with $29.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nfl, NBC, Wars, Movies, Turner, telelvision, television, dramedy, twilight, review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Wall-Street-Is-In-The-Money"},{"id":"47509135698842","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Date Night Battles Titans for Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Date Night Battles Titans for Top SpotAlso, How To Train Your Dragon shows staying power.by Gitesh Pandya | April 12, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, in a virtual dead heat for first place, Fox’s new comedy Date Night opened with about as much in ticket sales as the second session of the Warner Bros. 3D epic Clash of the Titans. Sunday estimates from the studios had the films separated by only $225,000 which is not enough to claim a decisive victory, but both films certainly pulled in solid amounts powering the overall marketplace to another very strong spring frame. Final grosses to be reported on Monday, after Sunday sales are counted, will determine the official rankings.[rtimage]MapID=1226635&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new Steve Carell-Tina Fey film Date Night attracted an impressive turnout grossing an estimated $27.1M in its first weekend of release. Debuting in 3,374 locations, the PG-13 film about a married couple’s disastrous evening out averaged a very impressive $8,032 per theater. Reviews were mixed but generally upbeat as audiences instead responded to the starpower of the two leads who have enjoyed much success in television and at the movies. In fact, this is Fey’s third number one hit comedy in April following 2004’s Mean Girls which she wrote and co-starred in as well as 2008’s Baby Mama. Produced for $55M, Date played as mainstream entertainment for adult audiences. Fox estimated a 34% Saturday-to-Sunday drop nearly matching the 35% decline Warner Bros. estimated for its Titans. If the rankings stay the same after final numbers are reported, Date Night will be the first 2D movie to take the top spot in six weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1212698&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As expected, the 3D mythology remake Clash of the Titans fell sharply in its second weekend falling 56% to an estimated $26.9M. If estimates hold, it will finish the frame close behind in second place with a cume of $110.5M after 10.5 days. Titans was number one on Saturday and is estimated to be tops on Sunday too, but Date Night‘s stronger Friday on its opening day gives it the advantage over the three-day period. Warner Bros. could end up with roughly $160M by the end of Clash‘s run.The big story this weekend came in third place where the 3D animated film How To Train Your Dragon witnessed a remarkably low 13% decline in its third round for an estimated $25.4M gross boosting the 17-day total to a terrific $133.9M. Short-sighted film industry watchers and impatient Wall Street investors prematurely dismissed Dragon and DreamWorks Animation after its less-than-stellar opening weekend two weeks ago. The company’s stock dropped 8% on the first trading day after the debut with analysts lowering their estimates for the final domestic take to just $152M. Dragon will now crush that mark next weekend and looks on course to break the $200M barrier too becoming the second biggest 3D toon of all-time behind just the $293M of Up.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=25&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Beating Pixar’s Oscar winner may not be possible, but outgrossing other competitors like Monsters vs. Aliens, Ice Age 3, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs makes Dragon a powerful performer. The PG-rated film was indeed slow out of the gate, but amazing word-of-mouth coupled with school holidays for spring have made Dragon the must-see film for kids and parents. Competition for families and 3D screens remains extremely light for the next five weeks so the Viking pic’s strong run should continue. Reaching $250M cannot be ruled out at this point given the road ahead since Dragon will be able to earn at least five times its opening figure, if not more.[rtimage]MapID=1210444&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Tyler Perry’s latest film Why Did I Get Married Too? followed his usual pattern – big opening, big drop. The Lionsgate release grossed an estimated $11M in its second frame tumbling 62% for a ten-day tally of $48.5M. A final take of roughly $65M seems likely. Fellow sophomore The Last Song starring Miley Cyrus fared much better declining by just 37% to an estimated $10M. With $42.4M in 12 days, Disney should reach a similar $65M.The Mouse House also claimed the number six slot with its 3D juggernaut Alice in Wonderland which grossed an estimated $5.6M, off only 32%, for a $319.3M cume. The Johnny Depp smash now sits at number 22 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters behind Shrek the Third which hauled in $321M in 2007. The ogre returns next month with his own 3D installment.[rtimage]MapID=1200459&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A trio of comedies followed. The time-travel pic Hot Tub Time Machine took in an estimated $5.4M, down 33%, for a $37M total for MGM. Sony’s The Bounty Hunter dipped 29% to an estimated $4.3M for a $56M sum to date. And the kidpic em&gt;Diary of a Wimpy Kid eased by just 23% grossing an estimated $4.1M for Fox lifting the cume to $53.8M.Vivendi opened the faith-based drama Letters to God in tenth place with weak results. The PG-rated film about a boy battling cancer bowed to an estimated $1.3M from 897 locations – very wide for this type of pic – for a poor $1,394 average.The top ten films grossed an estimated $121M which was off 1% from last year which was Easter when Hannah Montana The Movie opened in the top spot with $32.3M; but up 56% from 2008 when Prom Night debuted at number one with $20.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"zombie, watch, history","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Date-Night-Battles-Titans-for-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509135694744","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Retakes the Top Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dragon Retakes the Top SpotThe Dreamworks Animation film claims #1 in the worst Box Office weekend so far this year.by Gitesh Pandya | April 26, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, with Hollywood dumping its weakest films into theaters, moviegoers understandably stayed away from the multiplexes as the North American box office slumped to its lowest level of the year. New releases The Back-up Plan and The Losers generated unimpressive results allowing the five-week old 3D cartoon How to Train Your Dragon to reclaim the number one spot thanks to its continued durability. For the first time all year the top ten films failed to gross at least $90M.After coming within a hair of nabbing the box office crown last weekend, How To Train Your Dragon won a decisive victory this time grossing an estimated $15M in its fifth weekend for another slim decline of only 24%. The DreamWorks blockbuster has now amassed a fantastic $178M and should bust through the $200M mark the same weekend as when Paramount stablemate Iron Man 2 arrives to kick off the summer movie season. The Viking toon is still on course to finish its run in the neighborhood of $225M which would be more than five times its opening weekend take thanks to amazing legs. Dragon‘s drops to date have been 34%, 14%, 21%, and 24%.[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans didn’t exactly turn out in large numbers for Jennifer Lopez who returned to theaters with her first major wide release in five years. Her pregnancy comedy The Back-up Plan collected an estimated $12.3M from a very wide 3,280 locations for a lackluster $3,735 average. Slammed by poor reviews, the PG-13 film about a woman who finds Mr. Right after being impregnated artificially played mostly to adult women, and failed to appeal to a broader audience. Females made up 71% of the audience, 57% were over 30, and 21% were Latino, according to distributor CBS Films. This is only the company’s second release following the disastrous Brendan Fraser-Harrison Ford flop Extraordinary Measures which debuted to a terrible $6M and $2,363 average in January.Lopez has generally been a reliable draw at the box office with her films and the opening of Plan does not necessarily mean she no longer has box office clout any more. The generic story, lack of additional starpower, and poor marks from critics all helped to prevent an opening like those of her past films. The last major Lopez vehicle was 2005’s Monster-in-Law which bowed at number one with $23.1M in May, a month usually topped by big-budget action films each weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1226387&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences made Date Night the number three choice again this weekend as the Steve Carell-Tina Fey comedy slipped just 37% to an estimated $10.6M. Fox has laughed up a solid $63.5M in 17 days and could be headed for the $90M mark.Opening in fourth with weak results was the action film The Losers with an estimated $9.6M from 2,936 locations for a poor $3,271 average. The Warner Bros. release featuring Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan didn’t have the starpower to pull in paying audiences and the story involving a group of renegade ex-soldiers seeking revenge on a criminal mastermind failed to spark any interest. Reviews were mixed for the PG-13 pic.Kick-Ass stumbled in its second weekend falling 52% to an estimated $9.5M giving the super hero flick $34.9M in ten days. Lionsgate should end up with roughly $55M from its much-buzzed-about action film. The 3D action pic Clash of the Titans grossed an estimated $9M, off 42%, pushing the total for Warner Bros. up to $145.6M. Sony’s comedy remake Death at a Funeral tumbled 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $8M. With $28.4M in ten days, the Chris Rock-Martin Lawrence film should finish its run with $45-50M.[rtimage]MapID=1217700&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s new underwater documentary Oceans scored the best per-theater average of any film in wide release this weekend. The G-rated pic debuted in moderate national release with 1,206 locations and grossed an estimated $6M for a $4,975 average. Add in grosses from the Thursday opening on Earth Day when it ranked number one in the marketplace and the four-day cume stands at $8.5M. On a per-theater basis, the bow was almost identical to the studio’s doc from this same frame last year when Earth bowed to $8.8M from a wider debut in 1,804 sites for a $4,892 average.The Mouse House rounded out the top ten with a pair of hits. The Miley Cyrus teen romance The Last Song dropped 38% to an estimated $3.7M for a $55.4M total to date. Alice in Wonderland, the biggest non-Pandora 3D movie of all-time, fell 39% to an estimated $2.2M boosting the total to $327.5M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $85.9M which was down 14% from last year when Obsessed opened in the top spot with $28.6M; but up 13% from 2008 when Baby Mama debuted at number one with $17.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Day, Mudbound, italian, crime, Network, York, child's, america, war, DC, rom-coms, Dates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dragon-Retakes-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509135687572","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek dethrones Iron Man 2","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek dethrones Iron Man 2Plus, Robin Hood slips to third, and MacGruber, well, bombs.by Sujit Chawla | May 24, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend The fourth film in the Shrek series took the box office crown in the fourth weekend of the 2010 summer movie season, but with a much smaller gross than anticipated. Meanwhile, the SNL curse continued as Universal’s MacGruber crashed and burned on impact.Shrek Forever After took charge of the box office this weekend, debuting to $71.3M from 4,359 locations (which includes 194 IMAX and 2373 3D screens) for a per screen average of $16,345. The opening, while extremely good for most movies, is a big let down for the franchise.Each film in the Shrek series had a higher opening weekend gross than the previous one (taking into account that Shrek 2 opened on a Wednesday). While Shrek Forever After wasn’t expected to meet the heights of Shrek the Third, with the 3D and IMAX surcharges added in to a huge theater count, the $72M has to be seen as disappointing. As you can also see, the opening weekend percentage of the final total has been going up as well, as the grosses become more and more front loaded. With less-than-stellar reviews it is distinctly possible that Shrek Forever After may not make as much money as stablemate How To Train Your Dragon, which is currently at $211M and counting.[rtimage]MapID=1194517&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After two weeks in the top spot, Robert Downey, Jr. and Iron Man 2 took a step back into the second spot this weekend, falling 49% to an estimated $26.6M, bringing its cume to $251.3M. By comparison, the original Iron Man had grossed $223.1M by the end of its third weekend back in 2008. Third place belonged to fellow hero Robin Hood which fell 48% from last weekend to an estimated $18.7M, bringing its total to $66.1M. Look for a final gross in the $115-120M range.We’re now at fourth place with still no sighting of MacGruber… Taking up residence in the fourth spot was Summit Entertainment’s Letters to Juliet, which took in an estimated $9.1M this weekend, a drop of only 33% from last weekend’s opening. Its cume now stands at $27.4M and it looks to end its run in the $55-60M range. Fifth place finds fellow sophomore Just Wright which fell 49% from last weekend to an estimated $4.2M, bringing its total to $14.6M. Look for a final gross in the $25-30M range.[rtimage]MapID=1226386&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Who is that I see trying to defuse a bomb with only seconds remaining? It’s MacGruber! Oh no, he didn’t make it! Crashing into sixth place this weekend, the Saturday Night Live sketch-turned-movie bombed at the box office, pulling in only $4.1M, according to estimates, from 2,551 screens for a per screen average of $1,607. The $4.1M opening is one of the worst openings of all time from a film with at least 2,500 screens. How bad was this opening? 1999’s Chill Factor, starring that dynamic duo of Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Skeet Ulrich opened to $4.5M from 2,558 theaters.Seventh place belonged to the film that just wouldn’t quit, Date Night, which had the best hold in the top 10, dropping a slim 26% to an estimated $2.8M. Its total now stands at $90.6M. In eighth place was the horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street which fell 51% to an estimated $2.3M, bringing its cume to $59.9M. It looks to end its run with a total nearly identical to 2009’s remake du jour, Friday the 13th which finished with $65M.[rtimage]MapID=1211478&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=21&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]DreamWorks Animation’s second film in the top 10 ended up in 9th place this weekend as How to Train Your Dragon fell sharply with the latest animation offering taking most of its business. The dragon tale took in $1.85M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its cume to a robust $210.9M.Rounding out the top 10 was another new title to the charts, the Bollywood film Kites. Distributed by Reliance BIG Pictures, the crossover hit opened with $1M from 208 playdates, for a per screen average of $4,976.[rtimage]MapID=10012379&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed $141.9M which was down 15.7% from last year when Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian opened in the top spot with $54.2M; and down 14.8% from 2008 when Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull opened at number one with $100.8M.

The big-budget Disney film debuted to a gargantuan $116.3M over the Friday-to-Sunday span, according to estimates, smashing box office records left and right. It was the biggest March opening ever soaring past the $70.9M of 300 from 2007 and the best debut for a 3D film beating the $77M of Avatar from last December.Alice also generated the all-time largest IMAX opening weekend with $11.9M from 188 sites which easily surpassed the $9.5M from 178 locations of Avatar. Plus, the Burton fantasy scored the top opening ever for a non-sequel edging out the $114.8M of 2002’s Spider-Man. The webslinger flick sold more tickets however as admission prices were much lower eight years ago and there were no 3D surcharges involved. Overall, Alice in Wonderland enjoyed the sixth biggest opening weekend in box office history after The Dark Knight ($158.4M), Spider-Man 3 ($151.1M), The Twilight Saga: New Moon ($142.8M), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M), and Shrek the Third ($121.6M). New Moon is the only film opening outside of summer to debut better than the Mad Hatter pic.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=24&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Wonderland performance zoomed ahead of industry expectations which were mostly in the $70M range. The starpower of Depp and Burton combined with the new eccentric 3D spin on a familiar fairy tale made for a must-see event. Disney’s marketing push was powerful and the utter lack of compelling film choices for kids since Christmas helped to fuel demand. Four of the next five films on the chart were rated R. The studio must now send a thank you card to Depp as the actor has anchored the three biggest openings in company history – Dead Man’s Chest, Alice, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End ($114.7M). It should come as no surprise that a fourth Jack Sparrow pic is in the works with a release date set for May 20 of next year.The actor-director combo attracted more lackluster numbers for their last two films Sweeney Todd and Corpse Bride which were more experimental movies. Alice in Wonderland carried the Disney brand name and a PG rating, despite a smoking caterpillar, and featured very broad appeal exciting teens and young adults as well as families. The Alice bow more than doubled the $56.2M opening of the duo’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was a huge achievement at the time.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar and Alice have reinforced the industry’s faith in 3D technology, and its moneymaking potential, as moviegoers clearly have no problem spending extra for the special experience for the right event film. Studios have been feverishly reviewing their upcoming release slates to see which tentpoles can be done in 3D. Also making audiences wear those black glasses this year will be Clash of the Titans, Shrek Forever After, Toy Story 3, and the next Harry Potter film among others.Opening in 40 additional territories overseas, Alice in Wonderland commanded a giant opening weekend haul of $94M offshore bringing the total global debut to an eye-popping $210.3M. That was more than enough to end Avatar‘s 11-week reign at number one at the international box office and there are major markets like France, Spain, Japan, and China still to come. Depp’s incredible worldwide appeal will surely carry this title forward around the globe.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two R-rated crime thrillers were virtually neck-and-neck fighting for second place. Final numbers to be reported on Monday could change the order, but Sunday’s estimates showed a slight $200,000 edge for the cop drama Brooklyn’s Finest which debuted with an estimated $13.5M from 1,936 locations. Averaging a strong $6,973 per theater, the Overture release stars Richard Gere, Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke, and Wesley Snipes and played to an adult ethnic audience. According to studio research, 60% of the crowd was African American with a total of 86% being non-Caucasian. 52% was female and 60% was over 30. Reviews were mostly negative.Brooklyn beat Shutter Island on Friday, lagged behind on Saturday, and is estimated to win Sunday by a slim margin. The Saturday-to-Sunday declines are estimated at 35% by Overture for Brooklyn and 46% by Paramount for Shutter. The two films could end up swapping positions when final numbers are counted.[rtimage]MapID=1198124&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Close behind in third place for now was Shutter Island which followed two weeks at number one with a estimated $13.3M in its third round. The 41% decline was commendable given the record opening of Alice which played to a broad audience. Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio had to make room for that other director-actor team but have upped their cume to an impressive $95.8M. Paramount will break the $100M mark on Thursday or Friday.The Bruce Willis-Tracy Morgan police comedy Cop Out ranked fourth with an estimated $9.1M in its second weekend dropping by an understandable 50%. With $32.4M in ten days, Warner Bros. seems headed for $50-55M.Jake Sully and company took fifth as Avatar suffered the largest drop of its 12-week run thanks to Alice seizing control of most of the nation’s 3D screens this weekend. The James Cameron juggernaut fell 44% to an estimated $7.7M and lifted its mammoth cume to $720.2M from North America. It had never fallen by more than 31% before. The overseas drop was slightly better with the Pandora pic grossing an estimated $21.7M, off 40%, boosting the international tally to $1.88 billion. The worldwide take now stands at a towering $2.6 billion. The historic run may end in the neighborhood of $2.75 billion.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The horror flick The Crazies dropped by 56% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M for Overture for a $27.4M cume in ten days. A $40M final seems likely which is good for a fright flick. Fox’s fantasy Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians collected an estimated $5.1M, down 47%, raising its total to $78M.The hit date movie Valentine’s Day followed in eighth falling 53% to an estimated $4.3M bumping the sum to $106.4M. With Oscar gold expected to come its way, Fox Searchlight’s Crazy Heart saw sales climb 36% to an estimated $3.4M giving the Jeff Bridges film $29.6M to date. Dear John rounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.9M, off 41%, for a $76.7M gross.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In limited release, Summit re-released its Academy Awards darling The Hurt Locker into 276 theaters and collected an estimated $439,000 for a mild $1,602 average. The Kathryn Bigelow-directed film has been available on DVD since January 12, but the distributor wanted to capture some sales from those who missed it last summer (which includes almost everyone) and wanted to see it on the big screen. It is also positioned to capture post-Oscar business too and will take advantage of all the free publicity. Total to date is still a modest $14.7M.The top ten films grossed a stunning estimate of $182.5M which was up a whopping 87% from last year when Watchmen opened in the top spot with $55.2M; and up a staggering 110% from 2008 when 10,000 B.C. debuted at number one with $35.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru!","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Mirror, DC, drama, Mystery, Century, The, Countdown, 007, 2015","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Alice-Dazzles-Audiences"},{"id":"47509134077840","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Toy Story 3 Soars to No. 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Toy Story 3 Soars to No. 1Plus, The Karate Kid stays strong, but Jonah Hex tanks.by Gitesh Pandya | June 21, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, Pixar once again showed off its box office muscle with the record opening for Toy Story 3 which delivered the best debut in company history. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the comic book-inspired Jonah Hex was shot dead on arrival suffering one of the worst openings ever for a summer action film. The overall marketplace bounced back after a few sluggish weeks with the top ten reaching a stellar $184M — the second best performance of 2010 including holiday frames.Disney and Pixar scored their eleventh consecutive hit with Toy Story 3 which bowed at number one with a staggering $109M, according to estimates. The G-rated reteaming of Woody the Cowboy, Buzz Lightyear, and other memorable characters generated a red hot $27,061 from 4,028 theaters helped by higher 3D ticket prices. It was the second biggest opening ever for a 3D film after Alice in Wonderland‘s $116.1M from March and the second highest for an animated film trailing Shrek the Third‘s $121.6M from 2007. Woody and Buzz also tied the $109M opening of last summer’s Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen for number ten on the list of all-time biggest debuts and number one on the list of best June premieres.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Critics were all raves for Toy Story 3 which was not surprising since Pixar films hardly ever attract bad reviews. The animation studio’s previous best debut was $70.5M for 2004’s The Incredibles which translates to about $85M at today’s 2D prices. Last summer’s Up was Pixar’s first 3D entry and bowed to $68.1M but Story‘s built-in audience helped to bring out a larger audience on opening weekend.Toy Story 3 launched on Friday with a stunning $41M ranking as the largest opening day ever for an animated film. The CinemaScore grade was an encouraging A. Surprisingly, Saturday sales actually dropped 10% to $37M. Family films tend to jump up on Saturdays but Friday was bigger for Toy due to so many schools being out for the summer and the nature of sequels attracting more demand upfront. Plus, the Friday gross included healthy midnight sales from Thursday night. Shrek Forever After, another recent 3D toon that was a sequel, enjoyed a solid 39% bump on its first Saturday, however schools were all in session in mid-May.[rtimage]MapID=1196045&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The road ahead is still expected to be a bright one for Toy Story 3 thanks to amazing reviews, strong word-of-mouth, and more schools closing for the summer everyday this week. The Independence Day holiday session is not too far away either and will lead to continued strength into July.After a surprisingly strong opening weekend, Sony’s hit remake The Karate Kid fell 48% to an estimated $29M and broke the $100M mark after just ten days of release. The decline was not bad considering the competition for families that Toy Story gave. Total stands at $106.3M to date with the Jaden Smith vehicle possibly heading for the neighborhood of $175M. That would be some Father’s Day gift to producer-dad Will Smith beating many of his own blockbusters like I, Robot, Shark Tale, and the Bad Boys films.[rtimage]MapID=1226668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The A-Team dropped a moderate 46% to an estimated $13.8M in its second weekend boosting its ten-day total to $49.8M. Fox’s 1980s nostalgia trip looks to end its run with $80-90M. Universal’s rock star comedy Get Him to the Greek held up well in its third frame with an estimated $6.1M, off 39%, for a $47.9M cume.Four films snuggled into the tight $5M to $5.5M range according to estimates from their distributors. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could see a change in the rankings. With Buzz Lightyear taking away the 3D toon audience, Shrek Forever After tumbled 65% to an estimated $5.5M bumping its total to $223M. A final gross of $230-235M seems likely. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time enjoyed a remarkably impressive hold dipping only 19% to an estimated $5.3M giving Disney $80.5M to date. Killers followed with an estimated $5.1M, down 36%, for a $39.4M sum for Lionsgate.[rtimage]MapID=1229157&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Eighth place saw the debut of the year’s biggest disaster, Jonah Hex. The PG-13 comic adaptation grossed a microscopic $5.1M from 2,825 theaters for a puny $1,800 average. The Warner Bros. release generated no interest with moviegoers and won over no fans with critics either. Even the reliable comic book crowd stayed away from this one. Starring Josh Brolin, Megan Fox, and John Malkovich, Hex never caught on as a must-see film with audiences and was not based on material with much of a built-in fan base. Rolling the dice with films based on Iron Man, Green Lantern, and Thor make some kind of sense, but nobody asked for a Jonah Hex movie. The turnout was even worse than for Fox’s last film Jennifer’s Body which bowed to $6.9M in the weak month of September. The only good news for Hex is that the film didn’t cost too much. Its reported production budget was about $40M.Rounding out the top ten with estimates of $2.7M a piece were Paramount’s comic book hero Iron Man 2 and Fox’s comic strip pooch Marmaduke. The super hero blockbuster fell 41% raising its total to $304M putting it at number 33 on the list of all-time domestic hits. The dog pic tumbled 56% and has collected a mere $27.9M thus far.[rtimage]MapID=1223778&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The critically-acclaimed comedy Cyrus became the summer’s first major indie hit with its platform bow in just four theaters in New York and Los Angeles resulting in an estimated $180,000 for a scorching $45,000 average. The Fox Searchlight release stars John C. Reilly, Jonah Hill, Marisa Tomei, and Catherine Keener and expands to more cities in the weeks ahead.The top ten films grossed an estimated $184.2M which was up 32% from last year when The Proposal opened in the top spot with $33.6M; and up 36% from 2008 when Get Smart debuted at number one with $38.7M.Written by Gitesh Pandya of Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"and, Poppins, heist, twilight, ABC, Bravo","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Toy-Story-3-Soars-to-No-1"},{"id":"47509135684498","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Still King Over Sluggish Frame","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Shrek Still King Over Sluggish FrameNo sugar and spice for Splice.by Gitesh Pandya | June 7, 2010 |  CommentsThe summer box office slump spilled into a new month as the North Americanbox office delivered the worst June frame in five years. Four new releasestargeting different audiences were sprinkled throughout the top ten but nonemanaged to unseat reigning chart king Shrek Forever Afterwhich held the number one spot for the third straight time. Ticket sales wereonce again down sharply compared to last year as the films Hollywood hasprogrammed are still not generating the usual summer excitement.Shrek ForeverAfter became the first of the four ogre toons to top the box office forthree consecutive weekends as the 3D pic grossed an estimated $25.3M falling bya relatively light 42% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of last weekend’sMemorial Day holiday session. It was the smallest drop suffered by any widerelease. Paramount and DreamWorks Animation have taken in $183M after 17 dayswhich still trails the performances of the previous Mike Myers sequels. Shrek 2,the top-grosser of the franchise, had collected $314.5M by this point whileShrek the Third stood at $255.9M. Those films had lower ticket prices and no 3Dsurcharges. Forever After is on track to finish its run in the vicinity of$250M.[rtimage]MapID=1194517&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=41&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universalenjoyed a solid opening for its raunchy comedy Get Himto the Greek which laughed up an estimated $17.4M leading a quartet ofnew releases. The R-rated film about a record company assistant assigned toescort an unstable rock star from London to Los Angeles averaged a good $6,460from 2,697 theaters. Jonah Hill, Russell Brand, and Sean Combs starred and JuddApatow produced. The debut was almost identical to the $17.7M second place bowand $6,335 average of 2008’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall which inspired the AldousSnow character played by Brand in Greek. Both films were directed by NicholasStoller. Budgeted at $40M, Greek skewed a bit towards adult men as studioresearch showed that 53% of the audience was male while 55% was under30.[rtimage]MapID=1212410&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Ashton Kutcherand Katherine Heigl followed close behind in third place with their newaction-comedy Killerswhich launched with an estimated $16.1M from 2,859 sites for a respectable$5,631 average. The PG-13 film about a woman who discovers after getting marriedthat her husband is a secret assassin opened a few notches below the $20.2Mdebut of Kutcher’s last summer offering What Happens in Vegas with Cameron Diazfrom May 2008. Killers was not screened for the press before its release, butcritics reviewing it on opening day panned the film.[rtimage]MapID=10011824&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disneysaw a steep 54% drop for its expensive adventure film Princeof Persia: The Sands of Time which grossed an estimated $13.9M followingits disappointing holiday opening. With only $59.5M collected after ten days,the Jerry Bruckheimer production looks to end its run near the $90M mark.Overseas and home video revenue need to be stellar in order to recoup theestimated $150-200M in production costs plus the additional cash spent onworldwide marketing.Suffering the worst decline of any film in the top ten was Sex and the City 2which tumbled 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $12.7M. Warner Bros. hasbanked only $73.4M in 11 days trailing 28% behind the $101.8M that the first Sex rang up in the same number of days. The gals should end up near the$100M mark at the end of the domestic run.Fox learned this weekend that Marmaduke is no Marley &amp; Me. The new comic strip pic bowed to an estimated $11.3M from 3,213theaters for a lackluster $3,517 average and did not come close to the $36.4Mdebut of the studio’s other Owen Wilson-led dog flick. Marmaduke wasbased on a property with only limited popularity and it lacked the dazzle of 3Dthat kids are now used to from other family films. With The Karate Kidopening Friday and ToyStory 3 in 3D debuting a week later, the road ahead looks difficult forthe Great Dane.[rtimage]MapID=1226669&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramountand Marvel took in an estimated $7.8M with Iron Man 2, off53%, raising the total to $291.3M. The super hero sequel rose to number 39 onthe list of all-time domestic blockbusters just behind the $291.7M of 2005’s The Chronicles of Narnia. Next week should see the Robert Downey Jr. hitjoin its predecessor in the $300M club.Opening poorly in eighth was Splice, a newsci-fi horror entry released by Warner Bros., with an estimated $7.5M. TheR-rated thriller averaged just $3,041 from 2,450 locations and became the latestfright flick to fail to connect with paying audiences during the early summerperiod which has never been kind to the genre. Reviews were quite good for ahorror pic, though.[rtimage]MapID=1208173&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]RobinHood fell 51% to ninth place with an estimated $5.1M boostingUniversal’s cume to $94.3M.

Fox’s tween comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid beat expectations to open in second place while Sony’s Jennifer Aniston-Gerard Butler vehicle The Bounty Hunter enjoyed a solid debut of its own close behind in third. But Universal’s new action entry Repo Men flopped in fourth with a miserable showing. The overall box office was up over 2009 for the fourth straight weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1211803&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences lined up again for some 3D fun with Johnny Depp with Alice in Wonderland easily defending its crown with an estimated $34.5M in its third round boosting the 17-day cume to a stellar $265.8M. It was Disney’s first three-peat at number one since Depp’s megahit Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest from July 2006. Staying atop the box office chart for this long is rare these days. Outside of Avatar, the last film to spend three weekends in first place was Tropic Thunder from the summer of 2008.Alice smashed the $250M mark on Saturday after only 16 days and looks headed for the $350M mark. The Tim Burton pic is already the second highest-grossing film to ever open in the January-to-April corridor trailing just The Passion of the Christ which hauled in $370.3M in 2004 after a late February debut. This weekend, Alice also joined the list of the Top 50 all-time domestic blockbusters sitting at number 45 between Shrek ($267.7M) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ($262M).[rtimage]MapID=1211236&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox posted brawny numbers for its kidpic Diary of a Wimpy Kid from 3,077 playdates for a strong $7,085 average. Based on the popular middle school-set book, the PG-rated film had no stars but instead capitalized on a built-in audience of fans attracting an impressive amount of business considering how Alice in Wonderland is still playing well to kids of all ages. With a budget of under $20M, the studio should not only see a healthy profit from box office and DVD sales but will also have a new franchise since there are still three more books in the series that can keep the cash coming in. Studio research indicated that 59% of the audience was under 25 and 51% was female. Fox is expecting upcoming spring and Easter school closings to keep the film going.[rtimage]MapID=10012049&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Opening close behind in third place was the battle-of-the-exes film The Bounty Hunter which seized an estimated $21M from 3,074 theaters for a solid $6,831 average. The PG-13 pic starring Gerard Butler as a bounty hunter assigned to capture his bail-jumping ex-wife played by Jennifer Aniston catered to an audience of adult women. Studio research showed that 58% of the crowd was female with the 50/50 age split at 30 instead of 25. The opening was almost identical to the $21.6M debut of 2008’s Fool’s Gold starring Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson. Both were battle-of-the-sexes action-comedies directed by Andy Tennant with poor reviews that were sold on the starpower of the beautiful people on screen. Gold, which enjoyed a holiday on its second weekend, ended with $70.2M and Bounty could approach the same vicinity which would be an encouraging performance given the budget that was in the low $40M range. Overseas potential looks solid as Aniston has been a bankable draw and Butler has seen his star wattage rise in the last year.[rtimage]MapID=1226671&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=39&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new sci-fi actioner Repo Men failed to capture any meaningful business in its first weekend with a poor opening of $6.2M, according to estimates. The ultraviolent R-rated pic starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker averaged a wimpy $2,440 for Universal from 2,521 theaters. Critics panned the futuristic film.[rtimage]MapID=1202804&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal found more bad news in fifth place as its other March action title Green Zone tumbled 58% to an estimated $6M for a weak ten-day total of only $24.7M. The studio did what it could to hide the film’s Iraq setting and pushed it instead as a film from the Jason Bourne guys but audiences didn’t buy into it. With a production cost of more than $100M, Zone will end up with a domestic take of just $35-40M. The early overseas tally is $20.4M with many markets still to open, but recovering production and marketing costs internationally will also be a challenging task.[rtimage]MapID=1208134&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramount claimed the next two spots with the comedy She’s Out of My League which grossed an estimated $5.9M and the thriller Shutter Island which took in an estimated $4.8M. The R-rated laugher declined by only 40% in its second round and upped its ten-day sum to $20M with a $35M final likely – not bad for a low-profile and inexpensive pic that is sure to do even better on DVD. The Scorsese-DiCaprio flick dropped 41% and has banked $115.8M to date.Avatar spent its 14th weekend in the top ten with an estimated $4M, off 39%, and a $736.9M cume. Fox’s overseas total climbed to $1.937 billion making the global haul $2.674 billion. Fox Searchlight’s Our Family Wedding fell 50% to an estimated $3.8M for $13.7M in ten days. Fellow sophomore Remember Me crumbled 60% to an estimated $3.3M giving Summit only $13.9M to date. Final grosses will be near the $20M mark for each.[rtimage]MapID=1223281&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In limited release, Focus scored the best average with its Ben Stiller pic Greenberg which bowed to an estimated $120,432 from only three sites for a muscular $40,144 average. Anchor Bay averaged a sturdy $17,500 from each of two locations for its Andy Garcia film City Island. The 45-minute IMAX science film Hubble 3D debuted to an estimated $453,000 from 39 large-screen venues for a $11,608 average. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo opened to an estimated $340,408 from 34 for a $10,012 average for Music Box. And Apparition earned a weak $3,295 average for its rocker girl pic The Runaways which debuted to an estimated $804,000 from 244 houses.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.2M which was up 19% from last year when Knowing opened in the top spot with $24.6M; and up 18% from 2008 when Horton Hears a Who remained at number one with $24.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Anna, Musicals, thriller, color, Tomatazos, impossible, PlayStation, FX, service, drama, Tarantino","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Alice-Reigns-For-Third-Straight-Weekend"},{"id":"47509135691670","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 2 Draws Fifth Biggest Opening of All-Time","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Iron Man 2 Draws Fifth Biggest Opening of All-Time\n                        Audiences welcome Tony Stark's return with over $130 million.\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | May 10, 2010                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                The summer movie season kicked off with the thunderous opening of the eagerly awaited super hero sequel Iron Man 2 which hauled in an estimated $133.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday period making for the fifth biggest debut of all-time. Paramount released the Marvel production in a mammoth 4,380 theaters including 181 venues with IMAX screens making it the widest bow in history edging out the 4,366-theater release of The Dark Knight in July 2008. The new Tony Stark film averaged a scorching $30,502 per site.\n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=97&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nHollywood’s only blockbusters to open bigger were Knight with $158.4M, Spider-Man 3 with $151.1M, The Twilight Saga: New Moon with $142.8M, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest with $135.6M. Iron Man 2 registered the largest debut in company history for Paramount beating Shrek the Third‘s $121.6M and was second-best among May titles behind another Marvel sequel launching over the first weekend of the month – the third Spidey flick.\nRobert Downey Jr. once again played the title role with Jon Favreau directing and Gwenyth Paltrow co-starring. New players this time for the $170M production were Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Don Cheadle. Samuel L. Jackson’s cameo in the first installment was expanded into a supporting role this time giving the actor the coveted ‘and’ credit. Rourke snagged the almost-as-cool ‘with’ credit. Numerous promotional partners added marketing muscle to the campaign including Burger King, Audi, 7-Eleven, Dr. Pepper, Oracle, and Hershey’s Reese’s brand. \n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=89&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nFans powered the first Iron Man to an opening of $102.1M (including Thursday night shows starting at 8pm) two years ago over the first weekend of May ahead of a leggy run that reached $318.4M. The sequel’s opening was 31% better and benefited from 7% more theaters, two years of ticket price increases, and the addition of an IMAX release which took advantage of higher ticket prices. IM2 set a new record for biggest 2D IMAX opening with $10.2M from 181 screens beating the $8.5M from 138 of last May’s Star Trek, also a Paramount release.\nAs with its predecessor, Iron Man 2 scored an encouraging A grade from CinemaScore indicating great satisfaction from paying audiences. Critics were not as enthusiastic this time around but in general reviews were good, especially for a comic book sequel. Exit polls showed that 60% of the crowd was male and 60% was over 25. Friday kicked off with a stunning $52.3M in ticket sales including $7.5M in Thursday night post-midnight shows, Saturday dipped 11% to $46.5M, and Sunday is estimated to slide by 25% to $34.9M. The metal man accounted for a whopping 78% of all sales for the top ten movies this weekend as competition hardly existed and rival studios steered clear of releasing anything big against it.\n[rtimage]MapID=1197264&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=41&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nOverseas, where the Stark gang debuted a week earlier, ticket sales hit an estimated $57.2M this weekend lifting the international tally to $194M. That makes for a massive $190.8M global weekend gross and a $327.6M cume to date worldwide in under two weeks. Even with large sequel-type declines in the weeks ahead, Iron Man 2 should have no problem zooming past the $582M global haul of its predecessor paving the way for a third chapter which Marvel is already planning.\n[rtimage]MapID=1211478&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nFreddy Krueger took a tumble as expected. The horror remake A Nightmare on Elm Street fell a sharp 72% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.2M putting it in a distant second place. It was a larger sophomore fall than those for other fright redos like Halloween (64%) and Prom Night (58%) but did not reach the incredibly high 80% crash suffered by Friday the 13th last year. With $48.5M in ten days, Nightmare should end up with a solid $60-65M nearly matching the $65M of the Jason remake.\n[rtimage]MapID=1194522&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nHolding up well yet again in its seventh weekend of release was the 3D sensation How To Train Your Dragon which slipped only 36% to an estimated $6.8M boosting the hit toon into the double-century club with $201.1M to date. A final domestic take of $220-225M seems likely.\nFox’s leggy comedy hit Date Night followed with an estimated $5.3M in its fifth weekend, down only 30%, for a $80.9M cume to date. The Jennifer Lopez pic The Back-up Plan dropped 40% to an estimated $4.3M giving CBS Films $29.4M thus far.\nSummit’s family flop Furry Vengeance fell 40% to an estimated $4M resulting in a poor ten-day tally of just $11.6M. Clash of the Titans took a big hit from Iron Man 2 tumbling 61% to an estimated $2.3M. After its sixth frame, the Warner Bros. 3D adventure has banked $157.8M.\n[rtimage]MapID=1226860&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=47&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nChris Rock’s latest comedy Death at a Funeral followed with an estimated $2.1M, off 49%, for a $38.3M sum for Sony. The Losers ranked ninth collapsing 69% to an estimated $1.8M with $21.5M to date for Warner Bros.\n[rtimage]MapID=1226677&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]\nThree films fought over tenth place with estimated grosses between $1.5M and $1.6M but if Sunday estimates are to be believed, the documentary Babies narrowly won the race. Opening to weak results, the PG-rated film about the first year of life for four babies growing up in different parts of the world grossed an estimated $1.6M from 534 theaters for a lackluster $2,951 average. Focus went unusually wide with the launch as most non-Michael Moore documentaries do not bow in this many theaters on the first weekend. Disney’s nature films Oceans and Earth are two examples of wide releases for the genre as both were tied into Earth Day. Babies was slated for Mother’s Day weekend, however its target audience of new parents rarely get time to go out to the movies at that stage of life. A much larger crowd is likely to catch it on DVD and VOD. Reviews for the French-produced doc were generally positive.\nThe top ten films grossed an estimated $171M which was up 23% from last year when Star Trek opened in the top spot with $75.2M ($79.2M including Thursday night); and up 48% from 2008 when Iron Man remained at number one with $51.2M. During those two years, this was the second weekend of summer and not the kickoff.\n                                            \n                \n            ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comic, Pet, movies, Comics, Hallmark, dramedy, christmas, wars, Games, cinemax, Emmys","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-2-Draws-Fifth-Biggest-Opening-of-AllTime"},{"id":"47509135683473","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Karate Kid K.O.s the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: The Karate Kid K.O.s the CompetitionPlus, The A-Team claims #2, while Shrek finally loses the top spot.by Gitesh Pandya | June 14, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, eleven-year-old Jaden Smith defeated four grown men in a battle of the 1980s remakes as The Karate Kid soared above expectations easily outgunning The A-Team at the North American box office. Kid powered its way to an estimated $56M over the weekend from 3,663 theaters for a sensational $15,288 average.Produced for only $40M, the PG-rated film presented a modern take on the 1984 Ralph Macchio-Pat Morita favorite and starred Jackie Chan as the mentor. The setting was shifted to Beijing and despite the title, the film centered on kung fu instead of karate. Sony launched the marketing campaign with a highly effective trailer that used the son of Will to generate excitement with kids while also using nostalgia to pump up parents and other adults. Add in an end-credit song from teen sensation Justin Bieber (with a rap by Jaden) and a much-talked-about promotion at last weekend’s MTV Movie Awards and young people were hyped up and ready to buy tickets.[rtimage]MapID=1226668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Despite a lengthy 140-minute running time, Karate pleased audiences with an encouraging A CinemaScore grade and even scored an exceptionally high 94% in the top two boxes from exit polls. Females made up 53% of the crowd while 56% was under 25. It was the ninth biggest June opening of all-time and sixth best when only counting live-action films. Will Smith routinely opens summer blockbusters in the $50M range and contributes to his own soundtracks and now has a son following in his footsteps. Overseas potential is formidable especially across Asia.Opening far back in second place was The A-Team with an estimated $26M coming in below expectations. The Fox release launched very wide in 3,535 locations and averaged $7,355 per theater. A remake of the 1980s action television series, the PG-13 film starring Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper witnessed a slight 4% dip on Saturday and may not have the positive buzz needed for a long summer run. Reviews were mixed. In the battle of the 80s flicks, The A-Team and The Karate Kid were expected to have been much closer in ticket sales this weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1197695&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After a three-week reign at number one, Shrek Forever After continued to show off the strong legs seen by most 3D films these days. The ogre flick declined by only 38% which was impressive given how much Karate Kid was taking away business from family audiences. Forever broke the $200M mark and boosted its cume to $210.1M.Universal’s Get Him to the Greek enjoyed the smallest decline among last weekend’s four new releases dipping 43% to an estimated $10.1M in fourth place. The raunchy rock star comedy has collected $36.5M in ten days and could be headed for a finish in the neighborhood of $65M. Fellow sophomore Killers fell by 48% to an estimated $8.2M giving Lionsgate $30.7M. Look for a $50M final.[rtimage]MapID=10011824&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Filling up the next four spots were a video game, comic strip, television show, and comic book all turned into feature films. Tumbling 53% to an estimated $6.6M was Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time which has collected just $72.3M in 17 days for Disney. Fox’s Marmaduke fell 48% in its second round to an estimated $6M putting the ten-day sum at $22.3M. Falling 55% to an estimated $5.5M in its third lap was Sex and the City 2 which has taken in a disappointing $84.7M to date.Iron Man 2 came within a hair of joining the triple-century club with its weekend estimate of $4.6M. Off 43%, the Paramount release jumped up to $299.3M putting it at number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters surpassing the $296.6M of last November’s The Twilight Saga: New Moon.

Debuting far back in second, butalso surging past industry expectations, was Sandra Bullock’s new football picThe Blind Sidewhich got off to a fantastic start. The two new female-driven films attractedover $175M in combined ticket sales leading the top ten to soar to ajaw-dropping $245M.Audiences wanted monster love as The TwilightSaga: New Moon stunned the film industry by beating what were alreadysky-high expectations opening to an estimated $140.7M over the Friday-to-Sundayperiod. That gave Summit the third best opening weekend ever trailing the superhero duo of TheDark Knight ($158.4M in July 2008) and Spider-Man 3($151.1M in May 2007). However, New Moon did break the all-time recordsfor highest post-midnight grosses on the night before opening day with $26.3Mand the best opening day with $72.7M. The records were formerly held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Dark Knight with$22.2M and $67.2M, respectively. The Twilight sequel cost only $50M toproduce while the others cost well over $200M each.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=52&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Bella Swan love story grossed more in its first day than its predecessor Twilight did in its entire opening weekend. That film bowed this weekendwith $69.6M on its way to $191.5M from North America and $384M worldwide.Following New Moon‘s record opening day, the PG-13 film tumbled 41% to$43.2M on Saturday and is estimated to drop another 43% to $24.8M on Sunday. TheFriday-to-Saturday decline was identical to Twilight‘s which is quiteremarkable given how the new installment had much more fan hysteria surroundingit and 605 more theaters leading one to think it would absorb more of its totalbusiness upfront on the first day. Both installments earned 52% of the totalweekend gross on Friday.Other records set include best November bow and best non-summer openingsurpassing the $102.3M of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which had set both of thosemilestones four years ago this very weekend. Young women have been the drivingforce behind the Cullen franchise since the publication of the popular books,but mature women have also made up a sizable portion of the fan base. Studioresearch showed that 80% of the audience this weekend was female with those overand under age 21 evenly split. That translates to females under the age of 21spending about $56M this weekend to see Kristin Stewart choose between RobertPattinson and Taylor Lautner.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=50&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]As if the domestic performance was not impressive enough, New Moonattacked 25 foreign markets this weekend too and hauled in an estimated $118.1Mmaking for a staggering global debut of $258.8M. Summit has worldwide rights buthas assorted distributors doing the releases across the globe. The company hasalready filmed the third pic in the series, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,which will be ready for a June 30 release when students will be out of schooland ready for more from the vampire-werewolf teen tale. The date is theWednesday before the long Independence Day holiday frame.Led by Twilight, the overall marketplace surged to the second highesttotal in box office history trailing only the July 18-20 frame last year when The Dark Knight had its record bow and Mamma Mia debuted well insecond. The Top 20 that frame pulled in $257.6M while this weekend’s will comevery close with $254M, if estimates hold. Also amazing this weekend was thatdespite the sheer domination of New Moon, moviegoers still found time tospend another $105M on the rest of the films in the top ten. That bodes well forthe upcoming five-day Thanksgiving holiday session which kicks off on Wednesday.Five months after breaking her career opening weekend record, Sandra Bullock didit again with the football drama The Blind Sidewhich performed much better than expected with a $34.5M debut, according toestimates. The figure edged out the $33.6M bow of her hit summer comedy TheProposal which gave America’s favorite bus driver her previous best mark.Opening in 3,110 locations, the Warner Bros. release averaged a sturdy $11,096per site. Reviews were generally good and football movies often draw largecrowds. Based on a true story, Blind Side tells of a homeless black youthtaken in by a rich white family that helps him launch a successful footballcareer.[rtimage]MapID=1206167&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=54&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The PG-13 film was expected to collect about half as much since its older femaleaudience would be distracted by Twilight which has a large fan base ofmoms. But the marketplace expanded and had plenty of room for both. The blondeBullock’s film skewed 59% female and 75% to those 25 or older, according tostudio research. The road ahead looks bright with the actress set to score hersecond $100M blockbuster of the year after nearly a decade without any.[rtimage]MapID=1212694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=28&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After ahuge top spot debut last weekend, the doomsday actioner 2012 plunged 59% to anestimated $26.5M and ranked third for the frame. The pricey $200M film hasgrossed $108.2M in ten days in North America and looks to reach the vicinity of$160M domestically. Overseas, the global disaster pic remained a red hotperformer grossing an additional $100.5M to boost its international tally to$341.1M and the worldwide haul to a stunning $449.3M. 2012 is already theseventh biggest global blockbuster of the year and in another week it willshatter the half-billion mark and leap into the top five.Sony didn’t fare too well with the animated comedy Planet 51 whichbowed in fourth with a lukewarm $12.6M, according to estimates. The PG-ratedtoon landed in 3,035 theaters and averaged a mild $4,152 per site. Produced bySpain’s Ilion Animation Studios, the pic features Dwayne Johnson voicing a U.S.astronaut that touches down on a planet he thinks is barren only to discover acivilization of green beings that resembles 1950s America. Reviews were bad andthe 2D look just wasn’t what kids were looking for in a world now dominated by3D animation. Sony is hoping to pick up some more families over the comingholiday weekend, although that audience will get fragmented since Disneylaunches the Robin Williams-John Travolta starrer Old Dogs and Fox goesnationwide with its animated film Fantastic Mr. Fox.[rtimage]MapID=1200415&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=40&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s A Christmas Carol fell 45% to an estimated $12.2M in its third roundpushing the total to $79.8M.

Widening from 174 locations in ten markets to 629 theaters inover 100 cities, the R-rated hit averaged a fantastic $17,501 per location andlifted its total to $21.4M. By comparison, Oscar winner No Country For OldMen expanded nationally this same weekend in 2007 from 148 to 860 theaterswhile also in its third session and grossed $7.8M for a weaker $9,043 average.Its 17-day cume was $16.3M representing just 22% of its eventual $74.3M finaldomestic tally.

Taking home the silver and bronze medals respectively were the fantasy pic Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians: The Lightning Thief and the monster flick The Wolfman which finished the three-day race just $473,000 apart. Powered by these three big hits, the Top 20 surged to $190M, a new all-time high for this holiday.Moviegoers looking for love lifted the star-studded ensemble comedy Valentine’s Day to number one with an astonishing estimate of $52.4M resulting in the third largest opening ever in the month of February. Warner Bros. launched the PG-13 film ultrawide in 3,665 theaters and averaged a sensational $14,300. Very few live-action comedies have ever debuted north of $50M making Day‘s performance remarkable. Those that have included star vehicles (Bruce Almighty‘s $68M), sequels (Austin Powers in Goldmember‘s $76.6M) and franchise pics (Sex and the City‘s $56.8M).[rtimage]MapID=1219218&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=51&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Critics panned Valentine’s Day giving it some of the worst reviews of the year so far, but audiences paid no attention and responded to the abundance of stars (Julia Roberts, Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Alba, Jennifer Garner, Jamie Foxx, Bradley Cooper, Anne Hathaway, Queen Latifah, Taylor Lautner, Taylor Swift among others), a strong marketing push, and the timely release over Valentine’s Day weekend. The date pic charmed another $30.4M from overseas audiences in 52 markets for a $83M global gross.There was a close battle for second place but initial studio estimates put Fox’s Percy Jackson &amp; The Olympians in the runnerup spot by a slim margin with an estimated $31.1M in its first weekend. The PG-rated fantasy adventure averaged a solid $9,267 from 3,356 locations. Reviews were mixed, but the best among the three new wide openers. With schools out on Monday, Percy aims to widen the lead over the four-day stretch.[rtimage]MapID=1214096&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal debuted its monster movie The Wolfman in third with an estimated $30.6M from 3,222 sites for a muscular $9,506 average. Produced by and starring Benicio Del Toro, the R-rated chiller played more to fans of horror and thrillers and stood out from the weekend’s other offerings. Reviews were mostly bad. Overseas, it scared up $21M from 37 markets for a worldwide bite of $52M.Together the three new releases grossed a staggering $114M over three days and will likely boost that tally to about $135M over the Friday-to-Monday long weekend. That’s almost twice the $72.1M that last year’s trio of new films collected over the same four-day holiday. In 2008, four films launched over the Presidents’ Day frame grossing $90.4M over four days.[rtimage]MapID=1194949&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar dropped down to fourth place but only lost 4% of its weekend gross taking in an estimated $22M propelling the record cume to $659.6M. The Fox overachiever should shatter the $700M mark before March arrives. Internationally, James Cameron was still on top with another $59M boosting the overseas haul to $1.69 billion and the worldwide tally to an eye-popping $2.35 billion.The hit tearjerker Dear John fell 50% from its solid opening and grossed an estimated $15.3M pushing the ten-day tally to $53.2M. The Sony release could end up with an impressive $80-90M.

John Travolta (the Tatum of the late 1970s) saw his new action thriller From Paris With Love bomb settling for third place. Overall ticket sales slipped from last weekend thanks in part to the Super Bowl distracting millions of Americans.The young ladies couldn’t resist a man in uniform as the soldier story Dear John surged past industry expectations to capture the top slot at the multiplexes with an estimated $32.4M opening weekend. Invading 2,969 theaters, the PG-13 drama starring Tatum and Amanda Seyfried averaged a muscular $10,913 per site. Eager to take credit for the remarkable performance were Relativity Media which produced and Sony’s Screen Gems unit which handled marketing and distribution duties. It was the biggest opening ever over Super Bowl weekend beating the $31.1M of the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus 3D concert film from two years ago which played in just 683 locations but charged $15 per ticket for a scorching $45,561 average.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With Hollywood too busy in recent weeks rolling out underperforming films from over-50 actors like Travolta, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford, neglected teen girls found in Dear John the exact type of entertainment they were looking to pay top dollar for. According to Sony’s research, a whopping 84% of the audience was female while 64% was under 21. The $25M film opened better than From Paris With Love, Edge of Darkness, and Extraordinary Measures – combined. John even powered ahead of the $27.8M debut of the star-studded book-based date flick He’s Just Not That Into You from exactly one year ago.Reviews were mostly bad so the studio instead took its case directly to the customers scheduling many word-of-mouth screenings to build buzz and promoting the film with the U.S. Army and other military organizations. The lead actors were also sent to strategic locations for public appearances where, conveniently, teenage girls went into screaming frenzies. Dear John benefited from a release date just a week before Valentine’s Day and had a built-in audience of readers of the Nicholas Sparks book. 2004’s The Notebook, also based on one of his novels, turned into a major sleeper hit that summer. His next book-turned-movie The Last Song stars Miley Cyrus and hits cinemas at the end of next month over Easter weekend opposite the 3D actioner Clash of the Titans.[rtimage]MapID=1220192&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After its seven-week reign at the top of the box office, James Cameron’s Oscar-nominated juggernaut Avatar slipped to second place but still generated a healthy $23.6M, according to estimates. Off 25%, the Fox smash boosted its domestic haul to $630.1M. It was only the second time in its entire run that the weekend decline was more than 20%, however much of that was due to the expected hit Sunday will take because of the Super Bowl. Compared to last weekend, Friday slipped by 19%, Saturday dipped by 18%, and Sunday is projected to fall by 39%. For this weekend, the studio is forecasting a rather low 48% drop from Saturday to Sunday. Most distributors are factoring in declines of over 60% because of the Big Game.Overseas, Avatar grossed an estimated $75M this weekend, down 21%, lifting the record international tally to $1.58 billion and the global tally to an eye-popping $2.21 billion. Reaching $2.5 billion should be easy for the 3D extravaganza.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Action fans showed little interest in John Travolta’s bald head and goatee as the actor’s latest offering From Paris With Love bowed in third place with an estimated $8.1M from 2,722 theaters for a weak $2,983 average. The R-rated espionage thriller was directed by Pierre Morel whose hit thriller Taken was the big surprise winner over last year’s Super Bowl frame. This time, moviegoers were not excited and mostly avoided the French-set action flick. Reviews were negative for the Lionsgate release.Audiences abandoned Mel Gibson as his revenge thriller Edge of Darkness tumbled by 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $7M. After ten days, the Warner Bros. release has collected $29.1M and is headed for a finish of roughly $45M. On the other hand, Dwayne Johnson’s kidpic The Tooth Fairy posted another good hold in its third round dropping 35% to an estimated $6.5M. Fox’s 17-day total stands at $34.3M.[rtimage]MapID=1202110&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Falling a steep 55% in its second weekend was the romantic comedy When in Rome which grossed an estimated $5.5M putting the ten-day sum at a decent $20.9M for Buena Vista. Following in seventh was The Book of Eli with an estimated $4.8M, off 46%, giving Warner Bros. $82.2M to date.Fox Searchlight expanded its Oscar contender Crazy Heart from 239 to 819 theaters and saw ticket sales climb 58% to an estimated $3.7M for an eighth place finish. Averaging $4,457 per site, the Jeff Bridges starrer scored three nods for Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Song. The film has already earned many wins in the actor and song categories of other awards groups. Cume is now $11.2M.[rtimage]MapID=1200453&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony’s supernatural thriller Legion tumbled 53% to an estimated $3.4M lifting its cume to $34.7M. Sherlock Holmes rounded out the top ten and broke the double century mark in the process. The Robert Downey Jr. pic fell 42% to an estimated $2.6M raising the total to $201.6M. It became the record tenth release of 2009 to jump the $200M mark. With $242.5M from overseas markets, the global tally for the Guy Ritchie-directed franchise-starter now stands at an impressive $444M.Oscar nominees for Best Picture that are still in theaters benefited from the higher profile. Witnessing smaller declines than before were The Blind Side which dipped 14% to an estimated $2.6M and Up in the Air which slipped 16% to an estimated $2.4M. Totals are $241.6M and $76.7M, respectively. Lionsgate’s Precious expanded from 222 to 669 locations but still struggled with audiences. Despite more than doubling its weekend gross, the urban drama took in an estimated $435,000 averaging only $650 per site. Total is $46M.[rtimage]MapID=1208108&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.6M which was up 2% from last year’s Super Bowl frame when Taken opened in the top spot with $24.7M; and up 3% from 2008’s football weekend when Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds 3D debuted at number one with $31.1M.

Three new films without 3D trips into outer space opened to mixed results with the thriller Legion leading the way in second place with a solid showing. The family comedy The Tooth Fairy saw mild business in fourth while moviegoers ignored the drama Extraordinary Measures which landed in seventh. Films with major Golden Globe wins all witnessed small declines.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=31&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]There was no stopping Avatar which slipped a remarkably low 16% in its sixth frame and grossed an estimated $36M to remain atop the North American box office. After only 38 days of release, the Fox smash catapulted its total domestic gross to an eye-popping $552.8M and on Saturday surpassed The Dark Knight to seize the number two spot on the list of top-grossing domestic blockbusters of all-time. It now trails Titanic‘s $600.8M by a mere $48M and will break the 12-year-old record next week with ease. Avatar also set a new record for best gross in the sixth weekend of any film’s release beating the iceberg pic’s $25.2M from this very frame in 1998. The Pandora hit has grossed north of $35M in each of its six weekends – another industry first.In the world of actual tickets sold, Avatar trails numerous films from the past like 1990’s Home Alone, 1994’s Forrest Gump, and 2002’s Spider-Man. But in the world of grosses – the actual dollar amounts that participating production, distribution, and exhibition companies will be dividing up and stuffing their pockets with – the Na’vi hit is now in the same league that Titanic‘s strength has been powered in part by Saturday surges. The Golden Globe winner for Best Picture – Drama took in $9.1M on Friday, soared by 81% to $16.5M on Saturday, and is estimated to dip 37% to $10.4M on Sunday. 3D and IMAX screens are also at the center of the public fascination with the film as people are continuing to pay extra for this next-generation moviegoing experience. At Avatar‘s current pace, reaching the $700M domestic barrier cannot be ruled out.The Cameron megahit is still a durable smash overseas as international audiences have not had enough. The overseas tally hit an estimated $107M this weekend, off a slim 14%, boosting the international haul to a staggering $1.288 billion beating Titanic‘s record of $1.242 billion. The global gross now stands at a jaw-dropping $1.841 billion for Avatar putting it a mere $2M behind the long-standing record of $1.843 billion set in 1998. Avatar will have no problem crashing through the $2 billion worldwide mark in the coming weeks as it topples all of Titanic’s major box office records.[rtimage]MapID=1216680&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In the weekly battle to be the top non-Avatar film, Sony scored a hit with its supernatural thriller Legion which debuted to an estimated $18.2M from 2,476 theaters for a strong $7,351 average. The R-rated effects film starring Paul Bettany, Tyrese Gibson, and Dennis Quaid played to young men done with Pandora. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male and 54% was over 25. Legion cost $25-30M to produce.Denzel Washington’s apocalyptic thriller The Book of Eli dropped a moderate 48% to an estimated $17M and placed third this weekend. After ten days, the R-rated actioner has taken in a solid $62M for Warner Bros. and has a chance at becoming the Oscar-winning actor’s fourth career $100M+ hit.[rtimage]MapID=1202110&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Rock generated mild results for his latest entry into the family film market The Tooth Fairy which bowed to an estimated $14.5M from 3,344 sites for a mediocre $4,336 average. Dwayne Johnson’s PG-rated tale of a hockey superstar that becomes, yes, a tooth fairy played mostly to kids and parents. Reviews were bad, but probably had little impact.Off 48% in its second weekend of wide play, Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones dropped to fifth with an estimated $8.8M lifting the total to $31.6M. Paramount might end up with around $50M which didn’t seem possible just two weeks ago. Sherlock Holmes held strong easing only 28% to an estimated $7.1M in its fifth frame. The Warner Bros. hit has banked $191.6M and next week will become the tenth film from 2009 to break the $200M hurdle.[rtimage]MapID=1220547&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford failed to excite adult audiences with their new drama Extraordinary Measures which opened in seventh with only $7M, according to estimates. The first release from CBS Films averaged a weak $2,746 from 2,549 locations and played best in the midwest, southeast and mountain areas. The PG-rated film drew poor reviews which had an impact on the older-skewing audience.[rtimage]MapID=1209288&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With Fox’s own Tooth Fairy taking away kids looking for goofy comedy, the studio’s smash Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel fell 44% to an estimated $6.5M for eighth place. But the runaway hit did break the double century mark this weekend pushing its total to $204.2M.Universal’s adult comedy It’s Complicated still held up well dipping only 24% in its fifth round to an estimated $6.2M boosting the total to $98.7M. Look for the Meryl Streep pic to break the $100M mark by the end of the week. Jackie Chan rounded out the top ten with his kidpic The Spy Next Door which fell a troubling 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $4.8M. Lionsgate has grossed only $18.7M in ten days and should finish with $27-29M. Chan will try to attract a larger audience this summer when he stars in the China-set remake of The Karate Kid opposite Will Smith’s son Jaden.The top ten films grossed $126.1M which was up 6% from last year when Paul Blart: Mall Cop opened in the top spot with $21.6M; and up 16% from 2007 when Meet the Spartans debuted at number one with $18.5M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adventure, show","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Takes-Sixth-Consecutive-Weekend"},{"id":"47509136874403","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Continues To Dominate","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Continues To DominateThe Book of Eli and The Lovely Bones round out the top three.by Sujit Chawla | January 17, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, or a fifth straight weekend James Cameron’s Avatar controlled the box office setting another milestone as it moved past Star Wars into third place on the all-time domestic box office chart. Watch out The Dark Knight, you’re next.The unstoppable force that is Avatar dropped a slim 18% from last weekend and brought in another $41.3, according to estimates, bringing its total to an other-worldly $491.7M. Internationally, the film has now made $1.1B, which is just a hop, skip and a jump from Titanic‘s current record of $1.2B. Combined, the 3D sci-fi adventure flick has made an astounding $1.6B worldwide in only five weeks and the only question now is when it’ll beat Titanic, not if.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Book of Eli gave it a valiant effort, but fell short this weekend, taking in $31.6M according to estimates. That’s good enough to give Denzel Washington his second biggest opening weekend ever, behind only 2007’s American Gangster which shot up $43M in its opening weekend on its way to a final gross of $130M. The Book of Eli averaged a very strong $10,162 this weekend which could portend good things for the future.Rising up to third place this weekend after a nationwide rollout was Peter Jackson’s The Lovely Bones. The movie version of the bestselling novel brought in $17M, according to estimates, for an above average per screen take of $6,656. Reviews had been mixed for the dark tale of a murdered girl who narrates her life from the beyond, but apparently there were enough fans of the book that wanted to see the film regardless of the reviews.[rtimage]MapID=1189344&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=40&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A couple of holdovers rounded out the top five this weekend, flipflopping positions from the last few weeks. Fourth place went to the squeaky Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel which sang to the tune of $11.5M this weekend, according to estimates, down only 30% from last weekend. Its total now stands at $192.6M, which is just a stone’s throw from the original’s $217.3M final total. Fifth place went to the dashing duo Holmes and Watson as Sherlock Holmes brought in another $9.8M, according to estimates, down 41% from last weekend, bringing its cume to $180M.Debuting softly in sixth place was Jackie Chan in The Spy Next Door. The spy-turned-babysitter film took in $9.7M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screen average of only $3,317. Apparently families have not had their fill of singing rodents leaving Mr. Chan and his brood out in the cold.[rtimage]MapID=1220593&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Universal took the next two spots on the chart with It’s Complicated and Leap Year. Complicated took in $7.6M in its fourth weekend of release, according to estimates, bringing its total to $88.2M and a shot at the $100M mark definitely within reach. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Leap Year, starring Amy Adams, which fell a reasonable 36.7% from last weekend to an estimated $5.8M. Its total stands at $17.5M and should end its run with around $35M.In ninth place was the surprise hit of the season, The Blind Side which just keeps rolling along, this time taking in $5.6M, according to estimates, bringing its total to a tremendous $226.7M. And in tenth place was George Clooney’s award-bait Up in the Air which fell 23.7% from last weekend to $5.4M, according to estimates. The total now stands at $62.8M with a lot more to come if it can win a few major awards in the next few weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1212694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A couple of last weekend’s debuts dropped heavily in their sophomore frame as Daybreakers fell 67% to an estimated $5M and Youth in Revolt fell 59% to an estimated $2.8M. Totals are $24.1M and $11.9M respectively, which not a lot more left in the tanks.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Paramount, Disney, One, PaleyFest, Prime, Starz, critics, league, blockbuster, Annual, Netflix, VOD","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Continues-To-Dominate"},{"id":"47509136875428","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Is Still #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Avatar Is Still #1Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and the Chipmunks retain second and third spots.by Gitesh Pandya | January 10, 2010 |  CommentsThis weekend, successfully defending his land from intruders like the Na’vi, James Cameron had no problem staying put at number one at the North American box office for a fourth consecutive weekend with his futuristic megablockbuster Avatar which grossed more than all three new releases combined. The silver and bronze once again went to Sherlock Holmes and Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel while the vampire pic Daybreakers led the new films with a decent fourth place debut. Avatar, meanwhile, showed enough strength around the world that it has now put Titanic‘s all-time records in jeopardy.Tripling its nearest competitor’s grosses, Fox’s Avatar enjoyed yet another remarkable frame on top taking in an estimated $48.5M as the 24-day cume skyrocketed to an unbelievable $429M. Its 29% decline was the smallest of any film in wide release proving that the 3D adventure is still pulling in moviegoers even after the close of the busy holiday season. In its fourth round, Avatar is still averaging a muscular $14,173 per theater. Generating sizable grosses during the holidays is common, but to remain this strong in January is uncommon.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=33&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The decline is especially impressive since Friday last weekend was the New Year’s holiday which boosted business for all films. Compared to last weekend’s daily numbers, Friday this weekend fell by 48% but Saturday slipped by only 18% while Sunday is estimated to dip by just 20%. Saturday’s $21.3M was incredibly strong this weekend as the 60% increase from Friday’s $13.3M was tops among all non-kiddie movies. In fact, Saturday was bigger than the entire weekend grosses for any other film. Titanic and Star Wars Episode I also enjoyed supercharged Saturday grosses during their leggy runs. Avatar‘s performance is outstanding given that it is a male-skewing action film competing against the start of the NFL playoffs which featured games on both Saturday and Sunday this weekend.Avatar‘s three-day tally was easily the biggest gross ever for any film in its fourth weekend of release beating the old $28.7M record from 2,746 sites of Titanic from this very same frame twelve years ago. At today’s ticket prices, that would amount to $45M and it wasn’t in 3D meaning the two films sold about the same amount of tickets at this stage of the release. The 3D adventure’s third and fourth weekends now rank as January’s two biggest weekend grosses ever. The month’s biggest opening frame is $40.1M by 2008’s Cloverfield. No other films, debuting or holdover, have ever broken $40M in a January session.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=31&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Avatar smashed the $400M mark on Saturday in just 23 days making it the second fastest movie in history behind The Dark Knight which only needed 18 days in 2008. After 24 days, the Pandora film is running a mere 3% behind the pace of the Joker flick which had amassed $441.6M at this same point in its run. By this coming Saturday, Avatar should surpass the pace of Knight and eventually finish ahead of that film’s monster $533.3M cume.On the all-time domestic blockbusters list, Avatar surged to number seven between the $431.1M of 1999’s Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and the $423.3M of 2006’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. By Tuesday it will rise to number four passing Shrek 2 and E.T. Admissions, of course, are another story. Should Avatar continue on a course that sees moderate 35% weekly declines, it would be able to reach at least $581M domestically while a more durable run could see it break Titanic‘s $600.8M benchmark.[rtimage]MapID=1194501&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=21&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Defying gravity, Avatar actually saw international sales rise this weekend by 5% to an estimated $143M helped in part by a record-breaking opening week in China. That shot the overseas total to a mind-boggling $906.2M boosting the worldwide tally to $1.3352 billion. A whopping 68% of sales are coming from the offshore markets and that ratio should climb as the film’s strong domestic legs are overshadowed by phenomenal staying power internationally. Overseas business accounted for 75% of this weekend’s $191.5M global take. Avatar now looks very likely to break Titanic‘s long-standing $1.8 billion record to become the number one global blockbuster of all-time.Not having the same legs at the box office was Sherlock Holmes which tumbled 55% in the third weekend suffering a sharp fall now that the holiday season is gone. Still, the Warner Bros. franchise hopeful did remain the biggest non-Na’vi film in the land for the third straight frame and has bumped its 17-day total to an impressive $165.2M. Breaking the $200M mark is still a possibility.[rtimage]MapID=10010659&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Also falling sharply was Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel which stayed put in third with an estimated $16.3M dropping 54%. Fox has banked $178.2M with its franchise pic and is still on course to fly past the $200M mark just like its predecessor. Together, the two Chipmunks films should total over $430M just from North America.Lionsgate enjoyed a decent debut for its vampire thriller Daybreakers which landed in fourth place with an estimated $15M from 2,523 locations. The R-rated horror entry averaged a solid $5,945 and even drew good reviews from critics which is rare for this genre. Ticket sales dipped 5% on Saturday after the opening day so the usual rapid erosion is likely.Universal followed with a pair of chick flicks anchored by the stars of last summer’s Julie &amp; Julia. The Nancy Meyers film It’s Complicated starring Meryl Streep fell 42% to an estimated $11M in its third session boosting the 17-day total to $76.4M. Debuting in sixth place was the Amy Adams engagement comedy Leap Year which didn’t fare that well with audiences with an estimated $9.2M bow from 2,511 locations. Averaging only $3,650 per site, the PG-rated film skewed heavily towards women with females making up 79% of the audience and 54% being 30 or older. Reviews were horrendous. It did not come close to the $19.8M of last year’s Bride Wars or the $23M of 27 Dresses – both January comedies aimed at young women.[rtimage]MapID=10011994&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]In its eighth weekend, Sandra Bullock’s The Blind Side finally dropped below the $10M mark grossing an estimated $7.8M for seventh place. The sleeper smash slipped only 35% and upped its amazing cume to $219.2M. Paramount’s awards contender Up in the Air followed with an estimated $7.1M, off just 34%, for a $54.7M total.The Weinstein Co. saw a weak opening for its teen comedyYouth in Revolt which debuted down in ninth place with an estimated $7M from 1,873 sites for a mild $3,737 average. The R-rated Michael Cera pic attracted favorable reviews but its target audience of young adults had bigger films in the marketplace to take away their attention.[rtimage]MapID=1200671&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten was Disney’s The Princess and the Frog with an estimated $4.7M in its seventh round, down a steep 52%, pushing the cume to $92.6M.The top ten films grossed $143.2M which was up 18% from last year when Gran Torino opened wide in the top spot with $29.5M; and up a healthy 45% from 2007 when The Bucket List debuted at number one with $19.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Teen, The, Valentine's, American, Islander","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Avatar-Is-Still-1"},{"id":"47509136893868","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2012 Destroys the Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: 2012 Destroys the CompetitionPlus, A Christmas Carol gets #2, and Pirate Radio capsizes.by Gitesh Pandya | November 15, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Audiences were warned – by Mayans and film critics alike – but moviegoers around the world still flooded the multiplexes to see Roland Emmerich’s latest disaster epic 2012 which generated an explosive global debut. Last weekend’s top film A Christmas Carol held up well in its second weekend taking the runner-up spot while the awards hopeful Precious expanded moderately but raced all the way up to number four despite playing in fewer than 200 theaters. Overall ticket sales were slightly behind last year’s levels, but well ahead of 2007.Blasting past expectations, Sony scored its best opening of 2009 with 2012 which grossed an estimated $65M this weekend from North America alone. As big as it was, that amount represented just 29% of the global haul which soared to $225M thanks to a stunning $160M from 105 international territories. The doomsday thriller cost at least $200M to produce and was backed with an expensive worldwide marketing push which paid off.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The PG-13 pic opened domestically in 3,404 theaters and averaged a sensational $19,095. Sony estimated that opening weekend sales hit $23.6M on Friday, inched up 5% to $24.8M on Saturday, and will drop by a slim 33% to $16.6M on Sunday. If the estimate holds, 2012 will have the seventh largest November debut ever. The disaster pic played to a broad audience as studio research showed that males made up 52% of the crowd and 55% were 25 or older. Critics slammed the movie with negative reviews taking major aim at its script.Overseas, 2012 delivered the fifth largest international opening of all-time and the largest ever for a non-sequel. Emmerich’s previous disaster films have played especially well around the world so his newest one was always expected to be a global performer. Even with large declines in the weeks ahead, the worldwide gross may soar north of $500M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=1205696&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After a soft opening at number one last weekend, Disney’s 3D holiday offering A Christmas Carol displayed good legs dipping only 26% in its sophomore outing to an estimated $22.3M. The expensive Jim Carrey vehicle has taken in $63.3M in ten days and is playing out like the studio’s 2002 holiday pic The Santa Clause 2 which also was released on the first weekend of November. Carol and Clause had similar openings of $30.1M and $29M, respectively, and the Tim Allen sequel bagged another $24.7M in its second weekend pushing its ten-day score to $60M. The only major difference was the drop as Clause 2 eased by just 15%. The latest motion capture project from Robert Zemeckis could finish up with around $130M depending on how it holds up over the lucrative Thanksgiving session.George Clooney’s The Men Who Stare At Goats fell 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.2M but remained in third place with a cume of $23.4M in ten days. Overture may find its way to $35-40M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=1217605&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A hair behind in fourth place was Lionsgate’s awards contender Precious which rocketed up the charts thanks to an expansion from 18 to 174 locations delivering an estimated $6.1M gross for the weekend and a dazzling $35,000 average per theater. Reaching the top ten usually requires at least 1,000 theaters, but to hit the top five with under 200 venues is virtually unheard of. Backed by promotional clout from executive producers Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, the R-rated tale of an abused pregnant teen from Harlem continued to show remarkable strength proving it wasn’t just some one-week wonder. Precious opened in new markets such as San Francisco, Houston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. plus expanded into more theaters in its initial markets of New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago.Cume is $8.9M which is just the tip of the iceberg as the well-reviewed film will expand nationally this month plus it has awards season ahead of it when nominations and wins could keep it going all the way to March 7 when Oscars are handed out. This Friday, Lionsgate will widen Precious into roughly 600 theaters across more than 100 markets throughout North America and will add more playdates for Thanksgiving.[rtimage]MapID=1208108&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Michael Jackson’s This Is It stumbled in its third round falling 61% to an estimated $5.1M boosting the 19-day take to $67.2M. Sony continued to see bigger numbers overseas as the international take for the weekend was $11.5M. The collection of concert rehearsal footage has now grossed $155.4M overseas and a stellar $222.6M worldwide. A whopping 70% of the tally to date has come from outside of North America.Universal’s alien abduction chiller The Fourth Kind took a tumble in its second frame falling 61% to an estimated $4.7M lifting the ten-day tally to $20.6M. A $27-29M final seems likely. The studio has fared much better with its relationship comedy Couples Retreat which broke the $100M mark in its sixth weekend grossing an estimated $4.3M. Down just 31%, the Vince Vaughn vehicle has displayed great legs this fall and has upped its cume to $102.1M giving the actor his seventh hit to join the century club. The former swinger has also headlined $100M+ grossers in five of the last six years.[rtimage]MapID=1209302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Also breaking nine digits was the indie thriller Paranormal Activity which scared up an estimated $4.2M, off 49%, for a $103.8M sum for Paramount. Overture’s top-grossing film ever Law Abiding Citizen followed by dipping 35% to an estimated $3.9M for a $67.3M total. The Cameron Diaz flop The Box rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.2M, down a sharp 58%, raising the cume to a measly $13.2M after ten days. Look for a $17-19M final for Warner Bros.The British pic Pirate Radio was lost at sea and failed to find its way into the top ten during its opening weekend. Focus bowed the Philip Seymour Hoffman film in 882 locations and attracted just $2.9M worth of business, according to estimates, averaging a poor $3,253. Mixed reviews and a lack of starpower hurt the 1966-set tale of rebel radio DJs.[rtimage]MapID=10011834&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]But Fox enjoyed spectacular results for its stop-motion animated film from director Wes Anderson, Fantastic Mr. Fox, which debuted in only four theaters but grossed an estimated $260,000 for a stunning $65,000 average. That was similar to the $67,469 average of the filmmaker’s last entry The Darjeeling Limited although that one opened on a Saturday so its figures were for two days instead of three. The PG-rated Fox, which features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Bill Murray, will expand into more than 2,000 theaters on Wednesday, November 25 for the Thanksgiving frame. The studio is hoping that loyal Anderson fans in New York and Los Angeles will help spread the word allowing it to find broad appeal by the long holiday session.The top ten films grossed an estimated $125M which was down 7% from last year when Quantum of Solace opened in the top spot with $67.5M; but up a healthy 38% from 2007 when Beowulf debuted at number one with $27.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"renewals, Adult, Marvel, cartoon, Watching, Rock, live","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-2012-Destroys-the-Competition"},{"id":"47509138515900","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission Accomplished For G-Force","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Mission Accomplished For G-ForceHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Ugly Truth round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | July 26, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend audiences shifted their attention from teen wizards to talking guinea pigs as Disney’s 3D action film G-Force pulled an upset at the North American box office knocking Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince out of the top spot in its second weekend. The Hogwarts flick fell sharply but still pulled in a solid gross and continued its sensational run around the world. Mature audiences came out in impressive numbers for the Katherine Heigl-Gerard Butler comedy The Ugly Truth which opened well in third place.Families rushed to multiplexes to see adorable talking animals as G-Force powered its way to the top spot with an estimated $32.2M from an ultrawide release in 3,697 theaters. Averaging a healthy $8,697 per theater, the PG-rated action-adventure about guinea pig government spies connected with family audiences and took advantage of higher-priced tickets from its 1,600 3D locations. With almost $500M spent this summer on 3D toons Up and Ice Age, kids and parents were ready to move on to a live-action film that still offered clean and fun entertainment for children of all ages. The Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer brand names also added some weight.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]G-Force continued the studio’s great summer following Up and The Proposal which also debuted at number one. The trio could end up grossing a powerful $550M or more combined.Dropping to second place was the film most expected to top the charts, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which grossed an estimated $30M in its second weekend. The wizard sequel fell a steep 62% which was completely expected given the last film’s 58% sophomore drop. After 12 days, the newest Potter has banked an impressive $221.8M putting it 7% ahead of the pace of 2007’s Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which stood at $207.9M at the same point in its run. Factoring in ticket price increases, the two films have sold an identical amount of tickets over their first 12 days, although Prince did it with virtually no IMAX sales. Phoenix grossed a slightly better $32.5M in its second frame.With the bulk of its IMAX run to start this Wednesday, Half-Blood Prince could be on its way to a domestic total of $300M or a bit more. Overseas, the new Hogwarts tale fell sharply but still led the international box office with a muscular $84.4M from over 16,000 screens in 64 markets boosting the overseas total to an eye-popping $405.3M and the worldwide tally to a stunning $627.1M. The dazzling performance this weekend led to two major milestones — Warner Bros. smashed the $1 billion mark in overseas box office for 2009 and the Harry Potter franchise shattered the $5 billion mark across its six films in eight years. The series has grossed $5.1 billion and counting and should reach at least $5.4 billion with two more installments still to come.[rtimage]MapID=1189302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony targeted the date crowd and scored an impressive opening for its romantic comedy The Ugly Truth which bowed in the third slot with an estimated $27M from 2,882 theaters. The R-rated pic averaged a strong $9,368 which was tops among films in the top ten. It also underscored the growing box office clout of Katherine Heigl who enjoyed a $23M debut last year anchoring the comedy 27 Dresses. Studio research showed that 62% of the audience was female while 64% was over 25. Adult women and couples have had no new films specifically for them over the past month as most movies have targeted kids, teens, or the action crowd. The lack of competition helped the $38M production overcome horrible reviews from critics and last week’s sneak previews helped to spread advance buzz.The new horror title Orphan performed moderately in its debut grossing an estimated $12.8M from 2,750 locations this weekend. Bowing in fourth place with a decent $4,644 average, the R-rated thriller about a creepy girl adopted by unsuspecting parents performed much like past fright flicks like One Missed Call and The Eye which opened to $12.4M and $12.5M, respectively.[rtimage]MapID=1207460&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox’s hit toon Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs lost audiences and 3D screens to the guinea pigs this weekend and suffered its worst decline yet falling 53% to an estimated $8.2M. With a solid $171.3M in the bank, a final gross close to the $195.3M of Ice Age: The Meltdown and $197.8M of this spring’s 3D flick Monsters vs. Aliens still seems likely. Overseas, Dawn shattered the half-billion mark with an estimated $40.6M this weekend from 102 markets for an international cume of $505.4M and a dizzying global tally of $676.7M.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen fell out of the top five in its fifth weekend, but it did climb into the All-Time Top 10 list. The robot sequel scored an estimated $8M, down 42%, boosting the total to $379.1M after 33 days of release. That puts Michael Bay’s critically-panned testosterone flick at number 10 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters bumping off Oscar champ The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which took in $377M in 2003 and 2004. The Peter Jackson adventure sold more tickets though since ticket prices have increased since then. Reaching $400M should not be a problem for em&gt;Transformers which will end up selling about as many tickets as 1997’s Men in Black, another summer sci-fi smash executive produced by Steven Spielberg.[rtimage]MapID=1188000&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A week away from joining the All-Time Top 50, The Hangover enjoyed yet another solid frame grossing an estimated $6.5M, off just 21%, giving Warner Bros. a $247.1M total. A hair behind in eighth place was another successful summer comedy The Proposal which slipped only 23% to an estimated $6.4M for a $140.1M cume. This is the sixth straight weekend that the two comedies were side-by-side on the charts although Sandra Bullock spent the first five times on top.Universal rounded out the top ten with the gangster drama Public Enemies with an estimated $4.2M and the fashionista pic Brüno with an estimated $2.7M. The Johnny Depp vehicle fell 46% raising the sum to $88.1M while the Sacha Baron Cohen pic tumbled 67% for a $56.5M cume.[rtimage]MapID=1200814&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $138M which was down 19% from last year when The Dark Knight stayed in the top spot with $75.2M; and also down 19% from 2007 when The Simpsons Movie debuted at number one with $74M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"play, President","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Mission-Accomplished-For-GForce"},{"id":"47509138511802","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Support G.I.

Joe to a hugenumber one opening grossing more than the next five films combined by targetingyoung males. Meryl Streep held her own against all the military hardwaregenerating a strong second place showing for her turn as a celebrity chef in Julie &amp; Juliawhich played well to adult women. Entertaining entirely different audiences, thetwo new releases joined forces to help the North American box office break afour-week losing streak as the marketplace beat out last year’s numbers by ahealthy margin.Attacking an ultrawide 4,007 theaters, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobraposted the fourth largest August opening ever taking in an estimated $56.2M thisweekend. The Paramount hit averaged a muscular $14,025. With an additional $44Mfrom foreign bows in numerous territories, the PG-13 film collected $100Mworldwide in its first weekend of play. After its Transformers sequel gotpanned by critics but attracted massive crowds of moviegoers as 2009’s topblockbuster, the studio decided to limit the number of press it would show Joeto ahead of the release. The only films to open bigger in August were TheBourne Ultimatum ($69.3M in 2007), Rush Hour 2 ($67.4M in 2001), andSigns ($60.1M in 2002).Studio research showed that males made up 60% of the crowd while those over andunder 25 were evenly split. Families made up one-third of the audience while 25%of the turnout was Latino. Friday started with a bang with $22.3M in ticketsales. Saturday saw a 18% fall to $18.3M while Sunday is estimated to decline byanother 14% to $15.7M. Produced for a hefty $175M and marketed aggressively tomainstream American moviegoers looking for escapist popcorn fare, G.I. Joeopened as the final major action tentpole of the summer and faced littlecompetition from similar titles.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Adultwomen not interested in mindless violence lined up for the Meryl Streep-AmyAdams pic Julie &amp;Julia which opened to a strong $20.1M, according to estimates. Playingin 2,354 theaters, the PG-13 film averaged a strong $8,539 per location and waseffective counter-programming against the testosterone blast of G.I. Joe.If estimates hold, Julie will give Streep a $20M+ opener in three of thelast four summers with each one programmed against a male-skewing actiontentpole. In 2006, her comedy The Devil Wears Prada debuted to $27.5Mopposite Superman Returns while last summer’s musical Mamma Mia!bowed to $27.8M against the record launch of The Dark Knight. Now 60, Streep hasbecome a potent box office star in her later years.Produced for just $38M, Julie enjoyed a 17% sales bump on Saturday andscored an encouraging A CinemaScore grade making the road ahead look verypromising. Films targeting older women tend to have legs too so a final grossnorth of $80M could result. Studio research from Sony indicated that the filmconnected with its target audience as 67% was female and 64% was 35 or older.Reviews were positive and moviegoers came out to see the Oscar winner play chefJulia Child.[rtimage]MapID=1207146&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s3D actioner G-Force dropped 44% but remained in third place taking in an estimated$9.8M pushing the cume to a robust $86.1M for the expensive pic.

But with ticket pricesrising by 7% over the last two years, Prince has actually sold slightlyless stubs than Phoenix. A final domestic tally of about $300M still seemslikely.

Fallingfrom first to fifth place, the R-rated dramedy raised its ten-day cume to adisappointing $40.4M and is likely to end its domestic run with a dismal$60-65M. That’s a far cry from Apatow’s previous R-rated summer comedies The40-Year-Old Virgin ($109.2M) and Knocked Up ($148.8M). Funny‘sfailure to please crowds will also put an end to Sandler’s streak of sevenconsecutive years with $100M+ grossers.

With its $38M pricetag, Ugly cost substantiallyless than both Funny People and Brüno and will gross much morewinning the three-way battle of the R-rated July comedies.More bad news for Universal came in seventh place where its suspense thriller A Perfect Getawaygrossed a weak $5.8M, according to estimates, in its opening weekend. TheR-rated fright pic averaged a dismal $2,670 from 2,159 locations.

Holdovers and formerchart-toppers Inglourious Basterds and District 9 bothheld up well making it that rare frame when violent R-rated films claimed thetop four spots at the box office. The on-screen carnage drove ticket sales to anall-time high for the weekend before the Labor Day holiday session closing offan exceptionally powerful August box office.Audiences were in the mood to cheat death as The Final Destination scared its way to a strong top spot debut grossingan estimated $28.3M in its first weekend. The fourth installment in thenine-year-old franchise attacked 3,121 theaters and averaged a sturdy $9,079 persite bolstered by higher ticket prices from the 3D screens. Just under 1,700theaters offered the 3D presentation while the remainder screened the 2Dversion. As with most 3D releases, many multiplexes offered both versions somoviegoers could choose between the extra-dimensional fun or the standardversion at the standard price.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Itwas by far the largest opening ever for the franchise beating the $19.2M bow ofFinal Destination 3 from February 2006, and the first to reach numberone. However, when factoring in today’s higher ticket prices and the extrasurcharges that 3D venues collected, the new chapter only sold about 5% moretickets. Still, it proved that moviegoers are willing to pay more for 3Dentertainment and that many genres can benefit from the technology. Finalis the fourth 3D film of the year to open atop the charts after kidpics Monsters vs. Aliens, Up, and G-Force. It also beat out the$21.2M debut of January’s 3D horror entry My Bloody Valentine.Also impressive was how well the new Destination did against suchformidable competition. Halloween II took away a good portion of thehorror crowd and Basterds and District also played to some of thesame violence-loving audience. The gruesome foursome combined for a stellar$76.5M which was equal to what the top thirteen films took in during this verysame weekend last year. Budgeted at about $40M, The Final Destinationwill now try to challenge Friday the 13th‘s $65M to become thetop-grossing horror title of 2009. Nine R-rated films have opened at number onethis year including four during the last five weeks.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=18&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]QuentinTarantino’s war fantasy InglouriousBasterds enjoyed a solid second weekend despite the arrival of two newR-rated gorefests. The World War II saga dropped by 47% to an estimated $20Mputting the ten-day total at a robust $73.8M. The sophomore fall was much morelike the director’s Kill Bill Vol. 1 (44%) than its followup Kill BillVol. 2 (59%). Audiences are liking Basterds and good word-of-mouth ishelping the theatrical run. Budgeted at $70M, a final domestic haul of roughly$125M seems likely. Overseas moviegoers are also turning out in solid numbers asthe film, released by Universal abroad, grossed an estimated $19.4Minternationally this weekend boosting the overseas total to $59.1M. That putsthe global take at $133M and counting. Worldwide grosses should eventuallysurpass $250M.The Weinstein Co. seized third place too with Halloween IIwhich bowed to an estimated $17.4M from 3,025 sites. Generating a respectable$5,754 average, the R-rated terrorfest is the sequel to the 2007 reboot of thethree-decade-old franchise which launched on the same weekend, but with a muchstronger $26.4M over three days. That film bowed in 447 more theaters and hadthe horror audience all to itself as no other fright flick ranked in the Top 20.Both films were helmed by rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie.[rtimage]MapID=1207868&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=05&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Havinganother horror sequel to compete with on opening weekend certainly made thingsmessy for Halloween II. However even with large declines in the weeksahead, it should be a profitable picture given the low production cost of $15M.Audience research showed that 54% of the crowd was under 25 and males andfemales were evenly split. Expect this one to fade fast as Saturday salestumbled 27% from Friday’s opening day tally. Final Destination held upbetter dipping only 6% on Saturday.The cat food-loving aliens of District 9 came infourth place. Sony’s sci-fi hit slipped only 41% to an estimated $10.7M raisingthe cume to an amazing $90.8M after just 17 days. Look for the prawns to smashthe $100M mark next weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1190668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Leadingthe films that younger people could buy tickets to was Paramount’s G.I. Joe which rankedfifth with an estimated $8M. Off 35%, the $175M-budgeted action extravaganzalifted its cume to a solid $132.4M. Few thought at the beginning of the summermovie season that Joe would outgun Terminator Salvation but thereal American hero has now surpassed the $125.3M of the non-Arnold cyborgsequel.For the third straight weekend the chick flicks Julie &amp; Juliaand The TimeTraveler’s Wife were chart neighbors, but the former’s great legsallowed it to have the upper hand this time. Sony’s Meryl Streep hit Juliaeased by a slim 16% to an estimated $7.4M with an impressive $71M cooked up sofar. The $100M mark might now be within reach.

The PG-13 film averaged aweak $2,691 from 1,393 locations and failed to spark any nostalgia with babyboomers.Bookending the top ten with 3D movies, Disney took in an estimated $2.8M for itsfamily actioner G-Force which dropped 31% in its sixth mission lifting the total to$111.8M.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=27&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Moviegoerscontinued to catch up on the summer’s biggest blockbusters which witnessed smalldeclines this weekend.

Leading the way was the new adventure pic Where the Wild Things Are which bowed at number one followed by an exceptionally strong debut for the action entry Law Abiding Citizen in second. The most impressive performance came in third with the national expansion of the indie thriller Paranormal Activity which delivered the best average of any film. The four new wide releases kicked in a stunning $86M powering the Top 20 to $135M, a new record high for the month.Audiences rushed out to see Where the Wild Things Are making the adaptation of the popular kids book the top film with an estimated $32.5M in ticket sales. Averaging a ferocious $8,693 from 3,735 theaters, the PG-rated pic scored the eighth biggest October opening ever and the third highest for a kidpic during the month trailing only Shark Tale ($47.6M in 2004) and High School Musical 3 ($42M in 2008). It was also the second widest launch during the month after Shark Tale‘s bow in 4,016 locations.[rtimage]MapID=10008827&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=49&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]While the opening weekend was undoubtedly powerful, the long-term outlook is not as clear. Friday began with a potent $12.1M debut but Saturday inched up only 2% to $12.3M. Family-oriented films during the school year typically see large Saturday jumps in sales thanks to the target audience being more available. In recent weeks, Friday-to-Saturday increases on opening weekend for kidpics Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Toy Story double feature were 62% and 69%, respectively. Wild Things seems to be playing more to an adult audience appealing to those who read the book as a kid and to hipsters who enjoy director Spike Jonze’s unique style of filmmaking.Jonze took a nine-sentence book, stretched it into a 100-minute movie, and added plenty of new material including names and backstories for all the Wild Things and a deeper look into the home life of the nine-year-old boy at the center of the story. Reviews have been mixed with critics having a wide range of feelings for the film. Warner Bros. invested heavily into the marketing of Wild Things hoping to appeal to the broadest possible audience since the movie is not the typical family film that Hollywood churns out. The $75M production unspooled in 145 IMAX locations which accounted for $3.1M, or nearly 10% of the weekend tally.[rtimage]MapID=10008827&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=45&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Liam Neeson isn’t the only actor from across the pond to hit it big with a revenge thriller this year. Gerard Butler enjoyed a surprisingly potent bow for the action drama Law Abiding Citizen, also starring Jamie Foxx, which grossed an estimated $21.3M from 2,890 theaters for a stellar $7,353 average. The R-rated story of a man that plots a series of assassinations from jail to get back at those responsible for the killings of his wife and daughter played to a broad audience with males slightly outnumbering females. Neeson’s kidnapping thriller Taken was an unlikely blockbuster last winter when it bowed to $24.7M over Super Bowl weekend on its way to a $145M final.Butler and Foxx are certainly no guarantees at the box office. The former’s action pic Gamer opened to just $9.2M last month while the latter’s The Soloist debuted to a weak $9.7M in April. But the actor combo, the appealing storyline, and an aggressive marketing push helped to make it the biggest opening ever in Overture’s short history easily beating the $16.3M of last fall’s cop drama Righteous Kill with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Citizen should have no problem beating Kill‘s $40.1M total to become the distributor’s top grosser too.[rtimage]MapID=1198026&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=36&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Paramount expanded its micro-budgeted horror hit Paranormal Activity nationwide this weekend following three weeks of limited play and saw sales nearly triple to an estimated $20.2M. Freaking out moviegoers in 760 theaters, up from 160 last weekend, the R-rated spookfest averaged a sensational $26,530 per location matching almost to the dollar the $26,528 average of The Blair Witch Project when it went nationwide during the summer of 1999. That indie overachiever shot up to number two on the charts in its third weekend when it expanded from 31 to 1,101 theaters grossing $29.2M.In its first day of wide release on Friday, Paranormal took in $6.7M, then rose 15% to $7.7M on Saturday. The studio is projecting a slim 25% dip on Sunday to $5.8M. The total now stands at $33.7M with another expansion set for this Friday as it goes head-to-head with the opening of the latest installment of the horror industry’s top franchise Saw VI which attacks 3,000 theaters. Still, with the much-talked-about ghost story continuing to add theaters, and Halloween two weeks away, Paranormal Activity has the potential to finish with at least $75M.Continuing to use out-of-the-box marketing tactics to generate excitement (and sales), the studio has launched a contest that will reward the first ten theaters that sell out their midnight shows this Thursday night with a special party. This promotion is just the latest technique that keeps fans involved with the film’s release as it further infiltrates pop culture. To date, the marketing and distribution campaign has been executed with military precision.[rtimage]MapID=10010502&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Last weekend’s top choice Couples Retreat suffered a rocky second outing dropping 48% to an estimated $17.9M despite not having any new comedies enter the marketplace. With a solid $63.3M taken in over ten days, Universal should find its way to a final domestic tally of $100-110M making it only the second film of the year to join the century club for the troubled studio. Fast &amp; Furious grossed $155.1M last spring. Vince Vaughn’s 2006 Universal relationship trouble flick The Break-Up, which like Retreat he also produced, witnessed an identical 48% plunge in its sophomore frame.Sony’s latest horror film The Stepfather had a lukewarm $12.3M debut in fifth place, according to estimates. The PG-13 thriller averaged a decent $4,499 from 2,734 locations and skewed towards young women. Studio research showed that 54% of the audience was female and 55% was under 21 for the $19M production. Sony usually does better with its mid-October fright films. Last year, Quarantine bowed to $14.2M, 30 Days of Night debuted to $16M in 2007, and The Grudge 2 opened to $20.8M in 2006. The added competition from Paranormal Activity made an impact.[rtimage]MapID=1207147&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The animated comedy Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs broke the $100M mark on Thursday in its 28th day of release and added an estimated $8.1M to its total over the weekend. That gave the Sony hit a slender 30% decline and a new total of $108.3M which is remarkable for a fall pic. Meatballs is only the fourth September release of this entire decade to cross the century mark joining Remember the Titans ($115.6M in 2000), Sweet Home Alabama ($127.2M in 2002), and Eagle Eye ($101.4M in 2008).The studio claimed the next spot too with the horror-comedy Zombieland with an estimated $7.8M, down 47%, resulting in a cume of $60.8M. Disney extended the limited run of its double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) beyond its planned two-week period and grossed an estimated $3M in its third round. Tumbling 61%, the dynamic duo raised the sum to $28.6M in 17 days.[rtimage]MapID=1207888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=23&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Rounding out the top ten were Buena Vista’s Surrogates and the Warner Bros. pic The Invention of Lying with an estimated $1.9M each.

The frame’s three other new releases got the cold shoulder from moviegoers but the overall top ten surged ahead of last year and 2007 by more than 25%. Holdovers contributed too as no film in the top ten declined by more than 50%.Scoring his best opening ever in terms of both gross and admissions, Quentin Tarantino was once again on top of the movie world with his newest feature Inglourious Basterds which bowed to a stellar $37.6M, according to estimates. The much-needed hit for The Weinstein Co. averaged a sizzling $11,880 from 3,165 theaters and beat out the filmmaker’s previous career best delivered by 2004’s Kill Bill Vol 2 which the Weinstein brothers released when they were with Miramax. That bridal revenge saga bowed to $25.1M which would be about $30M at today’s prices.[rtimage]MapID=1200615&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=149&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Basterds, an ensemble film that co-stars Brad Pitt as a leader of an American military group out to kill Nazis during the second World War, was the fifth R-rated film to top the charts this summer and along with last weekend’s District 9 gave the marketplace back-to-back $37M+ R openers. Films in the second half of August rarely debut north of $30M.Reviews were generally positive for Tarantino’s newest venture which cost a reported $70M with Universal co-financing. Friday kicked off with $14.4M, Saturday dipped 10% to $12.9M which was not uncommon for this type of film from a popular director, and Sunday is estimated to dip 20% to $10.3M.Tarantino also scored career best debuts around the world in several countries as the Europe-set drama launched in 22 territories through Universal grossing an estimated $27.5M for a glorious global opening of $65.1M. Helped by Pitt’s worldwide appeal and a largely European cast, Basterds bowed at number one in several key markets such as Australia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. A final global theatrical gross of three to four times the production budget could result.[rtimage]MapID=1200615&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=129&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Coming in behind the Nazis were the prawns of District 9. The alien drama enjoyed a solid second weekend, especially for a sci-fi film, by dropping 49% to an estimated $18.9M bumping the ten-day total to an impressive $73.5M to date. By comparison, last year’s buzzworthy documentary-style monster movie Cloverfield tumbled 68% in its sophomore frame. With a relatively low $30M production cost, Sony’s much-talked-about District 9 should find its way to a robust $120M or so from North America alone.The much pricier popcorn flick G.I. Joe, still the widest film in release by far, declined by 44% and collected an estimated $12.5M in its third mission. Averaging $3,162 from an ultrawide 3,953 locations, the Paramount release has advanced its 17-day total to a solid $120.5M and still seems likely to break the $150M level.[rtimage]MapID=1193682&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=30&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A pair of female-skewing films with different trajectories followed. The romantic drama The Time Traveler’s Wife fell a moderate 46% in its second weekend to an estimated $10M boosting the ten-day total to $37.4M. The cooking comedy Julie &amp; Julia enjoyed better legs dipping only 25% in its third outing to an estimated $9M. Sony has banked an impressive $59.3M to date.While Quentin was enjoying his best debut ever, his good buddy Robert Rodriguez suffered his worst opening ever for a wide release as family audiences ignored his new film Shorts which debuted to an estimated $6.6M. Ranking sixth, the Warner Bros. release averaged a weak $2,126 from a very wide 3,105 theaters. The performance did not come close to the openings of previous kidpics from the director including Spy Kids ($26.5M in March 2001) and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3D ($12.6M in June 2005). Shorts tells a handful of stories about a group of boys that finds a magical rock that grants wishes.[rtimage]MapID=1198526&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=29&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s G-Force held up well slipping just 39% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the total to $107.3M. Dropping 32% in its sixth round was Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince with an estimated $290.3M. Following in ninth was the romantic comedy The Ugly Truth with an estimated $2.9M, off 36%, giving Sony $82.9M to date.Opening poorly in tenth was Fox’s Post Grad with an estimated $2.8M from 1,959 locations for a dismal $1,429 average. The PG-13 pic stars Alexis Bledel of Gilmore Girls fame as a young jobless woman who recently finished college. Faring even worse was the extreme sports doc X Games 3D: The Movie which bowed to an estimated $800,000 from a very wide 1,399 theaters for an atrocious $572 average. Both new releases targeted teens and young adults in their final days of summer vacation but failed to offer anything worth paying top dollar for.[rtimage]MapID=1190015&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $108M which was up 31% from last year when Tropic Thunder remained in the top spot with $16.3M; and up 29% from 2007 when Superbad stayed at number one with $18M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"shows, Disney, aapi, Brie, Travel, Dead, Broadway, 99%, TCA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tarantinos-Basterds-Take-the-Top-Spot"},{"id":"47509138513851","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Funny People Leads Sluggish Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Funny People Leads Sluggish WeekendThe Collector takes home little loot.by Gitesh Pandya | August 2, 2009 |  CommentsComedy heavyweights Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow claimed the number one spotwith their new dramedyFunny People which debuted to only moderate results leading the entire topten to slump to its lowest point of the summer. Two other new releases, thekidpic Aliensin the Attic and the horror film The Collector,both struggled to find ticket buyers helping the North American box office onceagain fall below year-ago levels for the fourth consecutive weekend.Universal claimed the top spot withFunny People which debuted to an estimated $23.4M making for the lowestgross for a number one film all summer. Playing in 3,007 locations, the R-ratedstory of a Hollywood superstar facing death averaged a healthy $7,795 pertheater. Reviews were mixed for the reported $75M production.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Friday generated $8.7M in opening day grosses but sales tumbled 15% on Saturdayto $7.5M signaling bad word-of-mouth. The weekend estimate Universal reportedwas very aggressive as it includes a scant 3% Saturday-to-Sunday decline. Finalgrosses will be reported on Monday and the three-day figure may end up closer to$22M.Funny People, which co-stars Seth Rogen, Leslie Mann, Jonah Hill, andEric Bana, opened weaker than Apatow’s last directorial effort Knocked Upwhich bowed to $30.7M in June 2007 with a $10,690 average. With Sandler being abigger and more reliable star, Funny was expected to at least open in thesame vicinity. Even last weekend’s The Ugly Truth with Knocked Upstar Katherine Heigl did better with its $27.6M bow from fewer theaters.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]People’s Saturday drop and weak B- CinemaScore grade hints at a troubled pathahead. Audiences may be finding it too serious for an Apatow pic and notimmature enough for a Sandler flick. The actor has scored $100M hits in each ofthe last seven years (tying Will Smith) but never with an R-rated entry.Sandler’s younger fans may have been kept out because of the rating. A runningtime of nearly two-and-a-half hours also tested the patience of moviegoers.Universal has suffered through a very forgettable summer and Funny Peoplehas added another headache. Land of the Lost is considered one of theseason’s most expensive flops with less than $50M collected, Public Enemieshasn’t been a blockbuster despite the starpower, and Brüno fared wellon opening day but has been plummeting by at least 66% each weekend since. Thestudio could possibly end the summer without any $100M hits. It had four lastsummer when the it focused mostly on franchise action films.[rtimage]MapID=1205730&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=32&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With most IMAX locations finally getting to open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince this past Wednesday, the latestwizard flick enjoyed the smallest third-weekend decline for the franchise since2002. Prince’s Friday-to-Sunday take fell just 40% to an estimated $17.7Mallowing it to hold steady in second place. Domestic cume to date rocketed to$255.5M. The last Potter installment to enjoy a smaller drop in the thirdouting was Chamber of Secrets which dipped only 24% thanks to theThanksgiving holiday session.Warner Bros. was able to debut the new Hogwarts chapter in 166 additional IMAXvenues this past week following the five-week run those screens had for the newTransformers pic. That boosted the playdate count for Prince to4,393 this weekend making it the widest film release in history edging out the4,366 of last summer’s The Dark Knight, another Warners smash. The new Potter seems likely to hit $300M in North America.[rtimage]MapID=1189302&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=48&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Half-Blood Prince again ruled the overseas box office this weekend grossingan estimated $42.7M from over 13,200 screens in 64 markets propelling theinternational cume to a sensational $492.3M. The global gross flew to aneye-popping $747.8M in just under three weeks of release. Top offshore marketsare the United Kingdom with $66.5M, Japan with $50.8M, and Germany with $48.2M.Close behind in third was last week’s top entry G-Force withan estimated $17.1M for a 46% sophomore decline. It was a bigger fall than thoseexperienced by fellow summer 3D kidpics Up and Ice Age: Dawn of theDinosaurs which depreciated by 35% and 34%, respectively, in their secondweekends. After ten days, Disney’s spy actioner has grossed $66.5M and is hopingto reach $110-120M by the end of its run.[rtimage]MapID=10009462&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=26&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With a new Apatow flick in the marketplace, The Ugly Truthtook a major hit falling 53% but still collected a sizable gross taking in anestimated $13M in its second weekend. The ten-day total for Sony stands at$54.5M. Budgeted at $38M, the Katherine Heigl-Gerard Butler pic should end upwith an encouraging $90-100M. Sony hasn’t been too big of a player at the boxoffice this summer so Truth will be a welcome hit.Opening in fifth place and barely making a dent in the summer movie season wasthe new kidpic Aliens in theAttic which took in an estimated $7.8M from 3,106 theaters for a weak$2,511 average. The Fox release tried to play to families and older kids, butcouldn’t compete with the high-octane competition from all the wizards andguinea pigs infesting multiplexes.[rtimage]MapID=1197086&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The horror flick Orphan held up reasonably well dropping 44%, encouraging for a frightflick, to an estimated $7.3M boosting the total to $26.8M in ten days.

The BuenaVista release has been a consistent go-to choice for adult women and couples.Falling 43% to tenth place was the year’s largest hit Transformers: Revenge ofthe Fallen with an estimated $4.6M raising the cume to $388.1M.Scaring up little excitement outside of the top ten was the new horror film TheCollector which debuted poorly with an estimated $3.6M.

The violent horror-comedy Zombieland enjoyed a strong debut in first place bumping the studio’s animated 3D pic Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs into second after two weeks on top. But some other studios collected a bit of cash too. Disney’s double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) drew impressive numbers in third while Warner Bros. saw lackluster results for its Ricky Gervais comedy The Invention of Lying in fourth. Debuting less impressively were Drew Barrymore’s roller derby flick Whip It and Michael Moore’s documentary Capitalism: A Love Story which both tied for sixth.Audiences didn’t skip their latest chance to see characters find new ways to rid the world of the undead as Zombieland powered its way to an estimated $25M this weekend from 3,036 theaters for a muscular $8,235 average. The R-rated film starring Woody Harrelson ended a month-long streak of horror films failing miserably at the box office. In fact, Zombieland fared better than the openings of September’s Pandorum, Jennifer’s Body, White Out, and Sorority Row – combined.[rtimage]MapID=1207888&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The comical story of human survivors outsmarting an endless string of zombies appealed to moviegoers as did a quirky marketing campaign. Reviews were extraordinarily positive with many critics calling it the American answer to the British cult hit Shaun of the Dead. Studio research showed that the audience was 56% male and 58% under 25 which was not surprising for this type of pic. With a $24M budget, and early word-of-mouth being positive, Zombieland looks to become a moneymaker. In a business dominated by sequels and tentpoles, Sony has been on fire lately with a series of relatively low-cost hits including District 9, Julie &amp; Julia, and The Ugly Truth.After two weeks on top of the box office menu, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs slipped to second but only lost one-third of its business to gross an estimated $16.7M in its third course. The Sony hit toon suffered a decline that was twice as big as last weekend’s when it dipped by a mere 17%. However, with Disney stealing away 3D screens and audience attention with Toy Story, the Meatballs drop was commendable. With a stellar cume of $82.4M in 17 days, Cloudy could still go on to reach $130-140M.[rtimage]MapID=1196077&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Families flocked to the three-hour double feature Toy Story &amp; Toy Story 2 (3D) spending an estimated $12.5M to see a pair of films that have been available on video for years. The Disney stunt generated a strong $7,163 average from 1,745 digital 3D locations as the studio successfully hyped up the event nature of the release. In addition to the 3D upgrade, moviegoers got two modern classics for the price of one and enjoyed a preview of next summer’s Toy Story 3 in the middle. Disney promoted this as a two-week-only event so moviegoers responded to the limited time offer. The performance was impressive given the staying power of the new 3D hit Meatballs which is playing to the exact same audience.Ricky Gervais saw good news and bad news this weekend with his latest comedy opening better than his last, but still not putting much of a dent into the overall box office. The well-reviewed The Invention of Lying bowed to an estimated $7.4M from 1,707 playdates for a mediocre $4,306 average. Compared to last fall’s Ghost Town which debuted to only $5M, Lying‘s weekend was 47% better and its average was up 29%. But the tale of the first man in history who learns how to lie showed once again that Gervais, though highly respected, is still no bankable star at the multiplexes on this side of the Atlantic. Lying also launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland this weekend with preliminary estimates showing it in a two-way race for first place with Fame.[rtimage]MapID=1200766&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fifth place was claimed by Bruce Willis and android Bruce Willis who joined forces in the sci-fi pic Surrogates which fell 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.3M. After ten days, the Buena Vista release has grossed a disappointing $26.4M and seems headed for a $40-45M final. The action film cost $80M to produce.Two new wide openers tied for sixth place with an estimated $4.9M each. Drew Barrymore’s directorial debut Whip It didn’t whip up too much excitement averaging a mild $2,820 from 1,720 sites. The roller derby pic was released by Fox Searchlight and garnered strong reviews. Also faring well with critics but not paying moviegoers was Michael Moore’s Capitalism: A Love Story which expanded nationally after a sizzling limited bow last week. The filmmaker’s latest doc averaged $5,042 from 962 theaters seeing just moderate results that did not match up to Moore’s previous hits. 2007’s Sicko also expanded wide in the second weekend and grossed a similar $4.5M but from a more narrow release in 441 locations for a solid $10,208 average. Capitalism may have gone too wide, too fast. Cume is $5.3M.[rtimage]MapID=1202767&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]MGM’s dance remake Fame stumbled 53% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $4.8M. The $18M-budgeted film has grossed $16.6M in ten days and should end its run with roughly $25M. Matt Damon followed with The Informant! which collected an estimated $3.8M, off 43%, for a $26.6M total for Warner Bros. Jennifer Aniston’s Love Happens rounded out the top ten dipping 36% to an estimated $2.8M giving Universal a weak $18.9M to date.In limited release, Paramount saw sensational results for its unorthodox release of the no-budget horror film Paranormal Activity which is only playing midnight shows in selected theaters. The Slamdance hit sold out every one of those showings grossing an estimated $535,000 from only 33 locations for an amazing $16,212 average. Paramount will expand on Friday to over 40 cities with theaters playing the film throughout the day with normal showtimes in hopes of a bigger breakout hit in the weeks leading up to Halloween.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89.9M which was off 1% from last year when Beverly Hills Chihuahua opened in the top spot with $29.3M; but up a healthy 42% from 2007 when The Game Plan remained at number one with $16.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Valentine's, CW, Christmas, Comic, who","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-WrapUp-Audiences-flock-to-Zombieland"},{"id":"47509138505654","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Final Destination Stays On Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Final Destination Stays On TopInglourious Basterds, All About Steve round out the top spot.by Gitesh Pandya | September 7, 2009 |  CommentsWhile the summer movie season started with a bang with the sharp claws of a mutant super hero, it ended quietly over the four-day Labor Day holiday session with the 3D horror sequel The Final Destination topping the lowest-grossing weekend of 2009. None of the three new releases managed to unseat last weekend’s box office winner and the Top 20 sunk to just $116M over four days and $91M over three days — the worst such tally of the year.With moviegoers not showing much excitement for the weekend’s new releases, The Final Destination remained at number one by default grossing an estimated $15.4M in its second round over the four-day holiday session. The Warner Bros. thriller witnessed a drop of 55% across the three-day period which was normal for fright films. After 11 days of play, the fourth installment in the successful franchise has scared up a sturdy $50.7M. A $70M final seems likely for Final which will be the best gross of the series. This weekend’s three-day take of $12.3M was the lowest for any number one film since Bangkok Dangerous bowed on top to $7.8M this weekend one year ago.[rtimage]MapID=1207470&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Brad Pitt’s supporting role in Inglourious Basterds led to an estimated $15M in ticket sales over four days in the third weekend putting it close behind in second. The Weinstein Co. release dropped moderately and raised its 18-day cume to a solid $95.2M. Overseas, Universal has grossed an additional $83.3M putting the global tally at $178.5M for the $70M-budgeted Nazi drama.Opening in third place was the critically-panned romantic comedy All About Steve with an estimated $13.9M over four days. Fox’s PG-13 film averaged a healthy $6,175 from 2,251 theaters. The turnout was larger than expected as the film took advantage of the good will generated this summer for stars Sandra Bullock and Bradley Cooper after their runaway comedy hits The Proposal and The Hangover, respectively. Plus with so many violent and male-skewing movies dominating the multiplexes over the last few weeks, Steve played as nice counter-programming to women looking for something light and funny. Critics showered the pic with some of the worst reviews of the year however, making it an early contender for Razzie nominations.[rtimage]MapID=1202106&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Gerard Butler didn’t flex too much muscle with his new action offering Gamer which debuted in fourth place with an estimated $11.2M. The R-rated pic about a gaming system where players control real people and weapons averaged a lackluster $4,476 from 2,502 locations for Lionsgate over the Friday-to-Monday period. Competition for young men was intense between all the other violent R pics in release as well as from college and pro football games over the weekend.Sony’s District 9 has become that rare sci-fi movie with legs and broke the $100M mark this weekend. The alien flick dipped to an estimated $9M boosting the total to $103.3M and counting. It is the 20th release of 2009 to join the century club. Following in sixth was the horror sequel Halloween II which collapsed in its second weekend tumbling to an estimated $7.1M for an 11-day tally of $27.1M. This latest reboot of the Michael Myers franchise could be dead, that is until it gets a new lease on life years from now.[rtimage]MapID=1190668&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=20&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Meryl Streep’s Julie &amp; Julia grossed an estimated $7M giving Sony $80.6M to date. Testosterone pic G.I. Joe fell to an estimated $6.7M lifting Paramount’s cume to $141M.Two films with just over $5M in four days rounded out the top ten. The Time Traveler’s Wife dropped to an estimated $5.5M and has taken in $55.8M thus far for Warner Bros. Miramax debuted the Mike Judge-directed comedy Extract to a weak response with audiences spending an estimated $5.3M for an average of just $3,298 over the long weekend from 1,611 locations. Reviews were mixed for the R-rated title.[rtimage]MapID=1211183&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With the summer now almost in the books, the latest cumulative grosses for the top ten movies of the season included $400.7M for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, $297.6M for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, $290.9M for Up, $272.2M for The Hangover, $257.2M for Star Trek, $194.2M for Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, $179.9M for X-Men Origins: Wolverine, $176.8M for Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, $161.1M for The Proposal, and $141M for G.I.

Russell Crowe‘s murder thriller State of Play bowed in second place while Jason Statham‘s action sequel Crank High Voltage limped to a weak sixth place opening.Efron proved that he could draw a sizable crowd of paying customers outside of his safe Disney zone with 17 Again which premiered with an estimated $24.1M winning this weekend’s box office race by a wide $10M margin. The PG-13 film about a thirtysomething dad who transforms back to a teenage kid averaged a very solid $7,393 from 3,255 locations. Teens and young adults turned out in strong numbers and the teen heartthrob’s large fan base certainly followed their superstar into new territory. Efron’s High School Musical 3 carried a G rating while the musical Hairspray in which he had a supporting role was rated PG. And with 17 Again not being based on a property with a built-in audience, it proved that Efron can certainly open a film on his own when starring in the right type of project. For Warner Bros., it was the studio’s industry-leading fifth number one opener of 2009. No other distributor has more than two this year.[rtimage]MapID=1201402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Landing in second with a decent showing was the conspiracy thriller State of Play which took in an estimated $14.1M from 2,803 theaters. Averaging a commendable $5,030 per site, the PG-13 film stars Russell Crowe, Ben Affleck, Helen Mirren, Jason Bateman, Robin Wright Penn, and Rachel McAdams. Reviews were solid for the Universal release which played to a mature crowd not being served by all the younger-skewing pics in the marketplace. According to studio research, State‘s audience was 55% female and 75% over 35.Three hit holdovers followed with estimates between $12-13M. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could see chart positions change.Paramount and DreamWorks claimed third place with the animated blockbuster Monsters vs. Aliens which became the top-grossing movie of 2009. The comic actioner grossed an estimated $12.9M falling 41% in its fourth frame to boost the cume to a stellar $162.7M. Monsters also surpassed the $154.5M of last spring’s Horton Hears a Who which was the top grosser during the first four months of 2008. Monsters vs. Aliens is now on course to become the third biggest non-Shrek toon in DreamWorks history after last summer’s Kung Fu Panda ($215.4M) and 2005’s Madagascar ($193.2M).[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Disney’s Hannah Montana: The Movie was close behind with an estimated $12.7M representing a steep 61% crumble in the second weekend. A large fall was expected but the sophomore slide was a bit less than those for last year’s Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: The Best of Both Worlds and High School Musical 3 which were 67% and 64%, respectively. The new Hannah has banked an impressive $56.1M in ten days and could reach $80M by the end of its run.Fast &amp; Furious took in an estimated $12.3M, falling 55% in its third lap, and boosted its 17-day take to a strong $136.7M. Universal’s hit sequel ruled the international box office again grossing an estimated $36M this weekend from 59 territories including powerful top spot bows in Australia, Italy, and China. Total is now $145M offshore and $281.7M worldwide easily making it the highest-grossing installment of the series globally. The Furious franchise has now raced to a stunning $881M worldwide across four films.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=94&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Five Jason Statham action films in 15 months seemed to be too much for fans to handle as the actor’s latest effort Crank High Voltage stumbled with an estimated $6.5M debut putting it in sixth place. The R-rated Lionsgate sequel averaged a not-so-heartpumping $2,928 from 2,223 locations. The opening not only was weaker than the bow of 2006’s Crank ($10.5M, $4,158 average) but it also fell sharply from the debuts of Statham’s last two films Death Race ($12.6M, $4,985 average) and Transporter 3 ($12.1M, $4,594 average).Suffering the worst drop of any film in the top ten was Seth Rogen’s latest comedy Observe and Report which tumbled 63% to an estimated $4.1M. Moviegoers could be getting too much of this star as well. The Warner Bros. release has collected $18.7M in ten days and should finish in the vicinity of $25M. The Nicolas Cage actioner Knowing followed with an estimated $3.5M, off 46%, pushing the total to $73.7M for Summit making it one of the top ten highest-grossing new releases of the year.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Two more hits rounded out the top ten. Paramount’s Paul Rudd comedy I Love You, Man dropped 46% to an estimated $3.4M putting the cume at $64.7M. The fright flick The Haunting in Connecticut grossed an estimated $3.2M, down 47%, and lifted its sum to $51.9M for Lionsgate.The top ten films grossed an estimated $96.6M which was up 21% from last year when The Forbidden Kingdom opened in the top spot with $21.4M; and up 40% from 2007 when Disturbia stayed at number one with $13M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"dark, and, Oscars, series, worst, Cinematographers, south, Us","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Zac-Attacks-1-Spot-with-17-Again"},{"id":"47509139977163","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Hannah Montana Sings Her Way to the Top","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Hannah Montana Sings Her Way to the TopFast &amp; Furious holds in second, and Dragonball has no powerby Gitesh Pandya | April 12, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend the queen of teendom Miley Cyrus flexed her muscles again at the multiplexes with Hannah Montana: The Movie which defeated all competitors for a squeaky clean number one debut over the Easter holiday weekend. Former chart-toppers Fast &amp; Furious and Monsters vs. Aliens kicked in over $20M a piece powering the overall marketplace to its best showing ever for the bunny holiday.Disney ruled the North American box office with an estimated $34M opening for Hannah over the Friday-to-Sunday period as the actress/rocker’s fan base came out in droves. The G-rated film about the popular television character’s reconnection to her roots averaged a powerful $10,904 from 3,118 theaters. It was the second biggest opening ever over the Easter holiday frame trailing only 2006’s Scary Movie ($40.2M). Hannah also scored the fifth largest April debut after Fast &amp; Furious ($71M), Anger Management ($42.2M), Scary 4, and The Scorpion King ($36.1M).[rtimage]MapID=1207961&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The teen superstar first proved her box office clout last year with the music pic Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert which debuted at number one over Super Bowl weekend with a stunning $31.1M from only 683 3D venues for an eye-popping $45,561 average. Higher $15 ticket prices, a more narrow release, and the promotion of the film as a one-week-only event made it a unique player at the box office. But Hannah Montana The Movie proved that the tween brand is still strong a year later and that Miley can open a regular film on her own. Cyrus has now seen her last two films both open at number one with $30M+ debuts, something most Hollywood A-listers can’t claim. Her talent reps must now see whether she can still open a picture outside of the Hannah Montana franchise. Next up for the sixteen-year-old is The Last Song, based on the Nicholas Sparks novel, which Disney plans to have in theaters next year.The studio chose Easter weekend for Montana since most of its target audience of school children and parents would have extra time off thanks to schools being closed on Good Friday. That holiday helped propel opening day sales to a stunning $17.3M as intense demand pulled most of the crowd out in the first day. Saturday fell sharply by 40% to $10.3M while Easter Sunday is estimated by Disney to drop by 38% to $6.4M. More than half of the weekend tally was collected on Friday. The audience breakdown had no surprises – 79% of the crowd was female, 60% was under 17, and two-thirds were families.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=95&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Dropping back to second place was last weekend’s gargantuan opener Fast &amp; Furious which tumbled 59% to an estimated $28.8M in its second lap. The sophomore weekend decline was in line with past films from the franchise as 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious dropped 63% while 2006’s The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift fell by 59%. Neither had a holiday helping the second frame. After ten days, the new Furious has raced to a stunning $118M and should speed past the $127.2M of 2 Fast next weekend before eventually racing ahead of the $144.5M of the original The Fast and the Furious from 2001. A final domestic tally of $160-170M could result for the Vin Diesel–Paul Walker reunion.Overseas has been on fire too as the Universal smash grossed an estimated $46.5M this weekend from 50 territories to boost the international sum to $91M. The global gross now stands at an incredible $209M after less than two weeks and by the end of this week, the racing sequel will become the highest-grossing installment of the lucrative series on a worldwide basis. Talks have already begun on a fifth chapter starring both leads.[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Kids lured in by 3D gimmickry were still lining up for the animated adventure Monsters vs. Aliens which pulled in an estimated $22.6M in its third weekend. Off just 31%, the PG-rated smash posted a great hold and boosted its total to a stellar $141M in 17 days. Monsters is now on the same course as two recent toon sequels that made a killing running only 4% behind the pace of 2006’s Ice Age: The Meltdown and 3% ahead of last fall’s Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Those blockbusters each went on to gross north of $180M domestically and more than $590M worldwide. Meltdown, like Monsters, had Easter to help the third frame but its drop was bigger at 41% and its weekend take was smaller at $20M. By the end of the week, the DreamWorks hit will become the top-grossing film of 2009 and could find its way to the neighborhood of $190M from North America alone.This weekend underscored how big moviegoing has been this year over holiday sessions. All three holiday frames this year not only beat 2008 numbers, but soared ahead by more than 20% in each case. Compared to last year, 2009’s Martin Luther King weekend was up 24%, Presidents’ Day frame was up 33%, and the Easter session climbed 26%.[rtimage]MapID=1207394&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=10&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Monsters voice actor Seth Rogen opened a new live-action comedy Observe and Report this weekend, but bowed at number four with a mediocre $11M, according to estimates. The Warner Bros. release averaged a mild $4,085 from 2,727 sites and performed much like the actor’s last R-rated laugher Zack and Miri Make a Porno which opened to $10.1M from 2,735 locations last fall. Observe, which co-starred Anna Faris, featured Rogen playing a mall cop battling a streaker menacing his domain. Reviews were mixed.The two films that followed both enjoyed small declines over the holiday frame. Nicolas Cage‘s actioner Knowing dipped by only 18% to an estimated $6.7M for Summit boosting the cume to a solid $68M. Paramount’s comedy I Love You, Man slid by just 17% to an estimated $6.4M for a $59M total to date. Dropping 40% to an estimated $5.7M was The Haunting in Connecticut which has taken in $46.3M for Lionsgate so far.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Failing to connect with moviegoers was the new sci-fi action pic Dragonball Evolution which limped to a $4.7M debut, according to estimates, putting it in eighth place. The PG-rated film was aimed at young boys but was rejected averaging a weak $2,132 from 2,181 locations for Fox.Rounding out the top ten were Miramax’s Adventureland with an estimated $3.4M and Universal’s Duplicity with an estimated $3M. The theme park comedy fell by 40% in its second weekend and lifted its ten-day tally to a disappointing $11.5M while the Julia Roberts spy flick eased by only 28% raising the cume to $36.8M, a low figure for the A-list actress.[rtimage]MapID=1203586&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=8&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $126.4M which was up a scorching 63% from last year when Prom Night opened in the top spot with $20.8M; and up a solid 34% from last year’s Easter frame which fell in mid-March when Horton Hears a Who stayed at number one with $24.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Musical, cartoon, movies, FX","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Hannah-Montana-Sings-Her-Way-to-the-Top"},{"id":"47509139960770","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Still Choose The Hangover","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Still Choose The HangoverUp and The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 round out the top spots,by Gitesh Pandya | June 14, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend moviegoers could not get enough of Mike Tyson’s tiger as the raunchy Vegas-set comedy The Hangover spent a second weekend at number one, dropping a remarkably low amount, and is on course to become the top-grossing R-rated comedy of all time. Also holding up well was the toon titan Up which remained in second place with a small decline of its own as it attempts to become Pixar’s biggest blockbuster ever. Among new releases, Denzel Washington’s hostage thriller The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 landed in third place with a respectable bow while Eddie Murphy’s family comedy Imagine That was dead on arrival with one of the worst openings of the year.Sliding only 26% from its surprisingly powerful debut, The Hangover was once again the top choice for ticket buyers selling an estimated $33.4M worth of stubs this weekend to lead all films in the marketplace. The Warner Bros. hit has now grossed a stunning $105.4M in just 10 days. Normally only big-budget action movies join the century club this fast, not no-star comedies costing under $30M. Moviegoers that took a wait-and-see approach last weekend were infected by the buzz and the post-bachelor party flick is now broadening its audience and benefiting from strong recommendations.[rtimage]MapID=1207417&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=9&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The second weekend drop was even lower than those enjoyed by other popular R-rated summer comedies like &gt;Knocked Up (36%), Tropic Thunder (37%), and Superbad (45%). Instead, Hangover‘s decline was much like the 24% that both leggy 2005 hits Wedding Crashers and The 40-Year-Old Virgin enjoyed. Hangover had little competition from new releases this weekend for its core audience of young adults as one film was an action offering playing older and the other was a comedy that was completely ignored. The sleeper hit now looks to surge past the $200M mark and could even surpass Wedding Crashers to become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever.Holding steady in the runnerup spot with a small decline of its own was the animated blockbuster Up which took in an estimated $30.5M in its third frame. Down only 31%, the Disney/Pixar sensation boosted its 17-day cume to a robust $187.2M. Up has now joined Shrek 2 as the only animated films in box office history to gross more than $30M in each of their first three frames. Third weekend grosses for other big toon hits include $28.4M for Finding Nemo, $28.2M for Shrek, $28M for Shrek the Third, and $26.5M for The Incredibles.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Compared to Nemo, Pixar’s top performer ever, Up scored a larger third weekend gross and a smaller decline beating the fish pic’s 39% drop. Nemo took in $191.5M in its first 17 days during the same time of year on its way to $339.7M and Up now looks to be on a trajectory to break the $300M mark as well thanks to great word-of-mouth and strong repeat business.Denzel Washington faced off with John Travolta in the action remake The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 which debuted in third place with an estimated $25M. The Tony Scott-directed pic averaged a solid $8,133 from 3,074 locations and ended up in the same range as many of Washington’s previous R-rated action films. In fact, the casting of Travolta seemed to add little value at the box office. Openings for Washington include $29M for Inside Man, $22.8M for Man on Fire, and $22.6M for Training Day. Pelham gave the Oscar winner his third best career opening after American Gangster ($43.6M) and Inside.[rtimage]MapID=1207149&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=3&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox’s franchise flick Night at the Museum dipped only 34% in its fourth adventure to an estimated $9.6M. Total to date stands at $143.4M. Following its poor showing on opening weekend, Will Ferrell’s competing action-comedy Land of the Lost fell 51% to an estimated $9.2M finishing in fifth. The $100M+ production has taken in just $35M in ten days for Universal and should stumble to a lackluster $55-60M final tally.Eddie Murphy enjoyed a big win this weekend as he beat out the opening of his last dud Meet Dave. But just by an inch. The comedian’s latest attempt at PG-rated family comedy Imagine That was rejected by parents and kids opening in seventh place to a dismal $5.7M, according to estimates. Paramount released the $55M production in 3,008 theaters and was rewarded with a laughable $1,895 average. It was the third worst opening weekend average for a wide opener all year faring better than only Battle for Terra ($933 from 1,160 theaters) and Miss March ($1,383 from 1,742). In fact, the last movie to open in 3,000+ theaters and generate a lower average than Imagine That was actually Meet Dave last July with its dreadful $5.3M from 3,011 sites and $1,744 average. Big paychecks for family comedies may have dried up for Eddie.[rtimage]MapID=1190964&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Star Trek didn’t have the lowest decline in the top ten this time, but the sci-fi reboot still held up very well in its sixth round grossing an estimated $5.6M. Off only 33%, the Paramount smash lifted its total to $232M. Rival actioner Terminator Salvation followed with an estimated $4.7M, down 43%, for a $113.8M total for Warner Bros.Sony’s Angels &amp; Demons ranked eighth falling 36% to an estimated $4.2M boosting the domestic total to $123.3M. Rounding out the top ten was the horror flick Drag Me to Hell which scared up an estimated $3.9M, down 45%, giving Universal $35.1M to date.[rtimage]MapID=1189217&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=13&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Audiences have been cutting their spending on sequels this summer. Battle of the Smithsonian is running 23% behind the pace of the first Night at the Museum at the same point in its run, Terminator Salvation is 17% behind T3, and Angels &amp; Demons is 38% behind The Da Vinci Code. Add in higher ticket prices and the gaps widen when comparing admissions.Francis Ford Coppola’s new self-distributed pic Tetro debuted impressively in platform release grossing an estimated $31,339 from solo houses in New York and Los Angeles for a solid $15,670 average. Since its Thursday launch, the Buenos Aires-set drama has collected $38,169. Expanding successfully in limited play was the Focus comedy Away We Go which widened from four to 45 locations taking in an estimated $554,000 for an encouraging $12,311 average. Many indie films collapse after expanding from New York and Los Angeles but this quirky pregnancy pic showed strength in over a dozen markets making it a true independent hit attracting the non-popcorn crowd.The top ten films grossed an estimated $131.7M which was down 25% from last year when The Incredible Hulk opened in the top spot with $55.4M; and off 4% from 2007 when Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer debuted at number one with $58.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandyawww.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Awards, doctor, TCA, Nickelodeon, story, Prime, comics, Day, international","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Still-Choose-The-Hangover"},{"id":"47509142273997","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Power Knowing To # 1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Power Knowing To # 1I Love You, Man and Duplicity round out the top three.by Gitesh Pandya | March 22, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Moviegoers still love Nicolas Cage action flicks as the actor’s latest film, the doomsday thriller Knowing, easily beat out two other new releases to capture the top spot at the North American box office. Opening in second and third respectively were the buddy comedy I Love You, Man starring Paul Rudd and the Julia Roberts-Clive Owen spy pic Duplicity. With the trio of new titles pulling in over $57M, most holdovers suffered sizable drops as the overall marketplace lagged behind last year’s numbers by a slim margin.Scoring his eleventh number one opening since winning an Oscar in 1996, Cage led the effects-driven actioner Knowing to a strong $24.8M debut, according to estimates. The Summit release averaged a potent $7,447 from 3,332 theaters and gave the young studio its second number one opener in four months. The company’s vampire smash Twilight hit the top of the charts during its November launch and hit DVD this weekend with its Saturday street date. Knowing, which finds Cage playing a professor who discovers a code that can predict future disasters, was rated PG-13 and played evenly to males and females according to studio research. The audience was older as 63% of the crowd was 25 or over. Critics mostly pointed their thumbs down, but ticket buyers didn’t care.[rtimage]MapID=10003713&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=7&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The male bonding comedy I Love You, Man debuted in second with an estimated $18M for Paramount. Starring Paul Rudd and Jason Segal, the R-rated laugher averaged an impressive $6,641 from 2,711 locations and performed much like the last comedies from each actor. Rudd’s Role Models bowed to $19.2M last November while Segal’s Forgetting Sarah Marshall opened to $17.7M last April. Both carried R ratings and played to young adults just like Man reaching final tallies of $67.3M and $62.9M, respectively. Reviews were generally positive.Julia Roberts and Clive Owen debuted in third place with their caper pic Duplicity which grossed an estimated $14.4M from 2,574 theaters for a solid $5,595 average. Universal’s PG-13 film about former spies that plot a con operation against a pair of corporations marked Roberts’ first lead role in a live-action wide opener in more than five years. During that time, the Oscar-winning actress took many supporting roles in films that were not anchored by her like Ocean’s Twelve and Charlie Wilson’s War. This time around she was the main star and settled for third place, but still posted numbers that were very respectable. Openings for her films from the early part of this decade include $11.5M for 2003’s Mona Lisa Smile, $20.1M for The Mexican, and $28.1M for 2000’s Erin Brockovich. Reviews were decent and the adult female audience could continue to show up in the weeks to come. Duplicity had the best Friday-to-Saturday bump among the weekend’s new releases with 27% compared to Knowing‘s 9% and I Love You, Man‘s 7%.[rtimage]MapID=1203586&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Even with no new family films opening, Disney’s PG-rated adventure Race to Witch Mountain still suffered a sizable drop falling 47% to an estimated $13M in its second weekend. After ten days, the Dwayne Johnson starrer has banked $44.7M. Race is nearly on par with Johnson’s last kid-friendly offering for the studio, 2007’s The Game Plan, although it opened stronger and is falling harder. Game Plan bowed to $23M and dipped only 28% in the second frame for a ten-day tally of $43.2M on its way to a $90.6M final. With DreamWorks charging into theaters aggressively on Friday with its 3D toon Monster vs. Aliens which could generate the biggest opening of the year, the Disney actioner may see more big declines ahead ending its run with $80-85M.In its third weekend, the comic flick Watchmen fell another 62% and grossed an estimated $6.8M raising the 17-day cume to $98.1M for Warner Bros. At its current trajectory, the final domestic gross should finish with about $110M. Universal’s horror redo The Last House on the Left also fell hard dropping to an estimated $5.9M in its sophomore frame, down 58%, for a total of $24M in ten days.[rtimage]MapID=1184697&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The Fox companies followed with their $130M+ blockbusters. Liam Neeson’s Taken took in an estimated $4.1M in seventh place, off 38%, for a sum of $133.1M. Fox Searchlight’s Slumdog Millionaire dropped 46% to an estimated $2.7M putting its gross to date at $137.2M.Falling to ninth place was Madea Goes to Jail with an estimated $2.5M, off 51%, and a total of $87.2M for Lionsgate. The Focus 3D hit Coraline slipped only 21% and pulled in an estimated $2.1M in its seventh round. Cume is $72.8M. Each film is now the second biggest grosser ever for its distributor trailing Fahrenheit 9/11 ($119.2M for Lionsgate) and Brokeback Mountain ($83M for Focus) respectively. Coincidentally, Slumdog is Searchlight’s number two all-time hit but still has a chance of surpassing the $143.5M of Juno.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.3M which was down less than 1% from last year when Horton Hears A Who remained in the top spot with $24.6M; and down 19% from 2007 when TMNT opened at number one with $24.3M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Cinematographers, Baby, Awards, Binge, wars, American, impossible, aliens, blockbuster, Emmys, Family","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Power-Knowing-To-1"},{"id":"47509139979212","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Fast &amp; Furious Races to $72.5M Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Fast &amp; Furious Races to $72.5M OpeningMonsters vs. Aliens falls to second place. All hail Vin and Paul!by Gitesh Pandya | April 5, 2009 |  CommentsThe turbo-charged racing sequel Fast &amp; Furious crushed its competitors and blew away all industry expectations with a launch that shattered the April opening weekend box office record. And with the animated hit Monsters vs. Aliens still doing solid business in its second frame, the overall marketplace powered its way to the highest-grossing April session ever. Together, the two juggernauts grossed more this weekend than the entire marketplace did during this same frame in 2008 continuing a scorching hot year for movie ticket sales.Universal won first place by an enormous margin with the heavily-hyped Fast &amp; Furious which bowed to an estimated $72.5M from 3,461 theaters for an eye-popping $20,950 average. It was easily the biggest debut of the year racing past the $59.3M of Monsters from just last weekend, and it smashed the old record for April openers held by Anger Management with $42.2M in 2003. The fourth installment in the popular racing series even posted the second largest debut ever in the entire January-to-April corridor trailing only The Passion of the Christ‘s $83.8M from February 2004. It was a summer-like opening in the middle of spring.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=82&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new Fast not only sped past the opening weekend grosses of all previous installments in the franchise, but it also attracted a larger audience even when ticket price increases are factored in. Openings for the lucrative series included $40.1M for 2001’s The Fast and the Furious, $50.5M for 2003’s 2 Fast 2 Furious, and $24M for 2006’s The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift which featured a new cast and setting. At today’s ticket prices, those figures would amount to roughly $52M, $61M, and $27M respectively. In just three days, the new Fast even beat Tokyo Drift‘s overall total of $62.5M. With a combined $334M domestically from the first three models, the Furious franchise could now soar past the $500M mark.The wild success this weekend can be attributed to many factors including marketing, the release date, and the casting. Universal had a tough job convincing fans to take a fourth trip with the decade-old franchise and so the four primary cast members of the first surprise hit were brought back together with a brilliant campaign led by the appealing tagline “New Model. Original Parts.” The cool factor was back. Moviegoers were drawn in by the starpower and the promise of a true adrenaline rush. The studio also made a bold move shifting the release date from June 12 where it would have faced intense summer competition, to early April where the road was clear of any traffic. The PG-13 pic had teens and young adults all to itself this weekend. And the whole industry will benefit since millions of movie fans saw trailers for the first wave of summer blockbusters.[rtimage]MapID=1196211&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=83&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]For the weekend, Fast surged to a jaw-dropping $30.5M on Friday, then fell 19% to $24.7M on Saturday, and is estimated to drop by 30% on Sunday to $17.3M. College basketball semi-finals cut into some business with young males on Saturday night. If Universal’s estimate holds, it will rank as the studio’s biggest debut ever. That record is still held by Steven Spielberg’s 1997 dino-sequel The Lost World which bowed to $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of its holiday opening (or $115M at today’s prices.) Should Fast see a more common Sunday decline of 35-40%, it would still rake in $70M over the weekend. Final box office data including actual Sunday sales figures will be reported on Monday.The Vin Diesel–Paul Walker reunion also opened overseas in 32 international territories this weekend and banked another $30.1M for a global launch of $102.6M. Many top markets are still to come including Russia, France, and the United Kingdom which all open next weekend.[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=16&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]After its top spot debut last weekend, the DreamWorks Animation hit Monsters vs. Aliens fell to second place but still attracted a large audience dropping 44% to an estimated $33.5M haul. Compared to other big March toons, the decline fell in between the 35% sophomore dip of Ice Age in 2002 and the 50% fall of its sequel Ice Age: The Meltdown in 2006. The ten-day tally for Monsters rose to $105.7M which is 9% behind the pace of Meltdown after the same period of time but up 21% over the first Ice Age. Ginormica and pals may find themselves battling their way to the neighborhood of $175M domestically.The spookfest The Haunting in Connecticut fell a sharp 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $9.6M settling into third place. Lionsgate’s hit thriller has banked an impressive $37.2M in ten days and looks headed for a $50M finish.Nicolas Cage saw his latest action entry Knowing fall 45% to an estimated $8.1M giving Summit $58.2M after 17 days of release. Over the same time period, Paramount’s raunchy comedy I Love You, Man has collected $49.3M thanks to an estimated $7.9M this weekend. For the second frame in a row, the R-rated laugher posted the smallest decline in the top ten.[rtimage]MapID=1196389&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The new theme park comedy Adventureland debuted to mild results with an estimated $6M opening from 1,862 locations. Averaging a lukewarm $3,228 per theater, the R-rated coming-of-age pic starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristin Stewart earned very strong reviews but failed to capitalize on them at the multiplexes. Its target audience of older teens and young adults were clearly distracted by fast cars this weekend. Adventureland bowed to $2.2M on Friday, remained flat on Saturday with $2.2M again, and is estimated by Miramax to slip by a very low 22% on Sunday to $1.7M.The spy comedy Duplicity starring Julia Roberts and Clive Owen dropped 44% to an estimated $4.3M pushing the total to $32.4M for Universal. Following in eighth was Disney’s Race to Witch Mountain with an estimated $3.4M, down 42%, for a $58.4M sum. The John Cena actioner 12 Rounds tumbled 57% in its sophomore effort to an estimated $2.3M giving Fox a weak ten-day cume of only $9M.[rtimage]MapID=1202764&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=2&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The indie comedy hit Sunshine Cleaning starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt expanded again in its fourth weekend and jumped into the top ten right at number ten grossing an estimated $1.9M. Averaging a respectable $3,923 from 479 sites, the Overture release has successfully widened its run throughout the country each week and has upped the total to $4.8M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $149.4M which was up a stunning 96% from last year when 21 remained in the top spot with $15.3M; and up a sizable 43% from 2007 when Blades of Glory stayed at number one with $22.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandyahttp://boxofficeguru.com/","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ABC, All, cancelled, 20th, Star","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Fast-and-Furious-Races-to-725M-Opening"},{"id":"47509139963844","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Up For Pixar’s First 3D Pic","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Up For Pixar's First 3D PicDrag Me to Hell smolders in third place.by Gitesh Pandya | May 31, 2009 |  CommentsPixar and Disney celebrated their tenth straight number one smash with the 3Dflying house flick Up which enjoyed a strong openingatop the North American box office. The new horror film Drag Me to Hell played well to thoselooking for a scare with its third place finish. Most holdovers fell by morethan 50% from last weekend’s holiday session but overall sales for the top tenstill matched up to last year.Moviegoers spent the weekend with a grumpy old man and an adventurous youngscout as the animated film Up debuted at number onewith an estimated $68.2M from 3,766 locations. Averaging a stellar $18,109 perlocation, the PG-rated film continued Pixar’s lucky streak which has seen everyone of its offerings debut at number one in its first weekend of wide release.Grosses were boosted by extra surcharges that theaters collected for the 3Dpresentation, the first ever for Pixar. For example, New York City’s LincolnSquare theater charges $12.50 for regular tickets, but $16.50 for Up in3D.Showered with praise and glowing reviews from critics, Up enjoyed thefourth biggest opening of 2009 trailing just X-Men Origins: Wolverine($85.1M), Star Trek($75.2M), and Fast &amp; Furious ($71M). Friday kicked off the release with $21.4M,Saturday rose 24% to $26.5M, and Sunday is estimated to decline by 24% to$20.3M. Up unspooled in a record 1,534 3D locations with Disney reportingthose theaters grossing 2.2 times more than the regular-priced 2D screens.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=22&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Up was able to fly past the $63.1M of its studio’s last entryWALL•E, although the higher ticket prices meant theaudience size was a bit smaller. But a clear victory was won over this year’s 3Dsmash Monstersvs. Aliens from rival DreamWorks Animation which bowed to $59.3M inMarch. Not only did Monsters benefit from higher 3D prices but it alsoopened wider in 338 more locations. Up now holds the record for the biggestopening for a 3D pic.For Pixar, Up ranks as its third best debut ever after The Incredibles($70.4M in 2004) and Finding Nemo ($70.3M in 2003). And it was the sixth largest bow for anyanimated film in history behind Shrek the Third($121.6M in 2007), Shrek 2($108M in 2004), The Simpsons Movie ($74M in 2007), Incredibles, and Nemo.Disney was able to reach all audiences this weekend. Studio data showed that thecrowd was 53% female and 53% 18 and older. With a CinemaScore rating of A+, onenotch higher than WALL•E‘s A from last summer, a long life is expected.Plus kidpic offerings are light between now and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs on July 1. With more and more schoolsclosing for the school year in the coming days, Up should be able to holdup well in the weeks ahead and challenge Star Trek for the summer boxoffice crown. That is, until the mid-summer tentpoles Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince arrive.[rtimage]MapID=1195997&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=19&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]With the Pixar folks stealing away the family audience, Fox’s Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian took a sizable hitfalling 53% to second place with an estimated $25.5M in ticket sales. After tendays of release, the PG-rated comedy adventure has pulled in an impressive$105.3M becoming the tenth film of the year to join the century club. A finaltally in the vicinity of $170M seems likely putting Smithsonian aboutone-third behind the $250.9M of the first Museumwhich opened over Christmas weekend in 2006.Universal’s supernatural thriller Drag Me toHell from director Sam Raimi debuted in third place with an estimated$16.6M from 2,508 theaters for a solid $6,630 average. While not a bad opening,the debut was a bit disappointing given the starpower of the filmmaker, lack ofhorror films for two months, and the spectacular reviews from critics. FellowPG-13 spookfests The Unborn and The Hauntingin Connecticut opened to $21.1M and $23M respectively this year.Universal even generated a $21M bow for its horror pic The Strangers ayear ago this very weekend. Drag‘s 11% Friday-to-Saturday drop shouldmean a shaky road ahead.[rtimage]MapID=1198119&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]John Connor saw most of his followers vanish as the action sequel TerminatorSalvation tumbled 62% in its second weekend to an estimated $16.1Mfalling two spots to fourth place. It was a larger drop than the 56% declinesuffered by T3:Rise of the Machines in July 2003 after its extended holiday debut.Released by Warner Bros., Salvation has generated $90.7M over 11 days andlooks headed for a final domestic tally of roughly $135M. That would put the newChristianBale actioner 13% behind the $150.4M gross of T3, and a troubling 28%behind in actual tickets sold. Salvation cost a reported $200M to produceand was backed by a pricey marketing campaign. Overseas, the sci-fi film openedat number one in seven Asian territories through Sony this weekend and grossed$8.6M from 673 runs for a solid $12,700 average.Posting the smallest decline in the top ten was Star Trek whichdropped to fifth with an estimated $12.8M, down 44%. Paramount’s reboot hitcrossed the $200M mark on Friday in its 22nd day of release and became the firstfilm of the year, and first since last summer’sThe Dark Knight,to surpass the double-century mark.

The global take for Demons standsat $356.5M.Paramount’s spoof comedy Dance Flickstumbled 54% in its second weekend and ranked seventh with an estimated $4.9M.With $19.2M in ten days, the Wayans venture should finish its run with roughly$30M. The summer kickoff flick X-Men Origins: Wolverine followed with anestimated $3.9M for Fox, down 52%, for a $170.9M sum. The mutant prequel iscurrently the third biggest grosser of 2009 and may end up with $180M.

The $11 million cume for the man-machine sequel is still decent, demonstrating the fact that, contrary to US figures, the film is performing robustly in international markets. Then again, Angels and Demons has made more money than Star Trek here — so what do local audiences know?Meanwhile, Will Ferrell’s Land of the Lost — lambasted, somewhat harshly, by the Sydney Morning Herald as the worst film of 2009 — could only manage a third-place debut, and studio indie Sunshine Cleaning, starring Amy Adams and Emily Blunt, crawled into 10th place on limited release.It was encouraging news for Warwick Thornton’s Samson and Delilah, however, as the Cannes-winning Australian film continued its solid run and passed the $2 million mark in its sixth week of release.Click here for full details..","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"true, breaking, Pictures","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Boxoffice-Terminator-Hungover"},{"id":"47509139974089","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Obsessed with Interracial Catfight","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers Obsessed with Interracial CatfightEarth and Fighting open strongly.by Gitesh Pandya | April 26, 2009 |  CommentsSinger-actressBeyoncéKnowles crushed the competition with a sizzling opening for her new romanticthriller Obsessedwhich powered well past expectations to lead the North American box office overthe final weekend before the much-anticipated start of the summer movie season.Also performing well were two other new releases – the Channing Tatum dramaFighting and the naturedocumentary Earth.Not drawing big crowds was the star-combo ofRobertDowney Jr. and Jamie Foxx in TheSoloist which bowed in fourth place. Most holdovers fell sharply losing50% or more of their business, but the top ten hit the $100M mark surging morethan 30% ahead of last year’s levels ending a record April and a busy springwith a bang.[rtimage]MapID=1207523&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Sony’s Screen Gems unit tempted audiences with a well-marketed thriller and gotoff to an explosive start with Obsessedwhich grossed an estimated $28.5M in its first weekend in theaters. Busting into2,514 locations, the PG-13 pic averaged a steamy $11,337 per site and shothigher than pre-release forecasts. The hit film stars Knowles andIdris Elba asa happily married couple until a sexy young office worker (AliLarter) begins to stalk the husband. The prospect of a woman-on-woman fightpiqued the interest of moviegoers and the collision of a black couple and awhite seductress also gave the film a must-see edge.Obsessed scored the seventh largest opening ever for the month of Apriland was a new career high for Knowles when in a lead role. It was also thesecond best in company history for Screen Gems behind the $30.1M of 2005’s The Exorcismof Emily Rose. Females drove the business for Obsessed making up58% of the crowd, according to studio research, while the age range was broadwith 51% being over 25. A modest $20M budget means Sony has yet anotherprofitable hit on its hands.[rtimage]MapID=1207523&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Obsessed also gave the film industry its eighth consecutive weekend witha $20M+ opening capping off a stellar four-month start to 2009. Over the first17 weeks of the year, the number of movies opening in wide release dropped 9%(51 vs. 56 last year). However, studios were able to reduce the clutter thatoften causes many pics to fail allowing for more marketing focus on each title.As a result, box office is up 16% and admissions are up 14%. Plus the number of$20M+ openers rose from 11 last year to 18 this year while the amount of filmscrossing the $100M mark skyrocketed from just one in 2008 to six in the currentyear. The summer box office could not have asked for more momentum as it getsunderway especially since the massive April crowds have been treated to trailersand posters for the upcoming season’s big crop of blockbusters.Zac Efron‘s high school comedy 17 Againdropped from first to second place and fell by an understandable 51% to anestimated $11.7M. With a solid $40M in ten days, the PG-13 hit looks headed fora finish of $65-70M proving that the teen heartthrob of the small screen candraw paying crowds to the multiplexes even outside of a franchise.[rtimage]MapID=1201402&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Debuting in third wasChanning Tatum‘syoung adult drama Fighting which punched up an estimated $11.4M in its opening weekend.The Rogue Pictures film was released by Universal and averaged a solid $4,955from 2,309 venues. Tatum rose to fame in 2006 with the dance drama Step Up but has beenmostly absent from the box office since then, a risky move considering therapidly shifting tastes of young people. Rated PG-13, Fighting catered toteens and young adults with males excited by the fights and females coming infor the hunky lead actor. Studio research showed that males made up 58% of theaudience while 66% were under 25.Faring worst among the weekend’s three new fictional wide releases was theviolinist drama TheSoloist which debuted to an estimated $9.7M from 2,024 theaters. TheParamount release did average a respectable $4,800 per theater, but the PG-13pic starring Robert Downey Jr. andJamie Foxxfailed to make much of a dent in the overall marketplace. Reviews were mixedwhich may have sent moviegoers elsewhere and the story of a journalist who bondswith a genius musician who happens to be homeless did little to excite thepublic. Even the casting of two popular Oscar-caliber actors couldn’t push thepic into double-digit territory. The Soloist reportedly cost $60M toproduce, a tough number to recoup especially given the film’s limited appealabroad.[rtimage]MapID=1205373&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The animal documentary Earth enjoyed arobust debut grossing an estimated $8.6M in its first weekend of play. TheG-rated tale following the stories of three sets of God’s creatures averaged ahealthy $4,742 from 1,804 locations. Rarely are documentaries given a nationwiderelease in the first weekend but Disney used Wednesday’s Earth Day as alaunching pad midweek and wound up with a stellar $14.2M over the five-day debutperiod. James Earl Jones narrated the film which earned glowing reviews. Withthe summer movie season unleashing a string of violent action films, Earthcould enjoy a promising road ahead if it can connect with parents of smallerchildren looking for fun and peaceful entertainment. Hollywood has little tooffer that lucrative segment of the audience until late May when Fox unleashesNight at the Museum 2 and Disney offers up Pixar’s Up.In its fifth weekend, the animated smash Monsters vs.Aliens slipped 36% to an estimated $8.5M boosting the total to $174.8Mto date. The year’s top-grossing film is from DreamWorks and Paramount.Universal’s conspiracy thrillerState of Playdropped a troubling 51% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.9M bringing theten-day total to a mere $25.1M. Budgeted at $60M, theRussell Crowe–BenAffleck starrer should finish up with a disappointing domestic take ofaround $40M despite positive reviews from critics. State joins Soloist as thelatest star-driven dramas targeting mature adults that are failing to find bigaudiences this year following The International and Duplicity. All will end upin the $25-45M range which is not what studios were hoping for when those largestar salaries were negotiated.[rtimage]MapID=1194516&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=14&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]HannahMontana The Movie followed with an estimated $6.4M, down 53%, givingDisney a solid $65.6M after 17 days.

However, the frame’s other new films all performed well too as the North American box office remained red hot. The wedding comedy Bride Wars debuted impressively in the bridesmaid slot while the horror flick The Unborn was close behind with a third place bow. Even the more narrow opening of the marital drama Not Easily Broken generated a sensational average. Studios released their first batch of new films since Christmas Day and audiences responded by filling up multiplexes powering the Top 20 films 15% ahead of last year.to $143M.Following four weeks of amazing grosses in limited release, Gran Torino expanded from 84 to 2,808 theaters and collected an estimated $29M. Averaging a muscular $10,337, the R-rated pic about a grumpy old man and his community of Hmong immigrants gave the two-time Oscar winning director the best opening of his half-century career easily beating the $18.1M of 2000’s Space Cowboys, also a directorial and starring effort for Eastwood. That debut at today’s ticket prices would be roughly $24M which Torino still beat.Warner Bros. has successfully used this release strategy before when targeting older adults at this time of year. Last winter, the studio opened the Jack Nicholson-Morgan Freeman film The Bucket List in 16 theaters on Christmas Day before expanding it wide this very weekend last January. It also shot straight to the top of the chart and grossed $19.4M for a $6,662 average. Four years ago, Warners platformed Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby into just eight locations in mid-December and slowly added more locations before going nationwide in its seventh weekend following the announcement of Oscar nominations. It took in $12.3M in its first wide frame and averaged $6,102. Gran Torino easily outmuscled both of those films.What makes this weekend’s gross especially impressive is the fact that Torino has not been one of the top films getting all the awards buzz this winter. The studio has spent heavily on television advertising in major markets for over a month now to keep the film in the minds of moviegoers and is seeing the investment pay off. With a $40.1M cume, Gran Torino should have no problem soaring past the $100M mark to become one of Eastwood’s most popular films. His other big earners include Baby with $100.4M (about $115M at today’s prices), 1992’s Unforgiven with $101.2M ($173M today), and 1993’s In the Line of Fire with $102.3M ($175M today). Clint pics have historically had strong legs.The wedding comedy Bride Wars opened in second place pulling in an estimated $21.5M for Fox. Starring Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as best friends whose weddings get scheduled on the same day, the PG-rated pic averaged a solid $6,665 from 3,226 playdates. It was the widest of the four new films opening or expanding into wide release this weekend. Bride skewed heavily female as women made up a sizable 80% of the audience. The film played to a broad age group though as 52% of the crowd was under 25. Studios often release female-skewing films in January since the football playoffs make males harder to reach.Fox generated an opening similar to the one it enjoyed last January with another wedding-related comedy. 27 Dresses starring Katherine Heigl bowed to $23M and a $7,526 average over the three-day portion of the Martin Luther King holiday frame in 2008 on its way to $76.8M. Reviews for the $30M-budgeted Bride Wars were poor, but ticket buyers instead responded to the starpower, premise, and comedy.Universal’s supernatural thriller The Unborn was an overachiever this weekend surging past expectations to score a $21.1M opening, according to estimates. Creeping into 2,357 theaters, the PG-13 fright flick scared up a superb $8,950 average. The debut was on par with producer Rogue Pictures’ horror hit from last summer The Strangers which also exceeded pre-release forecasts during its launch which resulted in a $21M weekend and $8,515 average. Rogue was just purchased by Relativity Media.Unborn benefitted from being the first horror film of the new year so competition was minimal. Past terrorfests that found success in early January include 2006’s Hostel which debuted to $19.6M and the prior year’s White Noise which bowed to $24.1M. A slick and creepy marketing campaign plus a marketplace filled with old leftovers gave fans a reason to come out and see something new and scary. Teens and young adults made up the bulk of the audience with 75% of the crowd being under 25. Females made up 55%. Unborn kicked off a new year’s feast for horror fans who will soon be attacked by My Bloody Valentine 3D next weekend, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans on the following weekend, The Uninvited on the frame after that, and a new Friday the 13th next month on Friday the 13th.Owen Wilson, Jennifer Aniston, and the 22 dogs that played the title character of Marley &amp; Me dropped to fourth after two weeks on top and grossed an estimated $11.4M. Down a steep 53%, the Fox release upped its total to $123.7M putting it at number 17 on the list of top-grossing releases from 2008. Brad Pitt was one step behind at number five with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which collected an estimated $9.5M, off 49%, for a $94.3M cume for Paramount.Tumbling 58% was Adam Sandler’s Bedtime Stories which took in $8.6M for Disney, according to estimates, raising the sum to $97.2M. Operation Valkyrie was in effect at number seven with an estimated $6.7M, down 53%, lifting the cume for Tom Cruise and his eyepatch to $71.5M. Yet another star-driven film, Jim Carrey’s comedy Yes Man, followed with an estimated $6.2M, dropping 56%. Total for Warner Bros. is now $89.4M.Sony released the marital faith-based drama Not Easily Broken on a small scale but was met with solid results in ninth place. The PG-13 film grossed an estimated $5.6M from only 724 theaters for a terrific $7,735 average. Budgeted at just $5M, Broken played to an audience of mature women. Females made up 70% of the crowd while 69% was over the age of 30. The Morris Chestnut starrer is an adaptation of the book of the same name by pastor and author T.D. Jakes who has built up a loyal following in the African American community over the years.Rounding out the top ten was Will Smith’s odd drama Seven Pounds which crumbled by 61% to an estimated $3.9M for a cume of $66.8M for Sony. The jellyfish flick will end the superstar’s streak of eight consecutive $100M+ blockbusters which began back in 2002.Numerous Golden Globe contenders in the Drama categories continued to tout their nominations in their advertising in hopes of luring in more audiences. Best Picture nominee Slumdog Millionaire was number 11 for the weekend with an estimated $3.7M, off 21%, for a total of $34.1M for Fox Searchlight. Miramax’s Doubt which scored four acting nominations including Best Actress for Meryl Streep fell a troubling 50% to an estimated $2.5M lifting the sum to $22.9M.The Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet pic Revolutionary Road, a nominee for Best Picture, expanded from 38 to 135 sites and grossed an estimated $1.4M for a solid $10,667 average. Paramount Vantage has taken in $3.2M to date. Winslet’s other offering during awards season The Reader dipped 15% to an estimated $1.4M as well pushing the cume to $5.5M for The Weinstein Co.Focus dropped 34% with its film Milk which collected an estimated $1.3M. Starring Best Actor nominee Sean Penn, the gay rights pic upped its total to $19.1M. Fox Searchlight expanded The Wrestler starring rival Best Actor nominee Mickey Rourke from 18 to 60 sites. The New Jersey-set tale took in an estimated $874,000 for a strong $14,567 average putting the sum at $2.8M. Frank Langella is also up for the Actor prize with his film Frost/Nixon which dropped 35% to an estimated $912,000 for a $7.7M cume.The top ten films grossed an estimated $123.3M which was up a healthy 25% from last year when The Bucket List expanded wide into the top spot with $19.4M; and up a superb 36% from 2006 when Stomp the Yard opened at number one with $21.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"BAFTA, BBC, godzilla, Rocketman, twilight, rt, The, universe, TCA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Clint-Races-to-1-with-Gran-Torino"},{"id":"47509142508504","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Still #1 and Races Past $100M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Marley Still #1 and Races Past $100MTop 10 stays virtually the same for second week.by Gitesh Pandya | January 4, 2009 |  CommentsMoviegoers caught up on those holiday films they didn’t see over Christmasweekend as the top seven films finished in the exact same slots as last weekendwith the dog drama Marley &amp; Meleading the pack once again and smashing through the $100M mark too.

The holiday comedy Four Christmases led the way with a stellar number one opening while sophomores Bolt and Twilight were in a virtual tie for second place with nearly identical grosses. The top ten films grossed $154M – the best tally for the turkey holiday in eight years.Superstars Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon contributed their producing and acting talents to Four Christmases and were rewarded with a potent debut grossing an estimated $31.7M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a fantastic $46.7M over five days since opening on Wednesday. The New Line pic was distributed by Warner Bros. and averaged a stellar $9,571 from 3,310 sites over the three-day period. The PG-13 film about a couple that must attend yuletide events at the homes of each of their divorced parents was just the type of comedic entertainment that moviegoers were in the mood for during the long holiday weekend. Ticket buyers ignored the bad reviews and instead responded to the starpower, the unique premise, and the comedy. Look for both actors to add another $100M blockbuster to their resumes in the coming weeks.Jumping up one notch from last weekend, Disney’s animated flick Bolt posted a slight uptick in ticket sales for a solid holiday performance. The PG-rated toon grossed an estimated $26.6M inching up 1% from its $26.2M bow last week. Though the canine star opened weaker than expected, it made up for that shortfall by generating a sensational second weekend take. After ten days, Bolt has grossed $66.9M. The studio is hoping that it will continue to see strong legs since there will be no new kidpics released over the next two weekends.Last weekend’s top film Twilight experienced a hefty decline as expected and ranked third with an estimated $26.4M. Falling 62%, the Summit release has now banked a stellar $119.7M which is quite an impressive sum for a no-star film budgeted at only $37M. The PG-13 film averaged a sturdy $7,699 from 3,425 locations.James Bond was still a popular draw for movie fans over the holiday weekend with Quantum of Solace dropping only 27% to an estimated $19.5M. That put Sony’s domestic total at a robust $142.1M after 17 days which is 23% ahead of Casino Royale at the same point in its run and 18% ahead of 2002’s Die Another Day. The overseas total for Quantum vaulted to $340.1M lifting the global haul to a stunning $482.2M.Fox’s big-budget historical epic Australia debuted with an estimated $14.8M over three days and $20M across five days. The Hugh Jackman-Nicole Kidman film opened in 2,642 locations and averaged a respectable $5,607. But given the cost of the massive production (the studio kicked in $78M of the $130M budget) the Baz Luhrmann-directed film will need strong legs and spectacular international grosses in order to break even. According to studio research, 65% of the audience was over 25 while 52% was female. Competition for adult audiences was fierce over the holiday weekend with many choosing to spend their dollars on Four Christmases and Quantum of Solace while young women were still distracted by Twilight. Reviews were mixed for Australia and the running time of 165 minutes meant fewer showtimes per day.Paramount ranked sixth with its toon entry Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa which slipped only 7% to an estimated $14.5M boosting the overall cume to $159.5M. The sequel’s final domestic haul looks like it will end up a bit below the $193.2M of its 2005 predecessor.Delivering a seventh-place debut was Jason Statham’s action sequel Transporter 3 which grossed an estimated $12.3M over the weekend and $18.5M over the extended holiday period. The franchise showed signs of age as the five-day bow failed to match the $20.5M four-day debut of Transporter 2 which launched over the slower Labor Day holiday frame. The third chapter in the series played in 2,626 locations and averaged a decent $4,695 over the Friday-to-Sunday span. Fox released the first two pics in the franchise while Lionsgate distributed this new chapter.Universal’s hit comedy Role Models dropped by 28% to an estimated $5.3M giving the Seann William Scott-Paul Rudd pic a solid $57.9M to date.Specialty films filled up the next three positions on the charts. The Holocaust drama The Boy in the Striped Pajamas expanded again from 406 to 582 locations and grossed an estimated $1.7M this weekend. The Miramax release averaged a mild $2,904 but raised its sum to $5.2M.Sean Penn’s highly praised performance in the Focus Features release Milk helped to deliver the weekend’s best average thanks to an estimated $1.38M from only 36 theaters. Averaging a sizzling $38,361, the R-rated film about the first openly gay elected official in America won rave reviews from critics and has generated Oscar buzz for Penn who hopes to score his fourth Best Actor nod from the Academy this decade and fifth overall. The Gus Van Sant-directed film’s five-day total since opening on Wednesday is $1.9M. On Friday, Milk will expand to nearly 100 theaters and will add more runs on December 12.Danny Boyle’s Slumdog Millionaire continued its impressive limited run widening from 32 to 49 theaters for a weekend gross of $1.37M, according to estimates, putting it a hair behind in eleventh place. Cume is now $3.6M. The Fox Searchlight title averaged a potent $27,898 and will add more theaters each week in December.The top ten films grossed an estimated $154.1M which was up 10% from last year’s Thanksgiving frame when Enchanted opened in the top spot with $34.4M over three days; and up 10% from 2006’s holiday when Happy Feet remained at number one with $37M in its second weekend.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"fast, One, Christmas, Dates","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Four-Christmases-has-a-lot-to-be-thankful-for-this-weekend"},{"id":"47509142469587","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers So Into You","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moviegoers So Into YouCoraline does decent business.by Gitesh Pandya | February 8, 2009 |  CommentsThe new romantic comedy He’s Just Not That Into You featuring anall-star cast including Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck was the top choice withNorth American moviegoers.

Taken has taken in $53.4M in its first ten days, but willface direct competition this Friday when Sony’s bank thriller TheInternational debuts.The 3D stop-motion animated film Coraline openedimpressively in third place with an estimated $16.3M. Focus averaged a solid$7,105 from 2,299 theaters and proved once again how moviegoers are rushing outto theaters and paying those higher ticket prices to see films in threedimensions. With helmer Henry Selick not being a household name, the PG-rated Coraline instead was promoted as being from the director of The NightmareBefore Christmas which over the last decade and a half has become a modernclassic spawning recent 3D re-releases around Halloween time. With thePresidents’ Day holiday next weekend and many schools taking winter breaks inFebruary, the Dakota Fanning-voiced pic should be able to enjoy a healthy run inthe weeks ahead. This weekend, a whopping 60% of the total gross came from RealD’s 3D screens.[rtimage]MapID=1189949&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=46&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Families weren’t exactly cheering the arrival of a new Inspector Clouseau film.The Pink Panther 2debuted in fourth place with an estimated $12M falling 41% short of the $20.2Mfirst place bow of its 2006 predecessor which also launched in early February.Sony’s comedy sequel stumbled into 3,243 locations and averaged a mild $3,700per site.

The new comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic enjoyed an impressive bow as well while the banking thriller The International saw a lukewarm launch. Most holdovers remained very strong as Valentine’s Day falling on the prime moviegoing day of Saturday gave a big boost to multiplex traffic.Overall, the Top 20 hauled in a stunning $211M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Monday period making for the biggest Presidents’ Day session on record. And just like last month’s record Martin Luther King holiday frame, this weekend saw more business at theaters than last year’s Thanksgiving holiday frame.[rtimage]MapID=1200552&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=1&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fans flocked to theaters to see the updated Friday the 13th spending an estimated $45.2M on the horror flick over the four-day holiday weekend. Produced by New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures, the R-rated pic was released by Warner Bros. in 3,105 sites and averaged a sensational $14,560 per site oer the Friday-to-Monday span. Paramount released the first eight films in the lucrative franchise’s history from 1980 to 1989 and will handle international distribution on the new Friday. It was the biggest opening in history for a pure horror film and the best for any R-rated film since last June’s Wanted starring Angelina Jolie bowed to $50.9M. The Friday-to-Sunday portion generated a meaty $40.7M.Produced for a mere $19M by Michael Bay’s Platinum Dunes, Friday the 13th followed the company’s other successful reboots of classic horror hits like 2003’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and 2005’s The Amityville Horror which debuted to $28.1M and $23.5M, respectively. The new Jason pic also powered well ahead of the $26.4M opening of 2007’s Halloween remake by Rob Zombie. Friday‘s release on Friday the 13th helped to make this an event film for genre fans and young adult audiences. The opening day generated a killer $19.4M worth of business, Saturday fell 26% to $14.3M, Sunday dropped 51% to $7M, and Monday is estimated to slide by 36% to $4.5M. Bay is already developing a redo of A Nightmare on Elm Street scheduled for release next year with New Line co-producing and Warners distributing.[rtimage]MapID=1192140&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=4&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Following its fantastic opening, the relationship comedy He’s Just Not That Into You dropped to second with an estimated $23.4M over four days boosting the 11-day total to a robust $58.8M. Like Friday, You was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. The ensemble hit should make its way to at least $90M domestically and could leap past the $100M mark too.The sleeper action hit Taken was close behind in third place taking in an estimated $22.2M. With the three-day portion off a scant 8% to $19M, it was the strongest third weekend gross for any film since The Dark Knight narrowly edging out the $18.8M that Quantum of Solace took in during its third frame. Taken has now swiped a stunning $80.9M in just 18 days with much more still to come. The Liam Neeson hit could crack the $100M mark next weekend and will challenge Gran Torino and Paul Blart: Mall Cop for bragging rights to top grossing wide release of the year. All three have shot well beyond expectations.[rtimage]MapID=1193252&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The 3D stop-motion film Coraline delivered a terrific sophomore frame grossing an estimated $19.1M over four days with the Friday-to-Sunday part sliding a mere 9% from its opening frame. Focus has banked an impressive $39.4M in only 11 days and should be headed north of $75M. The PG-rated film featuring the voice of Dakota Fanning has easily been the top choice for families this month.Striding into fifth place was the comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic which bowed to an estimated $17.3M. Based on the best-selling book of the same name, the Buena Vista release averaged a solid $6,902 from 2,507 theaters. The PG-rated film was slammed by critics but connected with its target audience of young women as a whopping 74% of the audience was female. Shopaholic played to a broad age range with 51% being age 25 and under. It was the thirteenth film this year to open north of the $15M mark. The three-day bow was $15.1M.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Yet another PG-rated winner followed. The Kevin James smash Paul Blart: Mall Cop saw its weekend take climb to an estimated $13.9M thanks in part to a see-it-again campaign aimed at moviegoers hitting cinemas over the Washington-Lincoln holiday frame. Sony broke the $100M mark on Friday after 29 days of release and the total now sits at $112.7M. James has now outgrossed the latest comedies from many A-listers like Jim Carrey’s Yes Man ($96.4M), Will Ferrell’s Step Brothers ($100.5M), and both of Adam Sandler’s releases from last year Bedtime Stories ($109M) and You Don’t Mess With the Zohan ($100M).The studio’s other PG-rated bumbling crime-fighter film The Pink Panther 2 dropped to seventh with an estimated $10.8M and enjoyed a good hold thanks to kids having extra time off. But with $24.1M in 11 days, the Steve Martin pic is running 48% behind the pace of its 2006 predecessor which collected $46.5M in the same timeframe on its way to a $82.2M final.[rtimage]MapID=1190694&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=5&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The box office has been churning out hits consistently in 2009. Every weekend this year has been up versus the corresponding frame from 2008 with the exception of Super Bowl weekend which was just a hair behind last year’s. Seven wide openers from 2009 have crossed the $50M mark compared to just four last year at this point. The top five films so far this year have collectively grossed an eye-popping $435M which is well ahead of the $329M from last year’s five-pack at this same point in time.Debuting in eighth place with a moderate bow was the banking thriller The International which grossed $10.7M over four days from 2,364 locations for a respectable $4,526 average. Starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts, the R-rated action drama earned mixed reviews and played to an older male audience. The Sony film faced a major challenge for that crowd from the durable hit Taken which grossed nearly twice as much this weekend. Produced for $50M, The International drew an audience that was 59% male and 66% over the age of 30.[rtimage]MapID=1202802&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Fox Searchlight’s award-winning Slumdog Millionaire spent its seventh weekend in the top ten and twelfth session in the Top 12. The Danny Boyle hit grossed an estimated $8.7M over four days boosting the stellar cume to $88.1M. Slumdog should be just shy of the $100M mark come Oscar night when it competes in nine categories with its ten nominations. The sci-fi actioner Push followed with an estimated $7.9M lifting the cume for Summit up to $20.3M in ten days. A $30M final may result.Oscar nominees for Best Picture did their best to bring in ticket sales as their time as ‘contenders’ nears its end. The Reader led the way with an estimated $2.5M for a $19.5M sum for The Weinstein Co. Dropping to an estimated $1.9M was Paramount’s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which lifted the domestic tally to $122.5M. The Sean Penn vehicle Milk fell to an estimated $1.1M giving Focus $26.7M to date. Universal’s Frost/Nixon took in an estimated $597,000 and has banked $16.5M thus far.[rtimage]MapID=1192085&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed an estimated $179.2M over four days which was up 34% from last year’s holiday when Jumper opened in the top spot with $32.1M; and up 10% from 2007 when Ghost Rider debuted at number one with $52M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"CW, 2019, BBC, psycho, game-of-thrones, politics, Premium, TV, ESPN","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Jason-Kills-at-the-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509142460369","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Madea Crushes The Competition","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Madea Crushes The CompetitionTaken and Coraline round out the top three.by Sujit Chawla | February 22, 2009 |  CommentsThis weekend Tyler Perry once again showed why he is the King (and Madea his Queen) of the box office as Madea Goes to Jail slaughtered the competition this weekend. Holdovers were mixed and the only other new release landed with a soft thud.Taking his rightful place atop the box office charts, Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail ruled the roost this weekend bringing in a stunning $41.2M, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $20,236. Perry’s fans have obviously been hungering for another round of Madea and they came out in droves to see her. Madea Goes to Jail replaces Madea’s Family Reunion as Perry’s biggest opening weekend gross. That film opened three years ago to a $30M bow and $13,688 average. Perry’s last two films have been relative disappointments (relative only within the Perry universe) but Madea has set him back on track. In fact, Madea Goes to Jail this weekend alone has made more money than Perry’s last film The Family That Preys, did in its entire run late last year, when it finished with $37.1M.[rtimage]MapID=1199053&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=15&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Continuing its impressive run and refusing to let go of second place was the Liam Neeson action-thriller Taken fell 40% from last weekend’s three-day totals to an estimated $11.4M bringing its cume to within a hair of the century club at $95.1M. The family film Coraline came in third this weekend, dropping a small 25% for an estimated weekend take of $11M. Its cume now stands at $53.4M for Focus Features.Fourth place belonged to the chick lit pic He’s Just Not That Into You which fell 56% from last weekend’s Valentine’s Day fueled total to $8.5M, according to estimates. Its cume now stands at $70.1M with the century club still a possibility.Fifth place belonged to multiple Oscar hopeful Slumdog Millionaire which saw its gross increase by 10% from last weekend to an estimated $8M. Its total after nearly four months in theaters is $98M and could grow much higher if it takes home the coveted Best Picture Oscar tonight.[rtimage]MapID=1198041&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=17&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]Crashing and burning into sixth place was last weekend’s champ Friday the 13th which fell an astounding 80% to $7.8M. A big drop was expected as fans of the genre rushed out on opening weekend, but this drop gives Friday the 13th the distinction of being one of the top 10 worst second weekend drops for a wide release in history. Its total stands at $55M with a final gross somewhere in the $65-70M range. While there are two more Friday the 13ths in this year (much too soon for a sequel to hit) the only Friday the 13th in 2010 is in August, the perfect time for an end of summer horror film.The second chick lit flick on the charts landed in seventh this weekend as Confessions of a Shopaholic took in an estimated $7M of consumer dollars bringing its cume to $27.6M. A drop of 53% from last weekend does not bode well for the Disney release. Look for a final total in the $40-45M range.[rtimage]MapID=1191984&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=6&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]A trio of Sony releases closes out the top 10 this weekend. In eighth place was arguably the biggest surprise hit so far this season, Paul Blart: Mall Cop which fell only 36% from last weekend to an estimated $7M. Its total now stands at a terrific $121.3M. Opening poorly in ninth place was the high school not-a-cheerleading movie Fired Up! The movie starring two guys who haven’t been in high school in about 10 years took in $6M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screen average of $3,315. And rounding out the top 10 was The International in its second weekend. The banking thriller took in $4.5M this weekend bringing its cume to a disappointing $17M. Look for a final total in the $25M range.Three of the other four Best Picture nominees added theaters this weekend and all saw their grosses rise slightly from last weekend. The Reader grossed an estimated $2.8M this weekend, (up 25% from last weekend) bringing its total to $23.1M. Milk also saw its grosses rise 25% from last weekend, grossing an estimated $1.1M this weekend for a total of $28.1M. Frost/Nixon saw its weekend take rise 31% from last weekend, raking in $678,000 according to estimates, bringing its cume to $17M. The final nominee, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was the only Best Picture nominee to lose theaters this weekend and saw its gross fall 25% from last weekend to $1.2M, bringing its total to $124.2M[rtimage]MapID=1192085&amp;MapTypeID=2&amp;photo=35&amp;legacy=1[/rtimage]The top ten films grossed $112.4M which was up 32% from last year when Vantage Point debuted atop the charts with $22.8M; and was up 17% from 2007 when Ghost Rider remained at number one with $20.1M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"television, Red, Extras, Bravo, DGA, serial, boxoffice, Oscars, Martial, 93rd, political, Geographic, movies, CW","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Madea-Crushes-The-Competition"},{"id":"47509144341474","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Max feels no  Payne at No. 1","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Max feels no  Payne at No. 1\n                        The video game adaptation shoots its way to the top spot.\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | October 19, 2008                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                This weekend, News Corp. scored a well-needed knockout at the North American box office with the one-two punch of Fox’s actioner Max Payne which debuted in the top spot and Fox Searchlight’s The Secret Life of Bees which bowed in third with the best average of any film in wide release. Lionsgate also performed well with its new presidential flick W. which landed in fourth allowing three new releases to post averages north of $5,000 each. The frame’s fourth new player was a dud – Summit’s teen comedy Sex Drive found few takers. Overall, the marketplace remained ahead of last year’s pace but was about even with 2006’s solid October session.\nEnjoying its first number one hit in seven months, Fox brought in solid sales for its stylish video game-inspired action pic Max Payne which grossed an estimated $18M to lead the weekend race. The PG-13 film attacked 3,376 theaters and averaged a commendable $5,332 per site. Males made up 64% of the audience for the testosterone pic which surprised nobody. Only three films this fall have opened better – Beverly Hills Chihuahua ($29.3M), Eagle Eye ($29.2M), and Burn After Reading ($19.1M). The bow was a bit ahead of the $15.5M debut for another video game actioner from mid-October, Doom starring The Rock from 2005.\n\n\n\nFor Fox, Payne came as a badly needed hit following a string of seven films that all opened to under $12M, with many debuting poorly with less than $8M. It was the best opening for the studio since June’s The Happening ($30.5M) and its first top spot debut since March’s Horton Hears a Who ($45M) which remains 2008’s biggest non-summer opener. The rest of the year’s slate for Fox includes the risky Nicole Kidman-Hugh Jackman epic Australia on Thanksgiving weekend, the Keanu Reeves sci-fi actioner ","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comic, thriller, thriller, nightmare, quibi, Film, new, Ghostbusters, Geographic, Comic, 24, venice, Studios, drama","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Max-feels-no-Payne-at-No-1"},{"id":"47509144351720","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Worst Box Office in 5 Years","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Worst Box Office in 5 YearsCage's action flick takes an unimpressive first place.by Gitesh Pandya | September 8, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers found almost nothing worth paying money for at North American multiplexes as the top ten films at the box office slumped to their lowest gross in five years giving the new fall movie season a disastrous start. Nicolas Cage’s latest thriller Bangkok Dangerous suffered one of the worst action openings ever for the Oscar-winning actor, but thanks to a sluggish marketplace it was good enough to claim first place. Summer holdovers performed relatively well with five pics in the top ten dropping by less than 40%, but most wide releases crawled to averages of less than $2,300 as theaters struggled to find ticket buyers.Bowing to only $7.8M, according to estimates, Bangkok Dangerous enjoyed a less-than-spectacular number one debut with a lackluster $2,943 average from 2,650 locations. The R-rated hitman pic gave Cage his second worst opening for an action film since becoming a major player in that genre with 1996’s The Rock. Over that twelve-year span, only last year’s Next posted a weaker debut for an action film with just $7.1M and a $2,618 average. Reviews were poor and Lionsgate’s marketing push was moderate at best.The weekend after Labor Day is typically one of the slowest frames of the year. With students back in school and a new football season starting, studios generally avoid opening any strong films at this time which in turns helps the box office slow down. But this year with a major tropical storm hitting the east coast and election hoopla getting bigger after the political conventions, moviegoing just was not a priority for people. The top ten films grossed a dismal $47.6M making it the worst showing since this very same weekend in 2003 when the top ten stumbled to $46.2M. The Top 20 grossed $59.7M that year and is estimated to reach $61M this weekend. Factor in ticket price increases and less stubs were definitely sold this time around. Final grosses to be reported on Monday will show if this entire frame will come in lower than that sluggish session from five years ago when David Spade’s Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star led the chart with only $6.7M in its debut weekend. Bangkok also delivered the smallest gross for a number one film since Dickie.Following its three-week rule of the box office, the war comedy Tropic Thunder retreated back to a close second place finish with an estimated $7.5M dipping only 35%. After its fourth weekend, the Paramount release has collected a solid $96.8M and should cross the century mark next weekend. Sony’s comedy The House Bunny climbed up one notch to third with an estimated $5.9M in its third session dipping only 29%. Total stands at $37M.The Dark Knight dropped only 34% to an estimated $5.7M and raised its amazing North American cume to $512.2M. Overseas, the Warner Bros. sensation raked in an estimated $11.8M boosting the international tally to $437.2M which allowed the worldwide gross to soar to a staggering $949.4M. The Christian Bale-Heath Ledger showdown now sits at number six among all-time global blockbusters sandwiched right between last summer’s megahits Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End ($961M) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($938M).Don Cheadle’s political thriller Traitor held up well in its second weekend dropping 41% to an estimated $4.7M to push the 12-day tally to $17.7M. The Overture Films release should finish off in the vicinity of $30M. The Vin Diesel actioner Babylon A.D. fell 58% to an estimated $4M for Fox putting the ten-day total at $17.2M. A $25M final should result.Another macho action pic Death Race followed with an estimated $3.6M, off 43%, giving Universal $29.8M to date. The spoof comedy Disaster Movie slipped 44% in its sophomore session to an estimated $3.3M. Lionsgate has seen just $10.9M in sales and should conclude its run with a mere $19M or so.Two successful summer comedy leftovers rounded out the top ten. Mamma Mia! eased 36% to an estimated $2.7M boosting the stellar domestic cume to $136.3M allowing it to enter the top ten list of summer blockbusters. Universal’s singing sensation smashed through the $400M worldwide mark this weekend thanks to a stellar international frame that saw an estimated $15M. That was enough to push the overseas sum to $280.1M and the global gross to an eye-popping $416M. Mamma is now Universal’s top-grossing film of the year both domestically and worldwide beating out the studio’s many action offerings like The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Wanted, and The Incredible Hulk which all cost more to produce.Sony’s stoner comedy Pineapple Express took in an estimated $2.4M, down 32%, and has grossed $84.2M thus far.The top ten films grossed a pathetic estimate of $47.6M over the weekend which was down 23% from last year when 3:10 to Yuma opened in the top spot with $14M; and off 3% from 2006 when The Covenant debuted at number one with $9M in its opening frame.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Nickelodeon, ESPN, Golden, Comic, harry","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Worst-Box-Office-in-5-Years"},{"id":"47509144337376","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Zac Beats Zack for #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Zac Beats Zack for #1 SpotAmateur musical theater performers defeat amateur pornographers.by Gitesh Pandya | November 2, 2008 |  CommentsDespite being clobbered by Halloween on Friday, Disney’s smash hit kidpic High School Musical 3 once again led the North American box office in its second weekend winning the frame by a comfortable margin. The squeaky clean teens were followed by a trio of R-rated films that fought fiercely over the runnerup spot. Final grosses to be reported on Monday could lead to a change in the standings, but based on official studio estimates Kevin Smith’s raunchy new comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno debuted in second, the horror sequel Saw V slipped a notch to third, and Clint Eastwood’s missing child drama Changeling starring Angelina Jolie expanded nationally and placed fourth with the best average in the top ten. With the Pumpkin holiday keeping folks away from multiplexes on Friday and the lack of any breakout new releases, overall ticket sales took a nosedive with the top ten pulling in just over $70M falling 39% from last weekend and dropping 41% from a year ago.Moviegoers couldn’t stay away from the singing and dancing students of High School Musical 3 making the franchise flick the top movie in the land with an estimated $15M over the weekend. Down a steep 64%, the Zac Efron pic pushed its stellar ten-day total to $61.8M. Disney has now ruled the box office over four of the last five weekends thanks to its one-two punch of G-rated family films HSM3 and Beverly Hills Chihuahua which still remained in the top ten this weekend.Theatrical business was on a rollercoaster ride this weekend thanks to Halloween falling on a Friday this year. Since Musical‘s audience of young children and parents are the ones most affected by trick-or-treating, the film got hammered on Friday tumbling an eye-popping 90% from its opening day to just $1.7M. With those holiday activities out of the way, sales surged over 380% on Saturday to $8.2M and the studio is projecting Sunday to fall by 37% to an estimated $5.1M. Compared to last weekend, the Saturday and Sunday takes depreciated by roughly 46% each, a reasonably good performance for a frontloaded sequel in its sophomore session.With Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa launching on Friday, competition for kids will get tough. Still, HSM3 may find its way to $90-100M domestically. Overseas, the Wildcats pulled in another $25.9M boosting the international tally to $85M and the worldwide cume to a stunning $146.8M. With a production budget of just $13M, it’s only a matter of time before the Mouse House puts a fourth installment into production, regardless of cast or story.Three distributors battled over second place this weekend and the final results may come down to how accurate their projected Saturday-to-Sunday declines end up being. Based on official estimates released by the companies, those drops for the moment stand at 25% for Zack and Miri Make a Porno from The Weinstein Co., 34% for Lionsgate’s Saw V, and a more understandable 40% for Universal’s Changeling.Kevin Smith’s Zack opened with an estimated $10.7M from 2,735 theaters for a decent $3,906 average. The Seth Rogen-Elizabeth Banks comedy about best friends that make a dirty movie together to earn some quick cash ended up performing much like Smith’s other R-rated comedies released wide. Clerks II bowed to $10.1M and a $4,680 average in 2006 while 2001’s Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back debuted to $11M and a $3,985 average. The casting of Rogen failed to pump the numbers up to those seen by the actor’s many films for Judd Apatow which often flirt with the $30M mark. Reviews for Zack were generally positive.The torture extravaganza Saw V got hacked by 66% in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $10.1M. The Lionsgate release has now banked a solid $45.8M in ten days. The weekend drop was skewed by the Halloween effect on Friday as Saturday declined by 58% from the previous weekend while Sunday is estimated to fall by 54%. The aging franchise is still showing signs of erosion as the cume is the lowest ten-day start for the series since the first Saw did $35.4M in 2004. Ten-day cumes for the other chapters include $60.1M for Saw II, $59.4M for Saw III, and $50.4M for Saw IV. Halloween fell within that period for all five films. Look for Saw V to finish in the neighborhood of $55M which should still make it a profitable piece of intellectual property.Universal expanded its Angelina Jolie vehicle Changeling from 15 to 1,850 theaters and grossed an estimated $9.4M. That amounted to a solid $5,085 average, the best among all wide releases. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the true story of a woman in search of her missing boy in the 1920s attracted mixed reviews which may have dampened sales with the target audience of older adults. Total including last week’s limited run is now $10.1M. The performance was somewhat similar to the expansion for the Oscar-winning filmmaker’s Mystic River from October 2003 which also went national in its second weekend with $10.4M from 1,467 sites. That film earned better reviews and a stronger $7,120 average which at today’s ticket prices would amount to roughly $8,300. Changeling‘s numbers also resembled those of Eastwood’s Flags of Our Fathers which debuted to $10.2M and a $5,461 average just two years ago in October 2006. Though not generating huge numbers, the former Dirty Harry is dependable when he hits the multiplexes with a new drama. He next pops up on screen this December in Gran Torino which he also directed.Freestyle Releasing was the most aggressive distributor with Saturday-to-Sunday declines this weekend projecting a slim 13% dip for its horror title The Haunting of Molly Hartley resulting in a reported three-day estimate of $6M. The PG-13 fright flick about a teenage girl hunted by the devil opened with a mild $2,262 average from 2,652 locations. Final grosses to be reported on Monday should see a smaller gross, however its fifth place standing is secure.The fall season’s second biggest hit Beverly Hills Chihuahua followed in sixth with an estimated $4.7M, off only 31%, for a cume of $84.1M for Disney. Collecting an estimated $4M, down just 34% in its third session, was The Secret Life of Bees which has upped its sum to $25.3M for Fox Searchlight.Fox’s action drama Max Payne fell 53% to an estimated $3.7M pushing the total to $35.6M. Paramount and DreamWorks held up well once again with Eagle Eye, the fall’s top-grossing flick, with an estimated $3.4M, down 33%, for a $92.5M cume. The $100M mark is well within reach for Mr. LaBeouf. The Edward Norton-Colin Farrell cop saga Pride and Glory dropped 48% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $3.3M. After ten days, the total for the Warner Bros.-New Line Cinema pic is a disappointing $11.6M.Guy Ritchie’s crime thriller RocknRolla failed to draw much of a crowd in its first weekend of wide release. Expanding from 19 to 826 playdates, the R-rated pic grossed an estimated $1.8M for a weak $2,119 average. Cume is a mere $2.4M for the Gerard Butler starrer.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.3M which was down 41% from last year when American Gangster opened in the top spot with $43.6M; and off 35% from 2006 when Borat debuted at number one with $26.5M.While the North American box office took a big hit this weekend, overseas action was ignited by what could be the top-grossing global blockbuster for the rest of 2008 – the new James Bond adventure Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig’s second turn as 007 opened to a colossal $24.8M in the United Kingdom breaking the record for that market’s largest three-day opening weekend edging out Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Quantum‘s launch was 35% bigger than Casino Royale‘s from two years ago indicating how firmly engaged audiences are now to Craig in the iconic role in this post-Pierce era. France opened to a stellar $10.5M while Sweden bowed to $2.3M, both bigger than the last Bond.Quantum of Solace makes its big global premiere this coming weekend when it invades 57 additional markets for what undoubtedly will be a massive worldwide assault. North America was originally scheduled to be part of that debut. But when Warner Bros. moved Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince from November to next July, Sony pushed the domestic launch of Bond back by a week to November 14 to move it closer to the lucrative Thanksgiving holiday. All 007 installments since the 1990s were released a week before the Turkey holiday with one exception – Tomorrow Never Dies which opened day and date against Titanic on December 19, 1997.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nightmare, Amazon, Premium, Sundance, Comedy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Zac-Beats-Zack-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509144344548","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chihuahua is Top Dog","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chihuahua is Top DogDisney's pooch reigns supreme at the weekend box office.by Gitesh Pandya | October 5, 2008 |  CommentsThis weekend a jam-packed slate of eight new films opening or expanding nationwide flooded the multiplexes but it was a pampered little dog that ticket buyers wanted turning Disney’s family comedy Beverly Hills Chihuahua into the box office king. Younger-skewing movies ruled the charts while an assortment of niche pics targeting specific audiences found some success elsewhere in the top ten. Three new films opening in over 1,000 theaters each failed to even make the top ten proving that the marketplace can only handle so much content. But the variety of product did lead ticket sales well ahead of year-ago levels starting October on a positive note.Moviegoers just couldn’t resist talking animals and the Disney brand name as Beverly Hills Chihuahua delivered a powerful number one opening with an estimated $29M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Averaging a stellar $9,020 from 3,215 locations, the PG-rated tale of a rich dog lost in Mexico connected with kids and parents and posted the best opening for a kidpic since June’s WALL•E launched to $63.1M. It was the second best family film opening ever in the September-October corridor trailing only Will Smith’s Shark Tale which debuted to $47.6M in October 2004. Also helping the Mouse House this weekend was the lack of good family movies over the past couple of months. The road ahead looks rosy as few options for children stand in the way of Chihuahua over the next month. Between now and the November 7 launch of the DreamWorks sequel Madagascar Escape 2 Africa there is High School Musical 3, but that belongs to the Disney empire.Shia LaBeouf might be on his way to scoring another career $100M+ blockbuster as his latest actioner Eagle Eye enjoyed a good hold in its second frame. Last weekend’s top film dropped 39% to an estimated $17.7M and lifted the film’s ten-day cume to a solid $54.6M. Paramount and its soon-to-be-ex-wife DreamWorks should find their way to $95-100M.Despite Eagle Eye‘s presence, Sony was still able to connect with teens and young adults with its comedy Nick &amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlist which debuted in third place with an estimated $12M. Playing in 2,421 playdates, the PG-13 romantic comedy averaged a healthy $4,957. According to studio research, 55% of the audience was under 21 while 62% was female. With Chihuahua skewing very young and most other new releases aiming for adults over 30, Playlist was able to reach a crowd that had few viable options this weekend. The modest $13M budget should allow it to become a moneymaker too.Richard Gere and Diane Lane suffered the worst drop in the top ten with their romance Nights in Rodanthe which fell 45% to an estimated $7.4M. With $25.1M in the bank, the Warner Bros. release should reach about $40M. By comparison, the actors charmed $52.8M from movie fans in 2002 with Unfaithful which amounts to about $65M at today’s ticket prices.The Ed Harris-directed Western Appaloosa expanded nationally after a two-week limited run and enjoyed a respectable take of an estimated $5M from 1,045 theaters. Averaging $4,794 per location, the Warner Bros. title showed that there is still an audience for this classic genre of films. Cume is $5.6M. Samuel L. Jackson’s thriller Lakeview Terrace slipped only 35% to an estimated $4.5M in its third frame boosting the 17-day total to $32.1M for Sony.Focus followed with Burn After Reading which grossed an estimated $4.08M, off just 34%, for a $51.6M cume. The Christian-themed hit Fireproof was close behind with an estimated $4.07M dropping a reasonable 41% in the second weekend. Budgeted at a mere $500,000, the Samuel Goldwyn release has captured a solid $12.5M in ten days and could go on to finish with an impressive $20-25M.Vivendi Entertainment opened its first wide release with the David Zucker-directed comedy An American Carol which grossed an estimated $3.8M for a ninth place finish. Playing in 1,639 locations in the United States, the PG-13 film about a Michael Moore-type filmmaker who is visited by three ghosts who show him the true meaning of America averaged only $2,325 per site. Kevin Farley, Kelsey Grammer, and Leslie Nielsen star and reviews were not very positive. Carol opens in Canada this Friday.Rounding out the top ten and scoring the second best average on that list was the Bill Maher doc Religulous which collected an estimated $3.5M from only 502 theaters for a potent $6,972 average. Directed by Larry Charles (Borat), the R-rated film that explores the merits of organized religion earned generally upbeat reviews for Lionsgate. The last film to open in the top ten in fewer theaters was the Spanish-language immigration drama Under the Same Moon with $2.8M from 266 sites in March.A slew of new releases also debuted outside the top ten with most generating disappointing results. The one film which audiences did actually connect with was the Anne Hathaway drama Rachel Getting Married which scored a sensational $33,667 average from nine theaters after grossing an estimated $303,000 this weekend in its platform bow. The Sony Classics release about a surly young woman who goes back home for her sister’s wedding has been praised by critics and has earned Hathaway plenty of kudos buzz making her, at the moment, one of the frontrunners on Oscar night. Directed by Jonathan Demme, the R-rated pic expands into more markets in the coming weeks.Universal stumbled with its Greg Kinnear drama Flash of Genius which opened in 1,098 locations collecting just $2.3M, according to estimates. With a weak $2,120 average, the tale of an inventor screwed by the auto giants just didn’t make moviegoers want to spend top dollar. Reviews were mixed.Miramax’s new arthouse thriller Blindness was panned by critics and flopped in its nationwide opening. The Julianne Moore pic took in an estimated $2M from 1,690 sites for an embarrassing $1,185 average. The figures only represent the U.S. and not Canada. The Simon Pegg comedy How to Lose Friends and Alienate People attracted few people debuting to an estimated $1.4M. Averaging only $801 from 1,750 theaters, the MGM release saw weak reviews from critics.The top ten films grossed an estimated $91M which was up a robust 44% from last year when The Game Plan remained in the top spot in its second frame with $16.6M; but off 7% from 2006 when The Departed debuted at number one with $26.9M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"IFC, Pirates, Rom-Com, TV, movies, nbcuniversal, school, Yoda, the, Classic, Film, Esquire, King, movies, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Chihuahua-is-Top-Dog"},{"id":"47509146295276","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dark Knight #1 for Fourth Time","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Dark Knight #1 for Fourth TimePineapple Express makes a solid debut.by Gitesh Pandya | August 10, 2008 |  CommentsThe unstoppable box office superhero The Dark Knight once again defeated all foes and spent its fourth consecutive weekend at number one becoming the first film in nearly five years to accomplish the fourpeat. With the gold medal going to Batman, Seth Rogen and James Franco shared the silver with their new stoner comedy Pineapple Express which posted a solid five-day debut. The frame’s other new release, the friendship sequelThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2, debuted in fourth with commendable results. Showing signs that the summer box office is coming to an end, the top ten slumped to its lowest tally of the season.Moviegoers once again drove The Dark Knight to the top spot as Warner Bros. grossed an estimated $26M in its fourth weekend to boost the 24-day total to an unbelievable $441.5M. The Caped Crusader continued to reach new milestones. Down only 39%, the superhero sequel shot up to number three on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters and sits behind only Titanic which grossed $600.8M during one theatrical run across 1997 and 1998, andStar Wars which took in $461M from multiple releases over differentdecades.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, ticket prices were much lower during those years and Knight is not likely to match those films in admissions. The new Joker film has sold roughly 62 million stubs which puts it on the same level as 2003’sThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which grossed $377M and sits at number ten on the all-time list. Coincidentally, the final Frodo pic was the last movie to spend four straight weekends at number one. Mel Gibson’sThe Passion of the Christ hit the top spot over four non-consecutive frames in 2004 including its first three sessions as well as its seventh outing which was the Easter holiday weekend. In today’s crowded marketplace, especially in the summer when even megahits likeIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Transformers, andThe Bourne Ultimatum only spend one week at the top, The Dark Knight‘s feat is truly incredible.The new Batman movie also smashed the $700M barrier in worldwide grosses this weekend. Overseas audiences in 56 markets spent an estimated $35.1M allowing the international total to soar to $263.1M while the global tally climbed to a jaw-dropping $704.6M. Opening against the start of the Beijing Olympics, Knight saw stunning first-place numbers in Korea with $6.9M in five days which already puts it ahead of the lifetime gross ofBatman Begins. The turnout was not as bright in Japan where it bowed in second place to $3M beating the opening of Begins by only 11%.The Dark Knight now looks set to reach the neighborhood of $520M from North America and more than $900M worldwide.The stoner comedy Pineapple Express claimed second place with an opening of $22.4M over the Friday-to-Sunday period and a gross of $40.5M since its Wednesday launch. Rated R, the Rogen-Franco buddy pic played in 3,072 theaters and averaged $7,292 per joint for the best average in the top ten. The Judd Apatow production got off to a red hot start with a blistering $12.1M bow on Wednesday driven by older teens and young adults rushing out on the first day to see the much-buzzed-about comedy.Pineapple lost some steam as the weekend came with $7.9M on Friday, a 3% dip to $7.6M on Saturday, and a slim studio-estimated 9% drop on Sunday to $6.9M. Friday-to-Saturday declines are not uncommon during the summer, but when a midweek launch takes some fuel out of the Friday gross, usually some kind of increase will occur on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp;The action-comedy basically played out like a highly-anticipated sequel over the five-day period. A whopping 45% of the cume was collected on Wednesday and Thursday matching the ratio of last summer’sHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which grossed $62.6M of its five-day $139.7M tally on those two first days. Non-sequels opening on a Wednesday in July or August generally take in 30-35% in the first two days of play. Produced for $27M,Pineapple looks to be a profitable venture regardless of what kind of legs it displays. Studio research showed that 58% of the audience was male while the CinemaScore grade was a solid A-. Reviews were generally good. Competition will heat up fast with this Wednesday’s launch of rival R-rated action-comedy Tropic Thunderstarring Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise.The adventure sequel The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor finished in third place in North America, but on a worldwide basis it remained at number one this weekend. Domestically the Universal actioner tumbled 60% to an estimated $16.1M boosting the ten-day tally to $70.7M. That was a much harder fall than the sophomore declines for the first two installments in the Brendan Fraser franchise.The Mummy fell by 43% in 1999 while The Mummy Returns dropped by 51% in 2001. Both of those launched on the first weekend of May to kickoff their respective summer seasons. A final gross of $100-110M could result stateside for the $145M-budgeted pic. Overseas where the film is generating more excitement, Dragon Emperor hauled in a stunning $56.1M this weekend from 49 territories and raised its international cume to $141.1M. The global gross soared to $211.8M with a few big markets like Japan and China still to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;Girlpower drove The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 to a fourth place debut with an estimated $10.8M for the weekend and $19.7M since opening on Wednesday. That represented a healthy 45% increase over the $13.6M five-day bow of the firstSisterhood in June 2005. That film went on to gross a modest $39M for Warner Bros. and found more fans on video. The newPants opened in 2,707 locations and averaged a decent $3,979 per site which was on par with the $3,807 three-day debut average of its predecessor. Reviews were positive.Will Ferrell’s latest comedy Step Brothers dropped 46% in its third weekend to an estimated $8.9M and lifted its total to $80.9M for Sony. The leggy musicalMamma Mia! grossed an estimated $8.1M in its fourth weekend slipping only 36%. Universal’s cume rose to $104M with the Meryl Streep hit becoming the twelfth $100M blockbuster of the summer. The industry had 14 at this point last year. For the Oscar-winning actress, the ABBA songfest marks her fourth time joining the century club. The studio placed its bets on expensive action movies this summer withThe Incredible Hulk, Wanted, plus the Hellboy and Mummy sequels. However, Mamma Mia! could very well fly past all of them if it keeps up its stellar pace and become Universal’s top-grossing film of the year. Overseas, the film grossed another $14.7M and boosted the international sum to $173.4M and the global tally to an amazing $277.4M.&nbsp;&nbsp;Brendan Fraser’s second offering in the top ten, the 3D adventure Journey to the Center of the Earth, folllowed with an estimated $4.9M, off a mere 27%, giving New Line and Warner Bros. $81.8M to date. The Will Smith superhero flickHancock fell 35% to an estimated $3.3M for a $221.7M sum for Sony.Kevin Costner followed with his political comedy Swing Vote which tumbled 50% to an estimated $3.1M in its second term. With only $12M in ten days, look for a disappointing $20M finish. The Pixar toonWALL•E was the oldest resident in the top ten rounding out the list with an estimated $3M in its seventh session. Down 34%, the Disney release has banked $210.1M thus far.The top ten films grossed an estimated $106.6M which was down 20% from last year when Rush Hour 3 opened in the top spot with $49.1M; but up 3% from 2006 when Talladega Nights stayed at number one with $22.1M in its second frame.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"USA, DGA, IFC, Adult, Lifetime, Con, boxoffice, Film, Chilling, streaming, It","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Dark-Knight-1-for-Fourth-Time"},{"id":"47509144347622","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackson Debuts Ahead of the Race","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Jackson Debuts Ahead of the RaceLeaving the comedies in his wakeby Gitesh Pandya | September 22, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers were in the mood for suspense as the Samuel L. Jackson cop thriller Lakeview Terrace easily topped the North American box office beating out three new comedy openers. Dane Cook’s latest My Best Friend’s Girl disappointed, the animated pic Igor bowed respectably, while the Ricky Gervais starrer Ghost Town played to empty auditoriums. The debuting films joined forces for just $37M in ticket sales falling short of the $63M pumped in last weekend by that frame’s four-pack of new titles. Still, the top ten managed to match year-ago levels.Sony scored its fifth number one opener of the year with Lakeview Terrace which debuted with a solid $15.6M, according to estimates. The PG-13 film about a veteran cop that terrorizes an interracial couple that moves in next door to him played in 2,464 theaters and averaged an impressive $6,331 per site. Produced for about $20M, Terrace connected with adult audiences despite stiff competition in the marketplace for mature moviegoers. According to studio research, 69% of the crowd was over 25 while 56% was female. For Jackson, it was a chance to flex some solo muscle at the box office as the film had no other stars in it. An effective marketing campaign by the studio’s Screen Gems unit also helped to deliver results. Reviews were not too positive, but ticket buyers instead responded to starpower and a good promotional push.Last weekend’s number one film Burn After Reading held up well in its second frame. The caper comedy from the Coen brothers grossed an estimated $11.3M falling a reasonable 41% and lifted its ten-day cume to a solid $36.4M. The George Clooney-Brad Pitt pic enjoyed a smaller decline than those seen by other wide releases from the Oscar-winning filmmakers. 2003’s Intolerable Cruelty, which also starred the former Batman, dropped 48% in its second weekend while 2004’s Tom Hanks starrer The Ladykillers fell by 44%. Focus looks to ride Burn to the vicinity of $65M.Dane Cook’s newest comedy failed to live up to the numbers posted by his previous efforts. The romantic comedy My Best Friend’s Girl, which also stars Kate Hudson and Jason Biggs, bowed to an estimated $8.3M from 2,604 theaters for a weak $3,187 average. That was a hefty 39% below the $13.7M of Cook’s Good Luck Chuck from this same weekend last year, and 27% behind the $11.4M debut of Employee of the Month from October 2006. All three were released by Lionsgate in roughly 2,600 locations. Girl carried an R rating and earned the same negative reviews the comedian routinely sees from critics.Debuting to respectable results in fourth place was the new animated comedy Igor with an estimated $8M from 2,339 playdates. The PG-rated film averaged $3,425 and faced no competition in its quest for family audiences. Pre-release expectations were low since it is not based on any popular brand name property. The MGM release has no other kidpics to face next weekend so it may avoid the large drops seen by most other films.Three sophomore titles followed. The Robert De Niro-Al Pacino cop flick Righteous Kill tumbled 53% in its second weekend to an estimated $7.7M ranking fifth. With $28.8M taken in across ten days, the Overture Films release should eventually reach $40-45M. Kill has already become the top-grossing film for the new distribution company which made a name for itself this summer with the indie smash The Visitor.Tyler Perry’s latest hit The Family That Preys took a tumble in its second weekend falling 57% to an estimated $7.5M. The drop was nearly identical to the sophomore slides of 58% and 57% for past films Madea’s Family Reunion and Daddy’s Little Girls, respectively. Lionsgate has banked $28.4M in ten days with Family and should find its way to around $40M by the end of the run. Picturehouse witnessed a sharp decline for its chick flick The Women which fell 48% in its second outing to an estimated $5.3M. With $19.2M collected in ten days, the ensemble film could reach the neighborhood of $30M.Good reviews meant nothing to the new Ricky Gervais comedy Ghost Town which opened poorly in eighth place with an estimated $5.2M. Averaging a mild $3,436 from a subdued wide release in 1,505 locations, the PG-13 film about a dentist that can see and speak to spirits also stars Greg Kinnear and Tea Leoni. The target audience of mature adults had many other options to choose from so competition was tough, plus Gervais has yet to prove himself as a box office draw who can sell tickets. The DreamWorks production was released by Paramount.Warner Bros. spent its tenth weekend in the top ten with The Dark Knight which grossed an estimated $3M, off just 29%, for a towering $521.9M domestic total. Overseas, the gargantuan smash raised its cume to $455.7M giving the superhero blockbuster a stunning $977.6M worldwide. That puts Knight at number four on the all-time global blockbusters list after Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest which all topped the $1 billion mark. Bruce Wayne should become a box office billionaire in early October. Sony’s leggy hit The House Bunny rounded out the top ten dipping 33% to an estimated $2.8M pushing the cume to $45.7M.September is when top distributors start rolling out their awards contenders and this weekend saw two of them generate sensational launches. Paramount Vantage unveiled the Keira Knightley costume drama The Duchess in seven theaters in New York and Los Angeles and grossed an estimated $203,000 for a sizzling $28,932 average. Attracting mostly good reviews, the PG-13 film will expand into the Top 20 markets this Friday. Warner Bros. rode into twice as many theaters with its Ed Harris-directed Western Appaloosa which collected an estimated $258,000. Averaging a sturdy $18,429 from 14 sites, the R-rated pic stars Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger, and Jeremy Irons and will expand nationally on October 3.The top ten films grossed an estimated $74.6M which was off only 1% from last year when Resident Evil: Extinction opened in the top spot with $23.7M; and down 3% from 2006 when Jackass: Number Two debuted at number one with $29M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Annual, Disney, Music","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Jackson-Debuts-Ahead-of-the-Race"},{"id":"47509144342499","title":"Box Office Wrapup: The Dogs Rule Once Again","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: The Dogs Rule Once AgainQuarantine pulls surprise victory over Body of Lies.by Sujit Chawla | October 12, 2008 |  CommentsIn one of the bigger upsets in recent box office history, the canineadventure Beverly Hills Chihuahuaremained at number one with the highly touted and highly pedigreed Body of Lieslanding with a thud in third.The rich dogs of Beverly Hills took pole position at the box office once againthis weekend as Beverly Hills Chihuahualapped up another $17.5M, according to estimates, a fall of 40% from lastweekend’s debut. The total for the PG-rated family adventure stands at $52.5Mwith the $100M brass ring now within site.Second place was a surprise with the Sony horror flick Quarantinescaring up an estimated $14.2M for a per screen average of a strong $5,770, topsin the top 10. Wit Halloween just around the corner, moviegoers were looking fora couple of good scares and the well-marketed Quarantine was just the ticket.Landing in third place with a very loud thud was the (former) Academy Awardhopeful Body of Lies.With past Academy winners and nominees taking part in all aspects of the filmincluding writing (William Monahan), directing (Ridley Scott)and acting (Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crow), Lies was expected to easily debut at number one but insteadthe war-on-terror story set in the Middle East did not resonate with audiences.Lies grossed $13.1M this weekend, according to estimates, for a per screenaverage of $4,841 while playing on 250 more screens than Quarantine.&nbsp;The highest grossing film of the season, Eagle Eye,fell to fourth place this weekend with an estimated $11M, a drop of 38% fromlast weekend, bringing it’s cume to $70.5M. Fifth place belonged to anotherholdover, the teen dramedy Nick &amp; Norah’s Infinite Playlistwhich took in $6.5M this weekend, according to estimates, bringing its total to$20.8M. Look for a final gross in the $40M range.Debuting quietly in sixth place was the Universal football drama The Expresswith an estimated $4.7M. The story of Heisman-winning running back Ernie Davisfailed to connect with moviegoers but should see better results on DVD.&nbsp;Rob Brown as Ernie Davis in The ExpressSeventh place belonged to lovers as Nights in Rodanthefell 37% to $4.6M, according to estimates, bringing it’s total to $32.3M.The battle for eighth and ninth was a close one as the reported differencebetween the two films was only $18,000. Currently in eighth is the WarnerBrothers western Appaloosawhich roped in an estimated $3.34M this weekend, bringing its total to $10.8M.Rising into the top 10 at number nine was the period drama The Duchess with anestimated $3.32M bringing its cume to $5.6M for Paramount Vantage.Crash landing at number 10 was the debuting fantasy film City of Emberfrom Fox. The story of an underground city on the verge of collapse was yetanother film that failed to connect with paying audiences, grossing an estimated$3.2M for a poor per screen average of $1,583, the lowest in the top 10.&nbsp;The top ten films grossed $81.5M which was up 1.5% from last year when WhyDid I Get Married? opened in the top spot with $21.4M; and down 15.5% from2006 when The Grudge 2 debuted at number one with $20.8M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"boxing, Television","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-The-Dogs-Rule-Once-Again"},{"id":"47509144354794","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tropic Thunder Holds Strong","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Tropic Thunder Holds StrongWhile the Bunny hops close on its heelsby Gitesh Pandya | August 24, 2008 |  CommentsThe final days of summer took their toll on the North American box office as moviegoing slowed down dramatically allowing Tropic Thunder to remain in first place for a second straight weekend. Among the frame’s four new releases, young females showed the most muscle powering the sorority comedy The House Bunny into second place while adult men pushed Jason Statham’s latest action pic Death Race into third. Ice Cube’s football drama The Longshots barely made the top ten while the Rainn Wilson comedy The Rocker was dead on arrival bowing at number twelve.Ben Stiller and his platoon of actors stayed in control of the box office with a healthy second weekend for Tropic Thunder which grossed an estimated $16.1M. Dropping only 38%, the R-rated action-comedy displayed a good hold and bumped its 12-day total to a solid $65.7M. The $90M Paramount release looks set to find its way to $105-115M.Anna Faris attracted a solid opening to her new comedy The House Bunny which performed above expectations with an estimated $15.1M. The PG-13 movie finds the star of the Scary Movie franchise playing an ex-Playboy bunny who becomes a house mother to a sorority of misfits. Sony released the film in 2,714 sites and averaged an encouraging $5,564. With so many action films and R-rated comedies aimed at guys over the past month, Bunny served as effective counter-programming for young women who showed up in impressive numbers. According to studio research, an incredibly high 68% of the audience was female while 54% was under 21. The production budget was $25M.Finishing in third place for the weekend was Universal’s new Jason Statham actioner Death Race with an estimated $12.3M from 2,532 locations. Averaging a respectable $4,855 per theater, the R-rated pic performed in line with the actor’s other offerings debuting higher than 2006’s Crank ($10.5M) but lower than 2005’s Transporter 2 ($16.5M). Both of those opened over Labor Day weekend. As expected, adult men made up the bulk of the audience with studio research showing that 63% of the crowd was male while 52% was 25 and older. Death Race carried a $45M pricetag making it more expensive than most of the action hero’s previous starring vehicles.Hollywood’s biggest superhero ever followed in fourth as The Dark Knight pulled in an estimated $10.3M in its sixth weekend. Sliding only 37%, the Warner Bros. megasmash pushed its record cume up to $489.2M and should surpass the $500M mark next weekend. The magic continued overseas with an estimated $34M from 62 markets this weekend sending the international total soaring to $381.2M. With the global tally now standing at a towering $870M, The Dark Knight should easily become only the fourth movie in history to top $1 billion at the worldwide box office following Titanic, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest.Suffering the worst decline in the top ten was Star Wars: The Clone Wars which tumbled 61% to an estimated $5.7M pushing the ten-day tally to $25M. The Warner Bros. animated entry should finish up with $36-38M. Sony’s Pineapple Express followed closely with an estimated $5.6M, down 43%, putting the stoner comedy’s cume at $73.9M. The horror flick Mirrors dropped 56% to an estimated $4.9M in its second weekend and has scared up $20.1M after ten days. A $30M tally is likely by the end of the run.Two films tied for eighth place with an estimated $4.3M in ticket sales each. Universal’s musical smash Mamma Mia! dipped just 29% and raised its domestic haul to $124.5M. This Friday the studio will release in selected theaters a new sing-along version of the hit film for Labor Day weekend which includes on-screen lyrics to all the songs to encourage audience participation, and prolong the box office run. Mamma’s overseas sum zoomed to $232.5M pushing the global gross to a stellar $357M.The other film in the number eight spot was the new Ice Cube football pic The Longshots which averaged only $2,058 from 2,089 locations. The PG-rated film was released by MGM and earned lukewarm reviews. Universal rounded out the top ten with The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor which grossed an estimated $4.1M, down 50%, for a $93.8M total. The overseas tally climbed to $222.4M giving the China-set adventure sequel a muscular $316M worldwide with 70% coming from outside of North America.Fox’s new Rainn Wilson comedy The Rocker debuted to pathetic results and failed to make the top ten. The PG-13 pic headlined by the co-star of The Office bowed to an estimated $2.75M from 2,784 theaters (the most for any new film this weekend) and averaged a pitiful $988 per site. It was the worst opening in box office history for a film bowing in 2,600+ theaters. Audiences ignored the pic sending a message to Hollywood that Wilson is not yet ready to graduate from second banana in the sitcom world to leading man of a theatrical release. Since its Wednesday launch, The Rocker has collected just $3.8M in five days.Making a moderate splash in limited release was the quirky indie comedy Hamlet 2 which debuted with an estimated $435,000 from 103 theaters for a mediocre $4,226 average. A smash at this year’s Sundance film festival where it was bought by Focus for a hefty $10M, the R-rated tale tells of a high school drama teacher and his students who put on a controversial musical in order to save their arts program. The distributor is hoping that this weekend’s limited debut will spark word-of-mouth that will fuel next weekend’s national expansion into 1,500 theaters over the long holiday session. But given this start, the road ahead will not be a smooth one. In 1999, Rushmore debuted in the same number of theaters but grossed $1.8M on opening weekend with a $17,881 average on its way to $17.1M overall. Almost Famous launched in 131 sites with $2.3M and a $17,669 average on its way to $32.5M. Hamlet 2 will need plenty of fan support if it wants to stay on screens into the fall season.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.6M which was off 2% from last year when Superbad stayed in the top spot with $18M in its sophomore frame; but up 9% from 2006 when Invincible debuted at number one with $17M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Country, video, werewolf","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Tropic-Thunder-Holds-Strong"},{"id":"47509147413499","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chan and Li Rule Box Office Kingdom","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Chan and Li Rule Box Office KingdomBut audiences didn't forget about Sarah Marshall.by Gitesh Pandya | April 20, 2008 |  CommentsAudiences were fired up for the first-ever showdown between martial artslegends Jackie Chan andJet Li as theirnew fantasy actioner TheForbidden Kingdom opened at number one at theaters across North America.Those in search of laughs powered the starless breakup comedy ForgettingSarah Marshall into second place with a strong debut of its own.Targeting different audiences, the one-two punch was enough to propel theoverall box office ahead of last year’s levels by a respectable margin.Lionsgate scored its first top spot debut of the year with TheForbidden Kingdom which grossed an estimated $20.9M from 3,151theaters over the weekend. The PG-13 adventure film averaged a solid $6,623 perlocation and saw much of its support from young male audiences and fans ofmartial arts movies. In the film, an American teen mysteriously travels back toancient China and embarks on a quest to free the famed Monkey King.Chan andLi, who each gotto play a double role, provided the starpower to pull in paying audiences.Reviews were mixed.Opening in second place with a solid debut of its own was the raunchyrelationship comedy ForgettingSarah MarshallForgetting Sarah Marshall which grossed an estimated$17.4M from 2,798 theaters. The R-rated pic about a man coping with being dumpedby his celebrity girlfriend averaged a commendable $6,201 and played best toadult women. The Sarah bow was below what producerJudd Apatowhas seen in the past with his R-rated summer comedies The40-Year-Old Virgin ($21.4M), Knocked Up($30.7M), and Superbad ($33.1M). However, it was stronger than the debutsof his latest offerings Walk Hard ($4.2M) and Drillbit Taylor($10.3M). Since the surprise success of Virgin in 2005, studios have usedApatow’s name and resume to market anything he remotely has been involved in.Sony claimed three of the next four slots. Last weekend’s number one film Prom Nightcrumbled by 56% to an estimated $9.1M and pushed its ten-day tally to $32.6M. A$45M final seems likely.TheAl Pacino crimedrama 88 Minuteswas rejected by moviegoers and collected only $6.8M, according to estimates, inits opening weekend. The Sony release averaged a mild $3,137 from 2,168locations and was panned by critics from coast to coast. The R-rated pic openedin numerous other countries around the world last year and was finally dumpedinto the late spring graveyard in the North American market.The kid adventure Nim’s Islandgrossed an estimated $5.7M, off 38%, giving Fox $32.9M to date. Sony’s blackjackhit 21followed dropping 48% to sixth place with an estimated $5.5M and upped its cumeto $70M.The Keanu Reevescop thriller Street Kingstumbled in its second weekend falling 68% to an estimated $4M.

Averaging a mild $2,997 from 1,052 locations, the PG-rated filmabout creationism was aimed at Christian audiences by distributor rocky MountainPictures.

The race for second place was extremely close as the Warner Bros. family picture Speed Racer and Fox’s comedy What Happens in Vegas delivered nearly identical numbers over the weekend. Regardless, the new product and the strong hold from the super hero giant helped the overall marketplace surge well ahead of year-ago levels.Paramount ruled the box office again with the first installment of its new super hero franchise Iron Man which grossed an estimated $50.5M dropping 49% from last week. Compared to the studio’s $102.1M bow which included Thursday night showtimes the second weekend decline was still just 51% which amounted to a strong hold given the enormous amount of business that was generated in the first weekend. The cume has soared to $177.1M already making it the top-grossing film of 2008 by surpassing the $150.7M that Horton Hears A Who has collected over the last two months.Iron Man is off to the best start ever for a non-webslinger comic book movie. The total beat out ten-day starts for 2003’s X2: X-Men United ($147.7M) and 2006’s X-Men: The Last Stand ($175.3M). The third mutant adventure even launched over the lucrative Memorial Day holiday weekend. X2 dropped by a similar 53% in its second session and its ten-day cume would amount to roughly $174M at today’s ticket prices so Iron Man is closely following that Marvel film’s admissions trajectory. The second X-Men flick, which had the same May 2 opening date five years ago, went on to gross $214.9M domestically, or around $250M at 2008 prices.The Robert Downey Jr. pic scored the largest sophomore weekend haul of any film since last May’s Shrek the Third which banked $53M on its second frame. Positive word-of-mouth helped as fans are recommending the super hero film to others and helping to drive sales. Plus the two new releases ended up not providing too much competition. This Friday’s release of The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and the following week’s debut of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull will provide some formidable distractions very soon. But at its current pace, Iron Man should soar to $260-280M from North America alone and could break the $500M mark worldwide.Warner Bros. and Fox both fought over the number two spot with their new releases. According to estimates released on Sunday, Warners won by a slim $200,000 margin however the rankings could get switched on Monday when final grosses are tabulated. But based on Friday and Saturday grosses, neither studio could claim a true victory as the race was too close to call.The big-budget family film Speed Racer struggled in its opening weekend bowing to an estimated $20.2M from 3,606 locations. Averaging a decent $5,605 per theater, the PG-rated film from the Wachowski Brothers fell short of all industry expectations. Even the least bullish projections forecast a debut in the high $20M range. Panned by most critics, the colorful and stylized racing flick tried to target kids and parents but failed to truly connect with audiences. Other high profile live-action summer films based on cartoon shows of the past fared better like Scooby Doo which bowed to $54.2M in 2002 and The Flintstones which debuted to $37.2M over four days back in 1994. Speed Racer at least didn’t crash and burn like The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle which opened to a miserable $6.8M in 2000.Warner Bros. calculated a slim 11% Sunday decline into its weekend estimate which may end coming down on Monday when final numbers are added up. Fox estimated a 29% Sunday drop for What Happens in Vegas and most major wide releases experienced 30-40% declines on Sunday. Speed Racer suffered from bad buzz and intense competition from Iron Man which appealed to many of the same people. Plus the racing pic is based on a property that lacks the broad mainstream appeal that other major summer films benefit from. With a reported production cost of well over $100M, Speed Racer also got off to a slow start overseas grossing just $12.8M from 30 markets. South Korea saw the largest international opening with $2.4M helped undoubtedly by the film’s casting of Korean pop star Rain, however most countries saw debut weekends of under $1M.Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher made their own bid for the runnerup spot with the new anti-romantic comedy What Happens in Vegas which took in an estimated $20M this weekend. Playing in 3,215 playdates, the PG-13 film averaged a solid $6,221 per venue. Vegas performed better than all the other recent comedies to hit the marketplace over the last month scoring higher than the openings for Forgetting Sarah Marshall ($17.7M), Baby Mama ($17.4M), and Made of Honor ($14.8M). In fact if the estimate holds, Vegas will enjoy the third best comedy opening of the year after 27 Dresses ($23M) and Meet the Browns ($20.1M).Four recent comedies with a combined cume of $148M followed with each dropping by less than 50%. In its second weekend, Sony’s Made of Honor fell by 49% to an estimated $7.6M pushing the ten-day tally to respectable $26.3M. Budgeted at $40M (a tad high for a laugher), the Patrick Dempsey vehicle should find its way to a mediocre $40-45M domestically.Universal’s pair of comedies Baby Mama and Forgetting Sarah Marshall followed with estimates of $5.8M and $3.8M, respectively. The Tina Fey–Amy Poehler pic dropped 43% and lifted its sum to $40.4M. Judd Apatow‘s latest R-rated concoction dipped by only 38% and has laughed up $50.7M to date.Falling 49% was the stoner sequel Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay with an estimated $3.2M giving New Line and parent Warner Bros. $30.7M to date.Jackie Chan and Jet Li claimed the number eight spot with The Forbidden Kingdom which took in an estimated $1.9M, off 55%, for a $48.3M total for Lionsgate. Fox’s kidpic Nim’s Island fell 51% to an estimated $1.3M giving the adventure film $44.3M in its sixth week of play.Sony Classics expanded its martial arts drama Redbelt after a week in limited release and landed in the top ten with an estimated $1.1M. Averaging a weak $827 from 1,379 locations, the R-rated action film upped its total to $1.2M and should conclude its run with less than $4M.Sony saw two hits and a flop fall out of the top ten this weekend. The teen thriller Prom Night tumbled 56% to an estimated $1.1M boosting the cume to $42.8M. Produced for only $20M, the PG-13 fright flick should end up with a solid $45M. The card-counting drama 21 enjoyed a six-week streak in the top ten but dropped 58% this weekend to an estimated $835,000. With a robust $80.4M in winnings earned to date, the Kevin Spacey flick looks to cash out with around $82M which was much better than anyone had expected.Al Pacino did not have much luck with audiences as they ignored his latest crime thriller 88 Minutes. The dismal entry collapsed by 69% this weekend taking in just $485,000, according to estimates, to push its embarrassing sum to only $16.4M. Not much more will be added.The top ten films grossed an estimated $115.4M which was up a healthy 24% from last year when Spider-Man 3 remained on top with $58.2M; and up a sturdy 43% from 2006 when Mission: Impossible III stayed at number one with $25M. Both of those action sequels were in their second weekends.Author: Gitesh Pandya, Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"comedy, One, Trophy, transformers, football, Comic-Con, comic, SXSW, marvel, jurassic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Iron-Man-Rocks-Speed-Racer-Stalls"},{"id":"47509206322717","title":"Weekly Ketchup: Mrs. Doubtfire Sequel in the Works","content":"\n\n                                            Weekly Ketchup\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Weekly Ketchup: Mrs. Doubtfire Sequel in the Works\n                        Plus, new roles for Brad Pitt, Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Ferrell.\n                        by Greg Dean Schmitz | April 18, 2014                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                \nThis Week’s Ketchup includes movie development news stories including a Mrs. Doubtfire sequel, and new roles for Johnny Depp, Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Ferrell, and Brad Pitt.\n\n\n\nThis Week’s Top Story\n\t\nROBIN WILLIAMS TO STAR IN MRS.

Twenty one years after Mrs. Doubtfire was one of the hit comedy movies of 1993 (it really was!), Fox 2000 has revived plans for the long-in-development sequel to the film. A lot has changed in those 21 years since Mrs. Doubtfire (and since 1996 when Robin Williams also starred in The Birdcage, another movie featuring cross dressing). Of course, a lot has also not changed, including at the movies, where Tyler Perry’s Madea movies have been consistent hits.  Another sign that things have not changed as much as we would like is that there was a controversy last year over how images from Mrs. Doubtfire were used in online coverage of transgender issues. Williams and director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone) are both expected to return for the sequel, which is being written by David Berenbaum (Elf, The Haunted Mansion).\n\n\n\nFresh Developments This Week\n\t\n#1 STEVEN SPIELBERG PRODUCING AND MAY DIRECT THE KIDNAPPING OF EDGARDO MORTARA\n\nNearly a year and a half after the release of Lincoln, we still don’t know yet what Steven Spielberg’s next directing project will be, although a few different possibilities have occasionally made the news since 2012. Those projects have included the sci-fi movie Robopocalypse, the Moses epic Gods and Kings, the Bradley Cooper movie American Sniper, and a Cortes/Moctezuma movie written 50 years ago by the very late Dalton Trumbo. The latest project that might join that list is an adaptation of the non-fiction book The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara by David Kertzer, which Spielberg is now producing (and might direct).  The book tells the true story of a religious controversy in 1858 during which an Italian Jewish child was taken from his parents and raised as a Catholic (eventually becoming a priest, even). The script is being adapted by Tony Kushner, who previously worked with Steven Spielberg on two other historical true stories (Munich and Lincoln). As for Dalton Trumbo, who died in 1976, his life will soon become a movie of its own, with Bryan Cranston playing Trumbo, and Helen Mirren now in talks to play his wife.\n\n\n\t\n#2 BRAD PITT TO PLAY GENERAL MCCHRYSTAL IN THE OPERATORS\n\nThe legacy of the military career of General Stanley McChrystal might have gone a different way without the publication four years ago of a Rolling Stone profile that quickly became quite controversial. Hollywood history is littered with biographical movies about powerful figures brought down by their own ambitions or egos, and if that’s the way the movie is interpreted, it may happen again for Stanley McChrystal. Brad Pitt is now producing and is attached to star in an adaptation of the book The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America’s War in Afghanistan by Michael Hastings. The movie will be directed by Australian director David Michôd (Animal Kingdom), who is also adapting the screenplay. The Hollywood Reporter describes the book as depicting, “the rise and fall of General Stanley McChrystal, the commanding general of international and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, and offers a behind-the-scenes portrait of our military commanders, their high-stakes maneuvers and the political firestorm that shook the United States.”\n\n\n\t\n#3 LEONARDO DICAPRIO TO GET MAULED BY A BEAR IN THE REVENANT\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel, Amores Perros) will work together for the first time on an adaptation of the Michael Punke novel, The Revenant: A Novel of Revenge. Leonardo DiCaprio will play “a 19th century fur trapper who is mauled by a grizzly bear, left for dead and then robbed. When he survives against all odds, he sets out on a treacherous journey to exact revenge on his betrayers.” Filming is expected to start this September, and The Revenant is expected to be released in the awards season of late 2015. Inarritu’s next released film before The Revenant will be Birdman, featuring Michael Keaton as an aging actor living in the twilight years following playing a very famous superhero.\n\n\n\t\n#4 HOT STUFF THE LITTLE DEVIL TO RAISE HELL FOR DREAMWORKS ANIMATION\n\nThis probably dates this particular writer quite a bit, but one of my favorite “kids comic books” back in the day was Hot Stuff the Little Devil, published by Harvey Comics. He was a character that Hellboy creator Mike Mignola was clearly inspired by (Mignola has also spoofed Hot Stuff with shorts called Hellboy Junior). Basically, Hot Stuff the Little Devil is literally a little devil baby, complete with diapers and an adorable little pitchfork. And Hot Stuff is now in development as yet another character that today’s kids have never heard of, but will get a DreamWorks Animation movie about him anyway. The movie is being adapted by siblings Wendy and Lizzie Molyneux, who have previously worked on the TV series Bob’s Burgers.\n\n\n\t\n#5 WILL FERRELL AND JOHN C. REILLY TO REUNITE AS BORDER GUARDS\n\nWill Ferrell has starred as an TV anchorman just this side of the Mexican border, and in the telenovella spoof Casa de mi Padre. He’s also worked twice before with John C. Reilly (Talladega Nights and Step Brothers). This week’s new project completes both trifectas, as Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are attached to star in the comedy Border Guards. Frequent Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay will be directing from a script by Jesse Armstrong (In the Loop). Ferrell and Reilly will play “two hapless but earnest friends who decide to give purpose to their lives by protecting America’s borders from illegal immigrants. In the process they find themselves accidentally stranded in Mexico without identification and must sneak back into the U.S.”\n\n\n\t\n#6 JADEN SMITH AND LIEV SCHREIBER TO STAR IN THE SLAVERY DRAMA THE GOOD LORD BIRD\n\nWhen one movie finds success, that often leads to other movies with similar subjects finally getting their own chance at a greenlight, and usually, that would lead to a cynical response. However, when the subject matter is something like slavery, and the successful film in question was 12 Years a Slave, it might arguably be an example of Hollywood’s greenlighting cliches actually serving an admirable cause. Liev Schreiber and Jaden Smith (After Earth, The Karate Kid) are now attached to star in The Good Lord Bird, an adaptation of the 2013 National Book Award winner by author James McBride. Jaden Smith will play a young slave in Kansas in 1856 who meets the radical abolitionist John Brown (Schreiber). The book was satirical, and features Jaden Smith’s character wearing a dress, and encounters with other historical figures like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. There’s no director announced yet.\n\n\n\nRotten Ideas of the Week\n\t\n#3 DAVID FINCHER HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE “OTHER” STEVE JOBS BIOPIC\n\nFans of director David Fincher who were excited about him reuniting with writer Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) for the second movie about Apple cofounder Steve Jobs got some bad news this week.  David Fincher has dropped out of the project reportedly over financial bargaining (namely $10 million up front, and control of the film’s marketing). There had also been earlier stories that Fincher’s request for Christian Bale to play Steve Jobs would have also led to a deal breaker, but Bale’s involvement (or lack thereof) wasn’t specifically mentioned as being a cause for Fincher’s departure. David Fincher’s next film in theaters will be Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, on October 3, 2014.\n\n\n\t\n#2 JOHNNY DEPP HAS REPORTEDLY JOINED THE KEVIN SMITH HORROR FILM TUSK\n\nKevin Smith has obviously worked with some big Hollywood stars in the past (like say, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, obviously), but this week’s announcement is sort of on a whole other level. According to actor Justin Long, who has also been cast in Kevin Smith’s walrus-themed horror film Tusk, Johnny Depp will also have a role. Although the story hasn’t been officially confirmed, Kevin Smith had previously hinted that he had landed a major movie star for a supporting role that will only require two days of filming. Michael Parks, Haley Joel Osment, and Genesis Rodriguez will also be in Tusk. Here’s a link to Kevin Smith’s RT Tomatometer page.\n\n\n\t\n#1 JOHN LEGEND ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR A FOUND FOOTAGE DANCE MOVIE\n\nWhen people look back at the sort of annoying movie trends of the years before and after 2010, “found footage” will almost certainly not be remembered 100% fondly. It is certainly true that audiences turn up for (some of) these movies, but the whole “shaky cam” thing is definitely an acquired taste (that doesn’t work with all types of stories, either). Will audiences tolerate the format for a dance movie, for example? R&amp;B singing star John Legend is testing the waters with Breaking Through, a collaboration with Step Up: All In screenwriter John Swetnam. Put another way, the production is describing Breaking Through as a “documentary-style dance drama for the YouTube generation.” It’s (not really) a convincing argument. Why stay at home watching people dance in videos on your tablet when you can go to a movie theater and pay $10-$15 a ticket to see… basically the same thing?\n\n\nFor more Weekly Ketchup columns by Greg Dean Schmitz, check out the WK archive, and you can contact GDS via ","section":"Weekly Ketchup","tags":"99%, Signature, Christmas, Rey, The, series, reboot, Trek, dceu, italian","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Weekly-Ketchup-Mrs-Doubtfire-Sequel-in-the-Works"},{"id":"47509147415548","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prom Night Crowned Multiplex Queen","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Prom Night Crowned Multiplex Queenby Gitesh Pandya | April 13, 2008 |  CommentsTeen girls seized control of the North American box office powering thehorror remake Prom Nightto number one. Adult men settled for the runnerup spot with the Keanu Reevescop thriller Street Kingsas the overall box office failed to generate any kind of notable heat. Themarketplace has now trailed last year’s grosses during eight of the last nineweekends.The frame’s one major bright spot came in the form of Prom Night,a reboot of the 1980 Jamie Lee Curtis chiller, which captured the crown with anestimated $22.7M in its first weekend in theaters. Attacking 2,700 locations,the PG-13 suspense pic averaged a spectacular $8,407 per venue. Horror filmsrarely surpass the $8,000 per-theater average mark unless the word Saw is in the title. Witha strong marketing campaign from Sony’s Screen Gems unit, a recognizable face in Brittany Snow,a commercially friendly rating, and a release date right before prom seasonmaking the subject matter very topical, the slasher hit connected with teens andyoung adults looking for a scare.Prom was just the latest success story from Hollywood’s continuousmission to recycle old horror hits. Audiences came out in huge numbers for otherremakes in recent years like 2003’s The TexasChainsaw Massacre ($28.1M debut), 2004’s Dawn of the Dead($26.7M), 2005’s The AmityvilleHorror ($23.5M), and last year’sHalloween($26.4M). With Prom Night, Sony also tied Fox for the industry lead ofthree $20M+ openers this year. With a production cost of nearly $20M, Prom Nightshould become the latest profitable fright flick for the studio.Collecting about half as much business in its opening weekend was the Keanu Reevescop thriller Street Kingswhich debuted to an estimated $12M. The R-rated actioner averaged a commendable$4,864 from 2,467 sites. Forest Whitaker, Hugh Laurie, Jay Mohr, and Cedric the Entertainerco-star in the tale of dirty L.A. cops. The Fox Searchlight film played to theopposite audience that rallied behind Prom Night pulling in adults with amale skew. Reviews were not kind. The debut was almost identical to the $11.9Mlaunch of the Bruce Willis film 16 Blocks.Both were star-driven police thrillers released in the spring. Blocks eventuallyreached $36.9M.After two weeks as the top card sharks, Kevin Spacey and pals saw theirblackjack pic 21fall to third place with an estimated $11M. Slipping only 28%, the Sony releasewas still a formidable player with an impressive third-frame gross and $4,020average. With a solid $62.3M won in 17 days, the card-counting hit should finishup with a terrific $90M.After a fierce battle over second place last weekend, Fox’s Nim’s Islandand Universal’s Leatherheadswitnessed vastly different sophomore drops that gave the Abigail Breslinadventure a clear edge this time around. The family film dipped only 32% to anestimated $9M while theGeorge Clooneycomedy fumbled by 51% to an estimated $6.2M. Ten-day totals reached $25.3M and$21.9M, respectively. Nim’s, which was produced for $37M, is not facingmuch competition for its core audience so a lengthier run leading to $45-50Mseems likely. The $58M-budgeted Leatherheads is suffering from bad buzzand should end its season with a disappointing $35M. But Universal has two morepromising players hitting the field this month – the comedies ForgettingSarah Marshall and Baby Mama – whichshould allow the studio to recover.The year’s highest grossing film in the domestic market Horton Hears a Whofollowed in sixth with an estimated $6M in its fifth session. Off only 34%, theFox blockbuster has banked $139.6M to date.Miramax posted a modest opening for its Dennis Quaid–Sarah Jessica Parkerdramedy Smart Peoplewhich took in an estimated $4.2M in its first weekend in theaters. Playing inonly 1,106 sites, the R-rated film averaged a lukewarm $3,797 per theater. Olderadults were the target audience with women outnumbering men. Reviews were notvery strong.The Ruins crumbled 59% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.3M thanksto intense competition for the horror crowd from Prom Night. With only$13.4M scared up in ten days, the DreamWorks/Paramount pic should quickly endits run with under $20M.The spoof comedy Superhero Movie grossed an estimated $3.1M, off 43%,and boosted its total to $21.2M for MGM and The Weinstein Co. Paramount’s Drillbit Taylorrounded out the top ten with an estimated $2.1M, down 39%, for a cume to date of$28.5M.A pair of independent films debuted to healthy numbers in limited release thisweekend. Overture generated muscular figures for its illegal alien drama The Visitorwhich grossed an estimated $88,000 from only four houses for a potent $22,000average. The PG-13 film expands wider on Friday.Fox Searchlight saw its musical documentary Young@Hearttake in an estimated $52,312 from four locations as well and averaged a solid$13,078. The senior citizen flick expands to 15 new markets on Friday and willslowly roll out to roughly 260 theaters over the next month.Three radically different films were tossed out of the top ten this weekend.Lionsgate collected an estimated $1.6M for the Tyler Perrycomedy Meet the Browns.Down 54%, the Angela Bassettfilm has taken in $40.1M to date and should reach about $43M overall. Fox’shorror remake Shuttertumbled 63% to an estimated $1.1M for a $24.8M cume. A respectable $26M finalshould result.The prehistoric adventure10,000 BCgrossed an estimated $1.5M, down 46%, and lifted its total to $91.8M. The WarnerBros. actioner will soon surpass studio stablemate The Bucket List tobecome the second highest grossing film of the year so far. A $95M final seemslikely. Overseas, the caveman flick has taken in a robust $158.7M allowing theglobal tally to break the $250M mark this weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $79.5M which was down 13% from last yearwhen Disturbiaopened at number one with $22.2M; and down 26% from 2006 when Scary Movie 4debuted in the top spot over the Easter frame with $40.2M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"chucky, 72, Sundance, Amazon, trailers, FX, television, anthology, Spring, American, bond, The, travel","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Prom-Night-Crowned-Multiplex-Queen"},{"id":"47509147410426","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Baby Mama Delivers a #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Baby Mama Delivers a #1Meanwhile, Harold and Kumar inhale $15 million worth of tickets.by Sujit Chawla | April 27, 2008 |  CommentsThe females beat the males this week as Baby Mama outdueled Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay for the top spot at the box office in this, the final weekend before the summer movie season kicks off.Former SNL Weekend Update co-anchors, and current BFF’s, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler‘s Baby Mama found its way to top of the charts this weekend, taking in an estimated $18.2M. The female buddy comedy about Poehler becoming a surrogate mother for Fey, averaged a strong $7,184 per screen for Universal.Landing in second place was the male buddy comedy Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, which smoked up an estimated $14.5M this weekend, in one of the last releases for New Line Cinema. In 2004, Harold &amp; Kumar Go To White Castle opened with a disappointing $5.5M on its way to a $18.2M final gross. Its sequel, after 4 years of gaining a cult following, nearly hit that amount in its first weekend.Third and fourth places went to last weekend’s numbers one and two. In third was the battle of the martial arts experts, The Forbidden Kingdom. Falling 47.5% from last weekend, the Lionsgate film brought in $11.2M, according to estimates, bringing its total to $38.3. Look for a final gross in the $55M range. Fourth place went to another Universal comedy, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which slipped 38% to $11M, according to estimates, bringing its cume to $35.1M. Look for a final gross in the same $55M range.Fox and Sony controlled the rest of the top 10, with three titles each. In fifth place for a second consecutive weekend was the family adventure Nim’s Island, which had the best hold in the top 10, dipping only 20% for an estimated $4.5M this weekend. Its cume now stands at $39M after four weeks.Sony’s triumverate of films landed in the six to eight spots. Leading off was the PG-13 horror film Prom Night, which fell 49% from last weekend to an estimated $4.4M, bringing its cume to $38.1M. In seventh was the surprisingly strong 21 which fell only 27.5% this weekend, taking in an additional $4M in chips, according to estimates. Its total now stands at a very solid $75.8M. Crashing and burning into eighth was 88 Minutes . The Al Pacino-led thriller fell 48% from last weekend’s debut to an estimated $3.6M. Its total stands at $12.6M with not much more left in the bucket. Look for a final gross in the $15M range.Spending a seventh week in the top 10, and landing at number nine was the Fox animated hit Horton Hears a Who, which took in $2.4M according to estimates, falling 31% from last weekend. Its cume now stands at a towering $147.9M. However its reign as the top grossing film of 2008 will come to an end very shortly. And rounding out the top ten was Fox stablemate Deception which landed with a thud and earned an estimated $2.1M this weekend, for a per theater average of a dismal $1,114. Look for a quick trip to the DVD aisles for this one.The top ten films grossed $76.2M which was up 34% from last year when Disturbia took its third trip to number one with $9M; and down 11% from 2006 when RV debuted in the top spot with $16.4M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"independent, Funimation, Cartoon, globe, Interview, richard, french, leads","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Baby-Mama-Delivers-a-1"},{"id":"47509146304496","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moody Superheroes Rule the Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Moody Superheroes Rule the Box OfficeWhile the Human Spaceship Belly Flopsby Gitesh Pandya | July 13, 2008 |  CommentsA week before The Joker unleashes chaos, moviegoers passed the time by driving the comic book sequel Hellboy II: The Golden Army to a number one debut while also showing up in solid numbers for the 3D adventure Journey to the Center of the Earth. On the other hand, Eddie Murphy‘s new comedy Meet Dave was totally ignored and suffered a dismal debut becoming the summer’s biggest flop. Holdover pictures in the top ten performed well with each dropping by less than 50%.One superhero with an attitude problem replaced another in the top spot as Universal’s actioner Hellboy II debuted ahead of the pack with an estimated $35.9M in its first weekend of release. Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan’s Labyrinth), the PG-13 film opened 55% better than the $23.2M bow of its 2004 predecessor which Sony released. It went on to gross a mediocre $59M but grew its audience on DVD and cable. Golden Army averaged a sturdy $11,200 from 3,204 theaters. Budgeted at $85M, the new Hellboy took advantage of a built-in audience of fans and the starpower that its director has generated after winning three Oscars for Labyrinth. Reviews were very favorable and the studio is keeping the door open for a sequel, even though del Toro will spend the next three years in New Zealand making back-to-back Hobbit films.Close behind in second place was Will Smith‘s latest blockbuster Hancock which dropped 47% to an estimated $33M to boost its cume to a robust $165M after twelve and a half days. That’s an exact match to the total that 2005’s sci-fi action offering from Independence Day weekend War of the Worlds took in after its second session. The Steven Spielberg-Tom Cruise collaboration suffered a bigger drop of 53% and a smaller sophomore take of $30.5M, but did not have the extra revenue from night-before-opening previews like Hancock.It was a strong hold for Smith especially with the solid debuts of two new action films. Hancock also gave the superstar actor his fifth consecutive $150M+ blockbuster further cementing his status as the most bankable star in Hollywood. The road ahead could be a rough one though given Friday’s eagerly-awaited launch of the competing superhero juggernaut The Dark Knight, but a final domestic tally in the neighborhood of $250M could result. Overseas, the badass crimefighter soared to $180.2M in sales catapulting the worldwide cume to an eye-popping $345M in less than two weeks. The $150M production could fly to $500-600M globally.Opening well in third place was the 3D adventure tale Journey to the Center of the Earth starring Brendan Fraser with an estimated $20.6M. The New Line/Warner Bros. film launched in 2,811 theaters and averaged a solid $7,321 per site. However, the grosses from 3D and traditional 2D theaters were like night and day. A whopping 70% of the total venues did not have equipment to offer the film in 3D and those theaters averaged only about $2,000 each. But the 854 sites that did screen the PG-rated film in 3D averaged close to $20,000 per playdate and accounted for more than 80% of the weekend business. Most of those charged higher ticket prices too which helped to boost the grosses. Reviews were generally good for the $60M-budgeted project. Journey also had a limited international premiere grossing $4.2M from five markets led by $2.1M in the United Kingdom and $1.5M in Brazil.Disney and Pixar followed in fourth with WALL•E which grossed an estimated $18.5M in its third frame dropping 43%. The decline was bigger than Ratatouille‘s 38% dip during its third session a year ago this same weekend. The robot pic opened $16M better than the rodent comedy, but now their third weekend tallies are nearly identical as WALL•E‘s legs have not been as sturdy. Still, look for this latest animation gem to roll its way to roughly $220M domestically.Angelina Jolie had an eventful weekend welcoming in two new babies and also having twin films in the top ten. Her action thriller Wanted placed fifth with an estimated $11.6M, down 42%, boosting Universal’s cume to $112M. The actress also voiced Tigress in Kung Fu Panda further down on the chart. Jolie has now upped her counts for both children and $100M career blockbusters to six each.Get Smart came in sixth with an estimated $7.1M, down only 36%, and reached $111.5M after 24 days for Warner Bros.Stealing the ‘Flop of the Summer’ title from Speed Racer, Eddie Murphy stumbled into seventh place with a disastrous opening for his new comedy Meet Dave which grossed just $5.3M, according to estimates. The PG-rated film landed in 3,011 theaters and averaged a puny $1,760. It was the third worst opening in box office history for a film released in more than 3,000 theaters and certainly the poorest for a pricey star vehicle. The only films to open worse were last year’s The Seeker: The Dark is Rising ($3.7M from 3,141 sites) and 2006’s Hoot ($3.4M from 3,018 playdates).Carrying a budget of roughly $60M, buzz was always bad for Meet Dave and the concept of Murphy playing a human-looking spaceship operated by a mini crew inside of him, with a captain also played by the funnyman, did not fly with audiences. Competition also played a part as every film that ranked higher also offered action, comedy, or both. Dave‘s opening was a far cry from the solid $34.2M debut that Murphy’s comedy Norbit scored last year and joins the Oscar-nominated comedian’s hall of box office shame along with The Adventures of Pluto Nash, Holy Man, and Best Defense.Kung Fu Panda dropped 41% to eighth place with an estimated $4.3M sending the martial arts toon across the $200M mark with a total to date of $202M. The Paramount/DreamWorks pic is running 8% behind the pace of Disney/Pixar’s Cars from 2006 and will probably finish with roughly $215M. The Abigail Breslin pic Kit Kittredge: An American Girl held up well in its second weekend of wide release slipping just 29% to an estimated $2.4M. Though it enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten, it still has only collected $11M to date and seems headed for a $18-20M finish.Rounding out the top ten was Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with an estimated $2.3M in its eighth weekend, down 40%, raising the overall tally to $310.5M. The Harrison Ford adventure sequel is now within striking distance of fellow Paramount release Iron Man‘s $313.4M and could become the new top grosser of 2008. Warner Bros. fully intends to make it a three-picture race with The Dark Knight which could very well reach the same stratosphere by month’s end.Three films fell from the top ten this weekend. Universal’s The Incredible Hulk took in an estimated $2.2M, off 55%, for a $129.8M sum. That puts the new green guy a scant 1% ahead of Ang Lee’s Hulk at the same point in its 2003 run. Factor in higher ticket prices and the new Hulk has actually attracted fewer fans than the old one did, and cost a bit more. Budgeted at $150M, The Incredible Hulk should end up with about $135M edging out the $132.2M gross of Hulk, but will sell 13% fewer tickets. Overseas, the Edward Norton pic smashed the $100M mark boosting the international cume to $101.3M and the global tally to $231M.The much more profitable Sex and the City banked an estimated $1.7M, down only 28%, and raised its total to a stellar $148.2M. A final domestic haul of $155M seems likely for the New Line film distributed by Warner Bros. The overseas performance for the $60M production has been sensational with $220.5M taken in to date accounting for 60% of the global haul of $369M. Astounding industry observers, Sex has become the fourth biggest global blockbuster of 2008 after the Paramount triumvirate of Indiana Jones, Iron Man, and Kung Fu Panda.The summer’s other fashion-related comedy You Don’t Mess With the Zohan fell 46% to an estimated $1.1M giving the Adam Sandler vehicle $96.9M so far. The Sony release should inch its way to the $100M mark making it the comedian’s lowest gross for a broad comedy since 2000’s Little Nicky.The top ten films grossed an estimated $140.9M which was down 17% from last year when Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix opened in the top spot with $77.1M; and off 5% from 2006 when Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest spent a second weekend at number one with $62.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"award, crime, tv, Amazon, Tarantino, thriller, cancelled, LGBT, TV, movies, Calendar, Mary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moody-Superheroes-Rule-the-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509146315765","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Indiana Jones Rules Over Slow Holiday Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Indiana Jones Rules Over Slow Holiday WeekendCG gophers no deterrent for moviegoers worldwide.by Gitesh Pandya | May 26, 2008 |  CommentsHarrison Fordscored his first number one opening in eight years with the much-hyped adventuresequel Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skullwhich dominated moviegoing over the Memorial Day holiday weekend grossing morethan all other films in the marketplace combined. But despite the explosivestart for the long-awaited return of Indy, the rest of the box office slumpedwith few strong performances from supporting players. Overall it was the slowestMemorial Day weekend in five years.19 years after the last installment, the Indiana Jones franchise provedthat it was still relevant in today’s entertainment world as Crystal Skull opened to a stunning $126M over the four-dayFriday-to-Monday holiday period, according to estimates. The Friday-to-Sundayportion accounted for $101M and since the Paramount release’s Thursday launchthe cume has soared to $151.1M in five days. Playing in 4,260 locations, thePG-13 pic averaged a sensational $23,709 over three days and $29,587 over fourdays.The Friday-to-Sunday figure ranks as the tenth highest debut in box officehistory while the cume is the sixth best five-day start ever. The only otherfilms to gross more in their first five days of release were Star Wars Episode III($172.8M, Thu-Mon), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($169.5M, Fri-Tue), Spider-Man 3($169.4M, Fri-Tue), Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End ($153M, Thu previews-Mon), and Spider-Man 2($152.4M, Wed-Sun). Not bad company. The $185M-budgeted Kingdom alsoenjoyed the second largest Memorial Day weekend opening ever after last year’sAt World’s End which looted $139.8M over its official Friday-to-Mondayperiod.Crystal Skull marked the reunion ofHarrison Fordwith directorSteven Spielbergand executive producer George Lucaswhile newcomers like Shia LaBeoufand Cate Blanchettjoined the cast for this fourth escapade. Reviews were mixed but generallypositive. The five-day opening began with $25M on Thursday. Friday saw a 24%increase to $31M, Saturday jumped another 19% to $37M, Sunday dipped by 11% to$33M, and the studio is estimating a 24% Monday decline to $25M.The new Indiana Jones adventure also attacked multiplexes around theworld and grossed a stellar $160M internationally since its first launches onWednesday. Indy ranked number one in all 61 territories it opened in andbrought its global cume to $311M in less than one week of play.Last week’s top film The Chronicles ofNarnia: Prince Caspian tumbled in its second weekend of release to anestimated $28.6M over four days as the Friday-to-Sunday portion collapsed by ahorrific 58%. It was the worst gross in nine years for the second place filmover Memorial Day weekend. In 1999, Notting Hillclaimed that spot with $27.7M over four days behind chart-topper Star WarsEpisode I. However, that amount would be about $38M at today’s prices so thenew Narnia still sold fewer tickets.Caspian boosted its 11-day total to $96.7M and looks as if it will topout at $140-150M from North America or about half of the $291.7M that The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe grossed. This is a major stumblefor Disney which has been developing Narnia as a long-term franchise meant tokeep revenue flowing in for several years to come.The year’s top-grossing smash Iron Manfinished its fourth weekend in third with a strong $25.7M over four days,according to estimates, and watched its cume skyrocket to $257.8M. The three-dayportion dropped by just 37%. Paramount and Marvel continued to benefit fromsolid word-of-mouth as the super hero flick raced up to number 40 on the list ofall-time domestic blockbusters surpassing I Am Legend‘s $256.4M. Withboth Iron Man and Indiana Jones rocking the holiday box office,Paramount dominated the multiplexes accounting for a whopping 72% of the entiretop ten. The Robert Downey Jr. sensation is a virtual lock to join the $300Mclub now.Moviegoers looking for a comedy over the long weekend found it in theCameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcherpic What Happens in Vegaswhich took in an estimated $11.2M over four days. Meanwhile Speed Racercontinued to crash and burn falling to an estimated $5.2M. Each film was in itsthird weekend. Totals stand at a robust $56.4M for the Fox hit and a miserable$37.4M for the pricey Warner Bros. entry.Both Speed Racer and Prince Caspian were expected to add muscularnumbers to the May box office but moviegoers have not been too impressed. Theweaker-than-expected openings and the steep declines have led to a lack of depthin the marketplace as the Memorial Day frame usually sees strong contributionsfrom a number of different films.Universal’s pregnancy comedy Baby Mamaheld up well again grossing an estimated $4.2M in four days boosting the overalltake to $53M. Also laughing up the same estimated amount was the romantic comedy Made of Honorraising Sony’s cume to $40M.Forgetting Sarah Marshallwas still remembered by audiences in its sixth frame taking in an estimated$2.2M for a $58.7M total for Universal. New Line’s Harold &amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bayfollowed with an estimated $1.2M in its fifth outing for a $36.2M sum. Roundingout the top ten was the indie hit The Visitorwith an estimated $917,000 lifting the cume to $4.6M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $209.4M over four days which was down 14%from last year when Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End opened in the topspot with $139.8M; and down 9% from 2006 when X-Men: The Last Stand debuted atnumber one with $102.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"HBO, Country, revenge, Comedy, York, Hear, worst, El, Awards, DirecTV, Quiz, breaking, Fall","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Indiana-Jones-Rules-Over-Slow-Holiday-Weekend"},{"id":"47509146320888","title":"Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes Out","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Critics Consensus: No Go for Speed Racer, Vegas Cashes OutAlso, Redbelt mostly hits its mark.by Tim Ryan | May 8, 2008 |  CommentsThis week at the movies, we’ve got fast cars (Speed Racer,starring EmileHirsch and Christina Ricci),marital mishaps (What Happens in Vegas,starringAshton Kutcher andCameron Diaz),and battle royals (David Mamet‘s Redbelt,starringChiwetel Ejiofor).What do the critics have to say?Sing along with me: “Here it comes, here comes Speed Racer / It’s gettingbad reviews….” The critics say the Wachowski brothers’ big-screen adaptation ofthe old-school toon is loaded with flashy visuals, but is too bombastic andthinly plotted to resonate. Emile Hirsch stars as the titular hero, who, withthe support of main squeeze Trixie (Christina Ricci), battles it out it out withRacer X (Matthew Fox) in a cross-county road race that Speed learns is beingunfairly influenced by corporate interests. The pundits say Speed Racer istoo loaded with eye-popping (some say headache-inducing) visuals and too shorton character development and coherent plotting. At 32 percent on theTomatometer, you may not want to go (Speed Racer) go to this one. (Checkout this week’s Total Recall, in which we count down the greatest movie cars ofall time.)“Rotten!”How much mileage can a movie get out of the appeal of its stars? With regard toWhat Happens in Vegas, the critics say quite a bit — though perhaps notenough to deal this formulaic romantic comedy a winning hand.Ashton Kutcher andCameron Diaz star as a pair of strangers who stumble into matrimony afterhitting the jackpot; what follows is a battle of the sexes and a tug-of-war overthe money. The pundits say Diaz and Kutcher display solid comedic chops, but arelet down by a predictable plot and a sour undercurrent. At 50 percent on theTomatometer, you have even odds of enjoying this one.“I doubt that’s going to fit in the ATM slot.”With a gift for cryptic language and complex characterization,David Mamet isone of America’s most celebrated playwrights. It turns out he’s also a bigmartial arts fan. In Redbelt, Mamet’s passions collide, and critics sayit’s a solid, if not spectacular, combination.Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as aJiu-Jitsu teacher who preaches self-defense; however, after an accident new hisschool triggers a series of ominous events, he’s forced to step into the ring.The pundits say Redbelt features many of the strengths of Mamet’s work:strong acting (from a cast that includes Joe Mantegna,Emily Mortimer, andTimAllen), intriguing moral dilemmas, and rich dialogue. But some say it’s a littletoo tightly scripted to be fully believable. Still, at 64 percent, the scribessay Redbelt hits pretty hard.“For next year’s fundraiser, we should just have a cops vs. firemenbasketball game!”Also opening this week in limited release:Refusnik, a documentary about longstanding activist efforts to help Jewsin the Soviet Union, is at 100 percent.Turn the River, starringFamke Janssen as a pool hustler working to getback the son she gave up at birth, is at 88 percent.The MemoryThief, starring Mark Webber and Rachel Miner in the tale of a man whobecomes obsessed with the Holocaust, is at 86 percent.Monster Camp,a doc about live action role playing, is at 83 percent.OSS117: Cairo, Nest of Spies, a parody of espionage thrillers, is at 75percent.The Merchant-Ivory period drama, Before theRains, about a cross-cultural love affair in 1930s India, is at 50percent.Battle forHaditha, Nick Broomfield s chronicle of a dark campaign in the Iraq war,is at 44 percent.Noise, starring Tim Robbins in a comedy about a man who loses it afterbeing inundated with street sounds, is at 44 percent.The French slasher import,Frontier(s), abouta group of criminals who stumble into a house full of flesh-eaters, is at 43percent.The TraceyFragments, starringEllen Page ina dark comedy about a teenager searching for her brother, is at 40 percent.The Fall, a fantasy film about strange goings-on in a Los Angeleshospital, is at 42 percent.The Babysitters, starringJohn Leguizamo and Cynthia Nixon in comedyabout a girl who stars a sitting/callgirl business, is at 34 percent.“Patti Smith or Sonic Youth?”Wachowski Brothers Movies:—————————————-37% — The Matrix Revolutions (2003)73% — The Matrix Reloaded (2003)86% — The Matrix (1999)88% — Bound (1996)","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"biography, movie, crime, award, thriller, series, Adventures, YouTube, supernatural, Apple, tv, Awards, Winter, Schedule","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Critics-Consensus-No-Go-for-Speed-Racer-Vegas-Cashes-Out"},{"id":"47509146307570","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: WALL-E and Jolie: Box Office Power Couple","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: WALL-E and Jolie: Box Office Power CoupleThe lonely robot rocks the boxoffice.by Gitesh Pandya | June 29, 2008 |  CommentsMetal ruled the North American box office as the robot adventure WALL-E and the assassin thriller Wanted featuring a gun-toting Angelina Jolie rocked the multiplexes hauling in an eye-popping $114M in combined ticket sales. It was the first time in history that two films opened with more than $50M each on the same weekend. Powered by the explosive openings of the pair of new releases, the weekend box office climbed to its highest point yet in 2008.Robot love was in the air as moviegoers powered WALL-E into the number one spot with an estimated $62.5M in ticket sales. Playing in 3,992 sites, the G-rated space adventure averaged a sizzling $15,656 per theater and gave Pixar its ninth consecutive top spot debut. It was the eighth largest opening ever for an animated film and the fourth highest for Pixar after The Incredibles ($70.5M in 2004), Finding Nemo ($70.3M in 2003), and Monsters, Inc. ($62.6M in 2001). It was the third best bow for a G-rated film after (Nemo and Monsters) and WALL-E also gave Disney its biggest opening in over a year. Film critics were in awe with the computer-animated pic giving it some of the best reviews of any film this year.Pixar’s last film Ratatouille opened to $47M this weekend a year ago and was equally loved by critics, but featured a premise involving a rat cooking in a kitchen which turned off some audiences. The company’s previous effort Cars bowed to $60.1M in early June 2006 and featured a better premise, but got mixed reactions from critics. This time around, WALL-E successfully delivered a story that could be universally loved and was applauded by reviewers. It even overcame the liability of having very little human dialogue. With a CinemaScore grade of A plus a major holiday weekend coming up for Independence Day, long-term prospects look solid as positive word-of-mouth is sure to spread.The lonely robot kicked off its weekend with a potent $23.1M on Friday, Saturday sales dipped by 5% to $22M, while Sunday was estimated to drop by 21% to $17.4M. The Saturday decline was a bit unusual, but could be attributed to the upfront demand on Friday when most children were out of school. Studio research showed that 51% of the audience was female while 59% was under 25. Disney did report a high number of couples without children indicating that WALL-E is not only playing as a family film but as a date movie too.Angelina Jolie‘s latest high-octane action vehicle Wanted may have settled for second place, but the Universal release scored a sensational debut that soared above all expectations. The R-rated pic launched with an estimated $51.1M over the weekend from 3,175 locations for a scorching average of $16,100 per theater. It was the seventh largest opening in box office history for any R-rated film and marks a new career high for the actress for a live-action opener. Her previous bests were also June action titles – 2005’s Mr. and Mrs. Smith ($50.3M) and 2001’s Lara Croft: Tomb Raider ($47.7M). Legally speaking, Jolie did not get top billing in Wanted but instead was third-billed in the credits after James McAvoy and Morgan Freeman and received the ‘and’ credit in the titles. Reviews were mostly positive.The tale of an ordinary office worker recruited by a secret group of elite assassins was sold as a stylish action picture and was backed by a slick marketing campaign that accented the visual effects in the film. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch) put his unique stamp on the $75M production and word of Jolie’s nude scene certainly did not repel any ticket buyers. According to studio research, males made up 52% of the crowd while 51% was under 30. Friday started with a bang with a $19.2M opening day, Saturday slipped 8% to $17.6M, and Sunday is projected to fall 19% to $14.3M. Wanted also generated the third best opening for an R-rated summer film behind only The Matrix Reloaded ($91.8M in 2003) and Sex and the City ($56.8M last month).Universal also rolled out the assassin pic in 22 international territories and grossed an estimated $33M giving Wanted an explosive global debut of $84.1M. Russia led the way with $11M, the U.K shot up $8M, and South Korea kicked in $6.7M. The hit film is part of the studio’s summer slate of action entries along with The Incredible Hulk from earlier this month, July’s Hellboy II, and August’s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.WALL•E and Wanted capped off a sensational June box office that was on fire from start to finish. The marketplace could not be in better shape as it heads into the second half of 2008 which begins with the Fourth of July holiday session which gets an early start at 7pm on Tuesday night with the first showings of Will Smith‘s superhero actioner Hancock.Dropping from first to third was the action-comedy remake Get Smart with an estimated $20M in its second weekend. Off 48%, the Steve Carell vehicle lost an understandable amount of business given the competition from new releases. The $80M-budgeted film has now grossed $77.3M in its first ten days and seems set to finish with $125-135M for Warner Bros.The arrival of WALL•E prompted a larger decline than normal for rival animation entry Kung Fu Panda which dipped 47% to an estimated $11.7M in its fourth frame. With $179.3M tallied for Paramount and DreamWorks, the Po pic is running 6% behind the pace of 2006’s June toon Cars which raced to $190.5M at this same point in its release.Universal’s The Incredible Hulk continues to show rapid audience erosion falling 58% in its third session to an estimated $9.2M. The Edward Norton starrer has smashed up $115.5M in 17 days putting it a scant 1% behind the pace of 2003’s Hulk which stood at $117M at the same point in its run.Mike Myers saw his latest comedy The Love Guru tumble 61% to an estimated $5.4M lifting the ten-day total to just $25.3M. The $60M production looks to end up with only $35-40M for Paramount.Studio stablemate Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came within a hair of joining the triple century club this weekend thanks to another solid hold. The Harrison Ford adventure dropped 41% and collected an estimated $5M in its sixth weekend boosting the cume to a stunning $299.9M. Add in Iron Man, Transformers and Shrek the Third and by Monday Paramount will have distributed four of the last five megahits to break the $300M barrier. Crystal Skull now sits at number 28 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which grossed $305.4M in 2003.M. Night Shyamalan‘s eco-thriller The Happening collapsed another 63% to an estimated $3.9M for a $59.1M total for Fox. Sex and the City followed with an estimated $3.8M, off 42%, giving New Line and Warner Bros. an impressive $140.1M to date. Adam Sandler rounded out the top ten with Sony’s You Don’t Mess With the Zohan which dropped 57% to an estimated $3.2M giving the comedy $91.2M. Though a solid number, it is the worst total for one of the actor’s broad comedies after the fourth weekend since 2000’s Little Nicky.A pair of May success stories dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The year’s biggest blockbuster Iron Man finally fell out of the elite list in its ninth frame but still grossed an estimated $2.3M. Off 44%, the Marvel-Paramount smash saw its cume soar to $309.2M putting it at number 24 on the all-time hit list behind Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End which banked $309.4M last summer. With a hefty production cost of $185M, Iron Man should conclude its North American run with roughly $315M while its colossal worldwide total looks to reach beyond $600M.Universal’s hit horror film The Strangers tumbled 71% in its fifth scare to an estimated $611,000 boosting the total to a solid $51.5M. The R-rated fright flick cost just $9M and looks to end its run with $53M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $175.9M which was up a sturdy 24% from last year when Ratatouille opened in the top spot with $47M; and up 26% from 2006 when Superman Returns debuted at number one with $52.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"robots, hist, crime, shows, canceled, TIFF, Pictures, mutant, Epix, Pacific, Tubi","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-WALLE-and-Jolie-Box-Office-Power-Couple"},{"id":"47509147432965","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Girlpower Rules Over Super Bowl Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Girlpower Rules Over Super Bowl WeekendAmerica gets The Best of Both Worlds.by Gitesh Pandya | February 3, 2008 |  CommentsTween girls sacked the competition over Super Bowl weekend as the music pic Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concertshattered records and opened at number one at the North American box office.Debuting in second with solid results of its own was the Jessica Albacreepfest The Eye,but the comedies Over Her Dead Bodyand Strange Wildernessdebuted outside of the top ten with more modest results. Overall, themarketplace stayed strong with the top ten beating year-ago levels by more than30% for the third consecutive weekend.Shooting higher than the loftiest of expectations, Disney’s Hannah Montana film commanded an estimated $29M in ticket sales thisweekend from only 683 theaters for an eye-popping $42,460 average setting a newrecord for the Super Bowl frame. Presented in digital 3D cinemas, with 96% ofthe sites featuring RealD technology, the grosses were boosted by mostexhibitors charging $15 per ticket instead of the usual admission charges.Still, the G-rated film more than doubled its nearest competitor and sold outover a thousand showtimes during the weekend. The release was not as wide asother films since Disney was limited to only those auditoriums equipped with thenecessary facilities to project in digital 3D.Hannah Montana set a number of new box office milestones althoughasterisks will need to be added to the record books since it had the advantageof the higher-priced tickets. It was the largest opening ever over Super Bowlweekend beating the $21.6M of 2006’s horror entry When a StrangerCalls, and the largest overall weekend gross over this frame surpassingTitanicwhich banked $25.2M in 1998 in its sixth weekend. The gross for the icebergromance would be over $36M at today’s regular prices. Hannah also set therecord for the smallest amount of theaters for a film debuting at number one.Best of Both Worlds offered fans many reasons to rush out and grab aseat. Given the star’s 69-city sold-out concert tour, the film allowed Hannahlovers an easier way to see their favorite singer locally without having to getparents to buy scalped tickets. Add in the digital 3D presentation and thepromotion of an exclusive one-week-only run and ticket buyers wasted no time inmaking sure they got their stubs and showed up. An event film was born.

Saturday saw incredible strength with matinee business fromkids going on their parents’ first day off from work with sales surging anamazing 52% to $13.1M. The studio has estimated that Sunday’s grosses will dropby 45% to $7.3M. Most studios are estimating larger-than-normal declines of60-65% on Sunday for their films because of the Super Bowl, however HannahMontana‘s young female audience is least likely to care about the big gameso its drop should be lighter.Studio research indicated few surprises in the audience turnout. Females made upa whopping 84% of the crowd and those under the age of 25 accounted for 70%.Reviews were generally upbeat for the trim 74-minute concert film which allowedtheaters to schedule plenty of showtimes over the weekend to absorb demand.Hollywood’s annual Super Bowl weekend horror offering had to settle for therunnerup prize.

The Disney adventuresequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets held steady at number one for thesecond straight time grossing an estimated $35.6M. Dropping a reasonable 20%,the PG-rated actioner saw its ten-day total soar to $124M. Nicolas Cage‘sfranchise pic averaged a terrific $9,299 from 3,832 playdates. Book ofSecrets has already broken into the Top 20 chart of this year’s blockbustersand stands a chance of reaching the Top 10. That would be fitting since five ofthe six biggest hits of 2007 were sequels.Another PG-rated film catering to moviegoers of all ages followed in second.Fox’s family comedy sensation Alvin and the Chipmunks saw its weekend gross climb up 7% from lastweekend to an estimated $30M which boosted the cume to a stunning $142.4M inonly 17 days. If estimates hold, Alvin will become the first film in ayear and a half to gross $30M or more in its third weekend. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest was the last smash to do itback in July 2006. Alvin already sits at number 13 among all blockbustersfrom 2007 and is Fox’s second-biggest hit of the year after the $183.1M of The Simpsons Movie.Will Smith‘smegahit I Am Legendcollected an estimated $27.5M in its third weekend, off 18%, pushing itssensational total to $194.6M after 17 days. The Warner Bros. blockbuster is justa couple of days away from becoming the ninth blockbuster of 2007 to cross the$200M mark edging out 2005’s eight to set a new industry record.

Thatpolitical saga appealed to much the same audience and went on to gross $59.9Mdomestically. War cost $75M to produce.Indie darling Juno continued tooverwhelm at the box office leaping up into the number five slot with anestimated $10.3M despite playing in only 998 theaters. Every film above it onthe charts is in at least 2,500 sites. The teen pregnancy tale averaged astill-superb $10,321 in its fourth frame and pushed the sum up to a remarkable$25.7M. Juno is already outperforming Fox Searchlight’s dysfunctionalfamily comedy hit from last year Little MissSunshine which in its fourth frame grossed $5.6M from its expansion into691 locations for a $8,120 average and $12.7M total. With buzz snowballing,kudos attention becoming more focused, and a long awards season still ahead ofit, Juno looks to challenge Sunshine and 2004’s Sideways to becomethe distributor’s highest-grossing film ever. Those Oscar-winning comediesbanked $59.9M and $71.5M, respectively.Opening in sixth place was the sci-fi action sequel Alien vs Predator: Requiemwith an estimated $10.1M over the weekend and $26.9M over the six-day debutperiod since its Christmas Day launch on Tuesday. Attacking 2,611 sites, theR-rated pic averaged a mild $3,849 and skewed male to nobody’s surprise. Thesix-day bow still fell short of the $38.3M three-day opening of 2004’s Alien vs. Predatorwhich carried a PG-13 rating and launched in the late summer period.Sony was close behind in seventh with the opening of its fantasy adventuretale The WaterHorse which grossed an estimated $9.2M over the weekend and $16.8Mover six days. Over the three-day period, the PG-rated tale averaged a lukewarm$3,319 per site in 2,772 locations. The Loch Ness Monster saga played mostly tokids and families.Enjoying a sturdy bump from last weekend was the romance P.S. I Love Youwhich took in an estimated $9.1M climbing 40% from it unimpressive bow lastweekend. Warner Bros. has banked $23.4M in ten days and is finally reaching itscore audience of adult women now that holiday distractions have gone by.TheJohnny Deppmusical Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetdropped 14% to anestimated $8M in its second weekend. The $50M Paramount release has taken in$26.7M in ten days. Disney’s less gory music-filled offering Enchantedrounded out the top ten with an estimated $6.5M, up a charming 54%, to a totalof $110.7M.Opening just outside the top ten with a surprisingly soft bow wasDenzelWashington‘s directorial and starring effort The Great Debaterswith an estimated $6.3M from 1,171 sites for a decent $5,383 average. Producedby OprahWinfrey and co-starringForestWhitaker, the PG-13 film has collected an unimpressive $13.5M in the sixdays since its Christmas Day bow which is below what Washington usually seeswith his films. The Oprah factor was also expected to provide more of acommercial boost.Delivering the highest opening weekend average of the year, ParamountVantage’s oil baron saga There Will BeBlood exploded in just two theaters grossing an estimated $186,000for an eye-popping $92,763 average. Co-produced by Miramax, the R-rated film isanchored by Daniel Day-Lewis who in recent weeks has earned awards and nominations fromvirtually every kudos organization in the Best Actor category. He is nowconsidered one of the frontrunners for the Oscar. Reviews have been glowing forBlood which will expand on Friday to 50 theaters and gradually roll outin January.The top ten films grossed an estimated $158.1M which was up a healthy 18%from last year when Night at theMuseum stayed at number one with $36.8M over three days; and up astunning 41% from 2005 when The Chronicles of Narnia reclaimed the top spot with $25.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TV, twilight, hist, Christmas, TNT, Shudder, 2020, jurassic, Studios, Fox, Larson, emmy, Tour, Emmy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Cage-Alvin-and-Will-Still-Rule-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509147422719","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Horton Hears Cash Registers Ring at Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Horton Hears Cash Registers Ring at Box OfficeAll the Whos down in Whoville are rolling in dough.by Gitesh Pandya | March 16, 2008 |  CommentsNorth American film fans heard the call of the elephant and stampeded to the box office to see the animated Dr. Seuss pic Horton Hears a Who, which enjoyed the largest opening weekend of the year so far. The testosterone flick Never Back Down launched to decent numbers; however, the virus thriller Doomsday was dead on arrival in its debut. But ‘toon power was able to revitalize the marketplace, sending the top 10 above the $100M mark and ahead of year-ago levels for the first time in a month.Jim Carrey and Steve Carell lent their voices to Horton and ticket buyers responded, spending an estimated $45.1M on the Fox hit for a strong number one premiere. The G-rated tale bowed ultrawide in 3,954 locations and averaged a sturdy $11,406 per theater. The Whoville story generated the fourth best March opening ever, behind 300 ($70.9M), Ice Age: The Meltdown ($68M), and the original Ice Age ($46.3M) and also landed the fifth largest opening in history for a G-rated film.Horton took advantage of star power, the popularity of the Seuss brand, and an open marketplace with few options for families to help it post the year’s best debut. But the film went beyond just parents and kids — the studio reports that 47 percent of the audience was non-family, with teens kicking in a significant contribution. Budgeted at $85M, the animated feature also garnered glowing reviews from most critics. Horton also bowed in 29 international markets this weekend, and captured an estimated $14.2M tally.Animated films opening in March usually enjoy strong legs thanks to the Easter holiday and school vacations. Ice Age‘s opening weekend represented only 26 percent of its eventual $176.4M domestic final. Fox’s 2005 film Robots witnessed a 28 percent share, Meltdown played like a sequel and saw 35 percent, and last year’s Disney offering Meet the Robinsons grabbed 26 percent. Horton should follow in the same footsteps, as direct competition in the coing weeks is not too fierce, leading to possibly $150-175M from North America alone.Trailing the animated elephant were the woolly mammoths of 10,000 BC. The not-so-accurate account of prehistoric times fell 54 percent in its second outing to an estimated $16.4M and pushed the total to $61.2M after 10 days. Given the bad reviews, negative word-of-mouth and the genre, the sharp decline was expected. The Warner Bros. title is playing almost exactly like another spring historical actioner, 2002’s The Scorpion King. The Rock starrer generated similar numbers with a $36.1M debut and $61.3M 10-day take before concluding with $90.5M. 10,000 BC should find its way to the same vicinity domestically. Overseas, the prehistoric pic collected a mighty $38M this weekend as it saw top spot debuts in the United Kingdom, Korea, and Russia and second place launches in France and Italy. The international cume has risen to $73M putting the global gross at an impressive $134M.So far this year, moviegoers have been showing up in the same numbers, but have spread their dollars across a wider selection of movies than in 2007. Overall domestic box office is up 4 percent compared to the same period last year, and when factoring in the annual increase in ticket prices, total admissions are up only a slight amount. But at this point in 2007, six films had crossed the $50M mark, including three that broke the $100M barrier; this year, none have reached nine digits yet, but a whopping 10 have vaulted ahead of $50M (not including Horton, which is just days away from surpassing that mark).The Mixed Martial Arts drama Never Back Down debuted to mediocre results and landed in third place with an estimated $8.6M from a wide 2,729 theaters. Averaging a mild $3,155, the PG-13 high school tale is the first in-house production from new distributor Summit and played to an audience of young males. Research showed that 59 percent of the audience was male and 60 percent were under 21. Never was budgeted at $20M.Martin Lawrence’s second comedy of the year, College Road Trip, dropped a moderate 42 percent in its second weekend,, grossing an estimated $7.9M. With $24.3M collected in 10 days, the G-rated family flick should end up in the neighborhood of $45M.Sony’s action thriller Vantage Point has been enjoying surprisingly strong legs, and slipped only 27 percent this week, to an estimated $5.4M for a solid cume of $59.2M. Rival actioner The Bank Job posted an even greater hold, sliding only 17 percent in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.9M, giving Lionsgate $13.1M in 10 days. The high-octane pics should reach about $75M and $27M, respectively.Universal suffered a dismal opening for its futuristic virus thriller Doomsday, which bowed to just $4.7M, according to estimates, from 1,936 theaters. The R-rated pic averaged a miserable $2,450 and should find its real audience on DVD this summer.Will Ferrell‘s basketball comedy Semi-Pro fell 49 percent to eighth with an estimated $3M, pushing the total for New Line to $29.8M. Look for a final of roughly $35M, making it the comedian’s lowest-grossing lead performance in a wide release since 1998’s Night at the Roxbury.Sony’s The Other Boleyn Girl dipped only 28 percent to an estimated $2.9M for a cume of $19.2M. The kidpic The Spiderwick Chronicles rounded out the top 10 with an estimated $2.4M, off 49 percent, for a $65.4M sum. Final grosses should reach $26M and $70M, respectively.Warner Independent had a mixed weekend with its pair of limited release titles. The Naomi Watts thriller Funny Games opened in 289 theaters and grossed an estimated $520,000 for a dull $1,800 average. But its promising platform release Snow Angels added one Los Angeles site and took in an estimated $26,000 from three sites for a potent $8,667 average. The Kate Beckinsale starrer expands to the top 10 on Friday during its third session.Three solid box office performers fell from the top 10 this weekend. Fox’s sci-fi flick Jumper dropped 42 percent to an estimated $2.1M, lifting the total to $75.8M. The $85M Hayden Christensen–Samuel L. Jackson actioner should conclude with about $80M. It’s already banked $100M overseas and counting.The $70M adventure comedy Fool’s Gold collected an estimated $1.7M, off 38 percent, for a $65.4M sum. Warner Bros. looks to end with just under $70M. Step Up 2 the Streets, the latest teen dance drama to score with audiences, took in an estimated $1.5M, down 51 percent. With $55.4M taken in thus far, the Buena Vista release will reach close to $60M, putting it within striking distance of the $65.3M gross of 2006’s surprise smash Step Up.The top 10 films grossed an estimated $101.3M, which was up less than 1 percent from last year — when 300 remained at number one in its second weekend with $32.9M — and up 13 percent from 2006, when V for Vendetta debuted in the top spot with $25.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"golden, story, saw, history, Disney, to, star, Set","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Horton-Hears-Cash-Registers-Ring-at-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509149075465","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Treasure Threepeats; Juno Grows Bigger","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Treasure Threepeats; Juno Grows BiggerMeanwhile, P.T. Anderson continues to draw box office blood.by Gitesh Pandya | January 6, 2008 |  CommentsMoviegoers continued to rush to the multiplexes to catch up on holidayholdovers as the North American box office kicked off 2008 with robust ticketsales that were led by mostly the same movies from last week. Nicolas Cage‘sadventure sequel National Treasure: Book of Secrets remained at number one for thethird straight frame, indie darling Juno grew evenbigger jumping into third place, and Hollywood’s only new release One Missed Callsettled for a fifth place finish although its debut was stronger than expected.Uncovering an estimated $20.2M in its third expedition, the new National Treasure installment retained its box office crown dropping45% from last weekend. After only 17 days of release, the Disney blockbuster hasalready grossed a stunning $171M nearly matching the $173M that the first filmgrossed during its six-month run in theaters. Book of Secrets shouldsurpass that total on Monday or Tuesday and become Cage’s top-grossing filmever.The PG-rated adventure also raced past the studio’s own hit Wild Hogs to ranknumber 12 among all of 2007’s blockbuster hits. Secrets should crack thetop ten by next weekend joining a long list of other sequels which dominatedmoviegoing last year. At its current pace, the Cage smash should end up in theneighborhood of $220M domestically. Overseas, Book of Secrets brokethrough the $100M mark this weekend and stands at a global tally of $271.6M andcounting.There was a tight three-way race for the silver medal this weekend betweenthe last man on earth, a pregnant teen, and a trio of chipmunks. Studioestimates put them within $375,000 of each other and rankings could change onMonday once all of Sunday’s votes are counted.Narrowly taking second place with an estimated $16.4M wasWill Smith‘ssuperhit IAm Legend dropping 40%. With a towering $228.7M in 24 days, theaction hit has become the third biggest blockbuster in the A-list actor’s careertrailing his mid-90s alien smashes IndependenceDay ($306.2M) and Men in Black($250.1M). Legend now ranks as the sixth highest-grossing film of 2007and the second biggest non-sequel afterTransformers($319.1M). Overseas, the Warner Bros. actioner enjoyed big number one bows inAustralia, New Zealand, and Greece and boosted its cume to $170.2M putting theglobal tally at just under $400M. In North America, Legend seems oncourse to conclude with $260-270M.Fox Searchlight gave a major expansion to its runaway hit comedy Juno widening itfrom 1,019 to 1,925 locations and grossed an estimated $16.2M over the weekend.The per-theater average dipped by only 19% to a sturdy $8,429. Independent filmsthat expand this wide rarely retain such strong averages. Word of mouth has beenpropelling Juno on the charts and the PG-13 high school tale continues tofind new fans, especially with young women. The cume to date shot up to aremarkable $52M with sizable potential still ahead.Juno now looks set to reach a couple of major milestones at the boxoffice. It will easily surpass the $71.5M of Sideways to becomethe highest grossing film in company history for Searchlight. At its currentpace, the $2.5M-budgeted pregnancy pic will smash through the $100M mark andcould go much higher depending on added buzz the film may receive from GoldenGlobe wins and Oscar nominations. TheEllen Page hitmay even challenge Disney’sAmy Adams comedy Enchanted to become the top-grossing female-led film of the year.Right behind with an estimated $16M was Fox’s comedy sensation Alvinand the Chipmunks which dropped by 45% in its fourth frame. ThePG-rated family film has now collected a massive $176.7M and is less than a weekaway from surpassing the $183.1M of The Simpsons Movieto become the studio’s top-grossing film of 2007. It will also become one oflast year’s top ten overall blockbusters when it beats Homer and pals. Budgetedat under $70M, Alvin should zoom past the double century mark and finishwith $210-220M.The weekend’s only new release found itself with a solid fifth place debut. One Missed Call,a remake of a Japanese horror film, grossed an estimated $13.5M from 2,240theaters for a strong $6,038 average. The PG-13 film was expected to open withless than $10M. Warner Bros. marketed Call as a creepy thriller for teensand young adults and scored impressive results. Not facing any other new openersalso helped.&nbsp;Tom Hanksand JuliaRoberts found themselves in sixth place with the political dramedy Charlie Wilson’sWar which dropped only 32% to an estimated $8.2M. Universal’s $75MGolden Globe nominee has grossed $52.6M to date and should finish with $70-75M.Close behind with an estimated $8M was theHilary Swank–GerardButler romance P.S. I Love Youwhich enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten slipping only 14%. After aslow start, audiences are finding the Warner Bros. title which has taken in$39.4M thus far. A final tally of $60-65M seems likely.The kid adventure The WaterHorse followed with an estimated $6.3M, off only 31%, for a take of$30.9M. Look for roughly $50M by the end of its run.Johnny Depp‘sblood-soaked musical barber pic Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street fell 34% to anestimated $5.4M for a $38.5M cume.

Overseasprospects look brighter.Focus expanded its period romance Atonement andpopped into the top ten in the ten spot. TheKeiraKnightley–JamesMcAvoy drama widened from 310 to 583 locations and collected an estimated$5.1M. Its average of $8,789 was the best among all wide releases edging outJuno’s $8,429. Nominated for seven Golden Globes, more than any other film, Atonement has grossed $19.2M domestically plus $38.5M internationally. Nextweekend the love story bows in several major overseas markets such as France,Spain, Sweden, and Brazil.Two very different holiday season releases fell out of the top ten over theweekend. The R-rated sci-fi thriller Alien vs Predator: Requiemtumbled 58% to an estimated $4.3M in its second weekend pushing the 13-day totalto $36.8M. Look for a $45M final gross marking a sharp fall from the $80.3M that2004’s Alien vs. Predatorcollected.&nbsp;Disney’s fairy tale comedy Enchanteddropped 43% to an estimated $3.7M in its seventh outing boosting the robust sumto $119.7M. The PG-rated hit should be able to reach roughly $130M beforeclosing up shop.&nbsp;DenzelWashington‘s period drama The Great Debatersdeclined only 29% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $4.2M. With $22M in itsfirst 13 days, the MGM release looks to end up with a disappointing $35M overallwhich would be less than the opening weekend of Washington’s last filmAmerican Gangster.Posting sensational numbers in limited release once again was one of theyear’s most acclaimed films There Will BeBlood which grossed an estimated $1.3M from only 51 theaters for astellar $26,216 average.

Martin Lawrence’s new comedy Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins enjoyed a solidsecond place finish, but the standup concert film Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show bombed in its opening finishing well outside the top ten.Uncovering the most treasure, Fool’s Gold premiered in the top spot over theweekend with an estimated $22M from 3,125 theaters for a strong $7,043 average.The debut for the Warner Bros. release was a bit below the $23.8M opening thatthe two actors generated for their romantic comedy How To Lose A Guy in 10 Dayswhich launched five years ago this weekend. That figure would be roughly $27M attoday’s ticket prices.The $70M-budgeted Gold, which features the stars as an estranged couplereuniting to hunt for sunken treasure, was panned by critics and received someof the worst reviews of any film released in this new year. Andy Tennant (Hitch, Sweet Home Alabama) directed. In the half-decade since10 Days came out, Hudsonhas been absent from the box office throne while McConaughey headlined twonumber one openers – 2005’s adventure Sahara and 2006’s romantic comedy Failureto Launch.Debuting in second place with a nearly identical performance on a per-theaterbasis was the Martin Lawrence-led comedyWelcome Home Roscoe Jenkins with anestimated $17.1M from 2,386 locations for a solid $7,180 average. The Universalrelease played in 739 fewer theaters than Fool’s Gold and posted an average thatwas $137 higher. Directed by Malcolm D.

Cedric the Entertainer, James Earl Jones, Michael Clarke Duncan, Mike Epps, and Mo’Nique co-star.Produced for $35M, Roscoe Jenkins generated an opening similar to last month’sFirst Sunday which was another comedy led by an African American cast. That picwhich starred Ice Cube bowed to $17.7M from 2,213 theaters andis headed for a finish of just under $40M. According to Fox research, Roscoe‘saudience was 52% female and 52% over the age of 30.Despite its A grade from CinemaScore, Disney’s Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert plunged 66% in its second weekend to an estimated $10.5Mranking third for the frame. The G-rated concert film played in only 687theaters and still averaged a sizzling $15,295 per location and boosted itsten-day cume to a fantastic $53.4M. Hannah Montana was originally promoted as aone-week-only event and racked up record pre-sales over the past two months soit was expected to absorb most of the demand in the first seven days. The studioannounced last Sunday that it would extend the run. With a reported budget of$7M, the 3D tween sensation could climb to an astounding $70-75M. Most theatersare charging an extra-high $15 per ticket.Jessica Alba‘s horror pic The Eye held up reasonably well in its second weekendfalling 47% to an estimated $6.6M. The $22M Lionsgate title has grossed $21.5Min ten days and should see itself ending up in the neighborhood of $35M.More female starpower followed as a pair of funny ladies from Fox tied for fifthplace with an estimated $5.7M each. Oscar contender Junoslipped only 18% andboosted its cume to an amazing $117.6M. The wise-cracking pregnant teen is theeldest stateswoman in the top ten having just entered her tenth weekend. Eightof those frames were spent in the top ten. Katherine Heigl‘s 27 Dressesdroppedonly 33% and pushed its sum to $65.4M.Hot on the trail of those young ladies were a bunch of old geezers. 70-year-oldsuperstars Jack Nicholsonand Morgan Freemanwatched their hit film The Bucket Listcollect an estimated $5.3M, off just 21%, for a cume of $75.1M for WarnerBros. Not far behind was 61-year-old action starSylvester Stallone with Rambowhich fell 42% to an estimated $4.1M giving Lionsgate a tally of $36.5M.The bottom three positions in the top ten delivered a very close race as twoother films reported estimates of $4.1M also.

TheDanielDay-Lewis oilsaga There Will BeBlood expanded and saw its weekend milkshake dip by just 13%.Paramount Vantage has taken in $26.8M to date with much more expected in theweeks ahead as moviegoers catch up on high profile Academy Award contenders.Opening miserably outside of the top ten was the standup comedy doc Vince Vaughn’s Wild West Comedy Show which debuted to an estimated $507,000 from 962locations for an embarrassingly low $527 average. Scoring an opening weekendaverage of just three digits is never a good thing. The R-rated Picturehouserelease follows the comic actor and his group of standup comedians on their touracross several states.Grossing a similar amount of money from just a tiny fraction of the theaterswas the Colin Farrell hitman dramaIn Bruges which bowed in just 28 locations to anestimated $471,000 for a solid $16,829 average.

The horrorpicture One MissedCall will give fans of scary movies something new to nibble on. Awardscontenders will continue to expand including indie sensation Juno which will addhundreds of new theaters to its run. Overall, the healthy marketplace shouldpost a year-over-year gain versus 2007 to kick off the new year on the rightnote.Hoping to capture some of the success that The Ring enjoyed ahalf-decade ago, Warner Bros. unleashes the new supernatural thriller One Missed Call.The PG-13 film is a remake of a hit Japanese chiller about young adults whoreceive voicemail recordings of their own deaths shortly before they are killed.Fright films like these typically become winners through two important elements– a creepy plot and strong marketing. One Missed Call has both. Trailersand television spots have been very effective in communicating the storyline andthey’ve been edited well enough to give the target audience the chills.Marketplace conditions are also favorable since there are no other horrorfilms out there plus no competing new releases this weekend either. Teens andyoung adults are the main audience and they are done with the Fresh Prince’sturn as the last man on Earth and are ready to go see something new. And sincemost college students are still on winter break, look for a solid showing fromthat segment. Plus a trim running time of under 90 minutes will ensure plenty ofshowtimes.The first non-holiday weekend of January proved to be just the right time toopen two other recent horror hits. In 2006, the R-rated Hostel bowed to $19.6Mand a $8,909 average while a year earlier White Noise withits PG-13 classification bowed to $24.1M and a stellar $10,665 average. However,last January was a tough one for fright flicks as Primeval openedlater in the month to only $6M and a $2,475 average and The Hitcher debutedto just $7.8M and a $2,758 average. Opening in 2,240 theaters, One Missed Callcould open to about $9M.Fox Searchlight will give another major expansion to its hot indie smash Juno which willtry to climb one more chart position this weekend. The PG-13 film has been on atear since going nationwide on Christmas Day becoming a feel-good hit for thearthouse crowd and beyond. On Friday, Juno widens from 1,019 to 1,880locations. Look for its average of $10,436 to simmer down to about $7,000 inthis frame resulting in a solid $13M weekend gross which again would be thebiggest of its run so far. The total would rise to $49M with the road aheadleading past the $100M mark.With only one new film going into release,Nicolas Cagehopes to make it three straight weekends atop the box office charts with National Treasure: Book of Secrets. The Disney smash could drop by40% to about $22M lifting the cume to an amazing $171M which would be withinstriking distance of the $173M of its 2004 predecessor.Like Treasure, Alvinand the Chipmunks also faces virtually no competition from OneMissed Call. The Fox comedy might fall by 35% to roughly $19M which wouldpush the total to $176M.Sci-fi megahit IAm Legend has become the third biggest grosser ofWill Smith‘scareer and its cume is still climbing higher. Warner Bros. could see a 40% dropto around $16M for a gross to date of $227M. The quarter-billion markdomestically is still within its reach. Overseas, Legend has vaulted to $126Malready so the $400M worldwide barrier could crumble this weekend.Tom Hanksand JuliaRoberts enjoyed a healthy post-Christmas bump for Charlie Wilson’sWar which mature audiences are now finding.

Opening in semi-national release, the period romance The Other Boleyn Girlperformed well but the comedy Penelopestumbled and barely made the top ten.Ferrell’s latest attempt to mine laughs out of sports came in the form of Semi-Prowhich opened atop the charts this weekend to an estimated $15.3M. The New Linerelease averaged a decent $4,906 from 3,121 sites but did not match the numbersof the funnyman’s other recent hits like Blades of Glory($33M), Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby($47M), and Anchorman($28.4M). Those were all rated PG-13 allowing the comedian’s teen fans to buytickets while Semi-Pro carried the more restrictive R which most likely affectedticket sales. It was the lowest gross for a number one film sinceJodie Foster‘sThe Brave Onewhich debuted to $13.5M last September.Sony’s hit assassination thriller Vantage Pointfell to second place but enjoyed a good hold dropping 43% to an estimated $13M.The ensemble actioner has banked a terrific $41M in ten days and has benefitedfrom a highly effective marketing push by the studio. Look for a domestic finalof $70-75M.Holding up even better was the fantasy adventure The Spiderwick Chronicleswith an estimated $8.8M. The Paramount pic slipped only 33% and is takingadvantage of a marketplace lacking other options for families.Sony scored a solid debut for its period drama The Other Boleyn Girlwhich bowed to an estimated $8.3M from only 1,166 locations for an impressive$7,118 average. It was the best per-theater performance of any film in the Top20. Starring Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson,the PG-13 film played overwhelmingly to young women. Studio research indicatedthat the audience was 72% female and 66% under 35. Reviews were not verypositive.Jumperjumped down to fifth dropping 40% to an estimated $7.6M giving Fox $66.8M todate. Buena Vista’s urban dance pic Step Up 2 The Streetsfollowed with an estimated $5.7M, off 41%, for a $48.6M cume. The Matthew McConaughey–Kate Hudsonreunion pic Fool’s Gold&nbsp;grossed an estimated $4.7M, down only 28%, and raised its sum to $59.1Mfor Warner Bros.Two films tied for eighth place with an estimated $4M each. Summit debutedits Christina Riccipic Penelopein 1,196 locations and averaged a mild $3,349. The PG-rated film appealed to amore female audience and saw direct competition from the solid launch of Boleyn. Reviews were mixed. Oscar king No Country ForOld Men expanded from 1,101 to 2,037 sites to capitalize on itsAcademy Award attention and climbed back into the top ten. Miramax has grossed$69.6M to date and should be headed past the $80M mark domestically.Another Oscar winner Junoplaced tenth with an estimated $3.4M, down just 19%, and upped its total to$135.1M.

The science fiction thriller I Am Legend leads the way but will be joined by the family comedy Alvin and the Chipmunks and the romantic comedy The Perfect Holiday. For only the second time all year, just two films managed grosses of more than $5M last weekend. Hollywood critically needs this weekend to turn things around if it wants to end the year on a happy note.Gunning for his seventh consecutive number one opening, Will Smith headlines the sci-fi thriller I Am Legend, the latest Hollywood film based on the classic 1954 novel of the same name. The PG-13 entry finds the superstar playing the last man alive on Earth after a virus wipes out the entire human population in the not-so-distant future. Legend could prove to be Smith’s greatest box office challenge to date since there are no famous co-stars, no big director, and the novel it is based on is not exactly a hot item in today’s era. This film is Will’s to make or break.But for millions of movie fans, the former Fresh Prince plus action equals a definite trip to the local multiplex. The actor is right at the top of the current A list and is arguably the most bankable star alive consistently drawing in audiences that cut across all race, gender, and age barriers. Will Smith can bring out paying audiences for sci-fi (I, Robot), comedy (Hitch), drama (The Pursuit of Happyness), action (Bad Boys II), and animation (Shark Tale). With Legend he now flirts with the boundaries of horror as battling killer zombies that attack at night is a far cry from being a date doctor.Warner Bros. has good timing for I Am Legend. The marketplace has been about as dead as the world depicted in the film and audiences are hungry for an event film to get them back into the habit of moviegoing. Competition will not be much of a factor and business will be coming in from many directions with teens and young adults leading the way and fans of sci-fi and action delivering a big bang too. The studio’s massive marketing push will do the trick and adding more bite will be the simultaneous Imax release where higher ticket prices ($16 in New York City) will give the grosses a boost. Plus the strategic move of playing the new prologue for next summer’s much-anticipated Batman flick The Dark Knight with the Imax release of I Am Legend just fuels more excitement and guarantees more asses in the seats.Will Smith is looking to score one of the biggest December openings ever for a non-Peter Jackson flick. A big drop next weekend is likely, but for now consumers are keeping all eyes on I Am Legend which attacks 3,606 theaters on Friday. An opening weekend gross of about $50M could result.Will Smith and friend in I Am LegendSome younger moviegoers may not be in the mood for flesh-eating mutants. Luckily, Fox had the bright idea of getting jiggy with its new kidpic Alvin and the Chipmunks which will give parents and smaller children some harmless fun for the holidays. The PG-rated film is the latest big-screen treatment of a popular kids property from yesterday that gets a makeover for today’s sensibilities. When done right, ticket sales pour in from multiple generations. But when done wrong, you get disasters like The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.Competition should not be too bad since Enchanted which is going into its fourth session is the only family film generating any decent dough right now. Instead, holiday shopping may be the real threat as many parents will wait until a little later before heading to the cinemas for this one. The property is not popular enough to create any true sense of urgency. But this is common in mid December. Last year, Charlotte’s Web got off to a slow start with a $11.5M bow but went on to make seven times that amount with a final tally of $82.6M. Fox’s marketing push has been aggressively targeting young kids and the studio knows that little success lies with teens and young adults. Going very wide with 3,476 playdates on Friday, Alvin and the Chipmunks could gross about $15M this weekend but hold on well over the holidays.Alvin, Simon and TheodoreChristmas fun hits the multiplexes in another package with The Perfect Holiday from Yari Film Group. Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union star as single folks whose love lives cross while Queen Latifah and Terrence Howard play naughty and nice spirits along for the ride. The PG-rated film will play primarily to an African American audience which will make it a tricky sell at this moment in time. Though a very different film, Legend will steal away many in the target demographic and others who just saw This Christmas may not be looking for another story from the same category so soon. Poor reviews will also cause some box office headaches. Opening Wednesday in 1,306 locations, The Perfect Holiday could bow to about $7M over three days and $9M over five days.The Perfect HolidayAdding to the end-of-year frenzy that arthouse films find themselves in during awards season, Paramount Vantage’s The Kite Runner opens in 35 theaters in selected cities on Friday hoping to appeal to fans of the best-selling novel. The R-rated film in English and Dari tells of two young boys in Afghanistan whose lives take two very different paths after a violent incident right before the Soviet invasion of the country. Kite Runner has been included on some recent ten-best lists and scored two Golden Globe nominations. Reviews have been generally positive.The Kite RunnerFollowing its not-so-explosive debut, The Golden Compass will have tough work cut out for it during the sophomore frame. The New Line adventure will see the sci-fi audience abandon ship and line up for Will Smith while parents looking for some fun for their kids will have some talking chipmunks to consider. A 50% drop could be in order for Compass which would give it about $13M for the weekend and a ten-day tally of $45M.Disney’s Enchanted, which earned a pair of Golden Globe nominations, is slowly but surely making its way towards the $100M mark. Another moderate 35% decline would give the fairy tale pic around $7M which would push the sum up to $93M. Sony’s This Christmas will face direct competition from The Perfect Holiday so a 40% dip may result giving the pic $3M and $47M to date.LAST YEAR: The man in black beat out some tough competition to conquer the box office. Will Smith’s The Pursuit of Happyness led a wave of new releases with its top spot debut grossing $26.5M for Sony. The feel-good smash played well over the holiday season surging to $162.6M domestically and $294M worldwide – an impressive sum for a Smith vehicle not driven by guns or special effects. Fox’s fantasy actioner Eragon bowed close behind in second with $23.2M on its way to $75M from North America representing only 30% of the global take. Overseas the numbers were much stronger with $175M in ticket sales for a powerful $250M tally worldwide. Third place also featured a new release. Paramount’s family film Charlotte’s Web debuted to the tune of $11.5M but reached a solid $82.6M by the end of the run. Rounding out the top five were the penguin toon Happy Feet with $8.4M and the romantic comedy The Holiday with $8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"kong, Box, Searchlight, Month, 2017, canceled, Turner, Awards, park","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-I-Am-Legend-Set-For-Explosive-Opening"},{"id":"47509149095957","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Gangster Crushes Competition at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: American Gangster Crushes Competition at #1Denzel, Crowe, and Scott take over the multiplexes.by Gitesh Pandya | November 4, 2007 |  CommentsThe North American box office exploded thanks to the scorching debuts of theDenzelWashington–RussellCrowe crime drama American Gangsterand JerrySeinfeld‘s animated comedy Bee Movie whichcombined for over $85M in ticket sales. Following weeks of sluggish businesswhere the marketplace failed to match 2006 levels, this weekend’s box officeenjoyed a healthy bounce over last year and kicked off the holiday movie seasonwith a bang.Washington and Crowe both scored new career highs with the estimated $46.3Mopening weekend for the crime saga American Gangsterwhich dominated the multiplexes. Universal opened the R-rated tale in 3,054theaters and generated a scorching $15,175 average per location. Directed byRidley Scott,Gangster tells the true story of a drug kingpin who built up a heroin empire inHarlem in the early 1970s. The opening easily beat out the former all-timebiggest debuts for the Oscar-winning actors: Washington’s Inside Man with$29M and Crowe’s Gladiator with $34.8M.American Gangster enjoyed the second highest launch of the year for anR-rated film trailing only 300‘s$70.9M. Much of the success came from strong sales from young males and theurban audience which saw it as a Scarface fortoday’s generation. The same audience also helped to powerEminem‘s R-ratedhip hop drama 8 Mileto a surprising number one opening of $51.2M in November of 2002. Brian Grazerproduced both Mile and Gangster. Reviews were mostly favorable andearly Academy Award buzz could help the film in the weeks ahead. Despite thelong running time of nearly two hours and forty minutes, moviegoers lined up andfound their showtimes.Paramount and DreamWorks settled for a second place debut for their latestanimated film BeeMovie which grossed an estimated $39.1M in its opening weekend. ThePG-rated toon averaged a sturdy $9,954 from 3,928 locations and performed just abit below the levels of recent November animated titles. Last year, the penguinpic Happy Feetbowed to $41.5M while the previous year’s Chicken Littlelaunched with $40M. The two went on to gross $198M and $135.4M, respectively,from the North American market. Co-written by and starring Jerry Seinfeld, BeeMovie enjoyed virtually no competition in the current marketplace for familyaudiences. Critics were not too kind, but ticket buyers showed interest on theopening weekend. For 2007, the toon posted the fourth biggest debut for ananimated film after Shrek the Third($121.6M), TheSimpsons Movie ($74M) and Ratatouille($47M).Suffering the largest sophomore drop in franchise history, Saw IV tumbled 65%from its top spot bow and grossed an estimated $11M. The Lionsgate title hasstill banked an impressive $51.1M in ten days and should finish with nearly$70M.Buena Vista’s Dan in Real Lifefared much better in its second weekend dropping a slim 31% to an estimated$8.1M. With $23M in ten days, the romantic comedy might find its way to around$50M despite playing in less than 2,000 theaters.Sony’s vampire thriller 30 Days of Nightdeclined by 42% and took in an estimated $4M lifting the total to $34.2M. BuenaVista’s The Game Planfollowed in sixth with an estimated $3.9M, off only 37%, for a cume to date of$82M.Neglected and landing in seventh place was the newJohn Cusackdrama MartianChild which opened with an estimated $3.7M. Playing in 2,020locations, the PG-rated story of a man that adopts a boy who says he’s from Marsaveraged a pitiful $1,807 for New Line. Child was the seventh wide release inthe past six weeks to debut with an average of less than $2,000.Three adult-skewing fall pics followed.George Clooney‘slegal thriller Michael Clayton collected an estimated $2.9M, down 41%, for a sum of$33.2M for Warner Bros.

Leading the way is the horror film 30 Days of Night followed by the sports comedy The Comebacks which both will be targeting the teens and young adults that Hollywood has been ignoring in recent weeks. Mature adults who already have a wide selection of serious dramas to choose from will be served up three more – Reese Witherspoon‘s Rendition, Ben Affleck‘s Gone Baby Gone, and Halle Berry‘s Things We Lost in the Fire. With far too many films aiming for the same finite audience segment, some are sure to eat into the potential of others.Sony will monopolize the horror crowd looking for a scare before Halloween with its gorefest 30 Days of Night which tells of vampires that attack a small town in northern Alaska during its annual sunless period. The R-rated film prominently informs moviegoers in its marketing that it is based on a graphic novel hoping to tap into a little bit of the excitement generated by 300 last spring. The first eight months of this year were brutal to R-rated horror films with none reaching number one and high-profile franchise flicks like Hostel II, 28 Weeks Later, and The Hills Have Eyes 2 all failing to reach $10M on opening weekend. But the Halloween remake over Labor Day weekend changed all that and was followed three weeks later by another top spot debut from horror-action hybrid Resident Evil: Extinction. But those have died out so 30 Days stands as the only creepfest at a time when scary movies are in demand. Attacking 2,700 theaters, 30 Days of Night should easily top the charts and could bite into around $19M over the weekend.30 Days of NightFox spoofs the world of sports films with its new comedy The Comebacks which will target adolescents either too young for 30 Days or uninterested in scary movies. With so many mature stories hogging up screens, the market can certainly use a dose of immature humor right about now. The Comebacks is the first viable PG-13 comedy aimed at teens since fellow sports comedy Balls of Fury launched at the end of August. After a mid-week debut, that pic bowed to $11.4M over three days and Comebacks will play to many of the same folks. And with seventeen R-rated films opening wide over the last eight weeks, there has been little to celebrate for the under-17 crowd. Sure The Comebacks looks dumb, but dumb can sell. Add in a trim running time of under 90 minutes and commercial prospects are not bad. This is disposable entertainment for 14-year-olds. It will draw attention upfront, and be forgotten two weeks from now. Thanks to a lack of direct competition, The Comebacks could debut with about $11M from 2,800 sites.The ComebacksLeading the charge for the 30-plus crowd this weekend is Reese Witherspoon who headlines the political thriller Rendition from New Line. The R-rated drama finds the Oscar winner playing a woman whose Egyptian-born husband is captured by the CIA after being suspected of being a terrorist. Jake Gyllenhaal and Meryl Streep add to the cast. Rendition follows The Kingdom and In the Valley of Elah as military-themed films this fall with connections to the Middle East. Audiences will want only so much of this content. Witherspoon will have her starpower put to the test since she is the only major commercial star here and she is outside of her safety zone of romantic comedies. The film will play to mature adults and will have to compete not only with this weekend’s other new dramas, but also with an assortment of holdovers already playing to the same audience. Reviews have been mixed which will also make things difficult. Debuting in roughly 2,200 locations, Rendition may capture about $9M over the Friday-to-Sunday period.Reese Witherspoon and Peter Sarsgaard in RenditionBen Affleck makes his directorial debut with the crime thriller Gone Baby Gone which stars his brother Casey in the lead role. The Miramax release also stars Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, and Michelle Monaghan and carries a R rating. Reviews have been good which will come as a shocker to those that look at this movie as nothing more than Daredevil getting to hop into the director’s chair. Reese, Joaquin, George, Cate, and Halle will all be cutting into the adult pie which can only expand by a certain amount. The marketing push has been highlighting the film as being from the author of Mystic River in hopes of finding those who loved that other Boston-set fall crime drama. An invite to the top five may not arrive for Ben. Opening in approximately 1,500 theaters, Gone Baby Gone could collect about $6M this weekend.Freeman, Affleck and Monaghan in Gone Baby GoneYet another new option for adults looking for serious fare is the Halle Berry–Benicio Del Toro starrer Things We Lost in the Fire. The Paramount release about a widow who seeks comfort from her dead husband’s drug-addicted friend will play to a mature audience and skew more female. The R-rated film has generated some good early reviews and both leads have Oscars on their shelves, but it will not be enough to compete with the other films targeting the same crowd. Berry showed in April that she can only open a picture so much when her thriller Perfect Stranger bowed to a $4,211 average even though A-lister Bruce Willis co-starred. With a not-so-wide release in about 1,000 theaters this weekend, Things We Lost in the Fire might debut with around $3M.Halle Berry and Benicio Del Toro in Things We Lost in the FireFreestyle Releasing has booked the few remaining empty screens out there for its teen thriller Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour. As one of the only PG-rated suspense pics ever made, the film will try to attract younger teenagers not interested in sports-themed comedies. With only 1,100 theaters, a quiet marketing campaign, no stars, and zero buzz, a weak debut of about $1M could result.Sarah Landon and the Paranormal HourAfter a potent number one debut, Tyler Perry‘s hit comedy Why Did I Get Married? should suffer a big fall in its second weekend if history is any indicator. Sophomore drops for the filmmaker’s previous offerings include 50% for Diary of a Mad Black Woman, 58% for Madea’s Family Reunion, and 57% for Daddy’s Little Girls. Lionsgate should see a 50% fall to about $10M this weekend giving the ensemble relationship tale $37M in ten days.Disney’s The Game Plan once again has no new competition for the kiddie audience. Why studios have programmed so many serious adult dramas into this month and no other good family films is anyone’s guess. A 35% dip would leave The Rock with $7M and an impressive cume of $68M after 24 days.Both Sony’s We Own the Night and the Warner Bros. thriller Michael Clayton will have to fight extra hard in order to compete with the new releases gunning for their customers. Night looks to slide more and fall by 45% while the strongly reviewed Clayton could ease by 40% with both films grossing roughly $6M over the weekend. That would lead to ten-day totals of $20M and $21M, respectively.LAST YEAR: Just two months after the release of the similarly-themed magician pic The Illusionist, Buena Vista still managed to score a number one bow for The Prestige which opened with $14.8M on its way to $53.1M. Martin Scorsese‘s The Departed enjoyed a strong hold and ranked second with $13.5M in its third frame. Debuting in third was Clint Eastwood‘s war saga Flags of Our Fathers with $10.2M leading to a disappointing $33.6M final for Paramount. Sony’s animated hit Open Season ranked fourth with $8.2M. Rounding out the top five was rival family film Flicka with $7.7M for Fox on its way to only $21M. Also premiering in the top ten was Sony’s Marie Antoinette with $5.4M which led to a final tally of just $16M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Carpet, Awards, ABC, Movies, Academy, rotten, Poppins, YouTube, MSNBC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-30-Days-of-Night-Gets-Halloween-Started-Early"},{"id":"47509150778393","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Vampire Flick Scares Up #1 Debut","content":"\n\n                                            Weekend Box Office\n                                        \n                        \n                        \n                            var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];\n                            mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {\n                                mps.rt.insertlogo('#article_sponsorship_ad', 'ploc=articlesponsorship');\n                            });\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        Box Office Guru Wrapup: Vampire Flick Scares Up #1 Debut\n                        30 Days of Night drains the competition.\n                        by Gitesh Pandya | October 21, 2007                          | \n                          \n                              Comments\n                          \n                     \n\n                     \n\n                     \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                           \n                       \n                     \n\n                    \n                                                Bloodthirty vampires flew high, depressing dramas sank, and many holdovers\nheld up well at the North American box office. The new horror flick \n30 Days of Night\neasily ruled the charts while a handful of adult dramas were met with opening\nweekend sales that ranged from mild to embarrassing. Oscar-winning actresses\nReese\nWitherspoon and\nHalle Berry\nboth failed miserably with their new serious stories which were both shunned by\nticket buyers. With so many fall offerings eating into each others’ business,\nthe overall marketplace remained sluggish as for the fifth consecutive weekend\nthe top ten slumped below year-ago levels.\nSony commanded the top spot with its R-rated gorefest \n30 Days of Night\nwhich opened with an estimated $16M over the Friday-to-Sunday period. Attacking\n2,855 theaters, the vampires-in-Alaska pic averaged a solid $5,604 and tapped\ninto a pre-Halloween box office that offered no major scary movies. The lack of\ncompetition helped the $30M\nJosh Hartnett\nstarrer which brought out older teens, young adults, and genre fans. Days\nwas based on a popular graphic novel and earned mixed reviews which is above\naverage by horror picture standards.\n\n\n\nTyler Perry\nfollowed up his muscular top spot debut for his latest comedy \nWhy\nDid I Get Married? with a strong second weekend hold dropping only\n43% to an estimated $12.1M. After just ten days in theaters, the Lionsgate\nrelease has already collected a sturdy $38.9M which is just ahead of the $38.1M\nthat Perry’s first film \nDiary of a\nMad Black Woman took in during its first ten days in 2005. Married\nsuffered a smaller drop than his other films witnessed indicating that the\nfilmmaker’s latest entry could be reaching beyond its core African American\naudience. Diary fell 50% in its sophomore session while \n\nMadea’s Family Reunion and \nDaddy’s Little\nGirls tumbled by about 57% each. Married looks on course to reach\na remarkable $65-70M which would be a new career high for Perry\n\n\n\nPosting the smallest decline in the top ten once again was\nThe Rock‘s hit family\ncomedy The Game\nPlan which ranked third in its fourth weekend with an estimated\n$8.1M. That represented a slim drop of only 26% and boosted Disney’s cume to\n$69.2M. The durable sensation ranks as the actor’s second biggest hit in a lead\nrole after The Scorpion King which took in $90.5M in 2002.\nGame Plan should\neasily surpass that mark and has not yet seen a drop of more than 35%.\n\n\nAlso holding up very well was\nGeorge Clooney‘s legal thriller\nMichael Clayton\nwhich remained in fourth place with an estimated $7.1M. The Warner Bros. title\ndropped by only 32% and boosted its total gross to $22M matching its production\nbudget. The marketplace was crowded with adult dramas targeting Clayton‘s\naudience so the strong hold was an impressive performance. Powerful reviews and\ngood word-of-mouth contributed to the success. A final tally of $40-50M may\nresult.\n\n\n\nTwo new films fought fiercely over the number five spot. Miramax estimated that\nits kidnapping thriller \nGone Baby Gone would collect $6M over the weekend from\n1,713 theaters for a mild $3,503 average. The directorial debut of\nBen Affleck\nstars his brother\n\nCasey Affleck along with\nMorgan Freeman and\nEd Harris and was\ngreeted with stellar reviews from film critics. Produced for $19M, Gone faced\ntough competition from other adult dramas but could have legs in the weeks\nahead.\n\n\n\nAiming for teens and young adults with a dose of immature spoof comedy was \nThe\nComebacks which grossed an estimated $5.9M for Fox. The PG-13 sports film\nenjoyed a much wider release in 2,812 venues and generated a dull $2,080\naverage. The debut was nowhere near the numbers that the studio has seen in the\nrecent past with its other spoof comedies. Both \nEpic Movie from earlier this\nyear and Date Movie from 2006 debuted to about $19M. Comebacks will be lucky to\nreach that amount overall.\n\n\n\nDespite the weekend estimates reported by Miramax and Fox, three studios\nestimated that Comebacks edged out Gone Baby Gone by a slim margin over the\nweekend. Miramax’s estimate factored in a 26% Saturday-to-Sunday decline while\nFox’s figure includes a more reasonable 38% drop. All other films in the top ten\nprojected Sunday declines of 34% to 51%. Final box office grosses to be reported\non Monday will tell which film truly earns the fifth-place spot. The position is\nvaluable to studios for the publicity since many news outlets only report on the\ntop five films each weekend and ignore anything below them.\n\n\n\nFalling hardest among holdover titles was the\nJoaquin\nPhoenix/Mark\nWahlberg\ncrime thriller \nWe Own the Night\nwhich dropped by 49% to an estimated $5.5M in its second weekend. The Sony\nrelease has banked $19.8M in ten days and looks headed for a mediocre finish of\n$30-33M.\n\n\n\nGenerating the hottest average in the top ten was the latest re-release of Tim\nBurton’s creepy animated hit \nThe Nightmare Before Christmas which debuted to an\nestimated $5.1M from only 564 theaters for a potent $9,122 average. The special\n3D version was given a wider launch by Disney compared to this weekend a year\nago when it opened in 168 theaters for a $3.3M weekend and sizzling $19,506\naverage. That re-release bagged $8.7M while its original 1993 run brought in\n$50M. With no other good options for parents other than the studio’s own The\nGame Plan, Nightmare proved to be an exciting pre-Halloween option for families.\nThe PG-rated film will only play for a limited three-week engagement and goes\nback into the Mouse House’s vault soon after the pumpkin holiday.\n\n\n\nMoviegoers ignored the terrorism drama \nRendition despite its acclaimed cast\nallowing it to barely debut in the top ten. The New Line release opened to an\nestimated $4.2M from 2,250 locations for a horrible $1,856 average. It was Reese\nWitherspoon’s first film since winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for\n2005’s Walk the Line, but fans were not biting. Jake Gyllenhaal,\nMeryl Streep,\nand Alan Arkin also starred in the R-rated story of a woman in search of her\nEgyptian-born husband who is captured by the CIA after being suspected of being\na terrorist. Rendition was the third film in recent weeks dealing with Middle\nEast issues and entered a marketplace flooded with serious adult dramas. Plus\nlukewarm reviews helped to make this a non-priority among ticket buyers this\nweekend.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top ten was the\nBen Stiller comedy\nThe\nHeartbreak Kid with an\nestimated $3.9M, off 46%, for a $32.1M cume for Paramount.\n\n\n\nHalle Berry joined fellow Oscar-winning actress Reese in striking out with\naudiences with her new adult drama. The former Storm headlined the Paramount\nrelease \nThings We Lost in the Fire with\nBenicio Del Toro and attracted a measly\n$1.6M in business on opening weekend, according to estimates. Debuting in 1,142\nlocations, the R-rated film about a woman who befriends her dead husband’s\nheroin-addicted pal averaged a pathetic $1,405. Reviews were generally favorable\nand studio research indicated that two-thirds of the audience consisted of women\nover 30. Fire cost a relatively low $16M to produce, but has a long road ahead\nof it in order to reach profitability.\n\n\n\nTwo additional films risked going nationwide and met with embarrassing results.\nThe teen thriller \nSarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour bowed to an estimated\n$560,000 from 1,115 theaters for a disastrous $502 average for Freestyle\nReleasing. Meanwhile, Rocky Mountain Pictures unleashed its animated pic \nThe Ten\nCommandments in 830 sites and was met with only $480,000, according to\nestimates, for a horrible $578 average. Both films should find their primary\naudiences on DVD.\nFocus saw a soft bow for its downbeat drama \nReservation Road which debuted in\njust fourteen theaters for a weak estimate of $36,821 for a poor average of\n$2,630. The arthouse crowd was just not in the mood for this depressing drama\nabout the death of a young boy which starred Joaquin Phoenix,\nMark Ruffalo,\nJennifer Connelly, and\nMira Sorvino. Also hurting\nRoad‘s performance were\nreviews that were far from glowing.\n\n\n\nWith all the new content in the multiplexes, five films were tossed out of the\ntop ten over the weekend. The costume drama sequel \nElizabeth: The Golden Age\ndropped 49% in its sophomore session to an estimated $3.1M giving Universal a\nweak $11.2M in ten days. Look for the\nCate Blanchett pic to end its domestic run\nwith a dismal $16-18M. Overseas prospects do look brighter though.\n\n\n\nSony’s durable musical extravaganza  \nAcross the\nUniverse dipped by 29% to an\nestimated $2.7M for a solid $16.8M total from less than 1,000 theaters. A\n$25-30M final could result. The Saudi Arabia-set political thriller \nThe Kingdom fell by 48% in its fourth outing to an estimated $2.4M. Universal has taken in\n$44M thus far and should end up with just under $50M which means that the $70M\nproduction will need to still work hard overseas and on video in order to break\neven.\n\n\n\nThe Milla Jovovich threequel\n\nResident Evil: Extinction tumbled 60% to an\nestimated $1.1M and raised its sum to a cool $50M. Fox’s fantasy adventure \nThe\nSeeker: The Dark is Rising saw its weekend gross nosedive by an alarming 81% to\nan estimated $425,000 lifting the dull total to $8.2M with little left to go.\n\n\n\nThe top ten films grossed an estimated $73.9M which was down 10% from last year\nwhen The Prestige debuted in first place with $14.8M; but up 13% from 2005 when\nDoom opened in the top spot with $15.5M.\n","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"psychological, king, TV, Pacific","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Vampire-Flick-Scares-Up-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509149083662","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Golden Compass Sets Course For #1 Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Golden Compass Sets Course For #1 DebutAtonement, Juno open in limited release.by Gitesh Pandya | December 6, 2007 |  CommentsNew Line hopes to breathe some life into the North American box office with the launch of its pricey adventure film The Golden Compass which stands as the frame’s only new wide release. Directed by Chris Weitz (About a Boy), the PG-13 film aims to capture a large crowd including the family audience and fans of sci-fi and fantasy. Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, who proved in the summer flop The Invasion that their names only carry so much commercial weight, reunite to star in the effects-heavy film.Working in its favor is the fact that all other studios have avoided programming their major offerings onto this weekend’s schedule. In fact it is quite rare to see two consecutive frames with only one national opener each. Media attention is concentrated on it this week and with multiplexes dumping their aging November flops, Compass will secure extra screens. The studio’s marketing push has been powerful and awareness is high which makes sense as New Line is hoping for a new fantasy franchise that can keep the cash rolling in for years to come. Teens and young adults who frequent the multiplexes the most should come out in solid numbers since they’ve seen every other worthy film already. Older adults will be a little harder to reach since holiday shopping is a major distraction on weekends right now plus reviews for Compass have not exactly been stellar.Although the property will target many of the same folks who have dropped billions on fantasy smashes like The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia, the source material is not as popular plus there is already backlash from some in the religious community for the anti-Christian material in the Philip Pullman books. Reaching the $65.6M opening of Narnia from this very weekend two years ago will be impossible. Instead, a debut closer to the $27.5M of Beowulf last month could be in order since there may be much overlap. Compass has more appeal for younger kids and females so a bigger bow should result. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, The Golden Compass might premiere to the tune of $33M this weekend.Nicole Kidman in The Golden CompassWith most of the big boys taking the weekend off from releasing films wide, indie distribs will once again seize the opportunity to platform their end-of-year pics and begin limited runs for possible kudos contenders. By law, you can’t have an awards season without at least one costume drama so Focus Features joins forces with Keira Knightley with Atonement which bows on Friday in 26 sites. The R-rated period piece also stars James McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave and has already grossed $31M overseas with over two-thirds of that total coming from the U.K. since its launch there in early September.James McAvoy and Keira Knightley in AtonementFox Searchlight counters in seven theaters with its teen pregnancy comedy Juno starring Michael Cera, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, and Ellen Page in the title role. The PG-13 coming-of-age pic opened on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and is director Jason Reitman‘s follow-up to Thank You For Smoking which grossed $24.8M for Fox Searchlight in the spring of 2006. Reviews have been strong across the board for both Juno and Atonement.Ellen Page and Olivia Thirlby in JunoAfter back to back stints of wearing the box office crown, the princess comedy Enchanted is now preparing to take a step back this weekend thanks to the arrival of Queen Kidman. The Disney hit will see some formidable competition for kids, but the overall drop should not be too large. A 35% slide to around $10.5M could result. That would give Enchanted a charming $83M after 19 days of play.With girls lining up for Giselle and company, their brothers have been taking a historical adventure with the computer-animated action pic Beowulf which has been holding its own since its debut. Golden Compass will also be a threat since there is much audience overlap. But Beowulf‘s good legs suggest that a drop of 35% could be in order here as well. That would leave the Paramount project with about $5M pushing the cume up to $76M.Sony’s holiday reunion film This Christmas and Fox’s assassin thriller Hitman both witnessed larger sophomore declines so a fall of 40% each should occur this weekend. Christmas would take in just under $5M for a $42M total while Hitman should bank $3.5M for a $36M sum.LAST YEAR: Mel Gibson scored his second straight number one opening for a historical foreign language film he directed with Apocalypto which debuted on top with $15M. The Buena Vista release went on to capture a solid $50.9M. Three-time champ Happy Feet was bumped down to second with $12.9M in its fourth frame. Sony’s romantic comedy The Holiday bowed in third with $12.8M for Sony. The Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet pic went on to gross $63.2M domestically and a stunning $200M worldwide. Studio stablemate Casino Royale slipped to fourth with $8.9M. Warner Bros. launched its action thriller Blood Diamond in fifth with a mediocre $8.6M on its way to $57.4M from North America and $171M globally. Opening in seventh was the studio’s other new wide release of the frame, the family comedy Unaccompanied Minors, with only $5.8M leading to a weak $16.6M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Universe, 71st, dramedy, Annual","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Golden-Compass-Sets-Course-For-1-Debut"},{"id":"47509149090834","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Beowulf Set To Conquer Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Beowulf Set To Conquer MultiplexesMr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium, Love in the Time of Cholera also opening.by Gitesh Pandya | November 15, 2007 |  CommentsOne animated film will bump another from the number one spot at the North American box office. But the new warrior Beowulf is no B movie but an A-list production from an Oscar-winning director offering action audiences something new. Also opening this weekend but likely to see more modest grosses are the family pic Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium and the romantic drama Love in the Time of Cholera. Without a compelling selection of great films, the marketplace should once again fall well below year-ago levels.Paramount looks to capture the box office crown without the help of DreamWorks this time with Beowulf, a computer-animated action adventure based on the ancient epic poem. The PG-13 film comes from Robert Zemeckis who expands upon the motion capture technology he used in 2004’s The Polar Express. This time around his film is aimed at somewhat older moviegoers as young children will be too frightened by the violence, gore, and yes, nudity. Beowulf aims to pry 14-year-old boys away from their videogame systems and into the multiplexes with a new type of action film that is presented in 3D in selected theaters. Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, and Angelina Jolie lend their voices and digital likenesses.The marketing has been terrific on the part of the studio. The core audience of young males is excited and ready to buy tickets and the film might even pull in part of the literary crowd curious to see how this classic tale is adapted to the big screen. The marketplace needs something like this now with hits like American Gangster skewing more adult and kidpics like Bee Movie not offering enough violence. If last December’s Eragon could open to $23.2M, then surely Beowulf can target the same crowd and go higher. Launching in over 2,800 theaters, Beowulf could conquer the box office this weekend with about $32M.The digitally-altered likeness of Ray Winstone in BeowulfDustin Hoffman stars as the eccentric owner of a magical toy store in Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium, a new entry for family audiences from Fox. The G-rated film co-stars Natalie Portman and Jason Bateman. With Bee Movie and Fred Claus already out there doing solid business, and likely to collect a combined $30M this weekend, competition for Emporium will be intense. Bad reviews will make parents hesitate, but if kids respond to the TV commercials, then they will find a way to force their parents to take them. Opening wide in around 3,200 locations, Mr. Magorium could bow to about $11M this weekend and try to remain a relevant choice over the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday session.Dustin Hoffman and Natalie Portman in Mr. Magorium’s Wonder EmporiumTo counter his current role as a brutal killer in No Country for Old Men, Javier Bardem stars in the romantic drama Love in the Time of Cholera. The R-rated tale from New Line is getting a moderately wide release and will play to an older adult audience with a female skew. The Oscar buzz Bardem has been receiving for Country could rub off on Cholera helping its case. And Latino audiences are being counted on to show up as are fans of Oprah who has endorsed the book that the film is based on. But overall, the Columbia-set film has not generated enough excitement to deliver a solid debut. Plus poor reviews will turn away much of the target audience. A slot on the lower end of the top ten could await. Opening in about 800 theaters, Love in the Time of Cholera might gross around $3M over the weekend.Love in the Time of CholeraBee Movie should fall from its spot at the top of the box office and slide by about 30% since there is not too much new competition for young kids. A weekend tally of $18M could result giving Paramount $97M to date. Universal’s American Gangster should drop by 40% to about $14.5M giving the crime saga a total of $102M. The holiday comedy Fred Claus could dip by 35% in its second weekend. That would leave the Warner Bros. release with a weekend take of $12M and a ten-day cume of $35.5M.LAST YEAR: In a major pre-holiday showdown, the penguin toon Happy Feet edged out the new James Bond film Casino Royale for the number one spot with a strong opening of $41.5M. The Warner Bros. family hit went on to collect $198M domestically and a stellar $384M worldwide. Sony’s relaunched spy series still posted a muscular debut grossing $40.8M over the weekend on its way to $167M domestically and a sensational $595M globally making the Daniel Craig-starrer the top-grossing 007 flick ever. After two weeks on top, Fox’s Borat slipped to third with $14.6M. Rounding out the top five were Disney’s The Santa Clause 3 with $8.3M and the Sony release Stranger Than Fiction with $6.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Disney, political","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Beowulf-Set-To-Conquer-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509149098006","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Bees and Gangsters Slug It Out For #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Bees and Gangsters Slug It Out For #1 SpotThis weekend should see a healthy box office.by Gitesh Pandya | November 1, 2007 |  CommentsFollowing a sluggish fall season, November kicks off with a bang this weekend with two high profile films both reaching for the number one spot while appealing to vastly different audiences. Paramount and DreamWorks target kids with the animated comedy Bee Movie from Jerry Seinfeld while Universal goes after adult audiences with its crime drama American Gangster which pits Denzel Washington against Russell Crowe. With little overlap in business, the overall North American box office should surge and finally beat out year-ago levels leading to a solid kickoff for the holiday movie season.A decade after conquering the television world, Jerry Seinfeld aims to take over the land of film with Bee Movie. The PG-rated toon tells the story of a bee that must try to save his world from those nasty humans that take their honey. Also lending vocal talents are Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Oprah Winfrey, and Chris Rock who snagged the coveted ‘and’ credit for what amounts to about 60 seconds of dialogue. Timing for the Paramount/DreamWorks release is as good as it gets. Not only is early November a hot time for kids movies to score at the box office but the marketplace has suffered a virtual drought when it comes to family-friendly entertainment this fall with The Game Plan being the only major contender. Parents are dying to take their kids to something else, anything else.Bee Movie falls into the lucrative category of digitally animated comedies about talking creatures featuring the voice of a popular comedian. Last November’s Happy Feet with Robin Williams opened to $41.5M, the previous year’s Chicken Little bowed to $40M, and 2004’s Shark Tale debuted with $47.6M. Bee has the slick animation and funny situations that kids like but also features humor that adults will enjoy too so it will play to a broad audience. And the millions of Seinfeld fans that have had nothing but DVD box sets every Thanksgiving will finally have some new material they can check out from their favorite comic. Critics have not been very kind but that should not affect the grosses that much. The studio’s marketing blitz will be enough to make children demand a trip to the local megaplex. With a highly commercial product, no competition for the family audience, and an ultrawide launch in over 3,500 theaters, Bee Movie could win the box office battle this weekend and gross about $42M.Jerry Seinfeld’s Bee MovieBoasting a much higher bodycount this weekend is Ridley Scott‘s American Gangster starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe which will shoot up some solid numbers from adult audiences. The R-rated drama tells the true story of Harlem drug kingpin Frank Lucas who built up a mammoth empire selling heroin. Crowe plays the detective out to shut him down. Starpower from the three names, all of whom have won or been nominated for Oscars multiple times, will be the driving force at the turnstiles. Universal’s $90M+ production also has garnered strong reviews which will help the cause and has been backed by an effective marketing push. The running time of nearly two hours and forty minutes will cut back on the amount of times each auditorium can play the film. Even multiplexes that double-screen the picture will probably run out of seats on Friday and Saturday nights.Gangster should play out like a Denzel movie more than anything else since his box office track record is the strongest and has more consistency than those of Scott and Crowe. Having scored ten career number one openings to date, Washington has seen his top bow come from last year’s Inside Man which debuted to $29M and a $10,275 average. Last fall’s organized crime hit The Departed opened to $26.9M and a $8,912 average and makes for a good comparison given its genre, starpower, acclaim, rating, and length. Gangster will attract a larger African American audience than Scorsese‘s award winner did so an opening north of $30M seems likely. Appeal to men and women will be equally strong. Many adult dramas have struggled at the box office this fall but American Gangster has the firepower to go out there and pull in paying audiences. Plus the weekend’s other major offerings will not eat into its customer base by too much. Heading into 3,054 theaters, American Gangster might debut with around $34M this weekend.Washington and Crowe in American GangsterAfter starring in the year’s second highest grossing horror film 1408, John Cusack hits the big screen again in the family drama Martian Child. The PG-rated film finds the actor playing a writer whose adopted son claims to be from Mars. Parents looking for a movie that they can see with their kids this weekend will be lining up for Jerry and his insect pals so Child will face an uphill battle. New Line hopes that there will be room in the marketplace for a live-action pic for kids but even The Game Plan in its sixth session will be a force to be reckoned with. Invading over 2,000 theaters, Martian Child might take in roughly $6M.John Cusack in The Martian ChildFollowing its strong top spot launch, the horror flick Saw IV is sure to fall hard on the second weekend. Sophomore drops amounted to 47% for Saw II and 56% for Saw III and the decline should get even larger for the fourth installment. A 60% plunge would give Lionsgate about $13M for the frame and a ten-day cume of $51M.Look for a better hold from Steve Carell‘s dramedy Dan in Real Life. The Buena Vista title enjoyed a solid average and has generated good word-of-mouth. The weekend’s new releases may not provide too much competition so a decline of 35% could result. That would put Dan at around $7.5M for a total of $22M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Crashing into multiplexes on a tidal wave of buzz was the raunchy comedy Borat which only debuted in 837 theaters but scored a potent top spot bow of $26.5M for a sizzling average of $31,607. The Fox blockbuster was the only film in 2006 to hit number one while playing in less than 2,000 venues. Final grosses reached $128.5M domestically and over $260M worldwide. Two new kidpics split the family audience and followed in second and third. Disney’s Tim Allen sequel The Santa Clause 3 bowed to $19.5M on its way to $84.5M while Paramount’s animated comedy Flushed Away debuted close behind with $18.8M before finishing with $64.5M. Falling to fourth was Saw III with $14.8M for Lionsgate while the Warner Bros. crime thriller The Departed rounded out the top five with $7.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com,","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"blockbusters, Winter","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Bees-and-Gangsters-Slug-It-Out-For-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509149087760","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Enchanted Conjures Up $50M Thanksgiving Debut","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Enchanted Conjures Up $50M Thanksgiving DebutThe latest Disney movie was no holiday turkey.by Gitesh Pandya | November 25, 2007 |  CommentsThe box office bounced back over the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend asmoviegoers spread their dollars across a wide variety of films whichcollectively helped to bring the marketplace back to life after a mostlyuneventful fall season. Disney led the way with its new family pic Enchanted,which ruled the multiplexes, but a surprisingly potent opening for the holidaycomedy This Christmas contributed to the weekend’s success too. Other newreleases were sprinkled across the top ten which virtually matched theThanksgiving numbers posted over each of the last two years. An unprecedentedeleven films each grossed $8M or more over the frame as every audience segmentfound something to see over the long holiday weekend.For the first time in eight years, Disney opened a new release at number oneover the turkey frame. The studio’s princess tale Enchantedpowered past allcompetitors to bow on top with an estimated $35.3M over the Friday-to-Sundayperiod and an incredible $50M across the five-day holiday span which began onWednesday. That led to a muscular $9,472 average from an ultrawide 3,730 sitesover three days. The PG-rated story of an animated princess who encounters thelive-action world posted the second biggest five-day opening ever over theThanksgiving session.The only hit to debut better was 1999’s Toy Story 2 from Disney and Pixar with$80.1M which was also the studio’s last new pic to bow at number one over thisframe. From 1994 to 1999, the Mouse House consistently debuted a new family filmeach year at number one over this lucrative holiday frame. Enchanted should haveno problem finding its way into the century club.Beating expectations to open in the number two spot was the family reunion filmThis Christmas which debuted to an estimated $18.6M over three days and astunning $27.1M over the five-day period. Sony’s inexpensive $13M productionaveraged a potent $10,011 over three days from only 1,858 theaters for the bestaverage among wide releases. The feel-good holiday pic brought in two-thirds ofits business from African-American moviegoers proving once again how powerfulthat audience is at the box office. Look for This Christmas to finish up as avery profitable venture.Last week’s top warrior Beowulfdropped 41% to an estimated $16.2M and landed inthird place. With $56.4M in its treasure chest after ten days, the$150M-budgeted Paramount release should conclude its domestic run with about$80-90M.Competing actioner Hitmandebuted in fourth place with an estimated $13M overthree days from 2,458 locations. Averaging a decent $5,303 per venue, theR-rated film about a super-assassin was adapted from a popular video game. Overfive days, Hitman shot up $21M for Fox which was targeting many of the sameyoung males that were going to see Beowulf.The animated hit BeeMovie followed in fifth with an estimated $12M, off just14%, for a $112.1M sum to date for Paramount. Warner Bros. was close behind withrival family offering Fred Clauswhich dipped 10% to an estimated $10.7M pushingthe total to $53.1M.Studio stablemate August Rush opened in seventh place with an estimated $9.4Mover three days and $13.3M across five days. The family drama about a youngmusical genius averaged a moderate $4,082 over the Friday-to-Sunday period.American Gangster remained strong in its fourth frame grossing an estimated$9.2M, down 29%, upping its cume for Universal to $115.8M.Two more new wide releases rounded out the top ten. The Mist, a terror talebased on a Stephen King story, debuted in ninth place with an estimated $9.1Mwith a five-day take of $13M. Attacking 2,423 theaters, the R-rated filmaveraged a mild $3,740 over three days. Horror films typically do not see hugenumbers over Thanksgiving weekend as most moviegoers are in the mood for morecheery and upbeat films. Miramax expanded its Coen brothers hit No Country forOld Men into nationwide release and captured an estimated $8.1M over three days.The crime thriller averaged a superb $9,433 and lifted its total to $16.6M.Opening to solid results from the arthouses was theBob Dylan picI’m Not There which grossed an estimated $757,000 from just 130 venues over the three-dayperiod. The Weinstein Co. release averaged a respectable $5,823 per site andcollected $1M over the long holiday session.The top ten films grossed $141.8M over the weekend which was up less than 1%from last year when Happy Feet remained at number one with $37M; but off 1% from2005 when Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stayed on top with $54.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Wars, reboot, Trivia, Rey, Winners, video, science, what, Month, Star, Music, golden, supernatural, Nickelodeon, Lucasfilm","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Enchanted-Conjures-Up-50M-Thanksgiving-Debut"},{"id":"47509150782492","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Wide Open Race For #1 Spot This Weekend","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Wide Open Race For #1 Spot This WeekendFive films compete for box office crown.by Gitesh Pandya | October 11, 2007 |  CommentsFive new films push their way into nationwide release on Friday hoping to challenge two-time champ The Rock making for what should be a free-for-all at the North American box office with many different studios having a realistic shot at claiming the number one spot. Among the top contenders are Sony’s crime thriller We Own the Night, the Lionsgate comedy Why Did I Get Married?, and the George Clooney vehicle Michael Clayton which expands nationally after its scorching debut in limited release. Adding to the mix are the costume drama Elizabeth: The Golden Age and the baseball tale The Final Season. The box office race should be a tight one with as many as four films likely to reach the low double digit millions.Oscar nominated actors Mark Wahlberg and Joaquin Phoenix face off as brothers on different sides of the law in the new action thriller We Own the Night. The R-rated pic co-stars Robert Duvall and Eva Mendes and will target an adult audience with a slightly male skew. The former Marky Mark proved his box office pull last spring as the only major star in Shooter which bowed to $14.5M and a $5,176 average by targeting the same audience. Things will be more difficult this time because of the intense competition for mature audiences especially from Michael Clayton. But Night‘s biggest advantage over Michael is that it has two commercial stars instead of just one. The combo should lead to a slim edge at the cash registers.Despite its awkward title, Night has been pushing itself as an action-packed thriller with faces people love to watch. Reviews have been mixed and with such a crowded field, it will be hard to stand out as a must-see option. Starpower should be the main factor here and showdowns between two solid actors are usually popular with ticket buyers. Opening in over 2,000 theaters, We Own the Night could debut to about $12M.Phoenix and Wahlberg in We Own the NightTaking on those boys with some machismo of his own, George Clooney heads into wide release with his legal drama Michael Clayton which Warner Bros. has drummed up plenty of awards buzz for. The R-rated pic bowed to a sizzling $47,994 average last weekend from its platform bow in the Clooney-friendly towns of New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto. This weekend, the thriller will face the real test when it enters every major market across the 50 states. Thanks to his political outspokenness, the Academy Award winning actor has become a polarizing figure. He could easily win an election to become mayor of Hollywood, but in other parts of the country people would gladly pay theaters to not play his movies.Clayton will test his drawing power since the film has no other box office anchors in it. Co-stars Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack are well-respected, but they don’t sell tickets. There is plenty of direct competition which is why the film got a head start a week early. Buzz from its red hot platform bow has spread helping to build interest. The crowd will consist of the same people that opened Syriana to $11.7M, The Black Dahlia to $10M, and Zodiac to $13.4M. Night will take away some males and Elizabeth will steal some females so a huge gross will be hard to find. But over the long-term the film could have legs. Expanding into 2,511 locations, Michael Clayton stands as the widest of the new offerings and may capture around $11M over the Friday-to-Sunday period.Clooney as ClaytonTyler Perry‘s latest relationship comedy Why Did I Get Married? finds trouble brewing when four married couples come together for an annual winter getaway. The writer/director’s films have always tapped into his loyal fan base with African American women at the core. His 2005 smash Diary of a Mad Black Woman surprised the industry with its first-place debut with $21.9M and a $14,771 average and was followed a year later by Madea’s Family Reunion which grew bigger with a $30M launch. Perry’s last pic Daddy’s Little Girls, also a February release, saw more modest numbers with a $11.2M opening as the filmmaker did not star in the pic.Married does not have the promotional value of Black History Month or the help of Presidents Day which Girls had early this year. However, Perry’s new film will not face any direct competitors for its target audience. Girls had to face the second weekend of Eddie Murphy‘s hit comedy Norbit which offered some audience overlap. Plus Married boasts more starpower with Perry back on screen and an added boost will come from Janet Jackson who is always a strong draw at the box office with the target audience every time she makes a rare appearance in a movie. The PG-13 film from Lionsgate is unlike anything else in the marketplace right now and with few buzzworthy films aimed at black moviegoers in recent months, it should successfully connect. Debuting in 2,011 theaters, Why Did I Get Married? might open with roughly $12M this weekend.Tyler Perry’s Why Did I Get Married?Another female-driven film, but taking place centuries ago and across the pond, is the historical drama Elizabeth: The Golden Age which finds Cate Blanchett reprising the role of the British Queen which made her a star nine years ago. The PG-13 pic also finds Geoffrey Rush returning and adds Clive Owen to the mix telling the story of the later years of the monarch’s 16th century reign when threats from Spain and a possible love affair at home led to new challenges. Though at the core a costume drama like its predecessor, Universal’s marketing has played up the action and adventure elements in hopes of attracting men looking for warfare and battle scenes. That may backfire when word gets out that there is actually very little action on screen.The first Elizabeth opened in limited release in November 1998 and rolled through awards season that winter eventually reaching an impressive $30M while never playing in more than 600 theaters. It also bagged seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Now the studio is hoping that a built-in audience will want to take another trip to the past. Though the first was an acclaimed picture, no real demand ever surfaced for a sequel. So it will be tough for Golden Age at the box office especially with all the competition. Female-led dramas often struggle in the marketplace since it is often too hard for adult women to drag men with them to the multiplex for these stories. New films from Clooney and Wahlberg offer more cross-gender appeal. Ordering her troops into 2,000 theaters on Friday, Elizabeth: The Golden Age might take home about $8M over the three-day period.Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush in Elizabeth: The Golden AgeLikely to strike out at the box office this weekend is the high school baseball pic The Final Season which stars Sean Astin, Larry Miller, and Powers Boothe. The PG-rated film offers no starpower and has generated very little excitement for itself in the marketplace. Most sports fans interested in the national pastime will tune into the playoffs on their television sets this weekend. A quick trip to DVD is assured for this one which has no guarantee to clinch a spot in the top ten. Opening in about 1,000 theaters, a weekend take of just $2M could be in the works.The Final SeasonAmong holdovers, The Game Plan surprised the industry two weeks in a row by taking the number one spot. Given its strong legs and continued lack of competition for the family audience and younger teens, a third round on top is not totally out of the question. Should all the newbies eat into each other and all fail to reach the $12M mark, the Disney kidpic by default may stay put. A 25% decline would give The Game Plan a third weekend tally of $12.5M pushing the 17-day total to a solid $58M.Paramount and DreamWorks were caught by surprise by the lack of strength for the opening of the Ben Stiller comedy The Heartbreak Kid. With nothing to keep it afloat, a 45% decline might be in order especially since adults will be distracted by a wide assortment of other options. That would give the Farrelly brothers a sophomore session of about $7.5M and a cume of only $25.5M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Sony used the Friday the 13th before Halloween to launch the sequel to one of the most successful horror films in history and captured the number one spot. The Grudge 2 bowed on top with $20.8M accounting for more than half of its $39.1M final. Eventual Oscar champ The Departed slipped to second with $19M easing only 29% for Warner Bros. The Robin Williams political comedy Man of the Year debuted in third with $12.3M before finishing with a disappointing $37.3M for Universal. Rounding out the top five were the Sony toon Open Season with $11.1M and New Line’s fright franchise flick Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning with $7.5M for a steep 60% plunge. Opening with weak results in sixth was the action pic The Marine with $7.1M on its way to $18.8M for Fox. The religious-themed drama One Night with the King bowed to $4.1M with a good $4,518 average and finished with $13.4M for 8X.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Black, Horse, Awards, Red, Anna, color, america, Country, zombie","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Wide-Open-Race-For-1-Spot-This-Weekend"},{"id":"47509150795810","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Jovovich vs. Alba in Multiplex Mayhem","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Jovovich vs. Alba in Multiplex MayhemResident Evil: Extinction takes on Good Luck Chuckby Gitesh Pandya | September 20, 2007 |  CommentsJodie Foster will find herself in the middle of a catfight over the number one spot this weekend. The star of current chart-topper The Brave One will face challenges from Milla Jovovich‘s new action sequel Resident Evil: Extinction, Jessica Alba‘s romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck, and the Amanda Bynes college laugher Sydney White. With adult-skewing dramas ruling the box office over the past couple of weeks, teens and young adults should be out in full force this weekend thanks to the selection of new options.Deadly viruses and killer zombies are back in Sony’s Extinction, the latest and final chapter in its video game-inspired action-horror franchise. The series has been a popular one with the first Resident Evil opening to $17.7M in March 2002 and its sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse debuting to a stronger $23M in September 2004. Each averaged about $7,000 over the debut frame. The R-rated Extinction will play to the converted and is not likely to generate any new fans. In fact, some will drop out thinking a third helping is a bit too much. Still the built-in audience of young adults and gamers plus a solid marketing push guarantee a top spot launch. Attacking over 2,700 locations, Resident Evil: Extinction could capture roughly $20M over the three-day debut period.Milla Jovovich fights a zombie in Resident Evil: ExtinctionDane Cook plays a dude whose every ex-girlfriend ends up engaged to the next guy she dates in the romantic comedy Good Luck Chuck. Jessica Alba co-stars in the R-rated release from Lionsgate which will use starpower to attract an audience of older teens and young adults. Last October Cook teamed up with another Jessica, Simpson that time, in the PG-13 comedy Employee of the Month which bowed to $11.4M. The marketing on Chuck has been good and cross-gender appeal seems solid too, although the rating could cut into business from younger teens who will certainly want to see this picture. Falling into 2,612 theaters, Good Luck Chuck may gross about $12M this weekend.Jessica Alba and Dane Cook in Good Luck ChuckAmanda Bynes headlines the college comedy Sydney White playing a freshman caught between the popular sorority sisters and her nerdy pals. The PG-13 film will aim itself squarely at teens and college students and should skew a bit more female. Hollywood has had a tough time reaching young females recently with flops like Nancy Drew ($6.8M opening), Bratz ($4.2M), and Gracie ($1.4M) all stalling. Sydney will try to appeal to the same crowd that powered Bynes’ comedy She’s the Man to $10.7M in March 2006. However the marketing push is not as strong and the release will not be as wide so the three-day take will be softer. The marketplace’s current lack of offerings for this audience creates a great opportunity for a good marketable film to come in a loot some cash. But Sydney just doesn’t seem to have what it takes to score a big opening. Pledging in over 1,900 theaters, Sydney White could debut with around $6M.Amanda Bynes in Sydney WhiteLast weekend, David Cronenberg‘s latest crime thriller Eastern Promises enjoyed a limited release bow that was basically a carbon copy of his last film A History of Violence which opened to $515,992 from 14 theaters in September 2005 for a potent $36,857 average. Focus is now matching History‘s sophomore weekend expansion pattern by widening Promises to 1,404 locations nationwide. History in its second session expanded to 1,340 sites and grossed $8.1M for a solid $6,047 average. Reviews and buzz for Promises is just as good so a similar performance could be in the works. Ticket prices are slightly higher, but so are the number of films also targeting an adult audience. In fact, the top five this weekend should boast mostly R-rated fare. For this weekend, look for Eastern Promises to take in about $8M.Eastern PromisesIn the arthouse scene, which is quickly getting more crowded with each passing week, Brad Pitt rolls in as both actor and producer in the Old West drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Warner Bros. is unleashing the R-rated pic in only 15 theaters in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Austin hoping to generate a strong average and positive word of mouth. Pitt already scored the Best Actor trophy for his portrayal of the famous outlaw at the Venice International Film Festival and is making a bid for kudos attention over the months ahead. Reviews have been mostly positive and an expansion is planned for the coming weeks.The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert FordAfter a less-than-spectacular number one opening, Jodie Foster‘s revenge thriller The Brave One will try to fend off competition for its mature adult audience from the expansion of Eastern Promises. The frame’s three newbies should play to other audience segments. A 45% drop would give Warner Bros. about $7.5M for the weekend and a ten-day cume of $25M which would be about how much Foster’s last starring vehicle Flightplan grossed in only its first three days.3:10 to Yuma posted a solid hold last weekend and this time a similar drop could result. The Lionsgate release might dip by 35% to around $6M raising the total to $37M after 17 days.LAST YEAR: Johnny Knoxville and his partners in crime landed a big number one opening for Jackass: Number Two which bowed to $29M. The Paramount sequel went on to collect $72.8M. Focus debuted in second with another R-rated film aimed at young men, the Jet Li actioner Fearless, which grossed $10.6M. The historical pic reached $24.6M. Sony’s football drama Gridiron Gang dropped two spots to third with $9.5M in its sophomore frame. Opening poorly in fourth was the action flick Flyboys with only $6M for MGM on its way to $13.1M. The animated film Everyone’s Hero rounded out the top five with $4.7M. Premiering to dismal results was the Sean Penn vehicle All the King’s Men (the third new release to take place in the past) with $3.7M for Sony. It quickly ended its run with a poor $7.2M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"your, archives, and, movies, Mary, blockbusters, Sundance, Bravo, Studios, Biopics, black, Marathons, TCA, TV, Fantasy","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Jovovich-vs-Alba-in-Multiplex-Mayhem"},{"id":"47509150789662","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Heartbreak Kid Hopes to Charm Moviegoers","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Heartbreak Kid Hopes to Charm MoviegoersSeeker, Feel the Noise also opening wide.by Gitesh Pandya | October 4, 2007 |  CommentsFollowing a six-week streak of R-rated films topping the charts, The Rock‘s family comedy The Game Plan led the box office last weekend. Now, adult fare comes back to claim the crown with the new Ben Stiller comedy The Heartbreak Kid which is aiming for an easy number one debut. Also opening nationally are the fantasy adventure The Seeker: The Dark is Rising and the music-filled drama Feel the Noise. With the Columbus Day holiday falling on Monday, some students will have extra time off making for a solid start for the month of October.Almost a decade after There’s Something About Mary became a sleeper smash, directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly reunite with Stiller for another raunchy relationship comedy with The Heartbreak Kid. A remake of the 1972 film written by Neil Simon, the Paramount release stands as another number one hit inherited from the DreamWorks factory. The pic tells the story of a man who marries too early and then falls for another woman during his honeymoon. In the past year, the R-rated envelope-pushing comedies Borat, Knocked Up, and Superbad grossed nearly $400M in combined domestic box office proving that there is gold to be mined in this genre when films are made well and deliver the laughs that audiences want.Plus star-driven comedies with major Hollywood faces routinely lure moviegoers away from the home and into the multiplexes. Heartbreak will probably not reach the $30.7M opening weekend figure of Knocked Up which had more buzz plus opened in June when most college students were out of school. But reviews so far have been quite good for this type of film so adults will certainly give it a try. And with so many dark and serious films about outlaws, vigilantes, and terrorists out there, audiences definitely want something light and funny right now. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, The Heartbreak Kid may debut with about $27M this weekend.Ben Stiller and Malin Aklerman in The Heartbreak KidThe time-travel adventure film The Seeker: The Dark is Rising heads into very wide release (possibly too wide) this weekend aiming for young boys in fantasy mode. Rated PG, the Fox release is based on the popular series of novels and will try to tap into a built-in audience of readers. Of course this is no Harry Potter and currently The Rock is doing a good job bringing in business from the lads so it will be an uphill battle at the box office. Overall buzz does not seem too strong so a huge crowd is not expected. Also there is no real starpower so the film will have to rely on special effects and fans of the literary property. Attacking 3,141 venues, The Seeker may generate around $9M over the weekend.The SeekerA Harlem rapper discovers Reggaeton music in Puerto Rico in the urban drama Feel the Noise from producer Jennifer Lopez. Sony is using her name prominently in the marketing which makes sense since there is not much starpower on screen. Latino and African-American youth are being targeted by the PG-13 film which should play mostly to a teen audience. The pic has a clear shot at this crowd since Seeker and The Game Plan skew younger and The Heartbreak Kid and The Kingdom will play older. The studio is trying to tap into the same audience that came out in surprisingly potent numbers for its past films like You Got Served and Stomp the Yard. Noise will open in half as many theaters and the buzz is a bit softer so the numbers will undoubtedly be smaller. Still an impressive average is likely. Stepping into 1,000 locations, Feel the Noise might bow to around $5M.Feel the NoiseOpening in just 15 theaters in a handful of cities is the George Clooney legal thriller Michael Clayton from Warner Bros. In the R-rated pic, the Oscar-winning actor plays a hotshot attorney who is called in to manage a crisis when his firm’s top litigator suffers a breakdown while defending a top client. Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack co-star. Reviews have been strong and the studio hopes that buzz from a few select markets will spread when Clayton expands nationally next weekend. But a crowded marketplace for serious adult dramas will make things tough.George Clooney in Michael ClaytonThe Rock‘s kidpic The Game Plan delivered a powerful debut last weekend and with little competition from new releases, plus the Columbus Day holiday, a solid hold should result. Seeker will distract a few young boys, but overall it shouldn’t be that much of a threat. A decline of 30% could occur giving the Disney hit around $16M for the session boosting the ten-day cume to an impressive $42M.The Middle East drama The Kingdom has been ranking number one during the week since kids are busy with school and less able to see Game Plan. Universal should see a 45% drop to about $9.5M which would put the Jamie Foxx actioner at $32M after ten days. Look for Resident Evil: Extinction to slide 50% to roughly $4M leaving Sony with $43M to date.LAST YEAR: October kicked off with a bang with the top spot debut of Martin Scorsese‘s The Departed with $26.9M. Warner Bros. went on to gross $132.4M domestically and $288M worldwide plus scored four Oscars including the coveted Best Picture statue. Opening in second place with $18.5M was Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning which was the first of three horror sequels that month. New Line found its way to $39.5M. Sony’s toon hit Open Season dropped to third with $15.6M in its sophomore frame. The Lionsgate comedy Employee of the Month bowed in fourth with $11.4M on its way to $28.4M.

The R-rated entry comes from current comedy king Judd Apatow who directed Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin which collectively grossed a stunning $256M domestically. He takes on producing chores here but his involvement has wisely been promoted heavily in the film’s marketing campaign which really ignited earlier this summer with the release of the uncensored red-band trailer on the internet which basically put Superbad on the map.The marketplace for teen sex comedies has had a void since the American Pie franchise switched into direct-to-DVD mode. Superbad has the goods to make itself into this generation’s must-see raunchfest with its story of three lovable nerdy high school kids on a mission to score booze for a party to impress some girls. The lethal mix of strong marketing, filmmaker starpower, and a high-quality product that actually delivers what the audience wants will lead to a potent opening weekend that should be enough to send it to the top of the charts. And with a reported $18M budget, this could very well be the summer’s least expensive number one hit. Crashing into over 2,800 theaters, Superbad might collect around $25M this weekend.Superbad!Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig give the suspense thriller The Invasion the most starpower of any of this weekend’s new releases. The PG-13 film finds the Oscar-winning actress playing a psychiatrist and the current Bond as her doctor pal who must team up to fight an alien entity that infects the human population around the world. This latest remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers boasts some considerable star wattage which will help it get the attention of adults. Warner Bros. is hoping to appeal to the same audience that made hits out of previous late-summer adult thrillers like The Skeleton Key ($16.1M, $5,795 average)and Kidman’s The Others ($14.1M opening, $8,397 average). With no other scary movies for mature audiences, competition should not be too fierce although The Bourne Ultimatum‘s third weekend will be a formidable foe. Landing in about 2,700 locations, The Invasion could debut with around $13M.The two stars of The Invasion.The Weinstein Company unleashes its Roman empire adventure The Last Legion on Friday. The PG-13 film stars Ben Kingsley, Colin Firth, and Bollywood superstar Aishwarya Rai. Excitement in the marketplace is not too high and the push has not been very strong so modest returns are expected at the box office. The current pair of threequels topping the charts will give Legion some major competition for the action crowd. Debuting in roughly 2,000 theaters, The Last Legion could bow to about $6M.Ben Kingsley leads The Last Legion.Like most summer sequels, Rush Hour 3 should lose more than half of its opening weekend audience in the sophomore session. There is no special buzz around the action-comedy to prevent a big drop and Superbad will steal away much of the young comedy crowd. A 55% decline is likely which would put Rush Hour 3 at about $22M for the weekend and $88M after ten days.Fellow threequel The Bourne Ultimatum looks to witness a smaller decline in its third assignment. Universal might experience a 45% drop to around $18M for a robust 17-day cume of $162M.LAST YEAR: Opening weaker than expected, but still at number one, was the Samuel L. Jackson actioner Snakes on a Plane which bowed to $15.2M. New Line found its way to a disappointing $34M. Talladega Nights dropped to second with $13.8M while World Trade Center held steady in third with $10.9M. The dance sensation Step Up fell to fourth with $10.2M while Universal’s teen comedy Accepted debuted in fifth place with $10M. A $36.3M final resulted. MGM’s comedy Material Girls stumbled into ninth with a mere $4.6M on its way to only $11.4M. But opening powerfully in limited release was the mystery The Illusionist with less than $1M from only 51 theaters for a potent $18,195 average. The Yari Film Group release expanded nationally and enjoyed good legs going on to gross $39.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"on, The, satire, Spike, Moore, Arts, Turner, Animation","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Make-Way-for-McLovin"},{"id":"47509150793760","title":"Box Office Preview: Kingdom Hopes to Win Box Office Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: Kingdom Hopes to Win Box Office CrownFeast of Love, Game Plan also battle it out.by Gitesh Pandya | September 27, 2007 |  CommentsAfter two weeks of rule by Jodie and Milla, the boys come charging back in what could be a fierce fight for the number one spot. Jamie Foxx heads up the Middle East political thriller The Kingdom while The Rock targets a kinder and gentler audience with his family comedy The Game Plan. With little to no overlap in customers, both films should have room to breathe. Also debuting but in a moderate national release is the Morgan Freeman pic Feast of Love.After scoring four consecutive $100M grossers this summer, Universal aims for another trip to the number one spot with its new military drama The Kingdom. Oscar winner Jamie Foxx leads the cast playing an agent with the FBI that assembles a talented team of experts to go to Saudi Arabia against government orders to investigate a suicide bomber’s attack against Americans. Jennifer Garner, Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, and Jeremy Piven co-star in the R-rated pic. The studio is hoping to reconnect with the same audience that powered its 2005 Iraq War drama Jarhead to a strong $27.7M bow. It’s even used Kanye West‘s music in its advertising just as it did two years ago.The Kingdom is part of a handful of fall flicks to deal with political issues in the Middle East. As one of the first ones out of the gate, it may not suffer from the backlash against this genre that may eventually be created. Marketed as a revenge picture featuring Americans fighting back against those who wronged us, the Peter Berg-directed film should tap into a certain segment of the audience that will find comfort in this type of fare. But competition for adults will be a factor especially considering how seven of the top eight films last weekend were rated R. Reviews have been mixed, however starpower is ample which should compensate. Infiltrating more than 2,700 theaters, The Kingdom might open with approximately $19M this weekend.Jamie Foxx and co. in The Kingdom.A superstar quarterback’s life is thrown into disarray when he meets the daughter he never knew he had in Disney’s The Game Plan starring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. The PG-rated entry enters multiplexes in the early weeks of the football season and at a time when there are zero options for families meaning the timing could not be better. The concept should sell to moms, dads, and kids alike. Plus, the studio found great success with this format two years ago when it put muscular action star Vin Diesel into the family comedy The Pacifier and drove $30.6M worth of business into theaters on opening weekend.Of course Diesel, Ice Cube, and other macho men have been showing their softer side in kidpics lately so the idea is not totally new. The studio’s sneak previews last weekend helped to get more buzz out there with the target demo and with the lack of direct competition, Game Plan should have smooth sailing with parents and children. The marketing push has been effective as Disney has proven with films like Wild Hogs that it can sell just about any type of star-driven comedy to the public. Charging into about 2,800 locations, The Game Plan could grab around $17M this weekend.The Rock stars in The Game Plan.Morgan Freeman, Greg Kinnear, and Selma Blair star in the new drama Feast of Love which quietly enters the marketplace on Friday as the frame’s third new wide opener. Directed by Robert Benton, the R-rated collection of intertwining stories set in Oregon will play exclusively to a mature adult audience. MGM has not been pushing the film too much and the release is not very wide so the film’s potential is limited. Women should outnumber men by a small margin. Landing in about 1,200 sites, a $2M debut could result.Morgan Freeman and Greg Kinnear in Feast of Love.The Tommy Lee Jones drama In the Valley of Elah will expand to roughly 700 theaters nationwide on Friday as it enters its third weekend of release and will try to pop into the top ten. The Paul Haggis-directed pic got off to a solid start by platforming in nine theaters to a $14,840 average. However, things slowed down considerably last weekend during its expansion to 317 playdates which eroded its average down to $3,996. The Warner Independent title struggled as it moved into more major markets and this weekend should see its average get diluted further. A weekend tally of about $2M seems likely.Tommy Lee Jones in Elah.A mighty tumble awaits current box office champ Resident Evil: Extinction which is coming off of the biggest bow in the series. The first two Evil pics each suffered a steep 62% drop in the second weekend. A similar drop should result for this third chapter giving Extinction about $9.5M for the frame and $38M in ten days.The Dane Cook–Jessica Alba comedy Good Luck Chuck is also following up on a solid debut. Most of the fans of the actors probably came out upfront so a 50% fall to around $7M seems likely. That would give Lionsgate a ten-day cume of $24M.LAST YEAR Sony topped the charts with its animated offering Open Season which debuted to an impressive $23.6M on its way to $85.1M. Ashton Kutcher voiced the number one film and starred on-screen opposite Kevin Costner in the second place pic The Guardian which opened to $18M. the Buena Vista release went on to collect $55M. Jackass: Number Two fell two spots to third with $14.6M losing half of it audience. Launching in fourth was the Billy Bob Thornton comedy School for Scoundrels with $8.6M for MGM on its way to $17.8M.

Most of the debutingfilms were met with disappointing sales since ticket buyers spent their time andmoney catching up on popular holdover titles which commanded the top threespots.The supercool kids of Superbad remained the leaders of the pack with an estimated weekendgross of $18M, falling 46% from last weekend. After ten days, the Sony smash hastaken in an impressive $68.6M and could be on its way to $120M or more. Thatwould give the raunchy hit a domestic gross nearly seven times its productioncost of $18M. Superbad is the first summer film to spend back-to-backweekends at number one since Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End which bowed over Memorial Day weekend inMay. Sony has now claimed the number one film nine times in 2007, more than anyother studio.Rising one spot to second place wasMatt Damon‘slatest assassin flick The Bourne Ultimatumwhich slipped only 38% to an estimated $12.4M. It was the fourth bestfourth-weekend gross of any summer film this year after the threequeltriumvirate of Shrek the Third ($15.3M),Spider-Man 3 ($14.3M), and Pirates($12.4M). With $185.1M in the bank for Universal, Bourne has now outgrossedevery James Bond film domestically (in nominal dollar terms), both previousBourne films, and two of the three Mission: Impossible pics. Ultimatumis stillon track to hit the $200M mark by the end of Labor Day weekend and will give aserious challenge to this decade’s top action films that are not driven byspecial effects – Rush Hour 2 ($226.2M in 2001) and Mission: Impossible 2($215.4M in 2000).&nbsp;New Line’s action-comedy sequelRush Hour 3 fell 43%to an estimated $12.3M in its third mission. TheJackie Chan–ChrisTucker threequel has collected $109M in 17 days and is on track to finishwith $140-145M.&nbsp;In a tight race among new releases, the family film Mr. Bean’s Holidayedged out the action film Warfor fourth place. Universal’s G-rated comedy opened to an estimated $10.1M from1,714 theaters for a solid $5,905 average. TheRowan Atkinsonstarrer has already grossed a stellar $189M internationally. Debuting closebehind with an estimated $10M was the R-rated crime drama War whichaveraged a mediocre $4,392 from 2,277 locations. StarringJet Li andJason Statham,the Lionsgate release opened close to the numbers of the last films from the twoactors. Last September, Li’s Fearless bowed to$10.6M and a $5,857 average while Statham’s Crank launched with$10.5M over three days and a $4,158 average. Putting the two together did littleto broaden the audience, however.&nbsp;MGM landed in sixth place with a disappointing opening for the comedy The Nanny Diarieswhich grossed an estimated $7.8M. Playing in 2,629 theaters, the PG-13 pic basedon the popular novel averaged just $2,971 per site.&nbsp;The year’s top-grossing non-rat toon The Simpsons Moviedropped 36% to an estimated $4.4M in its fifth frame boosting the cume to$173.4M for Fox. Paramount’s fantasy adventure Stardust grossed anestimated $4M, off only 30%, for a total of $26.5M.&nbsp;Moviegoers kept going back for more musical fun as New Line’s Hairspray dipped amere 23% in its sixth session to an estimated $3.5M and raised its overall cumeto $107.5M. Rounding out the top ten was the sci-fi flop The Invasion whichtumbled 47% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.1M. The Warner Bros.release has taken in just $11.5M in ten days and should end with a miserable$16-18M.Three national releases dumped into the late-August abyss debuted outside of thetop ten with weak results. Yari Film Group’s well-reviewed boxing drama Resurrectingthe Champ starringSamuel L.Jackson and Josh Hartnett opened with an estimated $1.8M from 1,605 theaters for a poor$1,152 average. Universal’s Latino crime drama Illegal Tenderbowed to an estimated $1.4M from 512 sites for a mild $2,805 average. The mostmiserable results came from theJon Voightfilm September Dawnwhich grossed an estimated $600,000 from 850 playdates for an embarrassing $706per-theater average for Slowhand Releasing.&nbsp;In limited release, theMandy Mooredrama Dedicationgot off to a moderate start collecting an estimated $24,000 from only fourvenues for an average of $6,000 on its opening weekend for The Weinstein Co.&nbsp;Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix grossed an estimated $2.5M,down 34%, lifting the domestic haul to $283.3M. Despite the midweek launch inJuly, the fifth wizard pic should end up with a final take nearly identical tothe $290M taken in by the last installment Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which had a Friday opening inNovember which has been the most common type of launch for the franchise.&nbsp;Buena Vista’s family film Underdog fell 42% toan estimated $2.2M and put its sum at $36.6M. A $42-44M final seems likely. Adam Sandler‘slatest comedy blockbuster INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry grossed an estimated $2.1M, down 42%,and gave Universal a total of $114.3M to date.

The overall NorthAmerican box office continued its red hot pace significantly beating outyear-ago levels yet again on its way to possibly ending the summer season with anew record.Sony captured the top spot for the first time since early May with Superbadwhich powered ahead of expectations to bow to an estimated $31.2M. The R-ratedtale of three nerdy high school pals on a wild search to get booze to impresstheir lady friends averaged a potent $10,583 from 2,948 locations. The openingeven beat out the $30.7M debut of June’s Knocked Up from directorJudd Apatowand actor Seth Rogen. Apatow produced Superbad which co-starred and wasco-written by Rogen. Critics were quite impressed with McLovin and friends andgave the film high marks. (Clickhere forour interview with the stars of Superbad.)The studio pushed the teen comedy for months with a well-executed marketingcampaign which included a popular uncensored trailer and touring the main actorsaround the country for promotional events. Superbad delivered the second biggestopening for an R-rated film this year only trailing 300. The two are the only R pics to reach number one at all in 2007. With a production cost of only $18M,the comedy will easily become a healthy moneymaker for Sony. But the film’stroubling Friday-to-Saturday drop of 15% could mean that fans rushed out upfrontas if this were a sequel and that big dropoffs could be on the horizon. Still itwas the second biggest opening ever in the traditionally slow second half ofAugust behind just Freddy vs. Jason which debuted to $36.4M in 2003. Studioresearchshowed that the audience was 52% male and 60% in the 18-34 bracket.Rush Hour 3 fell 56% in its second weekend and slipped to the runnerup spot withan estimated $21.8M pushing the ten-day cume to $88.2M. The New Line actionsequel should find its way to about $135-140M from North America. Like most ofthis summer’s threequels, Rush Hour 3 will end its domestic run well behind thegross of its predecessor.The one threequel to break that trend is The Bourne Ultimatum which followed inthird place this weekend with an estimated $19M, off only 42%. Universal’slatest action entry has taken in a stellar $163.8M in only 17 days and shouldsurpass the $176.1M of 2004’s The Bourne Supremacy by the end of the week tobecome the top-grossing film of the franchise. Grossing an estimated $6.7M inits fourth frame, down 41%, was The Simpsons Movie which has taken in$165.1M for Fox to date.Starpower from Nicole Kidman andDaniel Craig meant nothing at the box officefor their new sci-fi thriller The Invasion which bombed with an opening of just$6M, according to estimates. Playing wide in 2,776 theaters, the PG-13 remake ofInvasion of the Body Snatchers averaged a measly $2,161 per site. TheWarner Bros. release earned mostly negative reviews.Paramount’s fairy tale adventure Stardust fell 43% to an estimated $5.2M for aten-day sum of just $19.1M. A $30-35M final seems likely. The musical smashHairspray joined the century club over the weekend grossing an estimated $4.3Mfor New Line, down just 33%, for a total of $100.7M. Disney’s Underdogdropped 43% to an estimated $3.6M to boost its tally to $31.7M.Falling to ninth place was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which tookin an estimated $3.5M, off just 35%, giving Warner Bros. $278.6M from NorthAmerica.

Rounding out the top ten wasAdam Sandler andKevin James inthe Universal comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which madean estimated $3.5M, down 41%, for a total of $110.4M thus far.Opening with weak results outside of the top ten was the historical epic The Last Legion starringBen Kingsley,Colin Firth, andAishwarya Rai which launchedwith an estimated $2.6M from 2,002 playdates for a dismal $1,297 average.Debuting with respectable results in limited release was MGM’s Death at aFuneral which bowed to an estimated $1.3M from 260 theaters for a $5,012average.Warner Independent platformedLeonardoDiCaprio‘s documentary The 11th Hour inNew York and Los Angeles and generated a strong start.

The frame’s only other wide opener Hairspray enjoyed amagical debut of its own with a strong third place bow. Overall, moviegoersspread their dollars around as for first time in more than three years, fourfilms grossed over $20M each over the same weekend.Universal won a slim box office victory with the launch of Chuck and Larry which grossed an estimated $34.8M to lead the frame.Debuting in 3,495 theaters, the PG-13 pic about two straight firefighters whopretend to be gay for the domestic partner benefits averaged an impressive$9,950 per location. Though a solid first place performance, Chuck and Larryalso delivered the worst opening for one ofSandler’s broadlive-action comedies since the 2000 flop Little Nicky.His more dramatic turns in films like Spanglish and Reign Over Mehave attracted modest openings, but his mainstream laughers typically debut nearthe $40M mark. Sandler still stands a good chance of earning a $100M blockbusterfor the sixth consecutive year.Falling down one spot to the runnerup position was Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix which grossed an estimated$32.2M in its sophomore session. Down a steep 58%, the Warner Bros. releaselifted its 12-day cume to a stunning $207.5M. Second weekend declines aretypically large for high-profile tentpole films. Phoenix’s drop was a bitsmaller than the 62% for both Spider-Man 3 andPiratesof the Caribbean: At World’s End which each debuted on a Friday in May.However, it was larger than the drops for fellow midweek openers Live Free orDie Hard and Transformerswhich witnessed sophomore declines of 47% and 48%, respectively.The new Potter film had to compete with the arrival of the seventh andfinal wizard book on Saturday which appealed to the exact same audience andprobably kept many away from the multiplexes. Still the gross to date comparesfavorably to the $201M that the last film Goblet of Fire generated by the end of its second weekend in November2005. That tally however was over two fewer days but did have the benefit of theThanksgiving holiday. With the summer playing period, Phoenix stands agood chance of matching the $290M of Goblet and could even crack the$300M mark. Together with Transformers, that would give this summer arecord five megablockbusters crossing the $300M threshold.Helped by monster openings in Japan and Russia, the fifth wizard tale grossed astaggering $100.8M overseas this weekend to boost the international tally to$351.3M. That puts the global box office for Order of the Phoenix at atowering $559M after only 12 days. This weekend the Harry Potter moviefranchise also crossed a major milestone as the global box office for all fivefilms combined shattered the $4 billion mark.New Line attracted a large audience to its musical comedy Hairspray whichopened better than expected at number three with an estimated $27.8M. Playing in3,121 houses, the PG-rated film averaged a stellar $8,907 and gave the studioits best opening in two years. Hairspray earned rave reviews from criticsand starred a diverse cast that allowed the marketing team to target differentaudiences. Hollywood veteransJohn Travolta andMichelle Pfeifferhelped bring in adult moviegoers,Amanda Bynes andZac Efron caught theattention of teens, Queen Latifah helped give the film appeal to African American moviegoers,and newcomer Nikki Blonsky hit the talk show circuit making everyday Americans feel theytoo can win their shot at movie stardom. Many audience segments found somethinghere to like.Transformers banked another $20.5M, according to estimates, and saw itstotal soar to $263M. Off 45% in its third weekend, the Paramount/DreamWorksproduction climbed to number 34 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusterspassing the $262M of 2002’s Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.The animated rodent film Ratatouilledropped 39% to fifth place with an estimated $11M in its fourth outing to boostthe cume to $165.6M.

Adam Sandler headlines the gay marriage pic I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry while John Travolta goes one step further starring as a heavy-set mom in the musical Hairspray. For the first time in nearly a month, no new release gets an early midweek headstart.\nAdam Sandler is back for his annual trip to blockbusterland in Chuck and Larry starring with Kevin James and Jessica Biel. The PG-13 film reunites Sandler with director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore)\nand tells the story of two heterosexual firefighters who pretend to be married to each other to take advantage of the financial benefits. The former Saturday Night Live star only does one film per year and each comedy has a specific well-defined plot. That has led to a string of hits at the box office as fans so far have not had too much of him. Earlier this year, Eddie Murphy reached $34.2M with Norbit‘s opening while Will Ferrell bowed to $33M with Blades of Glory. Chuck should go a little higher.\n\nThe former wedding singer has scored $100M blockbusters in each of the last five years and aims to extend the streak to six with his latest summer offering. Last June, his comedy Click bowed to $40M on its way to $137.3M while 2005’s The Longest Yard debuted to $47.6M over three days before heading to a $158.1M final. Sandler is one of the most reliable box office draws in the business and his usual fan following, skewing a bit more male, should be back again this time. Reviews have been bad as usual but should not factor in much. Potter and Transformers will still provide some competition for young males and females may be swayed more to Hairspray. Universal’s marketing push has been on par with past films from the actor and Sandler has been hitting up all the standard talk shows for his yearly sales pitches. Tying the knot in 3,492 theaters, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry could open to about $37M.\n\n\nThe happy couple\n\n\nJohn Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken,\nAmanda Bynes, and newcomer Nicole Blonsky join forces for the lavish musical Hairspray, the 2007 movie version of the popular Broadway version of the 1988 cult film from John Waters. The new PG-rated pic has earned glowing praise from critics which will certainly help its cause in a summer full of action hits aimed at young males. Hairspray will skew more female and could appeal to multiple generations given the broad range of stars from teen queens to middle-aged sex symbols. \n\nNew Line does not have an easy sell here. However the studio was wise to program the release into the second half of summer knowing that audiences may be all actioned out by now and looking for something different. Musicals rarely hit the big screen during the summer although in 2001 Moulin Rouge opened wide to $13.7M and a $6,019 average leading to a respectable $57.4M gross. Hairspray hopes to become a hit like Chicago and Dreamgirls, rather than a dud like Rent or The Producers. Broadway musicals don’t always translate well onto the big screen but starpower often helps to make them click with moviegoers. Hairspray boasts a solid line-up of Hollywood stars and with strong reviews should\nattract a good following at the box office. Dancing into more than 3,000 theaters, the Adam Shankman-directed film could collect about $19M this weekend.\n\n","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"San, book, Pop, Funimation, kaiju, Television, Holiday, sequels, TV, the, cartoon, curtis, Masterpiece","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Can-Chuck-and-Larry-Beat-Up-Harry"},{"id":"47509152568373","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Evan\" Not-So-Mighty Opens at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Evan\" Not-So-Mighty Opens at #1by Gitesh Pandya | June 24, 2007 |  CommentsSteve Carell took over the number one spot this weekend with his new comedy \"Evan Almighty,\" but it failed to generate the flood of business needed to recoup its mammoth production cost.The John Cusack thriller \"1408\" debuted to strong results while \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" fell sharply in its second mission. Weekend sales were too close to call for the two which were separated by only $25,000 according to estimates. Overall, the North American box office posted solid, but not spectacular results for this time of year.Audiences lined up two by two for \"Evan Almighty\" which captured the top spot this weekend with an estimated $32.1M. The PG-rated sequel bowed to less than half of the $68M Friday-to-Sunday debut of its 2003 predecessor \"Bruce Almighty\" while costing more than twice as much. Playing in 3,604 locations, \"Evan\" averaged a solid $8,910 per ark. Morgan Freeman returned to play God and director Tom Shadyac was also back behind the camera, but Jim Carrey did not take part again. Universal spent a reported $175M producing its big summer comedy offering which was aimed at family audiences with its storyline involving animals and its PG rating. Reviews were mostly negative.Thanks to a heavy special effects budget and a production that went behind schedule but still needed to be completed in time for its set release date, \"Evan Almighty\" turned into one of the priciest comedies in history reaching a budget common usually only seen for high-profile action sequels. The film will need good legs, a strong international run, and hefty video sales in order to break even. According to studio research, 52% of the audience was over the age of 25, 45% consisted of families, and moviegoers polled by CinemaScore gave the pic an encouraging A- grade. However, the film scored a weaker B average grade from over 2,000 votes on Yahoo Movies.It was still a milestone weekend for struggling Universal Pictures which has released a number of turkeys over the past year. The studio scored its first number one opener since last August’s \"Miami Vice\" and its first $100M grosser since last June’s \"The Break-Up\" with Knocked Up.Opening surprisingly well in second place was the psychological thriller \"1408\" with an estimated $20.2M for MGM and The Weinstein Co. The John Cusack hit averaged a frighteningly strong $7,534 from 2,678 theaters. Rated PG-13, 1408 tells of a writer who checks into a haunted hotel room that dozens of others have died in. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars in the film which is based on a Stephen King short story. With so many horror films, even from proven franchises, failing at the box office in recent months, \"1408\" energized audiences and delivered a solid opening. It was the second biggest debut of the year for a fright flick behind the $22.2M bow of \"Disturbia,\" another PG-13 psychological thriller set mostly indoors.In a virtual tie for second place was last weekend’s winner \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" which tumbled 65% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $20.2M as well. Fox’s super hero sequel suffered a big blow, but it wasn’t a total surprise considering the 59% second-weekend drop of the first \"Fantastic\" pic and the fact that sequels often erode quicker. \"Silver Surfer\" has captured $97.6M in ten days and seems on a course to finish with $135-140M which would be slightly behind the $154.7M of its predecessor.\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" ranked fourth with an estimated $11.4M in its third caper, off just 43%, giving Warner Bros. a healthy $91M to date. The George Clooney–Brad Pitt heist pic is running 5% behind the pace of 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" at the same point in its run but 5% ahead of 2004’s \"Ocean’s Twelve.\" \"Thirteen\" looks headed for the $125M mark in North America. Overseas, the new chapter grossed an estimated $21.3M from 49 markets to raise the international tally to a cool $100M and the global gross to $191M.For the second straight weekend, Universal’s sleeper hit \"Knocked Up\" dipped by less than 30% and remained in double digit millions. The Judd Apatow-directed smash grossed an estimated $10.6M, off only 24%, and pushed its cume to $109M joining the century club on Friday in its 22nd day of release. \"Knocked Up\" continues to show the same great legs that made fellow R-rated summer comedies like \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" such big hits two summers ago. A final tally of $140-150M might result.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" followed in sixth with an estimated $7.2M, down 42%, boosting the cume to $287M. The Johnny Depp high seas adventure rose to number 29 on the all-time domestic blockbusters list after 2005’s \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" which grossed $290M. A final North American tally of around $305M seems likely for the expensive Buena Vista sequel. Overseas, \"At World’s End\" collected an estimated $20.4M pushing the international tally to $584.6M and the worldwide haul to a jaw-dropping $871.6M. Captain Jack will swing past \"Spider-Man 3\"’s roughly $880M global haul by the end of the week on its way to possibly $950M. The two juggernauts have combined for a towering $1.75 billion in worldwide box office so far.Sony’s animated comedy \"Surf’s Up\" held up well despite the arrival of Evan and grossed an estimated $6.7M dipping only 28%. The penguin pic has captured $47.3M to date. Rival toon \"Shrek the Third\" followed with an estimated $5.8M, off 36%, for a $307.9M total. That put the latest ogre tale at number 22 on the all-time domestic list passing \"Independence Day\" which grossed $306.2M in 1996 when ticket prices were much lower.. Look for Donkey and his pals to finish with roughly $330M from North America. Warner Bros. placed ninth with \"Nancy Drew\" which fell 34% to an estimated $4.5M giving the sleuth pic $16.2M in ten days.Opening in tenth place was Angelina Jolie’s \"A Mighty Heart\" with an estimated $4M from 1,355 theaters for a mild $2,956 average. The Paramount Vantage release earned strong reviews and has sparked Oscar buzz for Jolie’s performance as Mariane Pearl, widow of the slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. The R-rated film skewed to an audience of mature women with studio research showing that over 60% of the crowd was female and more than 60% was over 30.Lionsgate saw sensational results for the new Michael Moore documentary \"Sicko\" which platformed in only one Manhattan theater but still grossed an estimated $70,000 over the weekend. The distributor will open the PG-13 look at the U.S. health care system on Friday across the country. \"Sicko\"’s average was especially notable since it only occupied one screen at its theater. Often, when specialty films platform to such astonishing averages, they play in two or three screens within the same theater.Three very different films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. MGM’s Kevin Costner thriller \"Mr. Brooks\" fell 47% to an estimated $1.5M for a cume to date of $26.6M. A $30M final seems likely. \"Hostel Part II\" grossed an estimated $1M, down 67%, for a $17M total. The torture sequel should end with about $18M which would be a 62% fall from the $47.4M of the first \"Hostel\" flick.Also dropping down was the year’s biggest blockbuster \"Spider-Man 3.\" After seven weeks in the top ten, the webslinger tale declined by 48% to an estimated $1.3M and boosted its incredible cume to $332.5M. Sony now finds itself at number 15 on the all-time domestic chart behind \"Finding Nemo\" which gobbled up $339.7M four years ago. \"Spider-Man 3\" should finish in the friendly neighborhood of $337M making it the lowest-grossing installment of the series in North America. However, its international tally of more than $545M already makes it the biggest \"Spidey\" overseas and the combined global gross of about $880M makes it the biggest Peter Parker pic ever worldwide. The first two \"Spider-Man\" films grossed $822M and $784M respectively and while the third chapter lost audience members domestically, it more than made up for it with gains internationally.The top ten films grossed an estimated $122.6M which was down 2% from last year when \"Click\" opened at number one with $40M; but up 8% from 2005 when \"Batman Begins\" remained in the top spot with $27.6M in its second weekend.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"christmas, WarnerMedia, in, Disney, Schmidt, Esquire, Fire, Avengers, The, HBO, thriller, Classic, Awards","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Evan-NotSoMighty-Opens-at-1"},{"id":"47509154201654","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Evan Shall Lead the Way","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Evan Shall Lead the Wayby Gitesh Pandya | June 21, 2007 |  CommentsUniversal looks to score its first number one hit in nearly a year this weekend with the new Steve Carell comedy \"Evan Almighty\" which hits the multiplexes on Friday targeting a broad family audience.Reaching out to adult moviegoers are MGM with the John Cusack chiller \"1408\" and Paramount Vantage with the Angelina Jolie starrer \"A Mighty Heart.\" Overall, the marketplace could slow down a bit this weekend before another wave of high-profile summer blockbusters arrives towards the end of June.The sixth consecutive sequel to open at number one has a different formula up its sleeve. \"Evan Almighty\" loses Jim Carrey from \"Bruce Almighty,\" drops the rating from PG-13 to PG, and shifts the plot over to a Biblical story while courting family audiences. Michael Bay isn’t the only one with a transformer at the box office this summer. Universal’s big-budget comedy offering should easily top the charts, however the financial picture will be very different. Steve Carell, whose starpower has blossomed since the 2003’s \"Bruce,\" takes over as the lead playing a TV anchorman-turned-congressman who is told by God to build an ark because a mighty flood is coming. Morgan Freeman reprises his supporting role as the big G.On a budget rumored to have ballooned to $175M thanks to extensive special effects and overages, \"Evan Almighty\" stands as one of the priciest comedies ever. The loss of Jim Carrey means it has almost no chance of reaching the $68M three-day opening weekend gross of \"Bruce\" from four years ago when it shocked the film industry by kicking \"The Matrix Reloaded\" out of the top spot in only its second frame. It reached a domestic haul of $242.8M. \"Evan Almighty\" could conceivably gross half the amount of \"Bruce,\" while costing twice as much to produce. Does that mean it will lose money? Not necessarily. \"Evan\" would love nothing more than to follow in the footsteps of \"Night at the Museum,\" another effects-driven comedy led by a popular comedian aimed at families, which has grossed over $570M worldwide. If it can tap into that crowd, then it will be a divine road ahead.\"Evan\"’s trim running time of about 90 minutes will help since multiplexes can schedule numerous showtimes per day. Competition will come from current chart-topper \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,\" another action-comedy sequel tamed down to a PG to cater to eight-year-old boys on summer vacation. Teens and young adults who have to wait until the fall to see new episodes of Carell’s \"The Office\" may line up for \"Evan\" and give it a try, despite the negative reviews. There’s not much else exciting that demo right now. And given its themes, moviegoers in the Bible Belt may contribute some solid sales on opening weekend as the studio is wisely targeting churches in its marketing outreach. Opening in 3,602 theaters, \"Evan Almighty\" could premiere to about $40M this weekend.\"Evan Almighty\"John Cusack hopes to avoid the current horror curse at the box office with his new psychological thriller \"1408.\" The MGM release finds the actor playing a writer who checks into a haunted hotel room that many have died in. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars in the PG-13 pic. Scary movies have been slaughtered at the cash registers lately. Even star-driven adult thrillers have struggled as witnessed by openings of $11.2M for \"Perfect Stranger\" starring Halle Berry and Bruce Willis, $10M for Hilary Swank‘s \"The Reaping,\" $10M for Kevin Costner‘s \"Mr. Brooks,\" and $7.6M for Luke Wilson‘s hotel-themed \"Vacancy.\" Managing to surge a bit higher were Sandra Bullock‘s \"Premonition\" with $17.6M and Jim Carrey’s \"The Number 23\" with $14.6M. \"1408\" may not scare up that much business given consumer apathy towards fright flicks right now. Plus Cusack and Jackson are not really known for packing them in on opening weekend unless there are bigger stars present. Checking into 2,678 theaters, \"1408\" might take in about $12M this weekend.John Cusack in \"1408\"Angelina Jolie headlines this weekend’s serious offering for adult audiences, \"A Mighty Heart.\" Directed by Michael Winterbottom (\"The Road to Guantanamo,\" \"Welcome to Sarajevo\"), the R-rated film finds the Oscar-winning actress playing Mariane Pearl, wife of slain Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, and documents her struggle to find her kidnapped husband in Pakistan. In a summer of sequels and effects-driven action pictures for kids on vacation, Paramount Vantage is going after the adults that are often neglected at this time of year. Reviews for \"Heart\" have been strong with Jolie already earning kudos buzz and the film should appeal to the same audiences that came out for other acclaimed political thrillers like \"United 93\" ($11.5M, $6,395 average), \"The Constant Gardener\" ($8.7M, $6,444), and \"Syriana\" ($11.7M, $6,699). Competition will come from \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" and \"Knocked Up\" which have both been playing well with the 30-plus crowd. Debuting in about 1,350 theaters, \"A Mighty Heart\" might open in the vicinity of $7M.Angelina Jolie in \"A Mighty Heart\"Last weekend, Fox’s \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" opened at the top and was just one of six sequels to land in the top ten. Its 2005 predecessor tumbled 59% in its second weekend thanks to poor word-of-mouth and intense competition from newcomers \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Wedding Crashers\" which stole over $90M worth of ticket sales away from holdover pics. \"Silver Surfer\" has been greeted with marginally better responses and will not face as much competition from the incoming class this weekend, although \"Evan Almighty\" will be gunning for that PG-loving family crowd. A drop of 55% would give the new \"Fantastic Four\" saga around $25M for the frame and a ten-day cume of $103M.\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" will see some of its adult audience get pulled away by the weekend’s two new mature-skewing flicks. A 40% decline will leave the caper sequel with roughly $12M pushing the total to $91M after 17 days for Warner Bros. Universal’s comedy sensation \"Knocked Up\" will smash through the $100M mark this weekend, probably on Friday. Look for a 30% fall to around $10M boosting the cume to $108M.LAST YEAR: Adam Sandler scored his usual table at the top spot with his comedy \"Click\" which bowed to $40M for Sony on its way to $137.3M domestically and over $235M worldwide. The Disney/Pixar toon \"Cars\" dropped to the runnerup spot but dipped only 31% to $23.3M. Sophomores \"Nacho Libre\" and \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" were both hit hard and tumbled by more than 50% each to $12.7M and $9.8M, respectively. Focus launched the Tyrese Gibson actioner \"Waist Deep\" to a solid $9.4M from just over 1,000 theaters on its way to $21.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"adventure, Sematary, blockbuster, Month, blaxploitation, BBC, crossover, Disney, Paramount, Winners, diversity","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Evan-Shall-Lead-the-Way"},{"id":"47509152542763","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Chan and Tucker Back in Action","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Chan and Tucker Back in ActionDuo Tries to Recreate the Boxoffice Magic a Third Timeby Gitesh Pandya | August 9, 2007 |  CommentsAnother wide assortment of summer offerings will hit the multiplexes across North America this weekend. The action-comedy sequel Rush Hour 3 leads the way as the main course and will be joined by side dishes like the fantasy adventure Stardust, the family comedy Daddy Day Camp, and the horror flick Skinwalkers. The third mega-opening in a row should keep overall ticket sales abnormally high for this time of year.Six years and one week after the last installment opened, Rush Hour 3 hits theaters from coast to coast hoping to recapture the magic that made its two predecessors shatter industry expectations. Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, and director Brett Ratner have all reteamed (with some handsome raises) for a story about the world’s biggest organized crime syndicate whose secrets are hidden in Paris. The first Rush Hour smashed the September opening weekend box office record with a $33M launch in 1998. Rush Hour 2 set a new August opening record in 2001 with its $67.4M debut which it held until last weekend’s The Bourne Ultimatum arrived. Together, Carter and Lee have arrested $367M domestically and $575M worldwide with their pair of cross-cultural buddy cop hits.But a lot of time has passed since the last Rush Hour film and some fans may have lost interest in a formula that can easily get tired the third time around. The new pic should play mostly to existing fans and will not create too many new ones. Still, Rush Hour 3 does offer the most ethnic starpower of any film this summer so business from multicultural moviegoers should be very strong. Jason Bourne’s second weekend will provide ample competition for the action crowd, then again Rush Hour 2 had to deal with the second weekend of Planet of the Apes which opened the week before with a similarly potent $68.5M which at the time was the second biggest opening in history. So Chan and Tucker can handle the pressure. Expect those who like this dish to come back for a third helping for what should be the final big bow of the summer season. Crashing into more than 3,100 theaters, Rush Hour 3 could speed to about $61M this weekend.Chan and Tucker in familiar territory.The stars come out for Stardust, a new fantasy adventure boasting a cast that includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Robert De Niro, and Sienna Miller. The PG-13 pic should skew more to a female audience since males have more high-profile choices if they’re looking for action this weekend. Paramount has put a moderate amount of marketing support behind the film – an adequate amount for an August release. But with The Bourne Ultimatum and Rush Hour 3 absorbing roughly $90M in combined business from a broad audience, things will be tough for Stardust and for any other film for that matter. Debuting in about 2,300 locations, an opening weekend of around $11M could result.Stardust hopes to produce another form of green.The summer’s oddest couple entered theaters on Wednesday in Daddy Day Camp, a new family comedy starring Oscar-winner Cuba Gooding Jr. which is directed by The Wonder Years star Fred Savage. The PG-rated film is a followup to 2003’s Eddie Murphy hit Daddy Day Care which bowed to $27.6M on its way to a solid $104.3M for Sony. In a world where direct-to-DVD sequels get financed for just about any kids property, Camp seems like just that, only one which got lucky enough to get a theatrical release. Cuba is no Eddie when it comes to selling tickets. Sure, Snow Dogs grossed $81.2M in 2002, but Disney’s brand name and marketing machine were responsible for much of that success. Luckily for Sony there are not too many options for families right now so there is an opportunity, though a small one. Daddy Day Camp hit 2,184 theaters on Wednesday and could collect about $8M for the weekend and around $11M over five days.Perhaps Cuba is beginning to understand why Eddie didn’t return.Following in the footsteps of I Know Who Killed Me, Captivity, and Bug, the new horror flick Skinwalkers steps into the ring gunning for the title of worst fright flop of the summer. From Lionsgate and After Dark Films, the PG-13 pic has little marketing or distribution support and is only making a brief appearance at the marquees on its way to video store shelves. Debuting in just 650 theaters, an opening weekend of $1.5M seems likely.Skinwalkers!The Bourne Ultimatum made a big splash in its debut last weekend recording the largest August bow in history. However, it has been eroding during the week posting a solid $9.1M on Monday before dropping down to $7.5M on Tuesday. The large upfront turnout should lead to a sharp decline and Rush Hour 3‘s arrival will take away action fans too. Look for a 55% drop for the Matt Damon saga which would give Universal about $31M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $129M.Fox’s hit toon The Simpsons Movie, already the third highest grossing animated film of the year after the ogre threequel and the rodent comedy, should stabilize this weekend after its hefty sophomore slump of two-thirds. A 50% decline would give Homer and pals around $12.5M for the weekend and a 17-day total of $153M.LAST YEAR: Will Ferrell stayed put at number one with the hit comedy Talladega Nights despite a 53% drop to $22.1M in its second lap for Sony. Buena Vista raced past expectations with its teen sensation Step Up which bowed in the number two spot with a stellar $20.7M on its way to $65.3M.

There will be no encore.by Gitesh Pandya | August 5, 2007 |  CommentsMatt Damon set anew opening weekend record for the month of August with the top spot bow ofThe Bourne Ultimatum,the third installment in the actor’s signature spy series. The frame’s other newreleases saw more modest openings while most holdovers held up well. The wideassortment of popular hits allowed the North American box office to soar to thehighest grossing August weekend in history.Racing past expectations, Universal’sThe Bourne Ultimatumscored a spectacular opening grossing an estimated $70.2M in its first weekendin theaters. Infiltrating 3,660 locations, the PG-13 film averaged a muscular$19,175 per venue and beat out the $52.5M bow of its predecessorThe Bourne Supremacyby a healthy 34%. That action entry launched in July 2004 and went on to gross$176.1M. The new entry was also directed byPaul Greengrassand co-starred JuliaStiles and Joan Allen.The eye-popping debut set a new benchmark for the month of August edging outprevious record-holder Rush Hour 2 which bowed to $67.4M in 2001. That franchise’s next installmentRush Hour 3 plans toexact revenge when it opens this Friday gunning for the number one spot.Ultimatum also generated the second largest opening weekend in studio historyfor Universal trailing onlyThe LostWorld which collected $72.1M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion of itsholiday debut in May 1997 during what was then the biggest opening weekend ofall time.Matt Damon proved onceagain how popular and relevant his Jason Bourne character is to today’saudiences. Ultimatum also earned the best reviews of any action picture thisyear so even though it was the summer’s eleventh sequel and fifth threequel, thefilm still played out as an event picture for movie fans. The opening was evenbigger than any debut in the James Bond or Mission: Impossible franchises.Openings for last year’s newest chapters for those spy sagas were $47.7M for Mission:Impossible III in May and $40.8M for November’sCasino Royale.If the estimate holds for The Bourne Ultimatum, it will become the fourth filmin five weeks to open north of $70M following Transformers,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and The Simpsons Movie.The string of big hits set the July box office ablaze and has now spilled overinto the final month of summer which should continue the fireworks. Plus mostfilms have been holding up well over the last few weeks. Of the 37 holdovercases in the top ten during the last five weekends, only four have witnesseddeclines of more than 50%. By comparison, nine had such drops over the samefive-week period a year ago.Last weekend’s top film The Simpsons Moviewas the only pic in the top ten to take a big tumble dropping 65% in itssophomore weekend to finish in second place with an estimated $25.6M. That gavethe Fox blockbuster a robust total of $128.6M in only ten days of release. The$75M production might find its way to the neighborhood of $190M domestically.Overseas, Comic Book Guy and pals grossed another $47.3M shooting theinternational total to $187M from 75 territories for a sensational global grossof $315.5M and counting.Disney launched its canine pic Underdog in thirdplace with a respectable opening of $12M, according to estimates, from 3,013theaters. The PG-rated family film averaged a decent $3,986 per venue and triedto take advantage of a marketplace lacking choices for younger kids.Adam Sandler’slatest comedy INow Pronounce You Chuck and Larry dropped 45% in its third weekend to anestimated $10.5M for Universal. The musical Hairspray, also inits third frame, dipped 41% to an estimated $9.3M for New Line. Totals to datestand at $91.7M and $79.1M, respectively.The megablockbuster Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix grossed an estimated $9.3M,off 48%, boosting the total to $260.8M. That puts the fifth Hogwarts tale atnumber 37 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after 2004’s The Incredibleswhich banked $261.4M. Overseas, Phoenix posted an estimated $25.2M tolift the international tally to a towering $509.7M. With a worldwide gross of$771M, the latest wizard flick is now the third biggest global blockbuster of2007 after Pirates ofthe Caribbean: At World’s End ($952M) and Spider-Man 3($889M).The CatherineZeta-Jones drama No Reservationsfollowed in seventh place with an estimated $6.6M in its sophomore session. Downa reasonable 44%, the Warner Bros. release has cooked up $24.2M in ten days andlooks headed for a respectable $45M final.With a one-way ticket to the triple-century club, Transformerstook in an estimated $6M, down 49%, to lift its stellar cume to $296.3M. TheMichael Bay smash nowsits at number 26 on the all-time domestic list afterPirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which grossed $305.4Min 2003.For the second straight weekend, a pair of flops aimed at teens opened in thenumber nine and ten spots with averages of less than $3,000. Paramount’sAndy Sambergcomedy Hot Roddebuted to an estimated $5M from 2,607 theaters for a dismal $1,924 average.Lionsgate grossed an estimated $4.3M for its new preteen picBratz resultingin a mild $2,856 average from 1,509 playdates.Jennifer Lopez andMarc Anthonyteamed up for the biopic El Cantante whichdebuted well in a limited national bow with an estimated $3.3M from 542 theatersfor a solid $6,004 average. The Picturehouse release about the life of Salsapioneer Hector Lavoe earned lackluster reviews from critics. Receiving betternotices was the period drama Becoming Janewhich bowed in only 100 theaters to an estimated $1M for a strong $10,100average. Starring AnneHathaway as Jane Austen, the Miramax title expands to more markets in theweeks ahead.Four films fell from the top ten over the weekend. The animated comedy Ratatouille fromDisney and Pixar dropped by 46% in its sixth frame to an estimated $4M boostingthe cume to $188.3M. Though loved by critics, the rodent picture has not beenliving up to Pixar standards and should end its domestic run right around the$200M mark making it the company’s lowest-grossing hit since 1998’s A Bug’s Lifewhich took in $162.8M.Fox’s action sequelLive Free orDie Hard shot up an estimated $2.2M, tumbling 61%, and put its total at$130.2M. A domestic final of about $135M seems likely while the pic’s globalgross of $309M will continue to climb rapidly over the course of the summer.Also suffering sharp declines were the sophomores I Know WhoKilled Me and Who’s Your Caddy?which collected $1.2M and $1.1M, respectively. Lindsay Lohan’s latest box officeunderachiever crumbled 67% and has taken in just $6.2M in ten days with apathetic $8M final likely. The golf comedy fell 60% to a ten-day cume of only$4.8M and looks to end its run with a measly $7M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $158.8M which was up a solid 37% fromlast year when Talladega Nights opened at number one with $47M; and up a remarkable 62%from 2005 when The Dukes of Hazzard debuted in the top spot with $30.7M.Source: Box Office Guru","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Stephen, CW, drama, service, Nominations, Channel, Biopics, CBS, Shudder, Geographic, WarnerMedia","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Bourne-Beats-Bart-for-Box-Office-Crown"},{"id":"47509154204728","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Silver Surfer\" Sails into Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Silver Surfer\" Sails into Multiplexesby Gitesh Pandya | June 14, 2007 |  CommentsWith schools letting out for the summer, Hollywood rolls out a pair of PG-rated films hoping to attract kids to the multiplexes with some mindless fun.Fox unleashes \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" which looks to give the box office its seventh consecutive weekend ruled by a sequel. Warner Bros. counters the testosterone effects pic with its teen girl story \"Nancy Drew\" while The Weinstein Co. mixes the formulas by opening its all-female action flick \"DOA: Dead or Alive.\"Marvel super heroes look to top the charts for the third time this year with the new \"Fantastic Four\" film which reunites the main cast members of the first pic. That comic book actioner opened to a sturdy $56.1M in July 2005 and went on to gross $154.7M domestically and over $330M worldwide. Though panned by critics, it got the franchise going and Fox hopes to keep the cash registers ringing this summer. The studio aims to follow the same pattern it saw for its other Marvel ensemble series. 2000’s \"X-Men\" debuted to $54.5M and reached a $157.3M final with the 2003 and 2006 followups each grossing more and more.But \"Silver Surfer\" is different from \"X2: X-Men United\" which bowed to $85.6M. That mutant sequel earned strong reviews, followed a predecessor that was well-received, and opened at the beginning of May when there was no competition. The current sequel fatigue that has been hitting the box office could prevent \"Four\" from expanding beyond its core base. The studio gets credit for building the marketing campaign around the Silver Surfer character so it feels like it is offering something new. The milder PG rating could allow it to reach a broader audience, but many parents may not even notice as the ads make it look like all the other PG-13 comic pics. Cruising into over 3,800 theaters, \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" could take in around $53M this weekend.\"FF 2: ROTSS\"\"Nancy Drew\" hits the big screen with the teen sleuth from the popular mystery books moving to California to find herself in the middle of an unsolved case. The PG-rated film should see most of its business from the under-18 female set however since the property has been around for so long, it could bring in some older folks too. With Unfabulous star Emma Roberts as the title character, the Warner Bros. release offers little starpower beyond its core demographic. The studio will have to rely on the brand name and the current lack of films exciting girls. The turnout could be similar to what Warners saw two years ago in June 2005 with \"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\" which bowed to $9.8M over three days and $13.6M over its five-day launch. Opening in 2,612 theaters, \"Nancy Drew\" might debut with around $12M.\"Nancy Drew\"The videogame-inspired action film \"DOA: Dead or Alive\" gets a quiet release in 505 theaters on Friday. A babes-in-bikinis fight flick, the Weinstein Co. release is not being pushed too feverishly and will have little chance of drawing in business against the more high-profile action films out there now. With no major stars, the much-delayed PG-13 film might find itself with $1M or less this weekend.\"DOA: Dead Or Alive\"\"Ocean’s Thirteen\" was met with the smallest jackpot ever won by the franchise last weekend. \"Ocean’s Twelve\" fell by 53% in its second weekend in December 2004. The new installment should also see a steep drop given that it is the third time around and people are not exactly loving the pic. Warner Bros. could suffer a 55% decline and collect about $16M for a ten-day cume of $67M.\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" has been dropping by more than 50% each weekend and with the new \"Fantastic Four\" sequel arriving, this frame should be no different. Look for sales to get sliced in half and dip to about $11M pushing the domestic cume to $272M.A 30% drop could be in the works for \"Knocked Up\" which will not face much competition for adults. Look for a $14M weekend giving the Universal comedy $90M in 17 days.LAST YEAR: The Disney/Pixar collaboration \"Cars\" held onto the top spot for a second weekend with $33.7M for a reasonable drop of 44%. The Jack Black comedy \"Nacho Libre\" led the newcomers with an opening of $28.3M on its way to $80.2M for Paramount. \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\" followed in third with a $24M bow while \"The Lake House\" debuted in fourth with $13.6M. Final grosses reached $62.5M for Universal’s racing sequel and $52.3M for the Warner Bros. romance. Jennifer Aniston‘s \"The Break-Up\" ranked fifth with $9.8M in its third frame.

The Fox release collected an estimated $71.9M in its first weekend in theaters and averaged a spectacular $18,320 per site from 3,922 locations. The PG-13 comedy enjoyed the third largest debut ever for an animated film trailing only Shrek the Third and Shrek 2 which bowed to $121.6M and $108M, respectively.The Simpsons Movie delivered the fifth biggest July opening weekend ever after the megasequels Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest ($135.6M in 2006), Spider-Man 2 ($88.2M in 2004), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ($77.1M in 2007), and Austin Powers in Goldmember ($76.6M in 2002). It also ranks fifth among the biggest non-sequel opening weekends in history following Spider-Man ($114.8M in 2002), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone ($90.3M in 2001), The Passion of the Christ ($83.8M in 2004), and The Da Vinci Code ($77.1M in 2006). The magic number five is also where The Simpsons Movie stands in Fox’s company history behind the debuts of the last two installments in both the Star Wars and X-Men franchises.After building up an enormous fan base over the last 18 years, The Simpsons Movie was finally ready to capitalize on the popularity of the television series by jumping to the big screen and the audience certainly followed. Fox reported that the audience for the $75M production was solid in all four quadrants. Strong reviews from critics also helped the cause and probably encouraged many fans who have given up on watching the weekly series to return for the theatrical fun. The studio’s marketing department also deserves a gold medal for its unorthodox campaign which really commanded the attention of the public. From the contest between different towns named Springfield to host the premiere to the conversion of a dozen 7-11 stores into Kwik-E-Marts, the studio was able to generate massive amounts of excitement with creative new ideas.Dropping a notch from its top spot debut, Adam Sandler and Kevin James cuddled up in second place with the comedy I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry which fell 44% to an estimated $19.1M. The Sony release has laughed up a solid $71.6M in its first ten days and should find its way to the neighborhood of $125M. Chuck is performing much like Sandler’s 2002 summer comedy Mr. Deeds which bowed in late June to $37.2M, tallied $73.6M in ten days, and finished with $126.3M.Another former number one followed. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix dropped 48% to an estimated $17.1M in its third weekend and boosted its 19-day cume to $241.8M. Phoenix posted the smallest third-weekend gross of any Potter film to date, however a final domestic cume close to the $290M of the last installment Goblet of Fire still seems possible.The hot musical Hairspray posted a decent hold in its second weekend dropping 43% to an estimated $15.6M for New Line. The ensemble pic featuring John Travolta and Queen Latifah watched its total soar to $59.3M after only ten days which already makes it the studio’s top grossing film in two years. The PG-rated entry looks to pass the $103.3M of last winter’s Dreamgirls and may reach about $110M.Catherine Zeta-Jones headlined the new romantic dramedy No Reservations and found moderate success with an estimated opening of $11.8M. The Warner Bros. release debuted in 2,425 locations as an alternative choice for adult women and averaged a good $4,849. Aaron Eckhart and Abigail Breslin co-star in the story of a chef whose life changes after her sister’s death leaves the woman to care for her niece. Reviews were mixed.The action smash Transformers placed sixth in its fourth weekend with an estimated $11.5M. Down 44%, the Paramount/DreamWorks co-production boosted its cume to $284.6M putting it at number 31 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after The Matrix Reloaded which grossed $281.5M in 2003. Transformers is now the third biggest hit ever for Paramount after Titanic ($600.8M) and Forrest Gump ($329.7M) and also the third largest in DreamWorks history trailing the last two Shrek installments.In their fifth weekends, Disney’s Ratatouille and Fox’s Live Free or Die Hard held up well grossing estimates of $7.2M and $5.4M, respectively. The Pixar toon dipped 34% and has banked $179.7M to date while the Bruce Willis sequel slipped only 25% pushing the cume to $125.1M. The new John McClane adventure is the actor’s highest grossing live-action film since 1999’s The Sixth Sense.Two new flops rounded out the top ten. Sony’s Lindsay Lohan horror flick I Know Who Killed Me bowed to an estimated $3.4M from 1,320 theaters for a weak $2,576 average. The R-rated torture pic was never tracking well and its star’s recent arrests put the nail in the coffin for the film’s release. MGM opened the golf comedy Who’s Your Caddy? with an estimated $2.9M averaging only $2,846 from 1,019 sites.Four films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The Warner Bros. romantic comedy License to Wed tumbled 64% to an estimated $1.3M lifting its cume to $41.7M. A mediocre $44M final should result for the Robin Williams pic. Rival comedy Knocked Up has been one of the year’s top comedy performers and fell 48% to an estimated $1.2M giving Universal a superb $145.1M to date. The low-cost $30M production should finish its domestic run with just under $150M.Horror hit 1408 dropped 54% to an estimated $1.2M giving MGM $70M thus far. As the year’s second biggest fright flick after Disturbia, the John Cusack film should reach about $73M.The Steve Carell epic comedy Evan Almighty grossed an estimated $1.1M, down 57%, pushing the tally to $96.3M. Produced for $175M, the PG-rated pic will have to work hard with second-run business in order to crack the $100M mark for Universal. It will also have to soar internationally and on video if it wants reach break-even.A handful of films expanded into wider release this weekend. MGM’s military drama Rescue Dawn grossed an estimated $1.7M from 500 locations for a $3,304 average and $3M cume. The sci-fi thriller Sunshine grossed an estimated $1.3M for Fox Searchlight resulting in a $2,750 average and a total of $1.6M. The Don Cheadle film Talk To Me averaged $6,986 from 115 playdates for a weekend estimate of $803,000. Total sits at $1.9M for Focus.The top ten films grossed an estimated $165.7M which was up a potent 52% from last year when Miami Vice opened at number one with $25.7M; and up 58% from 2005 when Wedding Crashers rose to the top spot for the first time with $20M in its third frame.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"streaming, elm, Arts, show, psycho, Reality","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-The-Simpsons-Movie-Gobbles-Up-72M-Opening"},{"id":"47509154224191","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Mighty \"Shrek\" Returns To Claim Crown","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Mighty \"Shrek\" Returns To Claim Crownby Gitesh Pandya | May 17, 2007 |  CommentsAttacking theaters on the same May 18 date as the original ogre toon from six years ago, \"Shrek the Third\" stomps into the marketplace this weekend ready to seize the box office crown.No other studio dared to challenge this mid-May event film which has much of the scene all to itself. Add in the third weekend of \"Spider-Man 3\" and multiplexes will surely be active with ticket sales ready to surge from last weekend’s levels.Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and Antonio Banderas all return to lend their voices to \"Third\" and are joined by old and new faces like John Cleese, Julie Andrews, Eric Idle, Rupert Everett, and Justin Timberlake. In the new PG-rated film, the not-so-jolly green giant embarks on a quest to find himself a replacement to become the heir to the throne of Far Far Away and finds all sorts of comedic misadventures along the way.The first two \"Shrek\" pics also opened on the weekend before the lucrative Memorial Day holiday frame and went on to show terrific legs. \"Shrek 2\" bowed on a Wednesday and grossed a whopping $108M over its three-day period on its way to becoming the number three domestic blockbuster of all-time with $436.7M. It was so well-loved and interest in a new chapter began almost immediately with moviegoers of all ages. With its blend of colorful and zany antics for kids plus sophisticated humor for adults, the franchise has been able to stomp on all its animated competitors to become king of the toons. In fact the next biggest openings in history for animated films are claimed by \"The Incredibles,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" which all launched in the $68-71M range.In the much-talked-about ‘Battle of the Threes’ this month, each tentpole is trying to outdo the previous one and is slipping itself into theaters a couple of hours earlier each time. \"Spider-Man 3\" launched like most blockbusters do with Thursday night midnight shows, but \"Shrek the Third\" is offering its night-before showtimess at 10pm while next week \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" will take it one step further on the plank by starting its first showings at 8pm on Thursday evening. Though uncommon, the practice has been seen before. Night-before showtimes for previous summer tentpoles included 10pm for 2003’s \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" 10pm for 1997’s \"The Lost World,\" and even 6pm for 1996’s \"Independence Day\" which practically gave it a whole new opening day.With 4,122 theaters this weekend, \"Shrek\" should be able to dominate the marketplace with ease especially since the only real threat, \"Spider-Man 3,\" is fading fast and summer movie fans are looking for something else to eat popcorn in front of. Competition should actually be less for \"Third\" than for its predecessor. The second chapter faced $53.8M from the rest of the top ten on its debut frame. This weekend, even with higher ticket prices, that figure will be hard to reach since most of the top ten will consist of feeble grosses. That gives \"Third\" a nice environment to enter, even if trailers and commercials are not as funny this time around.Reviews have been weaker than last time and repeat business over the long-term should not be as strong for Paramount which hardly has its name anywhere on the new product. Its subsidiary DreamWorks still has its brand name everywhere on the film. Regardless, the marketing has been as powerful as ever with McDonalds coming on board as a promotional partner after years of being in bed with Disney exclusively. Comedies do so well at the box office and business should come from the family audience as well as from teens and young adults looking for fun weekend entertainment. Hoping to set a new benchmark for animated openings, \"Shrek the Third\" could haul in about $115M from Thursday night through Sunday.Will the \"Third\" time charm?Peter Parker busted onto the scene with a record-shattering opening weekend two weeks ago, but gravity has kicked in since. The second weekend drop of 62% showed that the film absorbed much of its potential upfront and that repeat business isn’t really a factor. This week, Monday sales were only $3.6M (down 65% from last Monday) while Tuesday stood at $3.5M (off 57%). With \"Shrek\" stepping in to steal away all the attention, \"Spider-Man 3\" is sure to suffer another large decline. Some multiplexes will open up those fifth and sixth Spidey screens and turn them into ogre auditoriums. Still, as the studio knew a year ago when tentpole release dates were set, a silver medal is guaranteed this weekend. \"Spider-Man 3\" may fall by more than 50% to about $27M and boost its 17-day cume to an impressive $280M.Sophomores \"28 Weeks Later\" and \"Georgia Rule\" will get bumped down a notch this weekend. Like for all horror sequels, a second weekend drop of less than 50% would be shocking for the Fox zombie pic. A 55% tumble for \"Weeks\" would put it at $5M pushing the ten-day tally to a modest $18M. Universal’s multi-generational dramedy is playing to older women who do not exactly rush out on opening weekend so a smaller decline will result. \"Georgia Rule\" could dip by 40% to around $4M giving the Jane Fonda flop only $13M in ten days.LAST YEAR: Sony shot to the top of the charts with the global launch of \"The Da Vinci Code\" which seized control of the number one spot with a massive $77.1M bow. The Tom Hanks smash went on to gross $217.5M domestically and a colossal $753M worldwide. Paramount debuted its DreamWorks toon \"Over the Hedge\" in the runnerup spot with $38.5M and went on to collect $155M from North America and $330M globally. Rounding out the top five were \"Mission: Impossible III\" with $11.3M, \"Poseidon\" with $9.2M, and \"RV\" with $5M. Lionsgate offered horror audiences \"See No Evil\" and was met with $4.6M on its way to a weak $15M total.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"El, rotten, comiccon, TV, Dates, political","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Mighty-Shrek-Returns-To-Claim-Crown"},{"id":"47509154227264","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Spidey Rules, Fonda Flops","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Spidey Rules, Fonda Flopsby Gitesh Pandya | May 13, 2007 |  CommentsPeter Parker suffered a massive sophomore slide, but \"Spider-Man 3\" still dominated the box office around the globe spending a second weekend at number one with no other film coming anywhere near its stellar numbers.Among the frame’s four new releases, the zombie thriller \"28 Weeks Later\" fared best with a decent bow in the runnerup spot while the Jane Fonda–Lindsay Lohan pic \"Georgia Rule\" was mostly ignored and opened with disastrous results. Two other new comedies \"Delta Farce\" and \"The Ex\" barely registered a blip on the radar.Sony was still crushing its competitors this weekend with \"Spider-Man 3\" which tumbled 60% to an estimated $60M in its second try in theaters. After ten days, the PG-13 hit has amassed a stunning $242.1M from North America and is still running ahead of its two predecessors. Ten-day cumes for 2002’s \"Spider-Man\" and 2004’s \"Spider-Man 2\" were $223M and $225M, respectively. However the new Venom installment is eroding faster as is often the case with the third part of a franchise. After the first three days, \"Spider-Man 3\" was an impressive 32% ahead of the first webslinger pic which opened on the exact same weekend in 2002. After seven days the lead was cut to 20% and now after ten days the gap has been reduced to 9%.For the weekend, \"Spider-Man 3\" accounted for a stellar 64% of the box office for the top ten and grossed $17.1M on Friday (down 72% from its record-shattering opening day last week), $25M on Saturday (down 51% from last Saturday), and is projected to gross $18M on Sunday (down 55% from a week ago). The 60% second weekend drop is not uncommon for high-profile tentpole sequels with mammoth debuts. Some other sophomore drops include 53% for \"X2: X-Men United,\" 54% for \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest,\" 63% for \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,\" and 67% for \"X-Men: The Last Stand.\"Where is part 3 headed in the long run? It would make sense to look at other action films that kicked off the summer movie season on the first weekend of May. The shares of the total cume collected in the first ten days were 64% for last year’s \"Mission: Impossible III,\" 69% for 2003’s \"X2,\" and 71% for 2004’s \"Van Helsing.\" Based on its trajectory and the competitive road ahead, \"Spider-Man 3\" could be headed for a finish of about $340-360M domestically. That would make it the lowest-grossing Spidey film in North America, however the overseas markets are a different story.\"Spider-Man 3\" grossed an estimated $85.4M internationally this weekend to boost its overseas haul up to a mammoth $379.6M for a colossal global gross of $622M. Next weekend, the Sandman entry will surpass the international takes of $418M and $410M for the first two Spider-Man flicks to become the top performer of the franchise outside of North America. With the \"Spider-Man\" fan base already maxed out domestically, Sony made a strategic move to grow the brand around the world by hosting several star-studded international red carpet premieres and opening the film in most countries days ahead of the United States leading to a substantial increase in moviegoer excitement in all markets. \"Spider-Man 3\" still stands a very good chance of becoming the biggest grossing film of the trilogy on a global scale with the North American shortfall being overshadowed by gains overseas. With a reported production budget of $258M, the super hero film should surpass the $900M mark worldwide this summer.Flesh-eating zombies took control of second place this weekend as the horror sequel \"28 Weeks Later\" opened with an estimated $10M representing a solid, but somewhat weaker-than-expected debut. The R-rated gorefest averaged a decent $4,342 from 2,303 playdates and delivered a gross almost equal to the $10.1M that \"28 Days Later\" achieved in its opening frame in June 2003. That sleeper hit bowed in a thousand fewer locations with 1,260 theaters and scored a more potent $7,986 average. Adjust for four years of ticket price increases and \"Weeks\" generated an opening weekend average half that of \"Days.\" The new chapter earned very high praise from most critics, but being the fourteenth horror film of 2007 probably hurt its cause as many genre fans have overdosed on frightfests. If the estimate holds (Fox estimated a rather slim 26% Saturday-to-Sunday drop), \"Weeks\" will become the first non-Spidey film to reach double digits on opening weekend since \"Fracture\" from mid-April.The star-driven chick flick \"Georgia Rule\" was dead on arrival at the box office debuting to an estimated $5.9M from 2,523 theaters for a flimsy $2,330 average. The R-rated film stars Lindsay Lohan as a rebellious teen left with her no-nonsense grandmother (Jane Fonda) for the summer. Felicity Huffman plays the alcoholic middle mom in the family. \"Georgia\" played more to the Fonda crowd than to the Lohan audience. Studio research from Universal showed that a whopping 81% of the turnout was female, 79% was white, and 70% was over the age of 30.\"Georgia Rule\" imploded at the box office since it repelled its two main consumer groups. Older women pay attention to reviews and critics were brutal in reviewing the dramedy. And younger teen girls who track Lohan obsessively couldn’t get in thanks to the harsh R rating. The opening was less than half the amount that the studio saw earlier this year when it targeted the same audience with the same number of theaters with the Diane Keaton–Mandy Moore pic \"Becasue I Said So\" which bowed to $13.1M over Super Bowl weekend. The Fonda flick was released over the Mother’s Day frame, but most daughters chose to give their moms the gift of not seeing \"Georgia Rule.\"Paramount’s hit teen thriller \"Disturbia\" enjoyed the best legs in the top ten dipping only 18% to an estimated $4.8M. Although in its fifth weekend, the Shia LaBeouf hit has the second largest theater count of any film and is playing in 3,106 locations that are still holding onto the durable thriller. Cume to date is $66.3M.The military comedy \"Delta Farce\" bombed in its opening weekend grossing only $3.5M, according to estimates, landing in fifth place. The PG-13 pic averaged a dismal $1,813 from 1,931 locations for Lionsgate. Reviews were understandably pitiful.New Line’s Anthony Hopkins–Ryan Gosling drama \"Fracture\" dipped only 22% to an estimated $2.9M in its fourth frame and upped its cume to $31M. The horror flick \"The Invisible\" dropped to seventh with an estimated $2.2M, down 33%, for a $15.5M total.Sliding only 25% in its third round was the action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" with an estimated $1.7M for Focus putting the sum at $18.9M. Nicolas Cage followed with his sci-fi flop \"Next\" which took in an estimated $1.6M, down 45%, for a total of $14.6M. Rounding out the top ten with an estimated $1.6M as well was the Disney animated hit \"Meet the Robinsons\" which fell 39% for a sturdy $94.1M cume. The 3D comedy will enjoy its status as the year’s top-grossing toon for just one more week since \"Shrek the Third,\" which opens on Friday, could march past it after only one weekend in theaters.Debuting with miserable results outside of the top ten was the Zach Braff–Amanda Peet comedy \"The Ex\" which opened to an estimated $1.3M from 1,009 locations for a pathetic $1,288 average. The PG-13 date flick was released by MGM and earned poor reviews. With \"The Ex,\" Hollywood has now seen a disturbing twelve wide releases over the last eight weeks fail to open to at least $5M. Numerous movies with little to offer paying moviegoers are being slaughtered in an overcrowded marketplace.Three star-driven vehicles dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Will Ferrell’s blockbuster comedy \"Blades of Glory\" grossed an estimated $1.4M in its seventh lap and boosted its cume to $113.8M. Off 41%, the $60M-plus DreamWorks/Paramount pic looks to skate to a $116-118M finish. Ice Cube’s comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" fell 46% to an estimated $950,000 giving Sony $47.4M to date. The family film looks to end with just under $50M putting it 40% behind its predecessor \"Are We There Yet?\" which pulled in $82.3M two years ago. Warner Bros. has collected a measly $5M in ten days for its Eric Bana–Drew Barrymore poker pic \"Lucky You\" and will probably fold with an embarrassing $7M.Arthouse darling \"Waitress\" starring Keri Russell expanded successfully in its second weekend serving up an estimated $636,000 from 65 sites for a solid $9,788 average. Fox Searchlight widened the acclaimed film from just four locations last weekend and pushed its cume to $788,000. A special Mother’s Day gift bag promotion across the country is expected to strengthen Sunday sales. This Friday, the comedy expands in its existing markets adding 57 theaters and on May 25 it will widen to 400-500 total theaters nationwide for the Memorial Day holiday weekend.The top ten films grossed an estimated $94.1M which was up 16% from last year when \"Mission: Impossible III\" stayed at number one with $25M; and up a scant 3% from 2005 when \"Monster-in-Law\" debuted on top with just $23.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"ITV, Arts, cats, thriller","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Spidey-Rules-Fonda-Flops"},{"id":"47509154208826","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Lucky \"13\" Hopes for Full Houses","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Lucky \"13\" Hopes for Full Housesby Gitesh Pandya | June 7, 2007 |  CommentsThe stars come marching out to do battle with the pirates for the number one spot this weekend.For the sixth consecutive weekend, a threequel is poised to command the top spot at the North American box office as Warner Bros. rolls out the caper pic \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" reuniting Hollywood’s fun boys. Sony counters with the family offering \"Surf’s Up\" while Lionsgate goes after the horror crowd with \"Hostel Part II.\" Each film should target its own audience so there should be space for all newcomers.George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and their endless list of co-stars are back again as everyone’s favorite criminals in \"Ocean’s Thirteen.\" The PG-13 pic finds the group back in Las Vegas on a heist driven by revenge against a real estate mogul, played by Al Pacino, who is launching his latest luxury hotel/casino. The first two in the series had December openings of $38.1M for 2001’s \"Ocean’s Eleven\" and $39.2M for 2004’s \"Ocean’s Twelve.\" They also had little direct competition for adults. Although they opened in the same fashion, the sequel was not as well-liked and found its way to $125.5M, or about one-third less than the $183.4M cume of the original which itself was a remake.\"Thirteen\" should play to the exact same audience of mature adults. Appeal is equally strong for males and females and even some teen interest should be there. Reviews have been generally positive but that should have little impact. Moviegoers know exactly what they are getting the third time around and will decide based on if they want to take another two-hour trip seeing slick actors, with slick hair, and slick clothes, acting cool. Those soured by \"Twelve\" may take a pass on \"Thirteen.\" Plus \"Pirates\" and \"Knocked Up\" will provide some solid competition. But the sheer amount of starpower should make this entry hard to resist to many looking for a fun mature film without pirates, super heroes, and endless special effects. \"Ocean’s Thirteen\" rolls the dice in 3,565 locations this weekend and might win about $37M over three days.Nerds!For those kids who can’t get enough of talking cartoon penguins, Sony unleashes its big summer animation entry \"Surf’s Up.\" Delivered in a mockumentary style, the PG-rated film tells the story of penguins that compete in a surfing competition, and of course crack jokes along the way. Arriving just three weeks after \"Shrek the Third,\" \"Surf’s Up\" will have to deal with competition from the ogre toon and to some extent the other aging threequels which combined should gross north of $40M this weekend. The new penguin pic does not have the buzz or the starpower of a Robin Williams that helped \"Happy Feet\" shoot to number one last November with a $41.5M bow on its way to a terrific $198M.Instead, \"Surf’s Up\" seems to be in the same middle category with recent films like \"Open Season\" and \"Meet the Robinsons\" which opened to $23.6M and $25.1M, respectively. With children in the process of ending their school years and starting their summer vacations, parents should be in the mood to take them to the movies for some non-violent fun. \"Surf’s Up\" lands in over 3,000 theaters on Friday and could debut with about $24M.\"Surf’s Up,\" aka \"March of the Happy Feet.\"Yet another horror sequel makes its way into theaters with Lionsgate’s \"Hostel Part II.\" The first \"Hostel\" was a number one hit last year opening to $19.6M on its way to an impressive $47.3M off of a tiny budget. The new R-rated entry finds three American students in Rome who find themselves caught in a grisly game of torture and mayhem. Horror fans have been suffering from fright fatigue lately. The recent sequels \"The Hills Have Eyes II\" and \"28 Weeks Later\" both opened to just under $10M failing to match the bows of their predecessors. Other horror flicks like \"Bug,\" \"The Condemned,\" \"The Reaping,\" and \"Vacancy\" all underperformed over the last several weeks and have helped to scare fans away from the genre.But Lionsgate is among the best at selling this type of fare to older teens and young adults and the distributor is hoping to tap into a built-in audience. Just as with the first one, Quentin Tarantino whores his name out again with a ‘presents’ credit on the marketing materials. It would be interesting to know what kind of compensation, monetary or otherwise, he gets for these transactions. Locking up ticket buyers in 2,350 theaters, \"Hostel Part II\" may open with around $12M.\"Hostel: Part II,\" sure to warm the hearts of all.Following its two frames at number one, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End\" should give up the top spot this weekend, although the runnerup slot is not necessarily a guarantee. The pricey Disney adventure fell by 62% last weekend and could see its drop dip to 50% this time. That would give Johnny Depp and his buddies about $22M for the session and $254M overall.Last weekend’s number two flick \"Knocked Up\" raced past \"At World’s End\" to claim the number one spot on Monday and Tuesday thanks to great buzz and is prepared to see a solid hold this time around. Two summers ago, the R-rated comedies \"Wedding Crashers\" and \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" both dipped by only 24% in their sophomore frames thanks to stellar word-of-mouth and no major competition from new releases. \"Knocked Up\" has the same great satisfaction from moviegoers, but will see much of its adult audience get tempted away by Brad and company. A 30% drop would still give it a great hold with about $21M for the frame. That would push the cume to a stunning $68M in only ten days.\"Shrek the Third\" will face direct competition from rival toon \"Surf’s Up\" this weekend. That could lead to a 40% decline to roughly $17M boosting the cume to $282M.LAST YEAR: Disney and Pixar joined forces for the number one opening of \"Cars\" which cruised into the top spot with $60.1M. The animated comedy raced to $244.1M domestically becoming the summer’s biggest non-Captain Jack flick, and over $462M worldwide. Universal’s comedy \"The Break-Up\" fell 48% in its second date grossing $20.3M and was followed by \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" with $16.1M. The horror remake \"The Omen\" bowed to $16M over the weekend and a creepy $36.3M over six days since its Tuesday launch on 6/6/06. Fox scared up $54.6M eventually. \"The Da Vinci Code\" rounded out the top five with $10.4M in its fourth lap. Debuting to solid results in a moderate launch was \"A Prairie Home Companion\" with $4.6M from 760 locations for a $6,008 average. The Picturehouse release found its way to $20.3M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"to, on, TV, thriller, New","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Lucky-13-Hopes-for-Full-Houses"},{"id":"47509155654727","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Vacancy\" Hopes for Full Occupancy","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Vacancy\" Hopes for Full Occupancyby Gitesh Pandya | April 19, 2007 |  CommentsAnother week, another horror film. That’s the mantra in Hollywood at the moment. Among the four new films going into wide release this weekend are Sony’s terror tale \"Vacancy\" which represents the fourth scary flick in three weeks to hit the multiplexes.Also debuting are New Line’s murder drama \"Fracture,\" the Warner Bros. romantic drama \"In the Land of Women,\" and the British action comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" all looking to help moviegoers kill some time as they await the return of the webslinger.Sony offers a new batch of frights in its latest horror pic \"Vacancy\" starring Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale as a couple stranded at a dirty motel where occupants are filmed while being brutally killed. The studio is making the right move by selling the R-rated film on concept first, and starpower second. The marketing has been creepy and effective plus the plot is different and appealing. Horror fans are likely to take interest. But moviegoers have been bombarded with scary movies so much in recent weeks that you’d think it was October. Plus the harsh rating will keep out some of the younger teens who may want in on this action. Also a wildcard will be this week’s massacre at Virginia Tech as college students may not be in the mood at this moment for a movie about senseless killings.Most of the business will depend on marketing and the campaign has been solid. It is very difficult nowadays to set your horror flick apart from all the other ones but \"Vacancy\" has done it right. Competition from \"Disturbia\" will be a factor, but older teens and young adults who like a good scare should line up in decent spring-like numbers. \"Vacancy\" opens in 2,551 theaters on Friday and could pull in around $14M over three days.Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson are forced to snoop in \"Vacancy.\"Recent Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling plays an assistant district attorney prosecuting a man who murdered his wife, played by Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins, in the new courtroom thriller \"Fracture.\" The New Line release will play to a mature adult audience which puts it in a strong position given all the films targeting teens and young adults at the moment. Both actors are well-respected, however they are not necessarily box office powers. Hopkins has done well when he’s playing a cannibal, but otherwise his track record is spotty when anchoring a film with no other major commercial draws. Reviews have been somewhat positive which could help a tad. \"Fracture\" debuts in about 2,400 theaters and may collect roughly $12M over the frame.Ryan Gosling wishes there was a time limit in \"Fracture.\"Warner Bros. goes after the ladies with the weekend’s only PG-13 entry \"In the Land of Women.\" Written and directed by actor-turned-filmmaker Jonathan Kasdan, the romantic drama stars \"The O.C.\"’s Adam Brody along with Meg Ryan and Olympia Dukakis in the story of a young man who learns the complexities of the other sex while caring for his ailing granny. Male appeal will be close to zero. That means that \"Disturbia,\" which is playing very well with teenage girls, will be a major competitor here. Aside from that, there aren’t too many direct threats however the overall marketing push has not been very loud on \"Women.\" Landing in 2,155 theaters, \"In the Land of Women\" might capture about $8M for the weekend.An Adam Brody sandwich, courtesy of \"In the Land of Women.\"The creative team behind 2004’s cult hit \"Shaun of the Dead\" is back with its take on cop buddy flicks with \"Hot Fuzz.\" The R-rated action comedy finds an overachieving London cop being transferred to a seemingly peaceful countryside village before stumbling upon a series of mysterious killings. Young men will make up the core audience. But through video and cable, \"Shaun\" has built up a loyal fan following which is likely to give this new entry a try. Add in positive buzz from its blockbuster release in the U.K. earlier this year (it’s already grossed $48M outside of North America) plus glowing reviews from U.S. critics and it is sure to pack a punch in the per-theater average race. Holding it back will be the moderate wide release in 825 locations. In 2004, \"Shaun\" debuted in 607 sites and grossed $3.3M for a solid $5,487 average. \"Hot Fuzz\" should be hotter and could arrest about $6M this weekend.The dandy \"Shaun of the Dead\" gang is back in \"Hot Fuzz.\"Following its surprisingly potent number one opening, Shia LaBeouf‘s thriller \"Disturbia\" will face some hefty competition from \"Vacancy\" which also goes after those seeking a scary flick. A 45% drop could be in order giving the Paramount title around $12M for the frame and a ten-day tally of $39M.Will Ferrell‘s hit comedy \"Blades of Glory\" looks set to break through the $100M mark this weekend. A 35% decline would give the Paramount release about $9M for the frame and $102M after 24 days. Disney’s animated film \"Meet the Robinsons\" has been holding up very well and with another weekend of mostly R-rated new entries, look for another slim dip. The 3D toon might slide by just 25% to roughly $9M boosting the cume to $84M. An invitation to the century club is in the mail.LAST YEAR: Spooky flick \"Silent Hill\" topped the charts opening to a strong $20.2M on its way to $47M for Sony. The Weinstein Company’s spoof hit \"Scary Movie 4\" tumbled 58% in its second weekend to $16.8M for the runnerup spot. Debuting in third was the Michael Douglas actioner \"The Sentinel\" with $14.4M before finishing with $36.3M for Fox. The studio’s toon sequel \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" followed with $13.3M in its fourth frame while competing animated entry \"The Wild\" rounded out the top five with $8.3M. The weekend’s other new release, the Hugh Grant comedy \"American Dreamz,\" bowed poorly in ninth with $3.7M on its way to just $7.2M for Universal.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"talk, Pacific, in, series, twilight","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Vacancy-Hopes-for-Full-Occupancy"},{"id":"47509155652678","title":"Box Office Wrapup: New Films No Match For Scary Shia","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: New Films No Match For Scary Shiaby Gitesh Pandya | April 22, 2007 |  CommentsIn the battle of the single-word-titled thrillers, \"Fracture\" beat out \"Vacancy\" but neither could dislodge \"Disturbia\" from the number one spot this weeend. It was mostly a sluggish frame at the North American box office as the top ten slumped to its third worst level of 2007.The courtroom thriller \"Fracture\" and the action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" both opened to respectable results while the horror pic \"Vacancy\" and the drama \"In the Land of Women\" generated little excitement.Shia LaBeouf enjoyed his first back-to-back stint in the top spot with the suspense hit \"Disturbia\" which held up well in its sophomore frame grossing an estimated $13.5M. Off only 39%, the Paramount release of a DreamWorks production averaged a solid $4,464 from 3,015 sites. Teen-oriented thrillers typically fall by more than 50% on the second session. Produced for a mere $23M, \"Disturbia\" has grossed an impressive $40.7M in its first ten days and could be headed for a $65-70M finish.Leading the weekend’s crop of new movies was the murder thriller \"Fracture\" as ticket buyers spent an estimated $11.2M watching Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling go at it. The R-rated film from New Line averaged a solid $4,574 per theater from 2,443 sites. Reviews were mostly good which helped since the film skewed to a mature adult audience.Will Ferrell scored the third $100M blockbuster of his career, and second in nine months, with \"Blades of Glory\" which ranked third in its fourth weekend with an estimated $7.8M. Down 44%, the Paramount title is still the widest release in the marketplace with 3,459 locations and the cume has hit $101.1M. The comedy star’s other trips to the century club in a lead role were with 2003’s \"Elf\" ($173.4M) and last summer’s \"Talladega Nights\" ($148M).Opening weaker than expected in the fourth slot was the horror entry \"Vacancy\" with only $7.6M, according to estimates. The R-rated pic about a couple stranded in a motel where videotaped killings take place averaged a mild $2,979 from 2,551 playdates. Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale star in the Sony release. Fright fatigue may have hurt \"Vacancy\"’s opening as the $19M-budgeted film was the fourth scary flick this month to be aimed at moviegoers. Young adults made up most of the audience as studio research showed that 66% of the crowd was under the age of 25 and 52% was female. \"Disturbia\"’s better-than-expected hold also made an impact.Disney followed in fifth with the animated hit \"Meet the Robinsons\" which grossed an estimated $7.1M in its fourth frame, down 43%, for a total of $82.2M.Shooting up the best average among all wide releases in the marketplace was the new British action-comedy \"Hot Fuzz\" which premiered to an estimated $5.8M from 825 theaters for a potent $7,075 per venue. The R-rated buddy cop flick from the creative team behind 2004’s cult hit \"Shaun of the Dead\" earned glowing reviews and tapped into a built-in audience of fans. \"Fuzz\" outgunned \"Shaun\" in all ways beating the latter’s September 2004 bow which delivered $3.3M from 607 theaters for a $5,487 average. Produced for $16M, \"Hot Fuzz\" has already grossed an impressive $48.5M overseas including $41M from the United Kingdom.The Ice Cube comedy sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" dropped two spots to seventh with an estimated $5.2M in its third weekend. Sony’s family pic fell 42% and raised its sum to $39.6M.Close behind in eighth was the new chick flick \"In the Land of Women\" which opened poorly with an estimated $4.9M from 2,155 theaters. Averaging a weak $2,281 per location, the PG-13 film stars Adam Brody as a young man who meets a houseful of women when caring for his sick grandmother. \"Women\" was the fifth wide opener of the past two weeks to fail to reach a $3,000 average in its debut frame.Rounding out the top ten were two films that that have been showing how differently starpower can affect the box office. The Halle Berry–Bruce Willis thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" collapsed in its second weekend and tumbled 63% to an estimated $4.1M. With only $18.1M locked up in ten days, Sony should find its way to roughly $25M followed by a quick trip to DVD. On the other hand, Buena Vista’s blockbuster comedy \"Wild Hogs\" starring Tim Allen and John Travolta remained in the top ten for the eighth consecutive weekend with an estimated $2.9M, off 39%, boosting the cume to $156.2M. It is the highest-grossing non-Spartan film of the year.Four films fell out of the top ten this weekend. The year’s biggest smash \"300\" dropped 49% to an estimated $2.3M in its seventh adventure and lifted its staggering domestic total to $204.7M. Budgeted at only $60M, the stylish war epic should end its North American run with an amazing $207-210M. That would amount to nearly three times its opening weekend gross which is rare these days for effects-driven action films that debut with monster bows. \"300\"’s legs have been strong overseas too where it has tallied $216.8M for a mammoth global gross of $421M and counting.Other R-rated films suffered horrendous drops as they tumbled out of the top ten. Losing two-thirds of its audience was Fox’s adventure \"Pathfinder\" which grossed an estimated $1.7M in its second weekend. The Viking pic has collected a puny $8M in ten days and looks headed for a wimpy $10M finish. Maybe casting some Spartans would have helped.Hilary Swank’s horrorfest \"The Reaping\" grossed an estimated $1.6M, down 65%, boosting the mild cume to $22.7M. The $53M double feature \"Grindhouse\" crashed 68% in its third try and took in an estimated $1.4M putting its 17-day take at $22.7M as well. Both films should end up in the $25M vicinity.Miramax expanded its Richard Gere drama \"The Hoax\" from 413 to 1,069 theaters but saw weekend sales slip 11% to an estimated $1.3M. The average was diluted down to a poor $1,216 as the cume inched up to only $5.1M.In limited release, Paramount Vantage widened its Molly Shannon pic \"Year of the Dog\" from seven to 33 sites and grossed an estimated $139,000 for a $4,200 average. Cume sits at $280,000 with more cities being added this Friday. Fox Searchlight’s \"The Namesake\" collected an estimated $765,000 from 327 locations in its seventh weekend averaging $2,339 for a cume of $9.8M to date.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.1M which was down an unsettling 26% from last year when \"Silent Hill\" opened at number one with $20.2M; and off 10% from 2005 when \"The Interpreter\" debuted on top with $22.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"history, Prime, romantic, Netflix, John","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-New-Films-No-Match-For-Scary-Shia"},{"id":"47509155657801","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Perfect Stranger\" Heads A Crowded Field","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Perfect Stranger\" Heads A Crowded Fieldby RT Staff | April 12, 2007 |  CommentsThis weekend Hollywood just doesn’t know its limits. Six new releases will jam into an already crowded marketplace on Friday trying to connect with spring moviegoers.That makes for a whopping 20 new films over a four-week ultracompetitive period. This weekend’s ticket buyers will not have enough time or money to see them all, especially in a relatively weak playing period like mid-April. Friday the 13th may indeed be a terrifying day for the accountants behind some of these freshman flicks.Call it \"Catwoman\" vs. \"Hudson Hawk.\" Sony unleashes its latest star-driven thriller \"Perfect Stranger\" which finds Halle Berry playing an investigative reporter following an ad mogul (Bruce Willis) who may have killed her friend. The R-rated pic boasts the most star wattage of any new film this weekend and that will mean something at the cash registers. The actor combo is unique, appealing, and diverse enough to bring in two different audiences which is always good for business. Poor reviews probably won’t mean too much to the box office. Sony’s marketing push has been commendable and with Spartans, Ninja Turtles, and figure skaters ruling the charts over the last five weeks, many moviegoers will be ready to shift over to this type of film. \"Perfect Stranger\" invades 2,661 theaters and stands a chance of hitting number one with around $15M.\"At least ‘Hudson Hawk’ didn’t make RT’s ‘Worst of the Worst’ list.\"Paramount counters with its own thriller this Friday the 13th with \"Disturbia.\" With a more teen-friendly PG-13 rating, the pic tells the tale of a young man under house arrest who suspects that his neighbor is a serial killer. Shia LaBeouf, Carrie-Anne Moss, and David Morse make up the cast so clearly the film is not being sold on its starpower. \"Perfect Stranger\" will provide some healthy competition as those looking for a scare, and are 17 or older, will find Berry and Willis worth paying money for. But young teens that have already skated with Will Ferrell may look here for their weekly escape to the movies. Entering about 2,500 theaters, \"Disturbia\" could scare up around $10M over the weekend.Yet another Shia LaBeouf movie.Rookie distributor Chicago Releasing drives into theaters with its maiden film \"Redline,\" an action drama about bored rich kids who drag race for fun. The PG-13 film is being aimed at teenage boys and young men with action-packed commercials and trailers full of hot cars and hotter babes. Eddie Griffin is the only major star in this vehicle so only those who really crave another \"Fast and the Furious\" flick will make it out. But in a weekend when most new films have been slapped with an R, this one could carve out a small audience of teens. Racing into about 2,000 theaters, \"Redline\" might finish with roughly $7M this weekend.No word yet how many expensive cars Eddie Griffin wrecks in \"Redline.\"With all the films thrown into theaters this year, nobody has offered up a handy dandy Viking flick. That changes this weekend with the action-adventure \"Pathfinder,\" an R-rated pic that looks at a young man’s battle against Norse invaders in North America centuries ago. Following the runaway success of \"300,\" it’s no surprise that Fox is marketing \"Pathfinder\" as a historical war epic based on a graphic novel. But this new film has nothing on Leonidas and pals. The Viking subject matter is not interesting, the marketing push has been weak, and lead actor Karl Urban is no commercial draw. Attacking 1,720 theaters, \"Pathfinder\" might find only $5M on opening weekend.Just one of many decapitations in \"Pathfinder.\"Lionsgate goes after an adult audience with its new crime drama \"Slow Burn\" which stars Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, and Taye Diggs. The R-rated film about a district attorney whose colleague gets tied up in a murder case will go out in a moderate wide release with only a mild marketing push behind it. The starpower is not strong enough to attract a sizable crowd and there is little buzz among movie fans. Opening in 1,163 locations, \"Slow Burn\" could die a quick death at the multiplexes with a $4M bow.\"Slow Burn\": Expected to experience a quick death.In a world overstuffed with animated films, First Look Pictures turns the tables and aims at adults with the R-rated toon \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters.\" Based on the animated series on Cartoon Network, the pic is trying to follow in the footsteps of \"Borat\" by taking a TV property with a cult following and making a long-titled feature film that pushes the envelope. Even the term ‘Movie Film’ seems taken from the Kazakh journalist. \"Aqua Teen\" scored some extra publicity with its marketing debacle in Boston several weeks ago, however that will not give the film more mainstream appeal. Only the die hard \"Aqua\" fans are likely to come out here. Competition is stiff this weekend and with the fewest theaters of the six pack of new flicks, this one could get left behind. Landing in over 800 locations, \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" may collect approximately $4M over three days.\"Only 23 more installments of $59.95 to go!\"After back to back wins atop the box office charts, \"Blades of Glory\" will face a fierce challenge this weekend from the new releases. Few have the starpower that the Will Ferrell comedy packs and last weekend’s strong hold suggests that crowds are being pleased. A 35% fall would give \"Blades\" $14M for the weekend and $89M in 17 days.\"Meet the Robinsons\" and \"Are We Done Yet?\" have no new competition for the family audience so respectable holds are likely here as well. A 35% drop would give the Disney toon about $11M for a 17-day tally of $70M while a 40% decline for the Ice Cube sequel would give Sony around $9M for the sophomore frame and $33M after 12 days.LAST YEAR Easter weekend saw the arrival of \"Scary Movie 4\" which commanded a powerful opening grossing $40.2M in its debut. It was the second largest opening in the spoof comedy series and went on to capture $90.7M for The Weinstein Co. The animated blockbuster \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" dropped to second place with a still-potent $20M in its third frame followed by the sports comedy \"The Benchwarmers\" with $9.9M. Disney saw a disappointing debut in fourth with the animated film \"The Wild\" which took in just $9.7M on its way to $37.4M. \"Take the Lead\" rounded out the top five with $6.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Heroines, motion, Awards, Tumblr, Song, Ice, crossover, ITV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Perfect-Stranger-Heads-A-Crowded-Field"},{"id":"47509155660874","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ferrell &amp; Heder Still America’s Favorite Couple","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Ferrell &amp; Heder Still America's Favorite Coupleby RT Staff | April 8, 2007 |  CommentsWill Ferrell and Jon Heder skated to another gold medal victory over the Easter holiday as the comedy \"Blades of Glory\" remained atop the charts despite the arrival of a handful of new pictures. The Quentin Tarantino–Robert Rodriguez experiment \"Grindhouse\" opened well below expectations and finished with disappointing results in fourth place.Overall, moviegoers were in the mood for existing films as the top five holdovers all dipped by less than 33%. The top ten delivered more than $100M in ticket sales for the sixth consecutive frame giving the marketplace continued strength.Comedy was king of the box office once again as \"Blades of Glory\" grossed an estimated $23M in its second weekend slipping only 30%. The Paramount release has now laughed up an impressive $68.4M in just ten days and looks headed north of $120M. The gross was slightly bigger than the $22.1M sophomore weekend take of Ferrell’s last hit \"Talladega Nights\" which tumbled by a larger 53% in its second lap last summer. With no major comedy competition this month, \"Blades\" should continue to pull in healthy numbers in the weeks ahead.Also holding up well in its second weekend was Disney’s animated pic \"Meet the Robinsons\" with an estimated $17M, off 32%. Still attracting solid business from its 3D engagements, the G-rated toon has banked a solid $52.2M in its first ten days and is also hoping to join the century club.Leading the crop of new flicks was the Ice Cube comedy \"Are We Done Yet?\" with an estimated $15M for a third place finish. The Sony followup to the 2005 sleeper hit \"Are We There Yet?\" averaged a solid $5,214 from 2,877 sites and has grossed $19.1M since opening on Wednesday. \"Done\"’s extended five-day opening was similar to \"There\"’s three-day bow of $18.6M from January 2005. That film went on to collect $82.3M and still stands as Cube’s top-grossing picture ever. Like the first one, the PG-rated Done played primarily to a family audience.The weekend’s big shocker was the violent two-for-one pic \"Grindhouse\" which debuted in fourth place with an estimate of only $11.6M. The three-hour-plus homage to the B movies of the 1970s averaged a decent $4,417 from 2,624 locations but did not come close to the opening weekend tallies of previous films from directors Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The long running time for the $53M production forced theaters to offer fewer showtimes and a lack of female appeal may also have contributed to the less-than-stellar bow. Openings for other R-rated offerings from the maverick filmmakers include $29.1M for Rodriguez’s \"Sin City\" and $22.1M and $25.1M for Tarantino’s \"Kill Bill\" installments. Reviews for \"Grindhouse\" were very positive but The Weinstein Co. may not find much long-term success as most fans of the directors probably planned to see it sooner rather than later.Hillary Swank’s new horror flick \"The Reaping\" came in fifth place in its debut grossing an estimated $10.1M from 2,603 locations for a moderate $3,872 average. The R-rated tale of a scientist investigating supernatural occurances in a small Louisiana town launched on Thursday and scared up $12M over four days. \"The Reaping\" also took off in 16 international markets and grossed an estimated $7.1M overseas.The year’s biggest blockbuster \"300\" followed in sixth place with an estimated $8.8M in its fifth battle, down just 23%, lifting the overall domestic haul to $193.9M. Overseas, the Spartan smash pulled in another $32M over the weekend boosting the international total to $173M and the global gross to a stunning $367M. \"Wild Hogs,\" the second largest hit of 2007, dipped 21% to an estimated $6.8M giving Buena Vista a fantastic $145.5M to date.Dropping to eighth was Mark Wahlberg’s action pic Shooter with an estimated $5.8M, off 31%, for a cume of $36.7M. Falling 47% to an estimated $4.9M was the Warner Bros. toon \"TMNT\" which put its total at $46.7M thus far.Fox’s family drama \"Firehouse Dog\" opened in tenth place with dismal results grossing an estimated $4M from 2,860 theaters. Averaging a weak $1,399, the PG-rated film about a boy and his celebrity pooch bowed on Wednesday and collected $5.3M over five days. With so many other films courting the family crowd over Easter weekend, \"Dog\" was completely overlooked.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.1M which was dead even with last year’s Easter frame when \"Scary Movie 4\" opened at number one with $40.2M; but up 23% from 2005’s holiday in March when \"Guess Who\" debuted on top with $20.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"critics, Classic, criterion, 93rd, cartoon, Music, and, dragons, on, vampires, best","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ferrell-Heder-Still-Americas-Favorite-Couple"},{"id":"47509155662923","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Grindhouse\" Prepares for Easter Carnage","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Grindhouse\" Prepares for Easter Carnageby Gitesh Pandya | April 5, 2007 |  CommentsEaster weekend sees four new wide releases hopping into the marketplace aiming to give the spring box office a boost.Action audiences get The Weinstein Company’s two-for-the-price-of-one special \"Grindhouse\" while horror fans go for a scare with the religious-themed fright flick \"The Reaping\" starring Hilary Swank which opens on Thursday. Wednesday saw two competing family films bow – the Ice Cube sequel \"Are We Done Yet?\" and the pooch pic \"Firehouse Dog.\" With Good Friday being a holiday for many, three-day numbers should reach healthy levels.Moviegoers with three hours to kill and a love of death and destruction will line up for \"Grindhouse,\" a double feature with separate films directed by indie heroes Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The R-rated pic includes the former’s road actioner \"Death Proof\" starring Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson and Rose McGowan while the latter’s zombie flick \"Planet Terror\" stars McGowan and Freddy Rodriguez. Clearly the primary business will come from the young male fan base that Tarantino and Rodriguez hold dearly. Since there is so much overlap here, the grosses may not grow beyond what they’ve seen with previous hits.\"Grindhouse\" has had some flashy marketing which is successfully generating interest. Plus there is starpower behind the cameras. Add in the two-for-one novelty item and the press tour that the cast and directors are on and it’s clear to see that a strong opening weekend will result. Debuts for similar ultraviolent R-rated films from the helmers include $22.1M for 2003’s \"Kill Bill Vol. 1,\" $25.1M for the folowing year’s \"Kill Bill Vol. 2,\" and $29.1M for 2005’s \"Sin City.\" But cutting into \"Grindhouse\"’s potential will be its length which will force each screen to offer one less showtime per day compared to conventional two-hour films. Reviews have been very positive so the pic may reach a little beyond its core crowd of fan boys. Entering 2,624 theaters on Friday, \"Grindhouse\" could deliver an opening weekend gross of around $25M.\"Grindhouse\"Following in the footsteps of Jim Carrey and Sandra Bullock from earlier this year, Hilary Swank gives it a go in the world of horror with the new religious-themed chiller \"The Reaping.\" The R-rated film finds the two-time Oscar winner playing a scientist called in to investigate mysterious occurances in a small Louisiana town where locals believe Biblical devastation is on its way. Horror flicks with religious storylines usually connect with audiences and with \"The Reaping\" timed for an Easter weekend launch, a sizable four-day start is likely. The thriller should skew a bit more female given the protagonist while age-wise, the appeal seems broader than just older teens and young adults.With the Thursday debut, Warner Bros. is looking to take advantage of the Good Friday holiday which will make Thursday night at the multiplexes seem like a Friday night. A Wednesday bow, which is common for this particular weekend, would have been more risky as bad word-of-mouth from opening day ticket buyers who return to work or school on Thursday would dampen weekend sales. Reviews have not been too pleasant, but the studio deserves credit for actually holding press screenings which nowadays is rare for a horror film. With \"Premonition\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes 2\" both fading away into the low single-digit millions this weekend, \"The Reaping\" is ready to cater to those in the market for a good scare. Warner Bros. attacks 2,501 theaters on Thursday and increases the run to 2,603 on Friday and could register an opening weekend of roughly $14M and $17M over four days.Hilary Swank in \"The Reaping.\"Rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube conquered the kiddie movie box office two years ago with the surprise hit \"Are We There Yet?\" which grossed $82.3M becoming the star’s biggest career hit. For the sequel \"Are We Done Yet?,\" Sony has replaced the road comedy element with a story about a family facing all kinds of obstacles fixing up their new house. There debuted to a solid $18.6M in January 2005 against almost no competition for family audiences. \"Done\" feels like the same dish served up again and has not really excited its target audience. Plus there is much more competition for it to deal with in the marketplace, notably Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" which offers fresh new entertainment. Cube probably won’t see the same success the second time around but at least the grosses won’t tumble 82% the way they did when he took control of the \"XXX\" sequel. Now playing in 2,877 theaters, \"Are We Done Yet?\" could collect about $13M over three days and $16M over five days.Ice Cube in \"Are We Done Yet?\"Families not in the mood for some fun with Ice Cube get to try out the boy-and-his-dog drama \"Firehouse Dog\" from Fox. The PG-rated pic about a celebrity hound that gets lost and later rescued by a firefighting team lacks the starpower and marketing muscle needed to deliver a strong opening. Between \"Are We Done Yet?,\" \"Meet the Robinsons,\" and even \"TMNT,\" kids have enough choices this Easter weekend and will probably wait for \"Firehouse Dog\" on DVD. Bowing in 2,566 sites, the family film could open with about $7M over three days and $9M over five days.\"Firehouse Dog\"Among holdovers, the Will Ferrell comedy \"Blades of Glory\" looks to lose its spot at the top of the box office, but should still deliver a solid sophomore spin. The comedian’s summer hits \"Talladega Nights\" and \"Anchorman\" both dropped by more than 50% in their second weekends. \"Blades\" has the Good Friday holiday to help soften the blow a bit. A 45% decline would give Paramount about $18M for the frame and a solid $61M after ten days.Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" also got off to a strong start last weekend, but will face stiff competition for families from both \"Are We Done Yet?\" and \"Firehouse Dog.\" The 3D toon could slide 35% to around $16M for a ten-day cume of nearly $50M. The ultraviolent war film \"300\" may fall by 45% to $6M and lift its impressive haul to $190M. The worldwide tally should blast past $350M this weekend.LAST YEAR: Still ranking number one with ease was the animated smash \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" with $33.8M despite losing half of its opening weekend sales. Debuting in second was the Rob Schneider sports comedy \"The Benchwarmers\" with $19.7M on its way to $57.7M for Sony. New Line’s dance pic \"Take the Lead\" opened in third with $12.1M before finishing off with $34.7M. The Denzel Washington–Jodie Foster actioner \"Inside Man\" followed with $9.1M in its third heist. Rounding out the top five was another action thriller \"Lucky Number Slevin\" with a $7M bow on its way to $22.5M for The Weinstein Co. The Fox Searchlight comedy \"Phat Girlz\" flopped in ninth with just $3.1M before getting yanked with only $7.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"kaiju, australia, Yoda, Disney, San, marvel, jones, deadpool, Superheroe, Black, Chernobyl, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Grindhouse-Prepares-for-Easter-Carnage"},{"id":"47509155664972","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Will Ferrell Goes for the Gold","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Will Ferrell Goes for the Goldby Gitesh Pandya | March 29, 2007 |  CommentsTwo promising new comedies target different age groups and look to close off a red hot March box office with strong opening weekend sales.Paramount offers the Will Ferrell pic \"Blades of Glory\" while Disney goes after the kids with the animated flick \"Meet the Robinsons.\" Together, the pictures should help the marketplace surge and allow the top ten to cross the $100M mark for the fifth consecutive frame. The box office has not seen this kind of streak since last summer. Smaller films entering the multiplexes include the action pic \"The Lookout\" from Miramax and Universal’s uplifting drama \"Peaceful Warrior.\"Comedy king Will Ferrell skates into theaters everywhere looking for another gold medal with his newest laugher \"Blades of Glory.\" The PG-13 film finds the funnyman and Jon Heder playing rival figure skaters who must team up as a pair in order to compete again. Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jenna Fischer, and Craig T. Nelson co-star. \"Blades\" boasts the two main ingredients to a successful comedy hit – a bankable star and a unique concept. Add in the very funny commercials and trailers and Paramount is well-positioned to score its second number one hit of the year joining fellow star-driven comedy \"Norbit.\" Both pics were produced by DreamWorks.Ferrell left the competition in the dust last summer with \"Talladega Nights\" which bowed to a robust $47M on its way to a $148M final. \"Blades\" doesn’t have as big of a marketing push or the prime summer play period so its opening will not soar as high. But the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star will again prove that he is a reliable draw. The industry had some doubts in 2005 when both \"Bewitched\" and \"Kicking and Screaming\" failed to reach $65M. Ferrell’s 2004 hit \"Anchorman\" debuted to $28.4M and \"Blades\" should play out like that one, only bigger. Teens and young adults will be the driving force plus there is plenty of cross-gender appeal. Though the marketplace is crowded with many options, there aren’t too many direct threats. \"Wild Hogs,\" the only major comedy, is getting old as is \"300\" which most high school and college students have already seen. Spinning into over 3,000 theaters, \"Blades of Glory\" should finish in first place and win about $37M over the weekend.Ferrell and Heder in \"Blades of Glory.\"Disney uses its patented moves to go after the family audience with its latest animated offering \"Meet the Robinsons.\" With most digital toons these days being of the PG variety, \"Robinsons\" carries a G rating which it hopes will help convince parents to buy tickets for even the youngest of their children. The story follows an orphan boy who befriends a kind family and features the voices of Angela Bassett, Tom Selleck, and Adam West. In the cartoon world, films sell best when they are comedies and feature popular comedians in central roles. \"Robinsons\" at least has the first factor working for it.The marketing has been strong and trailers have been funny. But unlike the studio’s last film for kids, \"Bridge to Terabithia,\" this time competition will be a force. \"TMNT\" and \"The Last Mimzy\" will only be in their second weekends and are set to steal away about $20M worth of business from the same target audience. Luckily, the weekend’s two other new films will attract different segments of the moviegoing crowd. \"Meet the Robinsons\" does not have the firepower to reach the heights of Pixar pics. Rather, it may bring out the same size audience as last fall’s \"Open Season\" which bowed to $23.2M from an ultrawide 3,833 locations. \"Meet the Robinsons\" bows in roughly 3,200 sites but could exploit its studio’s brand name to deliver a similar gross of about $23M.Let’s \"Meet the Robinsons.\"Years after leaving the sitcom world of NBC’s \"3rd Rock From the Sun,\" Joseph Gordon-Levitt anchors the heist thriller \"The Lookout.\" The R-rated Miramax release comes from writer-turned-rookie-director Scott Frank and co-stars Jeff Daniels. Starpower is seriously lacking here and that will hurt its box office prospects. Reviews have been good, but the target audience of young adults have \"Blades of Glory,\" \"300,\" and \"Shooter\" to choose from and all of them offer more for the money. With only so much marketing and distribution strength behind it, the film will have a tough time just getting an invite to the top ten. \"The Lookout\" debuts in about 1,000 theaters on Friday and could collect about $4M over three days.Jeff Daniels and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in \"The Lookout.\"In an unorthodox approach, Universal will be releasing the inspirational drama \"Peaceful Warrior\" in 615 theaters this weekend but most moviegoers will actually be getting free tickets through a promotion with Best Buy. The PG-13 film starring Nick Nolte was given a limited release last summer and grossed more than $1M from just over 40 theaters. Universal will report box office grosses that include regular paid sales plus full ticket prices for each free admission. With $15M worth of free tickets allocated for opening weekend, it will be unlikely that the paid portion will make up a sizable amount. Film fans who visit the promotional web site can get up to ten complimentary tickets each. However, the studio should get some extra buzz that it could benefit from when the DVD is released a few months down the road.Nick Nolte and Scott Mechlowicz in \"Peaceful Warrior.\"The Ninja Turtles ruled the box office last weekend in \"TMNT,\" but will face a formidable foe in Disney’s \"Meet the Robinsons\" which will play to the same audience. A 40% drop would give the animated actioner $14M for the frame and $43M after ten days. Warner Bros has also been raking in the dough with its stylish war epic 300 which has been holding up surprisingly well. Another 40% fall will put the R-rated battle pic at $12M boosting the cume to $180M after 24 days. Mark Wahlberg‘s \"Shooter\" could decline by 45% to $8M giving Paramount a ten-day total of $27M.LAST YEAR: Smashing the March opening weekend record set four years earlier by its predecessor, \"Ice Age: The Meltdown\" shot straight to number one with a colossal $68M debut. The Fox juggernaut went on to gross $195.3M domestically and a towering $657M worldwide giving the \"Ice Age\" duo over $1 billion in global grosses. Dropping to second was \"Inside Man\" with $15.4M. Warner Bros. launched its urban drama \"ATL\" in third with $11.6M on its way to $21.2M. Rounding out the top five were \"Failure to Launch\" with $6.5M and \"V for Vendetta\" with $6.3M. The horror flick \"Slither\" creeped into eighth place with a $3.9M opening leading to a $7.8M final. Sony claimed the year’s most notorious flop with \"Basic Instinct 2\" which bowed to $3.2M on its way to a pathetic $5.9M before sweeping the Razzie Awards.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, cancelled, New, BBC, Super, remakes, 71st, TV, social, dc, Endgame, 2017, Rocky, marvel, song","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Will-Ferrell-Goes-for-the-Gold"},{"id":"47509155672144","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"300\" Prepares to Conquer Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"300\" Prepares to Conquer Multiplexesby Gitesh Pandya | March 8, 2007 |  CommentsFor the first time in nearly a month, North America’s most popular movie won’t be about motorcycles. Warner Bros. goes back in time 2,500 years for the epic war saga \"300\" which aims to conquer the box office with ease.Other studios have conceded the frame to the effects-driven actioner as the only other film opening wide is the family drama \"The Ultimate Gift\" which will cater to a non-violent crowd that prefers to keep decapitations to a minimum in their weekend entertainment.Two and a half years after running the historical epic genre into the ground with \"Alexander,\" Warner Bros. is back to breathe new life into the industry with \"300.\" The R-rated war film stars Gerard Butler as the Greek king who in 480 B.C. led his small battalion of brave soldiers in battle against the mighty Persian army. Directed by Zack Snyder (\"Dawn of the Dead\"), \"300\" is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and features stylized action sequences and a visual look unlike the endless line of epics that hit multiplexes a few years ago.Warner Bros. got the ball rolling early last fall with exciting trailers that really energized the target audience of male action fans who now will be very satisfied by the amount of blood, gore, and female nudity in the picture. Momentum has been building ever since and today, \"300\" is an event film for many. The film lacks a marquee star but that should not matter much. The unique look and feel should compensate for that as moviegoers will find the film to be worth paying top dollar for to see on the big screen. This is not one to wait for on DVD. And unlike other epics, this one keeps it just under two hours which will allow theaters to offer enough showtimes per day. The marketplace is ready for \"300.\" Aside from \"Ghost Rider\" which is going into its fourth lap, there will be little direct competition for \"300\" to face so King Leonidas and his men should prevail in this battle.Other effects-driven R-rated action films have found success recently in the spring months. In 2005, Keanu Reeves‘ \"Constantine\" bowed to $29.8M and \"Sin City\" opened to $29.1M while last March \"V for Vendetta\" debuted with $25.6M. All three films ended in the $70-76M range. \"300\" looks like it has the strength to go higher. The marketing has been brilliant, competition is weak, and excitement is high. Warner Bros. will score its first number one opener of the year with \"300\" which invades 3,103 theaters, including Imax venues which will add a few extra bucks. A Friday-to-Sunday gross of about $38M could result.\"300,\" finally in theaters.Fox Faith, the new wing of Twentieth Century Fox dedicated to films with uplifting religious themes, rolls out its family drama \"The Ultimate Gift\" starring James Garner, Brian Dennehy, and Abigail Breslin who comes straight from her high profile Oscar nomination for \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Based on the best-selling book, the PG-rated film tells the story of a young man who instead of getting his expected inheritance after the death of his wealthy grandfather, is given a series of challenges to help him build character and learn what is truly important in life. Grassroots marketing is being used to court the faith-based audience and a dollar from every ticket sold will be donated to one of a number of different charities. Still, the film is not being given a marketing blitz so large numbers are not expected. Opening in over 800 theaters, \"The Ultimate Gift\" may gross about $3M this weekend.\"The Ultimate Gift,\" with Abigail Breslin.After opening almost everywhere else in the world, the hit Korean horror film \"The Host\" makes its ways to American shores through Magnolia Pictures this weekend. The R-rated creature feature debuts in about 70 theaters and has been garnering impressive reviews since its premiere last May at the Cannes Film Festival. Fox Searchlight platforms its family saga \"The Namesake\" from director Mira Nair (\"Monsoon Wedding,\" \"Vanity Fair\") in six theaters in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Toronto. Starring Kal Penn, the PG-13 film about the struggles of an Indian-American family will expand weekly throughout the rest of the month.\"The Namesake\"After three weeks of motorcycle flicks ruling the box office, a stylized trip back in time with \"300\" will come as a welcome change of pace. \"Wild Hogs,\" which powered its way to a surprisingly potent $39.7M bow last weekend, will drop out of pole position. With little direct competition, look for a reasonable dip in sales. The Buena Vista release has been a crowdpleaser and will remain the top choice for moviegoers in the mood for a laugh or anything with big Hollywood stars. A 35% decline could result giving \"Hogs\" a weekend tally of around $26M and a ten-day cume of $74M.Paramount’s serial killer pic \"Zodiac\" got off to a moderate start last weekend and will have another R-rated film aimed at adults to deal with. A drop of 40% may occur putting the murder mystery at $8M for a total of only $25M after ten days. Sony’s \"Ghost Rider\" will become the first member of the 2007 century club and should fall 45% to $6M for a $103M cume. The Nicolas Cage pic is set to take a serious hit thanks to 300.LAST YEAR: The Matthew McConaughey–Sarah Jessica Parker romantic comedy \"Failure to Launch\" debuted at number one leading a new crop of films with $24.4M. The Paramount release found its way to $88.7M. Opening in second place was the Tim Allen kidpic \"The Shaggy Dog\" with $16.3M followed closely by the new horror flick \"The Hills Have Eyes\" with $15.7M. Final grosses reached $61.1M and $41.8M, respectively. The Bruce Willis actioner \"16 Blocks\" dropped to fourth with $7.4M. After two weeks at the top of the charts, the Tyler Perry comedy \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" tumbled from first to fifth with $5.7M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"casting, mutant, Movies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-300-Prepares-to-Conquer-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509155675218","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Ghost Rides\" High Again at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Ghost Rides\" High Again at #1by Gitesh Pandya | February 26, 2007 |  CommentsAcademy Award winner Nicolas Cage ruled Oscar weekend with his skull-on-fire motorcycle actioner \"Ghost Rider,\" which held steady at number one in North America for the second straight time. Moviegoers delivered different verdicts to the handful of new releases led by the Jim Carrey thriller \"The Number 23,\" which fared best and debuted in second place. Overall, the top ten was about even with the corresponding weekends from the last two years.Dropping 57% from its powerful opening weekend, \"Ghost Rider\" took in an estimated $19.7M over the weekend and pushed its ten-day tally to a sensational $78.7M. The big-budget Sony actioner adapted from the popular Marvel comic book series suffered a decline similar to that of 2003’s \"Daredevil,\" which sank 55% in its second frame after an explosive bow over Presidents’ Day weekend. That super hero flick captured 68% of its domestic total in the first ten days. \"Ghost Rider\" is so far following the same path which means a final gross of $115-120M seems likely.Comedy guru Jim Carrey took a stab at horror with his new psychological thriller \"The Number 23\" and saw moderate results with a $15.1M launch, according to estimates. Playing in 2,759 theaters, the R-rated film averaged $5,476 per location for New Line. Critics were brutal to the scary pic, but the opening fared better than those of most of Carrey’s previous non-comedies.Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" dropped 40% in its sophomore adventure and pulled in an estimated $13.6M in ticket sales. The PG-rated fantasy has banked an impressive $46.2M in ten days and may be heading for around $75M overall.Fox saw a not-so-arresting debut for its cop comedy \"Reno 911!: Miami,\" which opened in fourth place with an estimated $10.4M. The R-rated feature adapted from the moderately successful Comedy Central series averaged a mild $3,849 from a wide release in 2,702 theaters. By comparison, openings for other recent R-rated comedies based on popular television properties include $26.5M for \"Borat\" and $29M for \"Jackass: Number Two,\" both of which bowed at number one.Eddie Murphy‘s comedy \"Norbit\" dropped 42% to an estimated $9.7M in its third weekend raising its total to $74.7M for Paramount. Warner Bros. followed with its own comedy \"Music and Lyrics,\" which pulled in an estimated $8M in its sophomore weekend. Down a reasonable 41%, the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore pic has taken in $32.1M in 12 days and could be headed for the $50M mark.Universal’s \"Breach\" dipped 41% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.2M. With $20.5M in ten days, the FBI thriller in on course for a $35M total. The Tyler Perry comedy \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" lost half of its audience in the second weekend just like the director’s last two February comedies. The Lionsgate release grossed an estimated $5.3M, down 53%, and has taken in $25.6M. Both \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" made about 75% of their total grosses in the first ten days so a $35M final for Girls seems likely.A pair of new releases rounded out the top ten. Warner Bros. saw a dismal opening for its Billy Bob Thornton drama \"The Astronaut Farmer,\" which grossed an estimated $4.5M from 2,155 locations. Averaging a poor $2,093 per theater, the PG-rated film earned mixed reviews from critics.Goldwyn’s historical slave trade drama \"Amazing Grace\" enjoyed a solid bow with an estimated $4.3M from only 791 sites for a respectable $5,442 average matching \"Ghost Rider’s\" per-theater average to the dollar. Reviews were mostly favorable.Four films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The runaway smash \"Night at the Museum\" collected an estimated $2.2M in its tenth weekend and upped its total to $241.7M putting it at number 44 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters ahead of \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" which made $241.4M in 2002. \"Museum\" fell 41% this weekend and should go on to reach around $246M domestically and over $500M worldwide.Universal’s Diane Keaton comedy \"Because I Said So\" grossed an estimated $2.9M, down 44%, putting its cume at a decent $38.4M. A final gross of $43-45M seems likely. Sony’s thriller \"The Messengers\" grossed an estimated $1.6M, tumbling 58%, for a $33.4M cume. The $16M production should conclude with a healthy $35M. MGM’s \"Hannibal Rising\" has grossed about $26M to date and should end its run with only $30M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $96.7M which was up 1% from last year when \"Madea’s Family Reunion\" opened at number one with $30M; but off 2% from 2005 when \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" debuted on top with $21.9M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"football, TV, indiana, crossover, Hulu, BBC, It, Amazon, Superheroes, Travel, Annual, shows","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Ghost-Rides-High-Again-at-1"},{"id":"47509155674193","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Ride with Wild Hogs at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Audiences Ride with Wild Hogs at #1by Gitesh Pandya | March 5, 2007 |  CommentsMoviegoers rallied behind the star-driven comedy \"Wild Hogs,\" which raced to number one at the North American box office, zooming past all expectations from Disney. Meanwhile, Viacom saw less-than-stellar debuts from its serial killer drama \"Zodiac\" from Paramount Pictures and the southern fried saga \"Black Snake Moan\" from arthouse unit Paramount Vantage. Overall, the box office remained healthy and surged well ahead of last year’s performance.Buena Vista powered its way to an estimated $38M in opening weekend sales for its road comedy \"Wild Hogs,\" delivering the largest March debut in history for a live-action film. The PG-13 pic starring Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy as four middle-aged men on a motorcycle adventure averaged a stellar $11,561 from 3,287 theaters. It was the year’s second biggest opening after \"Ghost Rider‘s\" $45.4M bow two weeks ago. According to studio research, 54% of the audience was actually female. Travolta’s everlasting sex appeal, Allen’s pull with moms thanks to his many Disney flicks, and the cast’s appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" last week probably contributed to the solid turnout by women. The stars also allowed the film to tap into different audience segments.\"Wild Hogs\" posted the best opening ever in March for a non-animated film and the third biggest overall. The only movies to debut better in this month were the \"Ice Age\" flicks of 2002 and 2006. It also gave Travolta the biggest opening by far of his career, beating the $23.5M of 2005’s \"Be Cool,\" and the second best bow for Allen after the $57.4M bow of 1999’s \"Toy Story 2.\" As expected, \"Hogs\" was slammed by critics but reviews are practically irrelevant for a star-driven comedy like this. This is a crowdpleaser, not a criticpleaser. Audiences make their decisions based on if they think they will get a good laugh or not and Buena Vista’s marketing push was indeed solid. Though the overall weekend gross was strong, what was even more encouraging was the significant Friday-to-Saturday boost of 49% which is rare for any new release. A journey into nine-digit territory seems likely.Debuting far back in second place was the serial killer pic \"Zodiac,\" with an estimated $13.1M from 2,362 sites. Averaging a respectable $5,546 per theater, the R-rated film from director David Fincher played to an older audience as two-thirds of the crowd was over the age of 25, according to studio research from Paramount. Males and females were evenly represented. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., and Mark Ruffalo, \"Zodiac\" follows the investigation behind one of California’s most notorious murderers from the 1960s and 70s. The $65M film fared better than last fall’s murder mysteries set in the Golden State, \"The Black Dahlia\" and \"Hollywoodland,\" which debuted to $10M and $5.9M respectively.Reviews were overwhelmingly positive for \"Zodiac,\" but its 160-minute length may have cut into its grossing potential. Plus when factoring in ticket prices increases over the years, it can be estimated that \"Zodiac\" sold the fewest opening weekend tickets of any of Fincher’s films. Admissions were roughly the same as for \"Fight Club,\" which bowed to $11M in 1999. The studio is hoping that good word-of-mouth can carry the film in the weeks ahead.After leading the pack for two full weeks, the Johnny Blaze flick \"Ghost Rider\" fell to third but only dropped 43% for an estimated $11.5M gross. Sony’s Nicolas Cage starrer has taken in $94.8M in 17 days and should become the first new release of 2007 to break the $100M barrier. Disney’s \"Bridge to Terabithia\" also held up well dipping 39% in its third adventure to an estimated $8.6M. Cume stands at $57.9M.Jim Carrey‘s thriller \"The Number 23\" fell from second to fifth place in its sophomore scare and collected an estimated $7.1M. Down an understandable 52%, the New Line title has taken in a semi-decent $24.7M in ten days and looks headed for a $35-38M finish.Eddie Murphy‘s latest comedy \"Norbit\" enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten and dipped 34% to an estimated $6.4M for a $83M sum. Fellow laugher \"Music and Lyrics\" dropped just 36% to an estimated $4.9M giving the Hugh Grant–Drew Barrymore pic $38.7M to date.Paramount Vantage bowed its Samuel L. Jackson–Christina Ricci drama \"Black Snake Moan\" and collected an estimated $4M from 1,252 theaters. Averaging a mild $3,208, the debut was half the size of writer/director Craig Brewer‘s last film \"Hustle &amp; Flow,\" which opened in July 2005 to $8M from 1,013 theaters on its way to $22.2M and an Oscar. Jackson has witnessed many of his headlining vehicles struggle at the box office including \"Freedomland,\" \"The Man,\" and even \"Snakes on a Plane,\" which despite hitting the top spot, grossed much less than expected given its media hype last summer.The Fox comedy \"Reno 911!: Miami\" tumbled 64% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.8M for a ninth place finish. The R-rated pic has grossed $16.4M in ten days and should conclude with roughly $20M. Rounding out the top ten was the FBI thriller \"Breach\" with an estimated $3.5M, off 42%, for a $25.4M total.Three smaller films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. The slave trade drama \"Amazing Grace\" dipped only 26% in its second weekend to an estimated $3M. With $8.2M in ten days, the Samuel Goldwyn/Roadside Attractions period pic may find its way to $15-18M. The Billy Bob Thornton flop \"The Astronaut Farmer\" grossed an estimated $2.2M, down 52%, and put its sum at an embarrassing $7.7M. Look for a $11M final.Lionsgate’s Tyler Perry comedy \"Daddy’s Little Girls\" fell 53% to an estimated $2.3M in its third frame and upped its cume to $28.4M. By comparison, the distributor saw stronger 17-day grosses of $44M and $55.7M respectively for the director’s last two films, \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" and \"Madea’s Family Reunion.\" \"Daddy’s\" should end its run with $30-33M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $100.8M which was up a stunning 30% from last year when \"Madea\" stayed at number one with just $12.6M; but off 4% from 2005 when \"The Pacifier\" debuted on top with $30.6M.Source: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Dead, comedy, El, Reviews, 45, DGA","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Audiences-Ride-with-Wild-Hogs-at-1"},{"id":"47509157189723","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Epic\" Comedy Battles Oscar’s Finest","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Epic\" Comedy Battles Oscar's Finestby Gitesh Pandya | January 25, 2007 |  CommentsA quartet of poorly-titled films will hit the multiplexes on Friday hoping to grab some business opposite a string of acclaimed releases fresh from earning their Oscar nominations.Leading the newcomers with the most theaters is the spoof comedy \"Epic Movie\" which goes head to head against the crime drama \"Smokin’ Aces.\" Horror fans get the werewolf pic \"Blood and Chocolate\" while those who prefer non-violence get the Jennifer Garner drama \"Catch and Release.\"Fox tries to tap into the immature crowd with its new comedy \"Epic Movie\" which spoofs many of the big-budget action and fantasy blockbusters of recent years. The \"Scary Movie\" series has ushered in more spoof flicks and Fox even saw solid results a year ago with its \"Date Movie\" which lampooned popular romantic comedies. That film bowed to $19.1M and found its way to $48.5M. Fans may be getting a little sick of the same template over and over again so the opening may not be as big, but the genre still works especially with young teens looking for mindless entertainment after a long week of classes. Commercials and trailers do not look that funny, but given the weak marketplace and the success rate of comedies with specific concepts, \"Epic\" may take in all the cash it needs to hit the number one spot. Holdovers do not seem like they will break into double digit millions this weekend. With a wide release in 2,801 playdates, the PG-13 pic could amass around $14M.Lampooning Harry Potter in \"Epic Movie.\"The weekend’s solo R pic comes in the form of the mob thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" from Universal. Jeremy Piven, Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, and Alicia Keys star in this ensemble piece about a witness in protective custody being hunted down by a crime boss before he can testify. Young men are the target audience here in this Vegas-set flick that tries too hard to be cool. The NFL’s weekend off should make guys more available for ticketbuying which will help. The studio saw an underwhelming $6.4M three-day debut for another R-rated crime saga earlier this month – \"Alpha Dog\" – and will probably see many of the same customers this time around. An extra 1,000 theaters will ensure a bigger opening, but there is no A-list star or director in the film to truly attract a large crowd. A quick in and out of theaters should result. Opening in 2,204 locations, \"Smokin’ Aces\" might collect roughly $8M in its first hand.Alicia Keys in \"Smokin’ Aces.\"Jennifer Garner plays a woman trying to rebuild her life after the death of her husband in the new drama \"Catch and Release.\" Sony proudly offers the only major new pic for female moviegoers and hopes to stand out from the crowd by going after an audience few others are targeting. The PG-13 film will test the starpower of the former \"Alias\" star who last hit screens two years ago with the big-budget bomb \"Elektra.\" Her comedy \"13 Going on 30\" which she anchored solo performed well with a $21.1M bow, but \"Catch\" lacks the same fun factor and will probably draw fewer males too. Plus the studio is going into the marketplace with less than half the theaters they gave to \"13.\" A supporting role by Kevin Smith is not likely to help bring in many dudes. But with so few films playing specifically to young women, a decent average is likely. \"Catch and Release\" hits 1,622 theaters on Friday and could take in about $7M.Jennifer Garner, Kevin Smith, and some other dude in \"Catch and Release.\"Werewolf terror hits the multiplexes in the form of \"Blood and Chocolate,\" a new supernatural fright flick aiming for teens and young adults. The MGM release carries a PG-13 rating which could work well in getting in younger teens, but the film lacks the zing or interesting concept that fans need in order to pay top dollar at the local theater. Every recent horror film has underperformed at the box office and this one does not seem like the savior that can turn things around. Plus other new releases will be distracting the target audience too. Opening in roughly 1,500 theaters, \"Blood and Chocolate\" could debut to around $4M.\"Blood and Chocolate.\"After racking up over $200M through its five-week stay in the top two slots, \"Night at the Museum\" should get bumped down a bit. The Ben Stiller film once again faces no new competition for the family audience so a slim decline should result. A 30% fall would give Fox about $8M for the weekend and a towering cume of $215M. Sony’s \"Stomp the Yard\" looks to fall harder so a 40% drop to around $7M could occur pushing the cume to $50M.After scoring the most Oscar nominations of any film with eight, the big-budget musical \"Dreamgirls\" shot up to the number one spot on Tuesday after finishing in third last weekend and on Monday. Although it missed out on the top prize of a Best Picture nomination, the Jamie Foxx–Beyonce Knowles film is still getting media attention which is fueling the buzz and the studio has wasted no time in advertising the fact that no other film has more Academy Award nods. Still, the film is aging and many other awards contenders are expanding and trying to attract upscale moviegoers too. A small 20% slide to around $6M may occur giving \"Dreamgirls\" a solid $85M total.LAST YEAR: Martin Lawrence topped the box office with his hit comedy sequel \"Big Momma’s House 2\" which bowed to a plump $27.7M. The Fox release went on to gross $70.2M. Debuting in second was the family film \"Nanny McPhee\" with $14.5M for Universal on its way to $47.1M. Sony’s \"Underworld: Evolution\" tumbled by 58% in its second weekend and placed third with $11.4M. The military drama \"Annapolis\" opened in fourth with a modest $7.7M before finishing with $17.1M for Buena Vista.

New releases were met with varying levels of success. Both the futuristic saga Children of Men and the high school drama Freedom Writers earned high marks while playing in moderate national play. However, the animated film Happily N’Ever After and the action-comedy Code Name: The Cleaner were both met with soft openings.Overall, the first weekend of 2007 was solid and holdovers displayed considerable strength as audiences continued to find time to see all the interesting films in the marketplace. A remarkable 14 movies collected weekend sales of $4M or more giving the box office great breadth.The Ben Stiller comedy Night at the Museum easily topped the charts over the weekend with an estimated $24M in its third weekend of play boosting its cume to a stellar $164.1M. Down only 35% from the Friday-to-Sunday portion of the New Year’s holiday frame, the Fox blockbuster matched the comedian’s hit Meet the Fockers from two years ago which also topped the charts over the same three weekends. With its lucrative start and impressive holding power, Museum should be able to zoom past the $200M mark domestically.Will Smith’s The Pursuit of Happyness also stayed put for the third straight weekend taking the number two spot again with an estimated $13M. The Sony hit enjoyed the smallest decline in the top ten slipping only 33% and pushed its cume to $124.2M. Pursuit could be headed for $160M or more.Adult audiences responded to Alfonso Cuaron’s futuristic drama Children of Men which expanded nationally in its second weekend and took third place with an estimated $10.3M. The critically acclaimed Universal release averaged a sturdy $8,515 from 1,209 theaters and has collected $11.9M since its limited opening a week earlier.Hilary Swank saw impressive results for her school teacher drama Freedom Writers which debuted in fourth place with an estimated $9.7M from only 1,360 theaters. Averaging a strong $7,136 per location, the PG-13 film from Paramount and MTV Films connected with a young and multicultural audience. According to studio data, 62% of the audience was under the age of 21 and 50% were non-white. The road ahead for Freedom looks promising as the film scored an exceptionally high A grade from CinemaScore and 93% of those polled would definitely recommend it. Paramount will widen the picture on Friday into 700 more theaters for the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. school holiday weekend.The studio’s hit musical Dreamgirls followed in fifth place with an estimated $8.8M in its second full weekend of wide release, off 37%. The Jamie Foxx-Beyonce Knowles pic upped its total to $54.5M and continues to post the best average in the top ten with a stellar $10,358 from 852 sites. Paramount will add about 1,000 more theaters on Friday.Family audiences were not too charmed by the new animated offering Happily N’Ever After which opened in sixth place with just $6.8M, according to estimates. The PG-rated fairy tale satire averaged a lukewarm $2,856 from 2,381 locations for Lionsgate and could not compete with Night at the Museum which continued to dominate the family crowd.Competing kidpic Charlotte’s Web followed closely with an estimated $6.6M for Paramount, down 43%, pushing the cume to $67M. Universal’s CIA thriller The Good Shepherd ranked eighth with an estimated $6.5M, off 41%, for a mediocre $48.4M sum.Rocky Balboa punched up an estimated $6.3M for MGM dropping 41% and raised its cume to an impressive $60.9M. Rounding out the top ten was another sports drama, the football saga We Are Marshall, which fell 37% to an estimated $5.1M giving Warner Bros. an underwhelming $35.4M to date.Debuting poorly in eleventh place was the action-comedy Code Name: The Cleaner which bowed to an estimated $4.6M from 1,736 for a messy $2,650 average. The New Line release stars Cedric the Entertainer and Lucy Liu.Three films fell from the top ten but still generated weekend grosses of $4M or more. The fantasy adventure Eragon took in an estimated $4.6M, down 44%, for a $66.8M total to date. Tied with $4M a piece were the Cameron Diaz comedy The Holiday and the penguin toon Happy Feet. Sony’s holiday comedy fell 41% and upped its sum to $59M while the animated smash dropped 48% lifting its cume to $185.4M.Several arthouse films in limited release expanded over the weekend. Fox Searchlight’s Judi Dench pic Notes on a Scandal expanded from 22 to 93 theaters and grossed an estimated $1.1M for a potent $11,828 average. The film widens to over 200 sites on Friday and then into over 600 playdates on January 26. Cume is $2M. Paramount’s Perfume was not as successful in its expansion going from three to 280 sites grossing an estimated $551,000 for a weak $1,968 average. Total to date stands at $649,000.Warner Independent went from 37 to 72 theaters for its period drama The Painted Veil and grossed an estimated $480,000. Averaging a solid $6,667, the pic has taken in $1.2M to date and will expand to 200 runs on Friday. MGM’s Miss Potter continues to attract mediocre numbers grossing an estimated $123,000 from 26 playdates for a mild $4,731 average. Cume is $140,555 for the Renee Zellweger film.The top ten films grossed an estimated $97.2M which was off 1% from last year when Hostel opened at number one with $19.6M; and up 4% from 2005 when Meet the Fockers remained on top in its third weekend with $28.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Creative, DC, teaser","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Line-Up-for-Museum-For-Third-Straight-Weekend"},{"id":"47509158688868","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Get Jiggy with \"Happyness\"","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Moviegoers Get Jiggy with \"Happyness\"by Gitesh Pandya | December 18, 2006 |  CommentsBox office heavyweight Will Smith scored his sixth consecutive number one opening this weekend with his new rags-to-riches drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which raced past two new kid movies to claim the top spot.The mythical adventure \"Eragon\" opened well in second place while the family film \"Charlotte’s Web\" debuted in third with a modest launch. The one-two punch of \"Pursuit\" and \"Eragon\" kicked in a combined $50.5M and for only the second time in box office history, two December films opened to over $20M each on the same weekend.Proving once again how strong his pull is with moviegoing audiences, Smith conquered the charts with an estimated $27M bow for \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which on Thursday picked up two Golden Globe nominations including one for Best Actor in the drama category. Averaging a stunning $9,467 per theater in 2,852 locations, the PG-13 film tells the real-life story of a San Francisco man and his young son who become homeless and must try to get back on their feet. The former fresh prince’s real son Jaden plays his on-screen son in the uplifting, feel-good story.With mixed reviews and no famous director or co-stars, \"Pursuit\" succeeded solely on the starpower of Smith and followed his last five films \"Hitch,\" \"Shark Tale,\" \"I, Robot,\" \"Bad Boys II,\" and \"Men in Black II.\" Those five hits all opened at number one and went on to gross a jaw-dropping combined haul of $1.7 billion worldwide. With such a strong start, Will Smith should easily be able to score the tenth $100M domestic blockbuster of his career.For Sony, \"Pursuit\" marked its record 13th number one opener of 2006 from a jam-packed slate of 27 releases. Sony also broke its own all-time studio box office record by crossing the $1.57 billion mark in domestic ticket sales with two full weeks still to go and three titles remaining in the top ten. The previous record was set by Sony in the \"Spider-Man\"-fueled year of 2002.Opening in second place with some strength of its own was the dragon tale \"Eragon\" with an estimated $23.5M. Playing in 3,020 sites, the PG-rated film averaged a stellar $7,765 per theater. Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, and Rachel Weisz star in the mythical adventure which was based on a teen author’s story. Driven by special effects, \"Eragon\" carried a reported production cost of more than $100M. With no \"Lord of the Rings,\" \"Harry Potter,\" or \"Narnia\" films this holiday season, fantasy audiences had nothing else to rally behind and so Fox took advantage of the opportunity by placing its actioner into the pre-Christmas slot. With school kids leaving for their holiday breaks in the days ahead, the dragon pic aims to soar towards the land of nine digits.The only other time two December openers bowed to more than $20M each on the same frame was on this very weekend in 1997 when \"Titanic\" debuted at number one with $28.6M followed by the launch of the James Bond flick \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" with $25.1M. This weekend’s two new releases also helped to keep the overall box office within striking distance of last year’s colossal frame when \"King Kong\" ruled with a $50.1M opening and \"Narnia\" in its second weekend contributed a stellar $31.8M. Despite not having any film of the same magnitude, the marketplace this weekend had great breadth and saw the Top 20 dip only 7 percent versus last year.Paramount got off to a slow start with its big holiday season offering for families \"Charlotte’s Web\" which bowed to an estimated $12M from 3,566 theaters for a mild $3,372 average. Based on the popular children’s book, the G-rated film stars Dakota Fanning and features voices from Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, and John Cleese. Studios never want to see an opening weekend average lower than its theater count, but Paramount is hoping that the upcoming school holidays will allow the well-reviewed film to have legs. Recent kidpics that the studio opened in mid-December went on to make six to seven times their opening weekend grosses. These include 2002’s \"The Wild Thornberrys\" with a $6M bow on its way to $39.9M and 2001’s \"Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius\" whch debuted to $13.8M and reached $80.9M. \"Web,\" which cost over $80M to produce, hopes to follow and capture the attention of parents and their smaller children in the days and weeks ahead when they have more available time.The penguin blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" followed with an estimated $8.5M, down just 34 percent, for a $149.4M sum. The Warner Bros. smash now ranks number eight among 2006 films and should climb into the top five after the holiday season. Sony’s Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet comedy \"The Holiday\" dropped only 36 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $8.2M pushing its ten-day cume to $25.3M. Overseas grosses for the films rose to $59.7M and $28.5M, respectively.Last weekend’s number one film \"Apocalypto\" tumbled down to sixth place with an estimated $7.7M. Dropping 49 percent, the Mayan adventure has grabbed $27.9M for Buena Vista in ten days but also suffered the largest decline of any film in the top ten. Fellow sophomore \"Blood Diamond\" fared better in its second weekend sliding only 28percent to an estimated $6.3M. Earning its star Leonardo DiCaprio one of his two Golden Globe nominations this year for Best Actor – Drama, the Warner Bros. title has mined $18.4M in ten days. \"Blood Diamond\" got off to a slow start, but is now showing that it could have the legs to go the distance over the holiday season.The James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" grossed an estimated $5.7M, off 36 percent, to put its total at $137.6M for Sony. New Line’s Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" once again enjoyed the smallest drop in the top ten dipping a mere 18percent to an estimated $4.7M for a $23.1M cume. The family comedy \"Unaccompanied Minors\" followed in the ten spot with an estimated $3.7M, off 37percent, giving Warner Bros. a poor $10.2M to date.Opening to spectacular results, thanks in part to its $25 ticket price, was the big-budget musical \"Dreamgirls\" from DreamWorks and Paramount with an estimated $360,000 from only three theaters for an unprecedented $120,000 average. Winner of five Golden Globe nominations including Best Picture in the comedy/musical category, the PG-13 pic was given a special exclusive release in solo houses in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. For the extra cash, ticket buyers were given a Broadway-style experience with reserved seating and a limited-edition program book. At a more standard adult ticket price of $10, that would translate to an average of about $48,000 which is still phenomenal. The studios reported that all 21 shows over the weekend were sold out. Starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, \"Dreamgirls\" opens nationally on Christmas Day in over 800 theaters.Also platforming this weekend was the George Clooney starrer \"The Good German\" which opened to an estimated $79,000 from just five locations for a solid $15,800 average. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the R-rated film co-stars Cate Blanchett and Tobey Maguire and follows an American war reporter’s escapades in Germany.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" fell 50 percent to an estimated $3M in its fourth assignment putting the total at $57.8M. Buena Vista should find its way to the neighborhood of $65M. Opening just five days after rival action pic \"Casino Royale\" has proven to be a major obstacle for \"Deja Vu\" which will end up with less than half the gross of the better-received Bond flick.Fox’s holiday comedy \"Deck the Halls\" has also faced stiff competition for its target audience. The Danny DeVito pic took in an estimated $2M this weekend, down 50 percent, for a $32.9M cume. A $40M final seems likely. Disney’s \"The Santa Clause 3\" dropped 43 percent to an estimated $1.9M giving the studio $79.8M thus far. Tim Allen and pals should reach the $85M mark, or about 40 percent below the $139.2M of \"Clause 2\" from four years ago.Elsewhere below the top ten, Golden Globe nominees for Best Picture posted good numbers. Fox’s \"Borat,\" nominated for both Picture and Best Actor in the comedy/musical category, slipped 39 percent to an estimated $1.6M for a $122.8M total to date. The raunchy comedy had fallen by more than 45 percent in each of the last two weekends. Miramax’s \"The Queen\" slipped only 22 percent to an estimated $685,000 for a $25.7M cume in its eleventh consecutive weekend in the Top 20. Fellow Best Picture nominee in the drama category \"Babel,\" which led all films with seven total Globe nominations, saw its weekend gross inch up 7 percent to an estimated $490,000 despite losing over one-third of its theaters. Paramount Vantage has taken in $18.3M so far and hopes that the nominations will allow the ensemble film to remain a relevant box office player through the holidays.The top ten films grossed an estimated $107.3M which was down 10 percent from last year when \"King Kong\" opened at number one with $50.1M; but up 13 percent from 2004 when \"Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events\" debuted in the top spot with $30.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"BBC, FOX, VICE, Country, HBO, toronto, rings, elevated","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Moviegoers-Get-Jiggy-with-Happyness"},{"id":"47509157182554","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Epic Movie\" Conquers Box Office","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: \"Epic Movie\" Conquers Box Officeby Gitesh Pandya | January 29, 2007 |  CommentsProving that there’s always money in spoof comedies, Fox’s \"Epic Movie\" shot straight to number one over the weekend in its debut frame beating out three other new releases plus a handful of expanding Academy Award contenders. In fact, the immature laugher outgrossed all five Oscar nominees for best picture combined.The crime drama \"Smokin’ Aces\" and the Jennifer Garner dramedy \"Catch and Release\" both enjoyed good results in their opening weekends, however the new horror flick \"Blood and Chocolate\" failed to even make the top ten. Most holdovers remained strong as the overall marketplace bounced back from last weekend’s dismal results.Matching the numbers it posted a year ago with \"Date Movie,\" Fox struck again with \"Epic Movie\" which topped the charts with an estimated $19.2M from 2,801 theaters. The PG-13 film lampooned several recent box office action hits and averaged a solid $6,855 per site. \"Date Movie\" skewered numerous romantic comedies and bowed to a similar $19.1M last February over the three-day portion of the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, whose writing credits include \"Date Movie,\" \"Spy Hard,\" and the entire \"Scary Movie\" series, wrote and directed \"Epic.\" Teenagers made up a large portion of the audience and both genders were well-represented. Critics who did bother to review it trashed the film.\"Epic Movie\": 0 percent Tomatometer, $19 million openingOpening in second place with impressive results and similar per-theater success was Universal’s mob thriller \"Smokin’ Aces\" with an estimated $14.3M from 2,218 locations. Averaging a commendable $6,430 per site, the frame’s only new R-rated pic connected with young men as its primary audience. According to studio research, 59% of the audience was male and 57% was 25 or older. \"Smokin’\" stars Jeremy Piven, Andy Garcia, and Alicia Keys and cost less than $20M to produce which should make it a profitable venture when all worldwide rights are exploited. The film also opened at number one in Russia this weekend with $1.7M and has grossed an additional $5.3M from the United Kingdom after its third weekend.Alicia Keys, in her big-screen debutThe unstoppable blockbuster comedy \"Night at the Museum\" enjoyed yet another small decline sliding only 21% in its sixth weekend to an estimated $9.5M. The Ben Stiller–Robin Williams smash has pumped its cume up to $216.7M and will soon join the top 50 domestic blockbusters of all-time.Jennifer Garner generated respectable results for her latest film \"Catch and Release\" which was not given a very wide release, but still sold an estimated $8M in ticket stubs. Averaging a solid $4,932 from 1,622 playdates, the PG-13 film about a woman rebuilding her life after her husband’s death played heavily female. According to Sony’s research, an overwhelming 75% of the crowd consisted of women and 58% was 25 or older. \"Catch\" cost $25M to produce and opened smaller than her previous headlining efforts \"13 Going on 30\" ($21.1M in 2004) and \"Elektra\" ($12.8M in 2005). Reviews were mostly negative.\"Catch and Release\": At 22 percent, it’s better than \"Elektra\"Sony’s \"Stomp the Yard,\" 2007’s top-grossing new release, slipped only 37% and took fifth with an estimated $7.8M. Total stands at an impressive $50.7M.A quartet of Oscar-nominated films followed. Paramount’s musical \"Dreamgirls,\" which led all films with eight Academy Award nominations, expanded from 2,214 to 2,785 sites and grossed an estimated $6.6M. That represented a slim 17% drop in sales from last weekend but a steeper 34% fall in the per-theater average which was $2,376. Cume to date is $86.7M. Despite not earning a best picture nomination, \"Dreamgirls\" is still holding up well and posting relatively low declines.\"And You, And You, And You…You’re Gonna Snub Me\"Also showing durability was Will Smith‘s \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which earned the box office star an Academy nod for best actor. The Sony blockbuster dipped only 21% to an estimated $5M pushing its sum to $152.9M. \"Pursuit\" did not have any expansion, but instead lost 378 theaters and still witnessed a decline similar to that of \"Dreamgirls\" which scored many more Oscar nominations and added hundreds of playdates to its run.The fantasy tale \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" widened from 609 to 823 sites and grossed an estimated $4.5M equaling its gross from last weekend. Nominated in six different categories, the Mexican film saw its per-theater average dip 26% from last weekend to a still-solid $5,474. Total is $16.3M for the Picturehouse release.\"The Queen\" saw a healthy bump in sales and ranked ninth for the weekend with an estimated $4M, up 18%, for a $41.2M sum to date. Miramax added 244 additional venues and saw its average inch up 2% to $2,186.Rounding out the top ten was a film that has approximately zero chance of earning any Academy Award nominations a year from now. The horror film \"The Hitcher\" tumbled 54% in its second weekend to an estimated $3.6M giving Focus only $13.4M to date. A $16-18M final seems likely.Opening poorly outside of the top ten was yet another horror film, the werewolf thriller \"Blood and Chocolate,\" which bowed to only $2.1M according to estimates. The PG-13 film attacked 1,200 theaters and averaged a weak $1,753 per venue for MGM.With last Tuesday’s Academy Award nominations putting several films into the media spotlight, distributors took the opportunity to expand their contenders and saw increased weekend grosses, even though averages were mostly not very impressive. Best picture candidate \"The Departed,\" which was near the end of its theatrical run after opening in early October, went back into national release and grossed an estimated $3M. Averaging $2,096 per site in 1,453 locations, the Martin Scorsese crime saga upped its cume to $124.9M. Its best picture rival \"Babel\" widened to 1,090 playdates and grossed an estimated $2.6M for a $2,368 average. Sales were up 25% from last weekend while the average inched up 2% with the total reaching $27.2M.Clint Eastwood‘s \"Letters From Iwo Jima,\" which has been holding back much of its release in anticipation of Oscar nods, added 55 theaters to its run and surged 26% to an estimated $1.7M. The Warner Bros. release averaged a decent but not spectacular $4,120 from 415 locations. The average increased a healthy 9% from last weekend and the subtitled film has collected $4.9M to date as \"Letters\" remained the lowest-grossing best picture nominee by far. But much potential could still be ahead of it.Among films with high profile acting nominations, Fox Searchlight’s \"Notes on a Scandal\" more than tripled its run to 640 theaters and grossed an estimated $2.5M as the weekend take doubled. The Judi Dench–Cate Blanchett pic averaged $3,978 per playdate and has taken in $9M thus far. The distributor’s Forest Whitaker drama \"The Last King of Scotland\" remained mostly steady with its theater count and saw its gross inch up 3% to an estimated $1.7M for a $7.7M total. Sony Classics more than quadrupled the run of Penelope Cruz‘s \"Volver\" and took in an estimated $1.2M from 689 sites. The average was diluted down to just $1,671 as the total climbed to $8.9M.The industry often looks at a film’s box office boost on the weekend after Academy Award nominations are announced to determine how much gold an Oscar nod is worth. But what is often overlooked is the additional marketing and distribution expense that is invested by a distributor to create new marketing materials, buy more advertising, and ship extra prints out across the country. Expanding these films in a crowded marketplace is not cheap, but studios do believe that there are long-term benefits to be gained by the added attention like extra momentum in overseas and video markets, plus possibly some added votes from Academy members. In addition, it is difficult to separate the sales that are due directly to the Oscar attention from those that would have occured anyway even if no nominations came through.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Paramount’s high school drama \"Freedom Writers\" dipped 33% to an estimated $3.5M in its fourth session. The Hilary Swank pic has grossed a respectable $31.3M to date and should finish with about $36-38M. The MGM family release \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" dropped 46% to an estimated $1.7M for a $11.5M cume. A disappointing $14M final seems likely.Universal’s futuristic drama \"Children of Men\" scored three Oscar nominations, but it meant little to its ticket sales. The R-rated drama fell 46% to an estimated $2M lifting the sum to $30.7M. The Alfonso Cuaron-directed film should conclude with around $35M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.4M which was down 12% from last year when \"Big Momma’s House 2\" opened at number one with $27.7M; and down 16% from 2005 when \"Hide and Seek\" debuted on top with $22M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Best, Country, Christmas, razzies","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Epic-Movie-Conquers-Box-Office"},{"id":"47509158691941","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Dragons and Webs Duke It Out at Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Dragons and Webs Duke It Out at Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | December 14, 2006 |  CommentsHollywood studios try to inject some juice into the North American box office this weekend by unleashing three big new releases aimed at getting people back into the habit of going to the movies.Boys will be courted with the fantasy adventure pic \"Eragon,\" girls will get to play with \"Charlotte’s Web,\" and adults looking for a feel-good story to counter their holiday shopping blues will have the father-and-son Smith team in \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\"The dragon tale \"Eragon\" attacks the cinemas on Friday giving fantasy audiences the entertainment they’ve been missing this holiday season. Fox’s PG-rated actioner will try to fill a void in a season without a \"Potter,\" \"Narnia,\" or \"Hobbit.\" Don’t expect grosses to come close to the numbers posted by those megahits, but if \"Eragon\" can still reach a portion of that huge audience, the studio will be happy. Ordinarily, the effects-driven film would probably have a tough time at the box office but thanks to a severe lack of competition, Fox has a golden opportunity. The marketing push has been strong and young males have little else to be excited by. Gamers might also be interested in seeing this adventure on the big screen and leave behind their new hardware for a couple of hours. A built-in audience of readers of the book will help too. Landing in 3,020 theaters, \"Eragon\" could open with around $23M this weekend.The latest fantasy novel turned fantasy epic: \"Eragon.\"The beloved children’s story \"Charlotte’s Web\" hits the multiplexes with Hollywood’s favorite young girl Dakota Fanning in the lead role. Paramount’s G-rated tale will aim for family audiences and is using the starpower of voice actors Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey, and John Cleese to connect with parents. With \"Happy Feet\" being the only major family film to do well over the past few weeks, kids should be ready to move on to something new. Girls will probably outnumber the boys here especially with \"Eragon\" opening at the same time. But the brand is known and the rating is tame so parents will look at this as a safe bet for their younger ones. Good reviews will help too. With children going on their school holidays soon, look for long-term strength as many will wait until Christmas week to go and see it. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"Charlotte’s Web\" might take in about $21M this weekend.\"Charlotte’s Web,\" no longer in animated form.Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden Smith hit the big screen together in Sony’s uplifting drama \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which aims to give adult moviegoers something to see this weekend. Based on the true story of Chris Gardner, the PG-13 film tells the story of a man who hits hard times and becomes homeless and moonlights during the day in a stock broker training program hoping for a new lease on life. \"Pursuit\" has gotten Smith some notice for his acting performance (including a Golden Globe nomination) and the novelty of seeing father and son in a movie together will certainly help sell tickets. The man in black has some of the strongest pull among Hollywood stars at the box office with appeal that transcends all age, race, and gender lines. It’s no wonder that he is now pursuing his tenth $100M blockbuster.Reviews have been mixed for the film overall even though Smith is hearing buzz about a possible Oscar nomination. Sony must have been hoping for better reactions from critics though. Instead, the studio will appeal directly to adult moviegoers and their desire to see an uplifting feel-good story anchored by a popular star at this time of year. Don’t expect \"Pursuit\" to reach the levels of the actor’s last film \"Hitch\" which bowed to $43.1M from 3,575 theaters for a $12,068 average. But if good word-of-mouth circulates, it could stay in the top ten throughout the holiday season and go on to be a winner. Appeal looks solid with both men and women plus a strong turnout from African Americans will help to boost the grosses. Opening in 2,852 theaters, \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" might debut with around $19M.Will Smith and son, playing Chris Gardner and son, in \"The Pursuit of Happyness.\"Opening with special solo engagements in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco is the lavish musical \"Dreamgirls\" starring Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson. Paramount and DreamWorks are putting on a special live roadshow performance with these engageemnts for ten days before the film expands across the country on December 25. In New York City, \"Dreamgirls\" opens exclusively at the giant Ziegfeld theater which has already sold out its five weekend performances. With a giant auditorium of 1,200 seats and ticket prices of $25, look for this one theater to contribute over $100,000 to the weekend gross. West Coast venues hope to contribute similar numbers. Though the gross will be inflated by the ticket price, sky high demand thanks to critics awards, Globe nods, and Oscar buzz has already led to Friday’s opening night shows in California to sell out as well.\"Dreamgirls,\" opening in limited locations.Other new films entering the marketplace in limited release include Steven Soderbergh‘s World War II drama \"The Good German\" starring George Clooney, Cate Blanchett, and Tobey Maguire from Warner Bros. MGM counters with its Iraq War drama \"Home of the Brave\" starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jessica Biel, Christina Ricci, and 50 Cent. The Weinstein Company platforms the Jude Law thriller \"Breaking and Entering\" from director Anthony Minghella in an Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles.Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson in \"Home of the Brave.\"Among holdovers, last weekend’s top film \"Apocalypto\" moves into its all-important second weekend which will indicate what type of staying power Mel Gibson‘s latest film has. Curiousity and media hype helped to bring out moviegoers on the first weekend, but will they keep coming? The Buena Vista release fared much better than expected on Sunday grossing $840,000 more than originally expected. The studio expected a Sunday drop of 38% but was pleased to see the bloody epic dip only 23%. This weekend’s three new offerings do not look to give too much of a direct threat to \"Apocalypto\" so a 35% drop may in order. That would give the Mayan adventure about $9M for the frame and $29M in ten days.Warner Bros. will see some competition for its penguin blockbuster \"Happy Feet,\" but its hit toon has been holding up quite well each week. A 35% fall would leave \"Feet\" with around $8.5M and allow it to flirt with the $150M mark. Sony’s \"The Holiday\" got off to a decent but not spectacular start with its $12.8M bow. The Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet starrer may slide 35% to roughly $8.5M pushing the total to $25M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Leaping into the number one spot, although with less muscle than expected, Peter Jackson‘s \"King Kong\" opened with $50.1M over the weekend and $66.2M over its five-day debut. Universal’s mega-budgeted ape flick went on to gross a commendable $218.1M domestically and $549M worldwide which fell a bit short of the film’s lofty expectations given its budget and filmmaker. \"Kong\" knocked fellow effects-driven actioner \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" to second place with $31.8M dropping 51% in its sophomore frame. \"Narnia\" would eventually climb back into the top spot. Debuting in third was the romantic comedy \"The Family Stone\" starring Sarah Jessica Parker with $12.5M on its way to $60.1M for Fox. Warner Bros. rounded out the top five with \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" which grossed $6M and \"Syriana\" which collected $5.6M. No other films dared to open against \"King Kong,\" however the critically acclaimed \"Brokeback Mountain\" expanded to just 69 theaters in its second weekend and jumped into the top ten with $2.5M for a scorching $36,355 average.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"El, Trailer, Crunchyroll, kaiju, women, Anna, films, Television, bond","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Dragons-and-Webs-Duke-It-Out-at-Theaters"},{"id":"47509157191772","title":"Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stomp Still Sits at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Wrapup: Stomp Still Sits at #1by Gitesh Pandya | January 22, 2007 |  CommentsBox office sales slumped this weekend as the top ten dipped to its worst level in four months with the college dance pic \"Stomp the Yard\" holding onto the top spot by a thin margin. Moviegoers ignored \"The Hitcher,\" the frame’s only new wide release, which posted an underwhelming fourth-place debut. A handful of Oscar contenders expanded into wider release and saw encouraging results hoping to collect steady sales from serious film lovers in the weeks ahead. Overall, the marketplace was quiet as the gross for the number one film and the cume for the top ten were both the lowest since mid-September.\"Stomp the Yard\" spent another weekend at the top.Sony’s low-budget hit \"Stomp the Yard\" spent another weekend at the top of the charts grossing an estimated $13.3M dropping only 39% in its sophomore frame. The PG-13 hit showed a healthy hold since most films catering to teen and young adult audiences fall by 45% or more on the second weekend. After ten days, the $14M-budgeted pic has grossed a stellar $41.6M and is on its way to reaching $65-70M. \"Stomp\" averaged a solid $6,485 from 2,051 theaters in its second step.Close behind in second place was the Fox juggernaut \"Night at the Museum\" which took in an estimated $13M, off only 24%, boosting the cume to $205.8M. On Saturday, the PG-rated Ben Stiller film became the sixth 2006 release to join the double century club. \"Museum\" now ranks fifth among last year’s releases and is likely to surpass the $217.5M of \"The Da Vinci Code\" to end off as the fourth biggest blockbuster released in 2006. With no major family films getting in its way in the coming weeks, \"Museum\" could find its way to nearly $240M from North America alone and over $450M worldwide.\"Dreamgirls\" saw a rise in its popularity after Gloden Globes wins.Thanks to a trio of Golden Globes and 307 additional theaters, the hit musical \"Dreamgirls\" saw its Friday-to-Sunday gross inch up 4% to an estimated $8.7M Averaging a respectable $3,935 from 2,214 sites in its fourth full weekend of national play, the Paramount/DreamWorks pic upped its cume to $78.1M and is easily on its way to joining the $100M club. The studio continues to spend lavishly on advertising and is eagerly anticipating Tuesday’s announcement of the Academy Award nominations. \"Dreamgirls\" is widely considered a shoo-in for a nomination for Best Picture, along with \"The Departed\" and \"Babel.\"Showing that horror fans may be getting sick of Hollywood’s endless line of fright film remakes, \"The Hitcher\" opened to disappointing results in fourth place with only $8.2M, according to estimates. The redo of the 1986 Rutger Hauer flick averaged only $2,904 from a very wide 2,835 theaters for Focus and its Rogue Pictures genre unit. The R-rated film was expected to perform better given that it was the only new choice for teens and young adults and the fact that it was given the widest bow in company history for its distributor. The strong hold for \"Stomp the Yard\" and the solid expansion of \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" which is pulling in fantasy and horror fans, may have contributed to the soft bow.\"The Hitcher\" is not exactly catching fire at the B.O.\"The Hitcher\" is the latest in a string of disappointments for Focus following \"Catch a Fire\" and \"The Return.\" Since last winter’s Oscar-winning film \"Brokeback Mountain\" lassoed $83M, the distributor has seen most of its films underperform. The company saw an average domestic gross of just $13.4M from its eight wide releases in 2006 with \"Jet Li’s Fearless\" being its top grosser with $24.6M.Will Smith’s \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" clocked its sixth weekend in the top five and grossed an estimated $6.7M, off only 25%, for a $146.5M cume. Sony should finish in the vicinity of $160M. Paramount’s Hilary Swank drama \"Freedom Writers\" followed with an estimated $5.6M, down just 24%, giving the pic $26.9M in 17 days. Look for the film to end in the $35-40M range.Guillermo del Toro‘s fantasy thriller \"Pan’s Labyrinth\" jumped into the top ten thanks to its national expansion and claimed the number seven spot with an estimated $4.7M. The Picturehouse release enjoyed the best average among all wide releases taking in $7,759 per theater from 609 locations. Cume is $10.2M for the Spanish-language film. The futuristic drama \"Children of Men\" from director Alfonso Cuaron followed falling 42% to an estimated $3.7M for Universal pushing the cume to $27.5M.Helen Mirren in \"The Queen.\"Also collecting an estimated $3.7M in ticket sales over the weekend was Miramax’s \"The Queen\" which expanded from 344 to 1,586 theaters following its two Golden Globe wins for lead actress and screenplay. Averaging a mild $2,333 per site, the acclaimed drama hit the top ten for only the second time in its long 17-week run and posted its best weekend gross to date. It had always played in fewer than 800 theaters until now and the distributor hopes that the Globe wins, plus the expected Oscar nominations on Tuesday, will allow the Helen Mirren film to appeal to a wider audience going forward. Total stands at $35.9M and counting. Rounding out the top ten was MGM’s \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" with an estimated $3.1M, down 28%, for a $9.3M cume. A final gross of around $15M seems likely.The box office had a very international flavor this weekend as seven of the top twelve films were directed by filmmakers born outside of the United States.Three films dropped out of the top ten over the weekend. Universal’s kidnapping thriller \"Alpha Dog\" tumbled 55% in its second frame and took in an estimated $2.9M. With only $11.7M in the bank, the ensemble pic should sputter to a disappointing $15-17M final tally. Also crumbling in its sophomore frame was the horror film \"Primeval\" which crashed 70% and grossed $1.8M, according to estimates. Buena Vista has scared up just $9.5M in ten days and looks to conclude its run quickly with a poor $11M.Paramount’s kidpic \"Charlotte’s Web\" has fared better over the holiday season and grossed an estimated $2.3M this weekend, down 40%. The family film has accumulated a solid $76.7M to date and should end its run with around $80M. Web bowed in mid-December with half the opening weekend gross of competing new release \"Eragon,\" but has now outgrossed the dragon adventure which currently stands at $72.4M.\"Babel\" took home a Golden Globe for Best Picture in Drama.A trio of Golden Globe winners expanded their runs and climbed up the charts. Paramount Vantage’s \"Babel,\" which took home the Best Picture — Drama trophy, re-expanded from 173 to 889 theaters and took in an estimated $2.3M for a $23.9M total to date. Fox Searchlight boosted its cume for \"The Last King of Scotland\" by 50% in one short weekend. The Forest Whitaker pic widened to 495 locations, from just four from last weekend, and collected an estimated $1.8M raising the total from $3.7M to $5.5M. Warner Bros. went from 35 to 360 locations for Clint Eastwood’s \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" which grossed an estimated $1.5M pushing the tally to $2.6M. Though not eligible for the Academy Award in the foreign language department, the Japanese-lingo pic is still considered a contender in the other Oscar categories.The top ten films grossed an estimated $70.7M which was off a disturbing 19% from last year when \"Underworld: Evolution\" opened at number one with $26.9M; and down 10% from 2005 when \"Are We There Yet?\" debuted on top with $18.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Horror, franchise","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Wrapup-Stomp-Still-Sits-at-1"},{"id":"47509157206111","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Can Sony \"Stomp\" the \"Museum?\"","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Can Sony \"Stomp\" the \"Museum?\"by Gitesh Pandya | January 11, 2007 |  CommentsCan Ben Stiller and his living artifacts four-peat at the top of the North American box office, or will one of the new releases take the crown over the four-day Dr. Martin Luther King holiday weekend? Ticket buyers will decide.Leading the freshman class is the dance drama \"Stomp the Yard\" which could have breakout potential. Also opening are the fantasy pic \"Arthur and the Invisibles,\" the drug dealer pic \"Alpha Dog,\" and the horror flick \"Primeval.\" With so many schools closed on Monday, the new films are targeting students of all ages who will have extra time on their hands.The west and east coasts meet in \"Stomp the Yard,\" a story of a Los Angeles student enrolled in an Atlanta university who uses his unique style to help his fraternity compete in a step dancing contest. The PG-13 film is short on starpower, but makes up for that with terrific marketing which is the real ingredient that will put asses into the seats. Sony has cut exciting trailers and commercial spots which should spark lots of interest with teens and young adults. Plus, MLK weekend is the perfect time to open a black college film since interest will be high for this particular subject matter. African American students will especially be out in solid numbers. However, the opening of Justin Timberlake‘s \"Alpha Dog\" could take away some of the young adult crowd.\"Stomp\" should appeal to the same audiences that delivered bigger-than-expected openings for \"Drumline\" ($12.6M opening, $6,865 average), \"ATL\" ($11.6M, $7,212), and \"You Got Served\" ($16.1M, $8,341). The urban youth of America possesses tremendous spending power and Hollywood has just woken up to this in recent years financing low cost flicks that return handsome profits through theatrical and DVD sales. \"Stomp\" also offers an appealing story relevant to today’s young people and looks to join this list. Stepping into 2,051 theaters, \"Stomp the Yard\" could collect about $16M over four days this weekend.An action shot from \"Stomp the Yard.\"The weekend’s only new kidpic comes in the form of the French production \"Arthur and the Invisibles,\" a groundbreaking feature which mixes live-action with animation in a fantasy tale. The PG-rated film from The Weinstein Co. is directed by action professional Luc Besson (\"The Fifth Element,\" \"Joan of Arc\") and features the voices of Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Snoop Dogg, and Madonna. With so many young children across the country having a long school holiday, \"Arthur\" should get some play as the only new option for parents who have taken enough trips to the Museum. Of course \"Happily N’Ever After\" flopping last weekend shows that family audiences will not come out for just anything. With about 2,500 theaters, it is the widest of the new titles which could help it get into double digit millions over the extended frame. The marketing push has been admirable too. MLK weekend has often seen better-than-expected results for debuting kiddie flicks like \"Kangaroo Jack,\" \"Racing Stripes,\" and \"Hoodwinked.\" \"Arthur and the Invisibles\" may carve out its share of the pie and gross roughly $11M over the four-day period.Those troll dolls have found a new purpose in \"Arthur and the Invisibles.\"Pop music king Justin Timberlake joins an ensemble cast which includes Emile Hirsch, Sharon Stone, and Bruce Willis in the gritty drama \"Alpha Dog.\" Directed by Nick Cassavetes, the R-rated film tells of a drug dealer who kidnaps the younger brother of a friend who owes a debt. The Universal release is based on true events and will target older teens and twentysomethings. The marketing makes the film look slick and cool plus JT provides a built-in audience of fans that can be tapped into.However, two main obstacles are in the way – the rating and competition from \"Stomp the Yard.\" A large portion of Timberlake’s fans are young teens and they will have a hard time buying tickets. Plus, \"Stomp\" will be distracting the urban youth with its slick look and milder PG-13 rating. On top of that, the studio’s release is not too wide. These factors should curtail the potential of \"Alpha.\" Critics have given solid support which may help a little, although Time Out New York boldly calls the pic the worst movie of the year in its zero-star review. Opening in about 1,200 theaters, \"Alpha Dog\" might bite down on around $8M over the long weekend.Timberlake gets down in \"Alpha Dog.\"Every horror film since Halloween has flopped and the streak looks to continue with \"Primeval\" from Buena Vista. The R-rated film about a news crew hunting down a killer boasts no starpower and lacks a compelling plot worthy of the ten-dollar bills of genre fans. Marketing support has been weak and awareness is not very high. The fright flick seems to have the same potential as last month’s \"Turistas\" which bowed to a weak $3.6M and $2,282 average. \"Primeval\" will open wider with about 2,000 theaters and has an extended four-day session so a gross of roughly $6M could result followed by steep drops.Zhang Yimou has seen solid but not spectacular averages for his latest Chinese epic \"Curse of the Golden Flower\" which has already grossed $2.2M from its limited release in about 60 theaters. Its average of $6,104 last weekend will drop considerably as it expands nationwide into about 1,200 playdates. The Mandarin-language period piece seems to be going too wide too fast and with all the choices in the multiplexes, Sony Classics may find it difficult to get multiplex crowds into all those new seats. \"Curse\" will try to play to fans of the \"Hero\" director, but Chow Yun Fat and Gong Li are no Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi at the American box office. A $4M gross over the long weekend could result.These horses must be suffering from \"The Curse of the Golden Flower.\"Ben Stiller and Will Smith have been inseparable blockbuster brothers atop the box office charts for the last three weeks. But the weekend’s new releases should finally cause a breakup. Stiller’s runaway smash \"Night at the Museum\" has been holding up incredibly well against any competition that has come its way and will attempt to become the first film since 2003’s \"The Return of the King\" to remain number one for four consecutive weekends. The only thing standing in its path is a possible teen explosion for \"Stomp.\" \"Museum’s\" four-day holiday gross could slip 25% from last weekend’s three-day figure giving the Fox hit about $18M and a remarkable cume to date of $187M.Smith has done pretty well for himself too with \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" which should see another solid turnout over MLK weekend. A 20% drop would give Sony a four-day tally of $10M boosting its total to a stellar $137M.Since it opened nationally on Christmas Day, \"Dreamgirls\" has been posting the best per-theater averages of any wide release. Now, Paramount will more than double the run and expand the Golden Globe nominee for Best Picture – Comedy or Musical from 852 to about 1,800 theaters. The Jamie Foxx–Beyonce Knowles musical is the favorite to take home that honor, plus other statues, and the studio wants to make sure the product is available everywhere once the wins occur. Plus, films with African American casts routinely do very well over the King frame so a jump in sales is assured. For the four-day period, \"Dreamgirls\" may climb to around $11M putting the cume at $68M. If it wins the Globe for Best Picture and secures a sizable number of Oscar nominations the following week, the total domestic take could certainly surpass the $100M mark as it did for \"Chicago\" four years ago. The Richard Gere musical reached a similar $63.8M at the end of the weekend it went fully national into 1,841 locations and went on to a sensational $170.7M final total.LAST YEAR: Disney kicked off the first of what would be many hit sports flicks in 2006 with the basketball drama \"Glory Road\" which opened at number one over MLK weekend with $16.9M over four days. The live action film barely beat out the animated comedy \"Hoodwinked\" which also grossed $16.9M over the Friday-to-Monday period, but was about $50,000 shy of the number one spot. The duo reached $42.6M and $51.2M, respectively. Third place also was held by a new release. Paramount’s Queen Latifah comedy \"Last Holiday\" bowed to a solid $15.5M on its way to $38.4M. Rounding out the top five were former number ones \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" with $12.8M and \"Hostel\" with $11.4M over the long weekend. Fox’s romance \"Tristan &amp; Isolde\" found few lovers in its debut opening to $7.6M on its way to just $14.7M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hard, slashers, halloween, Central, movies, australia, indiana, toronto, Month, Red","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Can-Sony-Stomp-the-Museum"},{"id":"47509157210209","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: New Year Brings New Crop of Pics","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: New Year Brings New Crop of Picsby Gitesh Pandya | January 4, 2007 |  CommentsThree new releases welcome in the new year this weekend, but moviegoers are likely to keep spending their cash on holiday holdovers.Family audiences have the new toon \"Happily N’Ever After,\" teens will be offered the drama \"Freedom Writers,\" and the comedy crowd will have \"Code Name: The Cleaner.\" Also, the sci-fi drama \"Children of Men\" expands across the country after a powerful debut last weekend in limited release. Early January is usually home to two kinds of films – weak pictures that can’t cut it during the competitive holiday season and acclaimed films expanding wider hoping for awards. This frame will see just that with current chart-topper \"Night at the Museum\" hoping for a third reign in the number one spot.Kids who have had enough of digital penguins will have a chance to see a new animated film this weekend with Lionsgate’s \"Happily N’Ever After.\" The PG-rated film tells the story of Fairy Tale World after Cinderella’s wicked stepmother takes charge. Sigourney Weaver, Andy Dick, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and hubby Freddie Prinze Jr. lend their voices. \"After\" has a funny premise and with \"Shrek the Third\" still four months away, some audiences may give this one a try for the time being. Last January, \"Hoodwinked\" posted some strong numbers playing to the same crowd and bowed to $16.9M over four days with a potent $7,051 average. \"Happily\" does not have the same marketing strength behind it plus it faces more competition. Last weekend, six films with G or PG ratings sold over $10Mworth of tickets over four days and even with heavy declines, there will be lots of choices for family audiences. Looking to attract the biggest opening among the three new films on Friday, \"Happily N’Ever After\" enters 2,381 theaters and may take in around $7M this weekend.The British animated import \"Happily N’Ever After.\"Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank takes the Michelle Pfeiffer route and plays a teacher schooling a group of inner city kids in \"Freedom Writers\" from Paramount and MTV Films. Directed by writer-turned-director Richard LaGravenese, the PG-13 film also stars \"Grey’s Anatomy\" hunk Patrick Dempsey. Teens and urban youngsters will make up the core audience here as Swank’s mature adult following will likely pass on this role. The actress just doesn’t have the commercial chops to anchor a film like this on her own and the buzz is not loud enough for this to become the next \"Dangerous Minds.\" Paramount is hoping that its push on MTV will help bring in the young vote, but the pic lacks the bang to make teens want to spend the bucks. Opening in about 1,200 theaters, \"Freedom Writers\" could debut with around $5M.Hilary Swank, conjuring Michelle Pfeiffer and Edward James Olmos in \"Freedom Writers.\"Also expected to put only a small dent into the box office this weekend is the comedy \"Code Name: The Cleaner\" starring Cedric the Entertainer and Lucy Liu. Pairing black and Asian actors in an action comedy worked wonders for \"Rush Hour,\" but here audiences will likely find the premise forced. Cedric plays a janitor who is duped into becoming an undercover agent and finds himself in the middle of an arms scandal. Both stars are great supporting players but neither has a track record of anchoring big hit films. Interested moviegoers will probably wait for the DVD. Look for the New Line release to also debut in the vicinity of $5M.\"Codename: The Cleaner\" isn’t expected to clean up at the boxoffice.Expanding nationwide on Friday into 1,200 locations after a powerful limited bow is Universal’s futuristic drama \"Children of Men.\" The Alfonso Cuaron-directed pic about the London of the future where no humans have been born in eighteen years stars Clive Owen, Julianne Moore, and Michael Caine. The R-rated film debuted to $702,982 from only 16 theaters for a sensational four-day average of $43,936. Serious adult moviegoers are the target audience here so the studio’s own CIA thriller \"The Good Shepherd\" will be the primary competitor. Reviews have been strong which will help. For the weekend, \"Children of Men\" could deliver roughly $7M.Clive Owen and his golden aura in \"Children of Men.\"Since the incoming line-up of films is not likely to do too much damage to the box office charts, it should be smooth sailing for \"Night at the Museum\" which looks to spend its third straight weekend at number one. \"Happily N’Ever After\" will take away a bit of the family crowd, but overall competition should not be too intense. Coming off of the holiday weekend, the Ben Stiller smash may drop 40% and collect $22M worth of tickets and push its stellar cume to $163M.Will Smith‘s Golden Globe-nominated performance in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" has kept moviegoers interested for three weeks. The Sony hit may slide 40% as well grossing $11.5M which would give the father-son venture $123M to date. \"Dreamgirls\" has been generating the best averages around since opening. Paramount could witness a 35% drop to around $9M for the frame and lift its cume to $55M.LAST YEAR: Horror fans powered the new fright flick \"Hostel\" to the number one spot over the first weekend of 2006 with a $19.6M debut. The low budget Lionsgate hit went on to scare up $47.3M. Holdovers filled up the rest of the top five. \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" slipped to second with $15.6M followed by \"King Kong\" with $12.6M. The comedies \"Fun with Dick and Jane\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen 2\" took up the next spots with $11.9M and $8.4M, respectively. The weekend’s two other new releases bombed miserably. Fox’s comedy \"Grandma’s Boy\" bowed to just $3M while the actioner \"BloodRayne\" barely made it into the Top 20 with $1.6M. Final grosses reached $6.1M and $2.4M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"news, Universal, movies, Century","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-New-Year-Brings-New-Crop-of-Pics"},{"id":"47509160142962","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Saw III Slices Up #1 Opening with $34M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Saw III Slices Up #1 Opening with $34Mby Gitesh Pandya | October 30, 2006 |  CommentsWith Halloween just around the corner, moviegoers rushed out to see the new horror sequel Saw III which enjoyed the biggest opening for the franchise and easily dominated the North American box office.The weekend’s other new release, the political thriller Catch a Fire, fared worse and opened outside of the top ten. With little new competition for older adults or families, holdover films in the top ten playing to those two audience segments witnessed good holds and dropped by less than 40% each. Overall, the marketplace was about even with last year’s when the second Saw dominated the charts.Saw III ripped into theaters and cut up an estimated $34.3M in ticket sales in its debut frame scoring the biggest opening for an R-rated film in nearly two and a half years. The brutal Jigsaw pic crushed the competition averaging a brutal $10,830 from 3,167 theaters and grossed more than the next four films combined. Lionsgate continued to grow its low budget October franchise. The first Saw opened this weekend in 2004 to $18.3M and reached $55.2M while its sequel bowed a year later to $31.7M on its way to $87M. Saw III, which was reportedly produced for only $12M, is already off to a stronger start with an opening that was 8% bloodier than its predecessor’s. The distrib also set new company records for both widest release and biggest opening weekend gross.The latest installment of the Saw series got off to a potent start on Friday grossing $14.4M before tumbling 21% on Saturday to $11.4M. A Friday-to-Saturday drop is not uncommon for heavily-hyped horror sequels. Sunday sales are estimated to dip only 25% to $8.5M. No R pic has opened this well since Brad Pitt‘s epic Troy with $46.9M in May 2004. Based on the history of the franchise with Halloween providing a boost, but subsequent weekends dropping hard, the torture trilogy could boost its combined domestic tally to a stunning $230M. Combined production budgets amount to less than one-tenth of that figure. Lionsgate has no plans to shut down its cash machine and is developing Saw IV for a Halloween 2007 release.For the third consecutive weekend, Martin Scorsese‘s mob hit The Departed was the nation’s second most popular film and grossed an estimated $9.8M. Dipping only 27% in its fourth frame, the Warner Bros. release has now made off with a sturdy $91.1M and looks headed for at least $125M domestically thanks to its terrific legs. The Departed is the studio’s second biggest film of 2006 after the $200M of the megabudgeted Superman Returns.Falling from first to third place was the dueling magicians tale The Prestige with an estimated $9.6M, off a respectable 35%. After ten days, the Buena Vista release has collected $28.8M and seems headed towards the $50-55M range. In its sophomore frame, the Hugh Jackman–Christian Bale thriller still averaged a solid $4,220 per theater.Clint Eastwood‘s war drama Flags of Our Fathers added more guns to its run with 314 additional theaters, but still slumped 38% in its second weekend to an estimated $6.4M. After ten days, the $90M Paramount release has taken in just $19.9M and did not hold up as well as previous films from the Oscar-winning director. In their second weekends of wide release, Mystic River dropped only 25% in October 2003 while Million Dollar Baby dipped just 31% in February 2005. Plus, neither film had a major expansion of screens. Flags saw its per-theater average fall 47% from last weekend to only $2,900. The World War II pic seems headed for a poor finish of around $40M. Overseas prospects also do not seem too bright as American military pics are not the most popular exports to come out of Hollywood.Still the top-grossing movie for kids for the fifth straight weekend was Sony’s Open Season with an estimated $6.1M, down only 25%, for a robust $77.4M cume. Fox’s horse drama Flicka dropped a reasonable 35% in its second weekend to an estimated $5M as it faced no new competition for family audiences. With $14.1M in ten days, the PG-rated film could finish up with a respectable $26-28M and do better on DVD early next year. Universal’s Man of the Year dropped 32% to an estimated $4.7M giving the Robin Williams comedy $28.9M to date.Sony rounded out the top ten with the final three flicks. The horror sequel The Grudge 2 scared up an estimated $3.3M, down 57%, to put its total at $36M after 17 days. The Kirsten Dunst period piece Marie Antoinette tumbled an alarming 47% in its second weekend grossing an estimated $2.9M. With a mere $9.8M in ten days, the Sofia Coppola pic should conclude with a disappointing $14-16M.The studio also expanded its dysfunctional family comedy Running with Scissors from eight theaters in limited release last weekend to 586 locations nationally this weekend. Following its potent platform lauch, the Annette Bening film performed to moderate results nationwide with an estimated $2.6M for a mediocre $4,352 average. Cume to date stands at $2.9M for Scissors which was not well-liked by critics.Focus Features’ apartheid thriller Catch a Fire opened to weak results in moderate national release bowing to an estimated $2M from 1,306 theaters for a mild $1,541 average. Directed by Phillip Noyce (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger), the PG-13 film stars Tim Robbins and Derek Luke and earned mostly positive reviews. Fire tried to perform like the distributor’s Africa-set thriller from last fall, The Constant Gardener. That film also boasted good reviews, some starpower, and a similar number of theaters. But Gardener opened in early September over the Labor Day holiday frame with a three-day bow of $8.7M from 1,346 theaters for a solid $6,444 average. Its timing could have played a big part in the more successful debut since there are usually very few serious movies for adults at the end of summer. Fire opened at the end of a two-month period that followed a string of ten fall films aimed at older adult moviegoers.An internationally-set film that did connect with moviegoers was the Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett drama Babel which debuted in New York and Los Angeles in only seven theaters but grossed an estimated $366,000 for a colossal $52,258 average. The R-rated film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (21 Grams, Amores Perros) and followed separate stories in Morocco, Mexico, and Japan which become interlinked. Reviews were very good and the film won the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Despite each of the seven locations playing the film on two or three screens, Babel still sold out numerous shows over the weekend. Paramount Vantage will expand the film on Friday into 13 new markets for a total of about 35 theaters and go national on November 10 into about 1,200 total playdates.The Weinstein Company got off to a solid start with its political documentary Shut Up and Sing which took in an estimated $51,000 from four theaters for an impressive $12,750 average. The R-rated film follows the musical trio The Dixie Chicks and how their lives were affected by remarks against President George W. Bush. Reviews were very favorable.Among notable holdovers in limited release, Miramax’s The Queen continued its slow but steady expansion widening again from 99 to 152 locations in its fifth session. The acclaimed Helen Mirren pic grossed an estimated $1.9M, averaging a strong $12,638, and lifted its cume to $6.3M. Parent company Disney saw its Halloween treat The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D hold in 168 special engagements and took in an estimated $1.8M. Down 45% from its debut, the Tim Burton animated pic has grossed $5.9M in ten days and averaged $10,815 for the frame.A pair of October titles fell from the top ten this weekend. Fox’s The Marine dropped 48% to an estimated $2M in its third assignment and pushed its sum to $15.5M. Look for a weak $18-20M finish for the John Cena actioner. New Line saw its fright flick Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning tumble bringing its cume to $38M to date. The horror prequel will struggle to get to $40M giving it half of the $80.1M of 2003’s Chainsaw remake.The top ten films grossed an estimated $84.6M which was up a scant 2% from last year when Saw II debuted at number one with $31.7M; but off 5% from 2004 when The Grudge remained in the top spot with $21.8M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"TBS, Amazon, rotten, Food, Disney, Hallmark, TCA, canceled, Family, Mudbound, Oscars, News, 71st, SDCC, globes","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Saw-III-Slices-Up-1-Opening-with-34M"},{"id":"47509160147060","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Prestige Defeats Flags for #1 Spot","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Prestige Defeats Flags for #1 Spotby Gitesh Pandya | October 22, 2006 |  CommentsThree well-reviewed dramas fought over the weekend box office crown, but it was a pair of dueling magicians that North American moviegoers chose first as The Prestige opened at the top of the charts. Close behind was the mob thriller The Departed which remained strong in its third weekend while Clint Eastwood‘s new war saga Flags of our Fathers settled for a third place debut.The weekend’s two other new releases targeted young females and found their way into the top ten as well. The family drama Flicka stumbled in wide release while the period pic Marie Antoinette did respectable business in moderate release. Overall ticket sales fell from last weekend, but were still up sharply versus a year ago.Leaving behind their super hero tights, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale topped the box office with The Prestige which opened to an estimated $14.8M. Averaging a strong $6,496 from 2,281 theaters, the PG-13 pic about two turn-of-the-century magicians who compete for tricks and the heart of a young woman was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins). Bale reteamed with Nolan after playing the Caped Crusader while Jackman took three turns playing Wolverine in the X-Men films. The Prestige scored good marks from critics and co-starred Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, and David Bowie. With ample starpower, the period drama beat out its rivals to win the weekend and won a decisive victory over fellow freshman Flags which was expected to make a more competitive play for the number one spot. The Prestige also grossed an estimated $1M from international bows this weekend in Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan.Remaining in second place for the second straight weekend was Martin Scorsese‘s smash hit The Departed which dipped only 28% to an estimated $13.7M. After 17 days, the Leonardo DiCaprio–Matt Damon crime saga has taken in a potent $77.1M and is on a course to reach $110-120M or more depending on how long its sturdy legs last. The Warner Bros. release averaged an impressive $4,551 from 3,005 theaters in its third mission and is already the fall season’s top-grossing film. Overseas, Departed grossed an estimated $5.1M from 13 markets boosting its international cume to $25.3M. It ranks number one in the United Kingdom and Australia. The global gross for the Jack Nicholson mob pic has broken through the $100M mark with many more countries still to open. The undercover saga infiltrates Italy and Spain on Friday, and rolls into Brazil, France, and Germany in the weeks ahead followed by Japan in January.Clint Eastwood, who beat Scorsese at the Oscars in 2005, saw his newest directorial effort Flags of our Fathers lose out in its box office battle against his old rival. The World War II pic debuted to an estimated $10.2M from 1,876 theaters to claim third place. Averaging a good, but not spectacular, $5,437 per location, the Paramount release played to a much older male crowd. Studio research showed that a whopping 80% of the audience was over the age of 30 while men made up 55%. Reviews were good, but critics were not as supportive as they were for Eastwood’s last two films Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River.Budgeted at $90M, Flags was easily the filmmaker’s most ambitious project to date and told of the American soldiers who were photographed in Iwo Jima during the final years of the war. Eastwood pics are not known for their powerful openings as his fans typically take their time coming to theaters to see his films. It would be pointless to compare the box office of Flags to Baby since the latter was rolled out over time during Oscar season and didn’t open nationally until its seventh weekend right after it scored seven Academy Award nominations. However, it would be fair to compare Flags to Mystic which debuted nationally in its second frame to the tune of $10.4M from 1,467 theaters for a more potent $7,120 average. With less starpower and somewhat weaker reviews, the war tale generated an opening weekend average that was 24% smaller than River’s. Still, the road ahead for Flags could be durable as an encouraging 90% of those polled found it to be \"excellent\" or \"very good\".Warner Bros. found itself with a piece of all three of the weekend’s top films serving as a co-producer on each film. The studio is handling both The Prestige and Flags overseas. The latter pic was co-financed with DreamWorks which is handling it domestically through its new parent Paramount.The fall season’s only kids hit Open Season remained a strong contender grossing an estimated $8M for fourth place. Down only 28%, the animated Sony title has boosted its cume to $69.6M and now looks like it has a chance to flirt with the $100M mark and become the second biggest film in the September-October corridor after The Departed.Opening in fifth place with not-so-impressive results was the girl-and-her-horse drama Flicka which bowed to an estimated $7.7M from a very wide 2,877 theaters for a weak $2,676 average. Fox’s PG-rated family film performed a bit below the $9.2M opening of last year’s Dreamer, another story of a young girl and her steed, which galloped into theaters this very weekend playing to the same audience. The budget for Flicka was only $14M.Tied for fifth place was last weekend’s number one film The Grudge 2 which also scared up an estimated $7.7M, but tumbled a steep 63% in its sophomore frame. Sony’s horror sequel has taken in $31.4M in ten days which is less than half of the $70.7M that its 2004 predecessor grossed over the same period. The first Grudge held up much better dropping 44% in its second weekend despite facing the powerful launch of the first Saw pic. Budgeted at $20M, The Grudge 2 looks to reach $40-45M domestically.Faring better in its second term was Robin Williams with his political comedy Man of the Year which declined a moderate 43% to an estimated $7M. Universal has collected a ten-day cume of $22.5M and is heading for $35-40M by the end of its campaign.Sofia Coppola‘s Marie Antoinette got off to a solid start in moderate national release opening to an estimated $5.3M from 859 locations for a sturdy per-theater average of $6,170. The Kirsten Dunst starrer about the former Queen of France played to a young female audience and scored the second best average in the top ten after chart-topper The Prestige. Critics were not too kind to the PG-13 pic.Dropping to ninth was the horror prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning with an estimated $3.8M, down 49%, lifitng the total up to $36M. Fox’s action pic The Marine rounded out the top ten with an estimated $3.7M, off 48%, giving the John Cena flick just $12.5M after ten days. A $20M final seems likely.Disney released its modern classic The Nightmare Before Christmas in special 3D engagements this weekend and posted strong numbers from limited release. The Tim Burton concoction grossed an estimated $3.3M from only 168 theaters for a sizzling $19,536 per venue. The film originally opened in October of 1993 and grossed a solid $50M.The R-rated dysfunctional family pic Running with Scissors got off to a potent start opening in only eight theaters but grossing an estimated $225,000. The Sony release averaged a muscular $28,125 and expands nationally on Friday. Reviews were mixed for the Annette Bening pic.Miramax’s The Queen kept growing and jumped 49% to an estimated $1.5M thanks to an expansion from 46 to 99 playdates. With a stellar average of $15,333 in its fourth frame, the successful widening continued and boosted the total for the acclaimed Helen Mirren film to $3.8M.Four more fall films fell from the top ten this weekend. Buena Vista’s Coast Guard actioner The Guardian took in an estimated $3.6M in its fourth mission, down 39%, for a $46.5M total. The Ashton Kutcher–Kevin Costner pic should conclude with a decent $50-55M. The Jessica Simpson comedy Employee of the Month dropped 45% to an estimated $2.9M giving Lionsgate $23.9M to date. Look for a final tally of around $30M.The historical epic One Night with the King took in an estimated $2.2M in its sophomore frame, down 46%, pushing the ten-day total to just $7.5M. The 8X release may reach about $12M. Paramount’s $12M comedy Jackass: Number Two has grossed a sensational $71.1M thus far after dropping 54% to an estimated $1.5M this weekend. The bold stunts sequel should end up with $74M and lots of profits for its studio.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82M which was up a healthy 25% from last year when Doom debuted at number one with $15.5M; but down 14% from 2004 when The Grudge opened in the top spot with $39.1M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Prime, TV, the, Tarantino, Disney, psychological, e., ABC, TV, language, Hulu","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Prestige-Defeats-Flags-for-1-Spot"},{"id":"47509158700136","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Penguins and Bond Still Rule Multiplexes","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Penguins and Bond Still Rule Multiplexesby Gitesh Pandya | December 4, 2006 |  CommentsThree new releases failed to make much of an impression on North American moviegoers this weekend as the top films at the box office remained the same.The dynamic duo of the penguin toon \"Happy Feet\" and the James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" ranked one and two for the third straight time while Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" found itself in the familiar third spot once again. Overall, the post-turkey blues set in with total ticket sales dropping significantly from last weekend.The animated blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" became only the second film of 2006 to spend three consecutive weekends at number one. Warner Bros. held steady at the top with an estimated $17M over the weekend dropping an understandable 54% from the Thanksgiving holiday frame. After 17 days of release, the penguin hit has grossed a stellar $121M and seems on course to reach the $180-190M domestic range depending on how it holds up over the holidays. The year’s only other film to stay in first place for three weekends was Johnny Depp‘s \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" which also happens to be the top-grossing blockbuster of 2006.In its usual runnerup spot was Agent 007 in \"Casino Royale\" which took in an estimated $15.1M in its third mission to boost the total to $115.9M. Off 51%, the Sony hit averaged $4,460 per theater which was virtually the same as Feet’s $4,481 average. \"Casino\" has been holding up better than the last James Bond flick \"Die Another Day\" which grossed less in its third weekend. The new Daniel Craig actioner opened with $40.8M and dropped 25% to $30.8M on Thanksgiving weekend. During the same weeks in 2002, \"Die\" bowed to a stronger $47.1M, but fell a larger 34% to $31M over the turkey frame, and then another 59% to $12.8M on the third session. \"Casino\" was running 7.2% behind \"Die\" after the first ten days but has now cut the margin down to only 3.6%. The new smash looks likely to edge out the previous installment’s $160.9M domestic tally. Worldwide, \"Casino Royale\" surged past the $300M mark in global ticket sales and continues to dominate the international box office.The \"Happy\"-\"Casino\" combo has now grossed a stunning $236.9M putting it slightly ahead of the $229.3M that moviegoers spent a year ago on \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" over the same time period. Factor in the usual 3% for annual ticket price increases and the dollar amount is almost identical. So far, the two hits have tag-teamed to help keep this year’s holiday box office relatively even with last year’s. However, December may struggle to keep up with its 2005 counterpart when movie fans spent a towering $400M on \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and \"King Kong.\" This month’s upcoming releases will all have to pitch in solid numbers for the marketplace in the final month of the year to keep up with last year.Also not shifting its chart position this weekend was the Denzel Washington actioner \"Deja Vu\" which remained in third place with an estimated $11M. Dropping only 46%, the Buena Vista release watched its cume climb to $44.1M after 12 days. The time-shifting thriller may go on to capture $75-80M.New Line’s Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" debuted in fourth place with an estimated $8M from a wide release in 3,183 theaters. Averaging only $2,521 per venue, the PG-rated film was expected to reach double digit millions given its 3,000-plus theater launch just weeks before Christmas. The flashier family blockbuster \"Happy Feet\" may have proven to be too strong of a competitor despite doing $104M in business before \"Nativity\" even opened.The Christmas comedy \"Deck the Halls\" followed with an estimated $6.7M dropping 45% in its second weekend. Fox has stuffed $25M into its stocking after 12 days and could be headed for a mediocre $40-45M final. Another holiday comedy, \"The Santa Clause 3,\" was right behind with an estimated $5M, off 50%, pushing the total for Disney to $73.2M. In seventh was the raunchy pic \"Borat\" which fell 53% to an estimated $4.8M giving Fox a stellar cume of $116.3M.The horror pic \"Turistas\" bowed in eighth place with an estimated $3.5M from 1,570 locations for an average of just $2,255 per site. Fox’s R-rated thriller about American tourists attacked while on vacation in Brazil played to the expected audience of older teens and young adults.Sony’s comedy \"Stranger Than Fiction\" followed with an estimated $3.4M, down 41%, for a cume to date of $36.9M. The Will Ferrell pic’s weekend take included grosses from the studio’s Saturday evening sneak previews of its upcoming Cameron Diaz–Kate Winslet pic \"The Holiday\" which ran at 75% capacity nationwide. The romantic comedy officially opens on Friday against three other new wide openers.Rounding out the top ten was the new college comedy \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" which opened with an estimated $2.3M from 1,979 theaters for an average of only $1,160. The MGM sequel performed much like a pair of recent R-rated comedies aimed at young males — \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny\" and \"Let’s Go to Prison\" — which debuted with just $3.2M and $2.2M respectively.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The DreamWorks animated film \"Flushed Away\" released by Paramount tumbled 61% to an estimated $2.3M in its fifth weekend and raised its total to $60.1M. Look for a $65M final.MGM’s political drama \"Bobby\" fell a steep 59% in its second weekend of national play. The Emilio Estevez pic grossed an estimated $2M lifting the sum to only $9.2M and should end with a weak $12-14M. The Warner Bros. sci-fi romance \"The Fountain\" dropped 57% in its sophomore frame to an estimated $1.6M giving the studio a puny $8.1M in 12 days. A $11-12M final seems likely.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.9M which was up 5% from last year when \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" remained at number one with $19.9M; and up 2% from 2004 when \"National Treasure\" stayed in the top spot with $17M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"E!, Comics, Binge","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Penguins-and-Bond-Still-Rule-Multiplexes"},{"id":"47509158713456","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Great Success!

Borat #1 in U. S. and A.by Gitesh Pandya | November 5, 2006 |  CommentsAmerica fell in love with Borat this weekend as the underdog movie-film about a TV journalist from Kazakhstan shocked the film industry by opening at number one, despite playing in a fraction of the theaters as Hollywood’s other new offerings.Shattering expectations, the Fox hit surged ahead of two debuting family films that had hoped to capture the box office title — Disney’s Christmas story The Santa Clause 3 and Paramount’s animated comedy Flushed Away.In the year’s biggest box office surprise, the much-talked-about film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan conquered North America grossing an estimated $26.4M in its first weekend beating out all competitors. Playing in only 837 theaters, the R-rated road trip pic averaged a jaw-dropping $31,511 per theater with sell outs from coast to coast. Based on the character created by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat was expected to open with strength in the top five, but was never seen as being powerful enough to reach the number one spot.Fox debuted the raunchy film in moderate national play hoping word-of-mouth would build and help to bolster the second weekend when it would go fully national. Instead, the red hot buzz and heavy doses of media publicity seemed to fuel demand on opening weekend. According to studio research conducted on Friday, the audience for Borat was 55% male and 53% under the age of 25. Fox expects the audience to broaden as women and older adults begin hearing from their friends about the crude laugher. Critics showered the $18M film with nearly universal praise calling it one of the funniest films of all time. This Friday, the studio will triple the number of theaters expanding to as many as 2,500 locations. A domestic gross well north of $100M is assured.Borat began the weekend with a potent $9.2M gross on Friday. Unlike many R-rated cult hits aimed at young males, the Kazakh tale grew on Saturday increasing by 10% to $10.1M. Fox is hoping that many of those who were sold out will return on Sunday to get tickets and is estimating a modest 30% drop to $7.1M for the final day of the frame. Brilliant out-of-the-box marketing on Fox’s part helped to turn a cult character into a can’t-miss blockbuster event thanks to outrageous publicity stunts carefully executed over the past few months which sparked intense curiousity from those unfamiliar with Cohen’s creation. People had to just go and see it to believe it. The road ahead looks glorious thanks to positive word-of-mouth, a sophomore weekend expansion, and the additional wave of free publicity that its surprise top spot debut will generate this week.The opening weekend performance was stunning, but not unique. It matched the results of two other low budget films that attracted widespread media attention from recent years — Michael Moore‘s political documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and the suspense hoax The Blair Witch Project. In June 2004, Fahrenheit also shocked the film biz by debuting at number one with $23.9M from just 868 sites for a stellar $27,558 average. Blair Witch went nationwide after two weeks of very limited play in July 1999 and grossed $29.2M from just 1,101 sites for a colossal $26,528 average landing it in second place. Both films would average about $30,000 per theater at today’s ticket prices. Each film expanded the following weekend and went on to reach a final gross that was five times its opening tally.Overseas, Borat opened day-and-date in Cohen’s native U.K. plus in other European markets with fantastic results. Cultural Learnings grossed an estimated $17M from 17 countries and captured the number one spot in Germany and the U.K. With such great success, Borat will surely not be execute.Settling for second place was The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause which grossed an estimated $20M from 3,458 theaters for an encouraging $5,784 average per venue. The Disney sequel debuted well below the $29M launch of the last installment of the franchise from this same frame in 2002. In Escape, Martin Short joins the cast playing the sinister Jack Frost who is out to ruin Christmas. Disney ruled the box office over the first weekend of November for four of the last five years with its family films. Tim Allen‘s latest G-rated turn as Kris Kringle was expected to be at the top of the charts this time too, but the phenomenon that is Borat was just too much. Competition from Flushed Away also split the family audence in two contributing to Santa’s lower-than-expected weekend bow. Reviews were mostly negative.Opening close behind in third place was the computer-animated toon Flushed Away with an estimated $19.1M from an ultrawide 3,707 theaters. Averaging a good $5,152 per site, the PG-rated pic follows the adventures of a domesticated pet mouse flushed into the underground world of a sewer rat. Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Kate Winslet provide the voices. The Paramount release was produced by DreamWorks and Aardman Animations who previously made Chicken Run and last fall’s Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. Flushed exceeded the respective openings of $17.5M and $16M for those two films and earned strong praise from critics. Despite competition from Santa, the sewer pic opened impressively and slightly above expectations.The long-term race between the two kidpics will be an interesting one to watch given the similar openings. Flushed should benefit from better word-of-mouth, however Santa’s Christmas theme could help it stay relevant as the holidays approach. Most yuletide pics debuting in early November have had very good legs with some rebounding over the Thanksgiving frame.With three new films getting all the attention, last week’s champ Saw III got shoved down to fourth place with an estimated $15.5M in its second weekend. The Lionsgate horror sequel tumbled an understandable 54% and raised its ten-day cume to a bloody $60.1M. The latest chapter in the highly successful torture series suffered a larger drop than its predessor Saw II which fell 47% in its sophomore session on its way to an identical ten-day gross before ending its run with $87M. Budgeted at $12M, Saw III looks to depreciate at a faster pace and could be headed for a finish of about $80-85M.Two former number one hits holding up with great strength followed in the five and six slots with a slender weekend decline of 19% each. Martin Scorsese scored only the second $100M blockbuster of his career over the weekend with The Departed which in its fifth round took in an estimated $8M. The Warner Bros. hit lifted its total to $102.3M and joined the director’s last film The Aviator ($102.6M) as his only films to reach nine digits in North America. The Leonardo DiCaprio–Matt Damon crime saga also became the 13th film of 2006 to cross the century mark matching the number of blockbusters at this same point last year. Buena Vista’s The Prestige grossed an estimated $7.8M in its third weekend pushing its cume to $39.4M.Clint Eastwood‘s war story Flags of Our Fathers expanded by another 185 theaters in its third mission and grossed an estimated $4.5M from 2,375 locations for a weak $1,895 average. The Paramount release saw its weekend take drop by 29% and its average decline by 35% putting the cume at a disappointing $26.6M. The Robin Williams comedy Man of the Year followed in eighth place with an estimated $3.8M, off only 19%, giving the Universal release $34M to date.Sony’s toon Open Season got hurt by the new family films and dropped 47% to an estimated $3.1M in its sixth hunt pushing the sum to $81.4M. Miramax’s awards contender The Queen finally popped into the top ten at number ten with an estimated $3M. The Helen Mirren film expanded from 152 to 387 theaters and averaged a solid $7,778 per location. The Queen has seen its theater count and gross climb each week and has now lifted its cume to $10.1M with much more still to go.Opening with sensational results in platform release was Pedro Almodovar’s newest story Volver which bowed to an estimated $202,000 from only five sites for a scorching $40,400 average. Sony Classics released the Spanish-language drama in only three New York and two Los Angeles locations and will expand to other cities in the weeks to come. Penelope Cruz, who is already establishing herself as a serious candidate against frontrunner Helen Mirren in the Oscar race for Best Actress, plays a young woman connecting with the spirit of her deceased mother.Paramount Vantage generated terrific numbers with the expansion of its cross-continent drama Babel which grossed an estimated $918,000 from 35 theaters for a potent $26,242 average. The Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett film widened from 7 theaters in New York and Los Angeles last weekend to thirteen additional markets this weekend. Babel opens nationally on Friday in over 1,200 total theaters going head-to-head with four other new wide releases plus the further expansion of Borat. Cume sits at $1.5M.The Dixie Chicks doc Shut Up and Sing widened from four to nine theaters in its second weekend and grossed an estimated $78,000. The Weinstein Co. release averaged a solid $8,613 and put its total at $146,000.Four films, including a trio of Sony titles, dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Fox’s family drama Flicka grossed an estimated $2.7M, down 43%, for a $17.6M total. The $14M girl-and-her-horse pic should conclude with a not-so-dazzling $22-24M. Sony’s period pic Marie Antoinette slipped only 19% to an estimated $2.3M but its cume reached a mere $13M after 17 days. Look for a weak $20M final.The studio’s dysfunctional family flick Running with Scissors fell 35% and took in an estimated $1.7M after its second weekend of national play. With a puny $5.3M in the bank, the Annette Bening comedy should sputter to a dismal $9M. Sony’s fright sequel The Grudge 2 has scared up a decent $38M to date. The $20M franchise film looks headed for a domestic finish of about $40M or so. Though profitable, the sequel will end up grossing only about one-third of the $110.2M of Sarah Michelle Gellar‘s first Grudge pic from two years ago.The top ten films grossed an estimated $111.2M which was down 4% from last year when Chicken Little debuted at number one with $40M; and down 16% from 2004 when The Incredibles opened in the top spot with $70.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"free, Christmas, FXX, blaxploitation, what, Fantasy, telelvision, Character, America, sequels, Returns","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Great-Success-Borat-1-in-U-S-and-A"},{"id":"47509158705259","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Turkey Frame Stuffed With New Movies","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Turkey Frame Stuffed With New Moviesby Gitesh Pandya | November 23, 2006 |  CommentsHappy Turkey Day! A crowded marketplace gets even more packed as six new films open or expand nationally over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.New films bowing on Wednesday include the action pic Deja Vu, the Christmas comedy Deck the Halls, the rock music comedy Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny, and the sci-fi romance The Fountain.Expanding nationwide are the political drama Bobby and the ensemble comedy For Your Consideration. Despite all the new releases, last weekend’s two big openers – the animated penguin flick Happy Feet and the James Bond adventure Casino Royale – will try to hold onto their positions atop the charts. With something for everyone, the overall holiday box office should be robust.Nearly a dozen years after teaming up for the hit submarine thriller Crimson Tide, Denzel Washington, director Tony Scott, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer join forces once again for Deja Vu. The PG-13 pic finds the Oscar-winning actor playing an ATF agent investigating the bombing of a New Orleans ferry which kills over 500 innocent people. To make this stand out from other scripts, a sci-fi element is added that gives investigators the possibility of preventing the tragedy from ever happening in the first place. Bruckheimer and Scott know how to please action-seeking movie fans. From Top Gun, to Tide, to Enemy of the State, the duo has scored many blockbusters over the past two decades.Denzel is a bankable star, especially in a law enforcement role in an action film. His recent openings for gritty action pics include $29M for this year’s Inside Man, $22.8M for 2004’s Man on Fire, and $22.6M for 2001’s Training Day. Deja Vu should play to most of the same fans, however its biggest challenge will come from competing action film Casino Royale which is still new and getting positive marks. A holiday frame as big as Thanksgiving will usually expand to handle both choices so there may be room to breathe, but there will certainly be some adults interested in both who only get time to see one. Buena Vista’s marketing push has been solid and reviews are even favorable. Debuting in 3,108 theaters, Deja Vu might open to around $23M over three days and about $34M over the long Wednesday-to-Sunday period.Fox offers up a new Christmas comedy for family audiences with Deck the Halls starring Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick. The PG-rated pic finds two dads with two different styles of holiday cheer going to battle over Christmas light decorations. The studio is hoping to pick up business from family audiences that are in a holiday mood and have already seen Tim Allen‘s The Santa Clause 3. But Happy Feet, which opened only five days before Deck, will be a major competitor since it is a more high profile kidpic with a louder marketing campaign. Deck looks to play to the same audience as last Thanksgiving’s Yours, Mine and Ours which debuted to $17.5M with $24.3M over five days. Deck has the starpower to grab some attention, but will have more direct competition. Landing in 3,023 sites, Deck the Halls might collect around $14M over the Friday-to-Sunday span and roughly $19M over five days.Funnyman Jack Black goes into vanity-project mode with the new comedy Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny which teams him with his musical partner Kyle Gass. The New Line release will appeal mostly to young males but with its R rating, many younger fans will have trouble buying a ticket. The rating should serve as a major strike against its commercial potential. Female appeal also does not seem too high so Destiny will play to a very specific audience. Expanding beyond Tenacious D fans will be difficult. Black’s last starring role was in the summer wrestling comedy Nacho Libre which opened to $28.3M thanks in part to its PG rating which let all the 12-year-olds in.Films like Let’s Go To Prison and Harsh Times learned in recent weeks that R-rated films aimed at young men can struggle at the box office. Both of those bowed to about $2M each. Pick has more starpower which should help its cause plus the busy turkey frame when college guys are all out of class. Those not busy playing their PlayStation 3, might rock out with JB and KG. Opening in 1,919 locations, Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny may debut with about $8M and $13M over five days.The good thing about having an endless line of stars like in the political drama Bobby is that the studio can have a different actor plug the film on every major talk show simultaneously. That’s what MGM is finding out this week with the Emilio Estevez picture which expands nationally on Thursday from two exclusive engagements to 1,667 sites from sea to shining sea. Last weekend, the R-rated story behind the day that Robert Kennedy was assassinated averaged a potent $34,519 per theater from its solo houses in New York and Los Angeles. But how will it play across all 50 states? Certainly Bobby will appeal to an older crowd that remembers the 1960s and to a smart upscale audience not looking for Bond or Denzel to save the day. Reviews have generally been good, but critics have not been overwhelming in their praise. As a national candidate, Bobby could collect about $7M over three days and about $10M over five days.Movie fans in search of the fountain of youth get to try out The Fountain, a time-travel adventure from writer/director Darren Aronofsky (pi). Hugh Jackman stars as a man determined to save the woman he loves, played by Rachel Weisz, and will cross a thousand years of time in order to do so. If marketing support is any indicator, this PG-13 entry is a low priority for Warner Bros. Awareness is not very high and its target audience of adults has many other options to choose from. Critics have not been too supportive either. Debuting in 1,472 theaters, The Fountain could open with around $4M and a five-day tally of $6M.Also expanding nationally after a strong start in limited play is the film industry comedy For Your Consideration which widens from 23 to 623 locations on Wednesday. The Warner Independent release enters a very crowded marketplace and will find it tough to bring in ticket buyers outside of the Christopher Guest fan club. Last weekend, the PG-13 film posted a stellar $16,174 average, but even acclaimed films like Babel have found out that gunning for smart adult audiences is one hard task. Look for a weekend gross of about $3M.Last weekend’s two chart-toppers will try to fend off competition from the new releases to hang on to their gold and silver medals. Warner Bros. may sit at the head of the dinner table once again with its animated penguin hit Happy Feet which narrowly won the weekend race last frame. Kid movies always do well over Thanksgiving and this should be no exception. Holdover films have ruled the holiday all decade long with 1999’s Toy Story 2 being the last new release to open at number one over this particular holiday weekend.With so many films opening or expanding over the turkey frame, direct competition for Feet will only come from Deck the Halls and The Santa Clause 3 which should see its weekend gross rise as most Christmas-themed films do over Thanksgiving. A 25% drop for Happy Feet would give the toon about $31M over three days and a ten-day cume of $91M.The James Bond actioner Casino Royale might slip a little more in its sophomore frame. In 2002, Die Another Day dropped 34% against no new competition in its second session which was also the turkey holiday. Casino will face a serious direct threat from Deja Vu, however it seems to be pleasing audiences more than Die did. That could lead to a similar 35% decline to around $26M giving the new Daniel Craig adventure $88M in ten days.Fox looks to crack the $100M mark with Borat this weekend. The raunchy comedy is phasing out at the box office, but non-frequent moviegoers may take a trip this weekend to catch up on one of the most-talked-about films of the year. A 35% drop to around $9.5M could occur giving Borat a hefty $107M in 24 days.LAST YEAR: Wizard power ruled the turkey frame as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire remained at number one with $54.7M over three days falling 47% from its debut. That gave Warner Bros. a staggering $201M in only ten days. Fox’s Johnny Cash film Walk the Line held steady in second place with $19.2M but slipped only 14% from its opening. Paramount opened its holiday family comedy Yours, Mine, and Ours in third place with $17.5M in three days and $24.3M over the long five-day holiday period. It reached $53.4M overall. Disney’s Chicken Little placed fourth with $12.6M, down 15% in its fourth frame. Sony’s musical Rent rounded out the top five bowing to $10M and $17.1M over five days. A final gross of $29.1M resulted. Other new releases over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend posted more modest numbers. New Line’s comedy Just Friends opened to $9.2M on its way to $32.6M. Lionsgate launched the drama In The Mix to $4.4M leading to a $10.2M end. And the caper pic The Ice Harvest debuted to $3.7M on its way to only $9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"service, crime, X-Men, Schedule, Sabrina, San, Comedy, jurassic, ID, mutant, Mary, biography, marvel, facebook","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Turkey-Frame-Stuffed-With-New-Movies"},{"id":"47509160145011","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Saw III Brings The Pain","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Saw III Brings The Painby Gitesh Pandya | October 26, 2006 |  CommentsBlood will flow and screams will be deafening at North American multiplexes this weekend when the horror sequel \"Saw III\" buzzes its way into theaters. While there will be no fight for the number one spot, the rest of the top ten will see new films and holdovers scrambling for high positions.The political thriller \"Catch a Fire\" opens on Friday in moderate national release and the comedy \"Running with Scissors\" expands into major markets after an impressive debut in limited release last weekend. Meanwhile, star-driven pics \"The Prestige\" and \"The Departed\" will try to remain popular choices with adult moviegoers.If it’s Halloween, it must be \"Saw.\" That’s the tagline that Lionsgate hopes will keep horror fans coming back for a third helping of pain for the newest chapter in its highly profitable fright franchise, \"Saw III.\" The R-rated film finds Jigsaw returning to terrorize another set of young people. Once again, the formula of no stars plus extreme brutality unleashing its fury on the weekend before the pumpkin holiday remains intact. Now a major player in the horror genre, Lionsgate opened its first \"Saw\" in 2004 to the tune of $18.3M and grew its audience over the following year, especially with DVD, to propel the sequel to a $31.7M bow. Over the last 15 months, no other R-rated film has opened better. Now, a marketplace without many exciting choices for the 17-30 age group will embrace a film, though familiar, that appeals to young adults.Another unfortunate dude opens \"Saw III.\"This month has already seen a pair of horror franchise pics open weaker than their predecessors which bowed in mid-October of recent years. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning\" debuted to $18.5M, down 34% from the $28.1M of 2003’s \"Massacre,\" and \"The Grudge 2\" launched with $20.8M, a steep 47% less than the Gellar original. But \"Saw III\" is in a different situation. \"Beginning\" was a prequel three years later with not much new to offer while \"Grudge 2\" was no longer a star vehicle. \"Saw III\" promises more of what its fans want – brutality, gore, and torture – so it stands on almost equal footing when compared to the last installment. The fan base has probably not grown much in the last twelve months and some might even drop out thinking it’s just the same offering yet again. But with competing fright flicks fading fast, \"Saw III\" will basically be the only horror film in town for those getting ready for Halloween. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"Saw III\" might cut up around $30M.Tim Robbins plays an elite South African leader and Derek Luke stars as an oppressed everyman in the apartheid drama \"Catch a Fire.\" Directed by Phillip Noyce (\"Patriot Games, \"Clear and Present Danger\"), the PG-13 political thriller tells the true story of a man captured and tortured by his government, only to become a radical freedom fighter for his people. Focus is likely to attract an audience similar to the one it saw last fall with another African-set political pic, \"The Constant Gardener.\" The Ralph Fiennes–Rachel Weisz film boasted a similar level of starpower and screens when it bowed to $8.7M over three days from 1,346 locations for a solid $6,444 average.Derek Luke in the inspirational \"Catch a Fire.\"Reviews for \"Fire\" have been generally positive, but it will not be an easy sell at the box office. Robbins is the top star here and his track record selling tickets is spotty when it comes to films where he is the solo anchor. Plus the marketplace is filled with pictures targeting mature adults like \"The Departed,\" \"The Prestige,\" and \"Flags of Our Fathers\" so a crowded field will make it tough for \"Fire.\" Using the ‘based on a true story’ angle in the marketing is always a helpful thing and Focus will soon see how much mileage it can get from it. Attacking 1,305 locations, \"Catch a Fire\" might capture about $6M over the Friday-to-Sunday session.Annette Bening‘s dysfunctional family pic \"Running with Scissors\" enjoyed a strong platform debut last weekend with a scorching $28,263 average from only six sites. This Friday, Sony hopes to build on its bow by expanding the R-rated film into 586 theaters across North America. Critics agree that \"Scissors\" is not the next \"Little Miss Sunshine.\" Reviews have been unflattering which will limit the commercial potential of a film that will mostly play to upscale adult audiences. A weekend take of around $3M could result diluting the per-theater average down to the neighborhood of $5,000.Annette Bening and Brian Cox in \"Running With Scissors.\"Arthouses continue to get more crowded with fall films hoping for critical buzz and possible awards attention. Paramount Vantage packs the most starpower with its Brad Pitt–Cate Blanchett drama \"Babel\" which took home Best Director honors at Cannes this year for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (\"Amores Perros,\" \"21 Grams\"). The R-rated tale trots across the globe from Morocco to Mexico to Japan with four interweaving stories about people from around the world who have no idea how connected their lives are. \"Babel\" opens in just six locations in New York and Los Angeles, most of them major multiplexes, and expands nationally in November. Reviews have been solid.Brad Pitt, in the oscar-buzz grabber \"Babel.\"With Election Day around the corner, President George W. Bush stars in two documentaries that will try to stir up some controversy in order to get audiences running to their local theater. Newmarket Films releases \"Death of a President,\" a docudrama about the fictional assassination of Bush in October 2007 and its aftermath. The R-rated whodunit was one of the hottest films at the Toronto Film Festival last month and hopes to capitalize on its buzz when it invades over 100 theaters this Friday. Also trying to wage a Red State vs. Blue State rivalry is \"Shut Up &amp; Sing\" which examines the hardships that The Dixie Chicks faced recording their new album after their public outcry against the current Commander-in-Chief. The Weinstein Company opens the film in New York and Los Angeles on Friday before expanding to much of the country on November 10.\"D.O.A.P\"Among holdovers, the period thriller \"The Prestige\" and the mob drama \"The Departed\" should remain popular contenders in the top five. \"Saw III\" should not detract from either pic too much and the frame’s other new films will not play wide enough to offer significant competition in the rankings. \"Prestige\" swiped the top spot last weekend and is well-liked by moviegoers. A 40% drop would give Buena Vista about $9M and a ten-day total of $28M. \"The Departed\" has been holding up superbly so another 30% dip would leave Warner Bros. with around $9.5M which could be good enough for a third consecutive weekend at number two. The cume would rise to $90M.LAST YEAR: Doing what its predecessor couldn’t do, \"Saw II\" opened triumphantly at number one and grossed a sturdy $31.7M for Lionsgate on its way to $87M continuing its most popular horror franchise. Sony countered with its family friendly adventure sequel \"The Legend of Zorro\" which debuted in second place with a decent $16.3M. The pricey Antonio Banderas–Catherine Zeta-Jones pic went on to reach just $45.4M domestically. Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman quietly bowed in third with the comedy \"Prime\" which opened to $6.2M from less than 2,000 theaters. Universal found its way to a $22.8M final. The horse flick \"Dreamer\" held up well in its second jump taking in $6.1M while fellow kidpic \"Wallace &amp; Gromit\" rounded out the top five with $4.3M in its fourth weekend. The fourth new wide release of the frame, Nicolas Cage‘s \"The Weather Man,\" got rained out collecting a mere $4.2M leading to a wimpy $12.5M finish.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"documentary, PlayStation, media, Captain, Legendary, TBS","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Saw-III-Brings-The-Pain"},{"id":"47509158701161","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Nativity\" Leads Trio of New Releases","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Nativity\" Leads Trio of New Releasesby Gitesh Pandya | November 30, 2006 |  CommentsThe post-turkey blues will kick in as the North American box office should slump this weekend following a busy Thanksgiving holiday frame.Three new releases venture into the multiplexes. The Biblical drama \"The Nativity Story\" will open in the most theaters and try to court a faith-based audience as Christmas nears. Teens and young adults looking to push the envelope with R-rated fare have the college comedy \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" and the horror thriller \"Turistas.\" Meanwhile, the penguin toon \"Happy Feet\" and the James Bond actioner \"Casino Royale\" will both be past the $100M mark by Friday and will try to stay atop the charts for a third straight time.The story of Baby Jesus comes to the big screen with New Line’s \"The Nativity Story\" which stars Keisha Castle-Hughes (\"Whale Rider\") as Mary. The PG-rated film should appeal to Christian parents wanting to share the religious saga with their children in an environment that the whole family can enjoy. Certainly \"The Passion of the Christ\" showed how big a Biblical film could be at the box office. However, \"Nativity\" is completely different and does not have that film’s high-profile director, controversy, or national media frenzy.Keisha Castle-Hughes and friends in \"The Nativity Story.\"Instead, it may tap into the same audience as October’s Babylon epic \"One Night With the King\" which opened to $4.1M from just 909 theaters for a $4,518 average. \"The Nativity Story\" will launch in more than twice the number of theaters and has a more timely release with December 25 right around the corner, but could generate a similar per-theater average. Critics have not been kind to the pic which might prompt some to wait for the DVD. Opening in around 2,800 theaters, \"The Nativity Story\" could collect about $13M over the weekend.Four and a half years after the release of National Lampoon’s first raunchy college comedy \"Van Wilder\" comes a new installment with \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj.\" This R-rated tale finds Taj (Kal Penn) from the first film moving to England to teach a group of misfits how to party down. It’s been a tough road in recent weeks for R-rated films aimed at young males. \"Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny,\" \"Let’s Go to Prison,\" and \"Harsh Times\" all opened with about $2M or $3M a piece. \"Taj\" has some brand recognition since the first \"Van Wilder\" went on to become popular on video and on cable. In theaters, it opened to $7.3M and a $3,612 average in April 2002 leading to a $21M final. However, a crowded marketplace will make it tough for the sequel to stand out. And \"Borat\" becoming a runaway smash with four straight $10M+ weekends won’t help either. Opening in 2,000 around theaters, \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj\" might debut with about $5M.Kal Penn returns in \"Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj.\"Fox’s new division Fox Atomic, which will cater to teen and young adult audiences, sets sail with its first film with the horror pic \"Turistas.\" The R-rated thriller is directed by John Stockwell (\"Blue Crush,\" \"Crazy/Beautiful\") and follows a group of American tourists on vacation in Brazil who cross paths with creepy organ harvesters. No starpower here. Instead, Fox is hoping to appeal to college kids looking for a good scare. Outside of older teens and twentysomethings, appeal should be minimal. Even with its core audience, \"Turistas\" will have to share shelf space with \"Taj\" so potential will be limited. Opening in less than 2,000 theaters, \"Turistas\" could find its way to a weekend gross of roughly $4M.A trio of scared turistas in \"Turistas.\"Among holdovers, films usually suffer steep declines on the weekend after the Thanksgiving holiday frame. Overall box office spending contracts and studios usually avoid programming any of their heavy hitters into the slot. In fact in the last 15 years, only one new release has opened at number one during this particular weekend – 2003’s \"The Last Samurai.\"This weekend, it could end up being \"Happy Feet\" and \"Casino Royale\" duking it out for box office supremacy for the third straight time. Family pics do extremely well over the turkey frame, but then come down hard a week later. Plus \"The Nativity Story\" could provide some competition for families. Warner Bros. might suffer a 55% fall for its penguin film which would leave it with $17M for the weekend and $120M after 17 days.The new blonde Bond is pleasing audiences worldwide and in the United States, \"Casino Royale\" is set to give \"Die Another Day\" a run for its money thanks to good word-of-mouth. With kids back in school, the Sony adventure film has taken over the number one spot during the mid-week period. \"Casino\" could drop by 50% this weekend to around $15M which would push the domestic cume to $116M. Look for the global tally to surpass the $400M mark with ease by the end of the holiday season.Last weekend, Denzel Washington‘s action thriller \"Deja Vu\" got off to a good start with a $28.6M five-day bow. Buena Vista may witness a 50% drop and collect roughly $10M over three days and raise its 12-day total to $43M.LAST YEAR: For the third straight weekend, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" rose to the head of the class and grossed $19.9M to lead the box office. Paramount opened its Charlize Theron actioner \"Aeon Flux\" to $12.7M on its way to a lukewarm $25.9M. It was the only new wide release of the weekend. \"Walk the Line\" dropped to third with $9.5M, \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" placed fourth with $8.3M, and \"Just Friends\" rounded out the top five with $5.6M.","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"hidden, scary","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Nativity-Leads-Trio-of-New-Releases"},{"id":"47509161691268","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Invincible\" Scores #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Invincible\" Scores #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | August 27, 2006 |  CommentsFootball season was back in swing at the North American box office this weekend as Disney’s real-life pigskin drama \"Invincible\" scored a number-one opening by more than doubling the ticket sales of its nearest competitor. The rest of the films in the top ten were packed into a tight range and were separated by a mere $2.6M meaning chart positions could change when final numbers are released on Monday. The frame’s other newcomers — the raunchy comedy \"Beerfest,\" the music-driven drama \"Idlewild,\" and the kidpic \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" — all generated more modest grosses in their debuts. Overall, the marketplace slumped to levels typical of the last weekend of August.Wahlberg went from mixing cocktails to playing football in \"Invincible.\"Mark Wahlberg was the most valuable player this weekend as his new football pic \"Invincible\" easily beat all foes and grossed an estimated $17M over the weekend finishing in first place. Averaging a solid $5,838 from 2,917 theaters, the PG-rated pic tells the true story of a 30-year-old bartender who landed a spot on the roster of the Philadelphia Eagles. Disney set up a sizable marketing campaign with the NFL promoting \"Invincible\" during the current pre-season and it seemed to have paid off handsomely. Reviews were generally favorable for the feel-good drama.\"Talladega Nights\" still going strong.Sony’s hit NASCAR comedy \"Talladega Nights\" stayed put in second place again with an estimated $8M in its fourth lap. The Will Ferrell smash dropped 42% and upped its cume to $127.7M making it the summer’s second biggest comedy.to date after Adam Sandler’s \"Click\" ($136M) which was also a Sony release. \"Talladega\" could race past \"Click\" by Labor Day.Making its way up to the number three position was Fox Searchlight’s hit road comedy \"Little Miss Sunshine\" which more than doubled its theater count and grossed an estimated $7.5M from 1,430 sites. The R-rated pic averaged a solid $5,245 and boosted its cume to $23M. \"Sunshine\" has steadily grown over the past month into a pop culture phenomenon becoming the \"it\" movie of the moment and looks certain to charm its way past the $50M mark domestically in the weeks ahead.Beer pong, a \"sport\" more fun playing than watching.Another R-rated laugher followed in fourth. The new Warner Bros. comedy \"Beerfest\" debuted with an estimated $6.5M from 2,964 playdates for a mild $2,193 average. The Broken Lizard concoction opened much like the comedy troupe’s 2002 hit \"Super Troopers\" which bowed to $6.2M over three days on its way to $18.5M. \"Beerfest\" tells of a group of American beer chuggers who must train and compete in a secret drinking tournament in Germany.Sam Jackson calling in to find out where the audience for \"Snakes\" went.Yet another comedy followed with a similar estimate of $6.5M in ticket sales. Universal’s \"Accepted\" dropped only 35% and upped its ten-day total to a respectable $21.1M. Fellow sophomore \"Snakes on a Plane\" was an inch behind with an estimated $6.4M tumbling 58% in its second weekend. Total stands at $26.6M. Final grosses look to reach $36-39M each.Paramount’s \"World Trade Center\" fell 41% to an estimated $6.4M putting its sum at $55.6M. Buena Vista’s dance drama \"Step Up\" captured an estimated $6.2M, off 39%, for a $50.4M total.Universal’s music-filled drama \"Idlewild\" bowed in ninth place but generated the best average in the top ten. The OutKast pic grossed an estimated $5.9M from only 973 locations for a solid $6,055 average. Studio research showed that 55% of the audience was over age 30, 61% was female, and 82% was African American.Rounding out the top ten was Paramount’s animated comedy \"Barnyard\" with an estimated $5.4M in its fourth weekend. Down only 28%, the PG-rated toon has taken in an encouraging $54.7M to date.Debuting poorly just outside the top ten was New Line’s kidpic \"How to Eat Fried Worms\" with an estimated $4M from 1,870 sites for an average of only $2,112 per theater. Yari Film Group widened its period mystery \"The Illusionist\" and grossed an estimated $1.8M from just 144 theaters for a strong $12,688 per venue. Cume is $3.2M and the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama will go national on Friday.\"Pirates\" is gold for Disney.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The summer juggernaut \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" enjoyed a seven-week run in the top ten, but dipped to an estimated $4M this weekend for a slim decline of only 23%. With a colossal $407.6M from North America alone, the Johnny Depp adventure surpassed \"Spider-Man\" ($403.7M in 2002) to claim the number six spot on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters. Chest looks to reach about $420M stateside. Worldwide, the \"Pirates\" sequel is closing in on an astounding one billion dollars in global box office.The teen comedy \"Material Girls\" starring Hilary and Haylie Duff dropped by 50% to an estimated $2.3M in its sophomore session. The MGM title has collected just $8.5M in ten days and should end up with around $13M before finding a bigger audience on DVD. The horror flick \"Pulse\" grossed an estimated $1.7M, down 53%, for a total of $17.9M. A final tally of about $21M could result.ThinkFilm’s drug-addicted teacher drama \"Half Nelson\" expanded from three to 21 theaters and grossed an estimated $210,000 for a strong $10,000 average. Cume is now $389,000. Fox Searchlight’s relationship film \"Trust the Man\" did not have as much luck during its expansion. The David Duchovny–Julianne Moore pic grossed an estimated $285,000 from 158 sites (up from 38 last weekend) and averaged a poor $1,804. Total is $541,000 with another widening up to 300 theaters set for Friday.The top ten films grossed an estimated $75.8M which was off 2% from last year when \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" remained at number one with $16.3M; and down 4% from 2004 when \"Hero\" opened in the top spot with $18M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"history, thriller, A24","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Invincible-Scores-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509161689219","title":"Box Office Preview: \"Crank\" Closes Up Summer Movie Season","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Preview: \"Crank\" Closes Up Summer Movie Seasonby Gitesh Pandya | August 31, 2006 |  CommentsThe summer movie season comes to an official end with the Labor Day holiday weekend unleashing three new releases plus the national expansion of a fourth.Lionsgate offers the action crowd \"Crank,\" Warner Bros. provides the suspense thriller \"The Wicker Man,\" Sony takes a shot with the basketball drama \"Crossover,\" and Yari Film Group goes nationwide with its period thriller \"The Illusionist.\" Each is hoping that current champ \"Invincible\" will fumble the ball. The summer-ending frame is often a time when moviegoers catch up on hit films they haven’t seen yet so notable holdovers could see their four-day grosses grow beyond their three-day takes from last weekend. Overall, the marketplace remains overcrowded with too many films fighting to get a slice of the box office pie.British action star Jason Statham attacks the U.S. for the second Labor Day weekend in a row with his latest pic \"Crank.\" Co-starring Amy Smart, the Lionsgate release sees the actor playing a poisoned hitman who must keep his adrenaline up in order to stay alive. Unlike his PG-13 \"Transporter\" flicks, \"Crank\" carries a more restrictive R rating which could narrow its target audience. It’s been a tough summer for R-rated action films with movies like \"Snakes on a Plane\" and \"Miami Vice\" both underperforming. But if there’s any distributor who can successfully target young adult males with these types of films with intriguing concepts, it’s the \"Saw\" studio.Jason Statham showing off his dramatic range\"Snakes\" was the only pure action film in the top ten last weekend so competition for \"Crank\" may not be too fierce. Statham has seen his starpower grow in the last couple of years and that might benefit his latest pic too. Still, the marquees are jam packed with choices this weekend so it will be tough to fight off other films and convince moviegoers that their time and money should be best spent here. A year ago this weekend, \"Transporter 2\" opened at number one with a four-day tally of $20.1M. However, that Fox pic was a sequel, had a less restrictive rating, and bowed in 900 more theaters. Given \"Crank’s\" debut in about 2,400 locations, it could end up with around $13M over the long Friday-to-Monday period.With his twin towers drama still in the top ten, Nicolas Cage hits the big screen for the second time in a month with the psychological thriller \"The Wicker Man.\" The PG-13 film stars the Oscar-winning actor as a cop investigating a cult while looking for a missing girl. Labor Day weekend has been a good time for creepy thrillers, especially for ones that appeal to high school and college students like the \"Jeepers Creepers\" pics. \"Wicker Man’s\" rating will help its cause, but whether it can excite teens will determine how big it can become. With a half-dozen production companies, six producers, and seven executive producers all involved, it’s hard to say if this is really director Neil LaBute‘s film. Warner Bros. has given \"Wicker\" a decent marketing push, but it has not become a must-see thriller. A marketplace flooded with pictures will provide plenty of competition for adults and this one will have to work extra hard to stand out in the crowd. Ending a disappointing summer for the studio, \"The Wicker Man\" bows in over 2,500 theaters and could scare up around $12M over the four-day period.Nicolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in \"The Wicker Man\"Sony goes after the urban youth audience with its new basketball drama \"Crossover\" which finds two young streetballers competing in the world of underground hoops. The PG-13 film is getting a moderate release in 1,023 theaters which will limit its potential, however a solid per-theater average could result. Compared to reigning box office champ \"Invincible,\" this new sports drama will attract a much more ethnic audience and should play primarily to teens and young adults. \"Idlewild\" will provide some competition for African American moviegoers, however the OutKast pic is playing to an older audience. With Anthony Mackie, Wesley Jonathan, and Wayne Brady heading up the cast, \"Crossover\" does not offer up much starpower. But it could be a short-term choice for the back-to-school crowd in urban markets. Over the Friday-to-Monday holiday span, \"Crossover\" might shoot up about $5M.The first rule of underground streetball is…After two weeks of strong results in limited release, the period mystery \"The Illusionist\" expands wide from 144 theaters to approximately 1,000 sites across North America. One of the summer’s best-reviewed films, the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama opened in 51 theaters with a powerful $18,195 average and widened on its second frame scoring a still-potent $12,745 average. Glowing praise from critics and solid word-of-mouth could help sell \"The Illusionist\" to moviegoers who would not ordinarily buy tickets to a film with these stars. Competition will be tough, though. For only the second time all year, ten films surpassed $5M last weekend and most are looking to remain relevant over the holiday session. \"The Illusionist\" could capture the same amount over four days this weekend pushing its cume to about $9M.Those illusionists get all the chicksMore new movies enter into limited release on Friday. IFC Films unveils the documentary \"This Film is Not Yet Rated\" in exclusive engagements in New York and Los Angeles. The unrated film (it was given an NC-17, but is going out with no official rating) explores the mystery behind the movie ratings system as determined by the Motion Picture Association of America. Writer/director Ed Burns returns to theaters as a private investigator searching for a missing woman in \"Looking for Kitty.\" The R-rated drama is being released in one solo New York house by ThinkFilm.Last weekend, Mark Wahlberg‘s football drama \"Invincible\" scored a number one opening and was the only film to attract more than $10M in ticket sales over the frame. Word of mouth has been good and the Disney release would like nothing more than to land another win over the holiday session. The four-day gross might see only a small drop from last weekend’s three-day bow. A decline to about $15M would give \"Invincible\" a total of $38M after 11 days.Labor Day weekend has historically been a great time for hot late-summer indie films to reach out to broader audiences and \"Little Miss Sunshine\" hopes to be the latest one to capitalize on its buzz. Four-day increases over the previous three-day weekends in recent years have included 17% for \"March of the Penguins\" last year, 35% for \"Garden State\" in 2004, 80% for \"Napoleon Dynamite\" that same year, and a whopping 104% for \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" in 2002. That PG-rated blockbuster added about 300 theaters over the holiday frame while the R-rated \"Sunshine\" will only increase its current count of 1,430 by a hundred or so. The Fox Searchlight hit could charm about $9.5M from ticket buyers over the long weekend and boost its cume to $36M.LAST YEAR Jason Statham ruled the Labor Day weekend box office with the number one opening of his action sequel \"Transporter 2\" which grossed $20.1M over four days. The Fox hit went on to collect $43.1M. The comedy sensation \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" slipped to second place with $16.5M over four days displaying another great hold in its third frame. Debuting in third with $11M was the thriller \"The Constant Gardener\" from Focus which went on to gross $33.6M and become a major awards contender. Rounding out the top five were the DreamWorks suspense flick \"Red Eye\" with $9.4M and Miramax’s adventure pic \"The Brothers Grimm\" with $9M. Two new films opened with weak results outside of the top ten. Miramax’s \"Underclassman\" bowed to $3.1M on its way to $5.7M while Warner Bros. took in just $1.2M for \"A Sound of Thunder\" leading to only a $1.9M final.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"movies, Rock, nfl, finale, LGBTQ, Studios, shows, Endgame, Ice, 2020, comiccon, dark, TV","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Crank-Closes-Up-Summer-Movie-Season"},{"id":"47509161683074","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Invincible Scores Another Win at #1","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Invincible Scores Another Win at #1by Gitesh Pandya | September 5, 2006 |  CommentsMoviegoers had football on their minds for the second straight weekend as Disney’s true-life NFL tale \"Invincible\" remained atop the North American box office over the long Labor Day holiday weekend finishing off another summer movie season. New releases \"Crank\" and \"The Wicker Man\" opened in second and third, respectively, while the critically acclaimed films \"Little Miss Sunshine\" and \"The Illusionist\" both scored strong per-theater averages in moderate release. The holiday frame marked the first weekend in six long months where no new film debuted with at least $15M. Hollywood was happy to close the books on a summer movie season that was slightly better than than last year’s.Retaining its first-place position, Mark Wahlberg‘s \"Invincible\" grossed an estimated $15.2M over the four-day Friday-to-Monday holiday weekend and remained the most popular movie in North America. After 11 days of release, the feel-good drama about a 30-year-old bartender who earned a spot on the Philadelphia Eagles starting lineup has grossed a solid $37.8M and could be headed for the neighborhood of $60-70M.It was only fitting that Disney topped the box office charts as the summer came to an end. Since the summer movie season kicked off on May 5 with \"Mission: Impossible III,\" Buena Vista has grossed $786M at the multiplexes beating out all other studios. Disney’s success was powered by the summer’s two highest grossing hits, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" ($414.2M) and \"Cars\" ($242M), but also included surprise late-summer winners like \"Invincible\" and \"Step Up.\" It was a drastic turnaround from last summer when the Mouse House’s biggest film was \"Herbie: Fully Loaded\" with $66M.Opening in second place was action star Jason Statham‘s new thriller \"Crank\" with an estimated $13M over four days from 2,515 theaters. Averaging a commendable $5,169 per site, the R-rated film features a poisoned hitman who will die if he can’t keep his adrenaline up constantly. The Lionsgate release opened better than Statham’s 2002 film \"The Transporter\" ($9.1M in three days) but did not reach the $20.1M bow of his action sequel \"Transporter 2\" which ruled the Labor Day frame a year ago. That number one hit carried a commercially friendly PG-13 rating and kicked its way into 800 more theaters. Over the Friday-to-Sunday span, \"Crank\" grossed $10.3M and averaged $4,095.Nicolas Cage opened his new suspense thriller \"The Wicker Man\" close behind in third place with an estimated $11.7M in ticket sales over the Friday-to-Monday holiday session. The Warner Bros. remake about a cop who investigates a missing girl averaged a mediocre $4,210 from 2,784 theatrs over four days. The PG-13 film grossed $9.6M in three days for a mild average of $3,448. Cage appeared twice in the top ten as his previous film \"World Trade Center\" finished further down in ninth place.Two smaller films successfully expanding into national release followed and scored the best averages among all the wide releases. Fox Searchlight’s road comedy \"Little Miss Sunshine\" ranked fourth for the weekend with an estimated $9.7M over four days with $7.6M over the Friday-to-Sunday portion. It was the second weekend in a row that actor Greg Kinnear had two films in the top five. He plays a supporting role in \"Invincible\" as well. \"Sunshine\" averaged a strong $6,071 from 1,602 theaters over four days pushing its total to $35.8M and counting. At its current rate, it should eventually surpass \"Miami Vice\" as the top-grossing R-rated film to come out of the summer.Rookie distributor Yari Film Group did an excellent job expanding its period mystery \"The Illusionist\" into national release and jumped into fifth place with an estimated four-day gross of $8M. Expanding from 144 to 971 theaters, the Edward Norton–Paul Giamatti drama scored the best average in the top ten with a sturdy $8,261 per venue. Cume now stands at $12.1M. The distributor scored excellent averages during its two weeks in limited release allowing positive word-of-mouth to spread for a film that was not easy to sell at a time when there were plenty of good choices for mature adults. Another 400 theaters will be added on Friday.A trio of comedies followed. Sony’s Will Ferrell hit \"Talladega Nights\" grossed an estimated $7.7M over four days and lifted its cume to a stellar $138.4M making it the top-grossing comedy of the summer. Paramount’s animated pic \"Barnyard\" took in an estimated $6.4M pushing its total to $63.6M. The teen flick \"Accepted\" placed eighth and collected an estimated $5.9M giving Universal $29.4M to date.Rounding out the top ten were the 9/11 drama \"World Trade Center\" with an estimated $5.8M over four days and the dance saga \"Step Up\" with $5.5M, according to estimates. Paramount’s Oliver Stone film has taken in a solid $63.7M thus far while Buena Vista’s surprise hit has taken in $58.4M.Opening quietly outside of the top ten was the street basketball drama \"Crossover\" with an estimated $4.5M over four days from a moderate release in 1,023 theaters. Sony averaged a decent $4,399 over the long weekend on the $6M film which played mostly to a young urban audience.Platforming to muscular numbers was the IFC Films doc \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\" which grossed an estimated $42,000 from solo houses in New York and Los Angeles for a potent $20,832 average. The unrated expose that examines the ratings board of the MPAA will continue to expand throughout September.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. The raunchy comedy \"Beerfest\" tumbled to an estimated $4.6M over four days giving Warner Bros. only $14.8M in 11 days. A $20M final seems likely. Universal’s OutKast pic \"Idlewild\" took in an estimated $2.9M in its sophomore session giving the music-driven film only $9.9M in 11 days. Look for a $14M conclusion. New Line’s buzzworthy action-horror pic \"Snakes on a Plane\" has scared up just over $31M to date and is set to end with a final domestic gross close to its $35M production budget.The top ten films grossed an estimated $89M over four days which was down 3% from last year when \"Transporter 2\" debuted at number one with $20.1M; but up 19% from 2004 when \"Hero\" remained in the top spot with $11.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Red, First, Turner, psychological, travel, toronto, language, crime, rotten, CBS, parents, Mirror, FX, casting, Spring","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Invincible-Scores-Another-Win-at-1"},{"id":"47509160163453","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Jackass Crashes into Theaters","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Jackass Crashes into Theatersby Gitesh Pandya | September 21, 2006 |  CommentsFour new films open wide, but they may not be enough to stop the North American box office from suffering its third consecutive down weekend.Leading the way is the Paramount sequel \"Jackass: Number Two\" which will enjoy the widest release by far. The rest of the films will take moviegoers back in time just as so many other recent releases have done. Focus Features unleashes Jet Li‘s martial arts epic \"Fearless,\" MGM takes off with the World War I adventure \"Flyboys,\" and Sony remakes the political thriller \"All the King’s Men.\"Four years ago, Paramount shocked the industry with the number one bow for its crude stunts flick \"Jackass: The Movie\" which managed to keep \"The Ring\" out of the top spot on the weekend right before Halloween. Its $22.8M debut and eventual $64.3M domestic take and DVD success helped to bring about a sequel, \"Jackass: Number Two\" which hopes to conquer the charts once again. The R-rated pic regroups the team from the hit MTV reality series including Johnny Knoxville and finds them taking part in another series of outlandish don’t-try-this-at-home antics. Males in their late teens and early twenties are the target audience here although slightly older guys who were devoted followers a half-decade ago might also be up for some nostalgia.The first \"Jackass\" bowed to a muscular $9,073 average from 2,509 playdates which at today’s ticket prices would be over $10,000. \"Number Two\" is not likely to match that amount though. A wider launch will dilute the average a bit and the franchise has aged and is no longer at the peak of its popularity. But since Knoxville has found more mainstream success recently with films like \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"The Ringer,\" the studio is hoping that some new fans will give \"Two\" a try. Competition for males will be fierce with last weekend’s top film \"Gridiron Gang\" still playing to sports-loving boys and men while Jet Li’s new film \"Fearless\" willsteal away dudes who dig martial arts fighting, bones cracking, and necks breaking. Male dollars will be stretched to the limit this weekend and an already sluggish marketplace will mean that there will only be so much overall traffic. Busting into over 3,000 theaters, \"Jackass: Number Two\" will rank number one and may open with around $23M.Mr. Knoxville and co. are back to cheat death and reason.Also gunning for young men with R-rated fare is Focus Features with the historical martial arts actioner \"Fearless\" starring Jet Li. Already a hit at cinemas in Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe, the period pic tells the true story of a legendary fighter who inspired his nation in China at the start of the twentieth century. With a bigger star in the lead, \"Fearless\" is sure to perform better than Tony Jaa‘s Thai actioner \"The Protector\" which bowed to just $5M two weeks earlier. Li has a consistently loyal fan following that is likely to turn out especially since the marketing campaign is pushing the claim that this is his final martial arts film ever. This tactic gives the pic a level of urgency, although it should not mean much to those outside of his fan base. Crossover potential to mainstream action fans is not very likely, though the actor’s pull with urban males should not be underestimated.Still, Li has posted some impressive numbers in his career. Each of his six films from this decade has launched with an opening weekend average of at least $5,500 with five having averaged more than $6,000. His last effort \"Unleashed\" bowed last summer to $10.9M and a solid $5,570 average while 2004’s Chinese blockbuster \"Hero\" conquered the North American charts for two straight weeks bowing to an impressive $18M and $8,865 average. Foreign language films pretty much never do that in the U.S. market. \"Fearless\" will not duplicate the success of \"Hero\" which used the \"Quentin Tarantino Presents\" tag to attract extra biz. Plus with \"Jackass\" taking away many young men this weekend, only the true followers will make it out. But reviews have been very positive (the best for any newrelease) and advance buzz from overseas has been encouraging too. Kicking its way into roughly 1,806 theaters, \"Fearless\" might debut to about $9M.Jet Li inviting us to his last Martial Arts flick.World War I bi-planes are the draw in \"Flyboys,\" a new historical action adventure being released by MGM. The PG-13 film stars James Franco as a courageous American pilot in France who devotes his life to fighting for the Allies. With a high pricetag and no proven stars that can sell in America, this is yet another risky period film packed into the slow month of September. The \"inspired by a true story\" description used by half of the films in the current top ten is once again in play here. With sex and bad language kept to a minimum, \"Flyboys\" hopes to appeal to a broad family audience so adults can bring their kids. However, the starpower and subject matter are both lacking making this a tough sell at the box office especially since the marketplace is already filled with mediocre product. Zooming into 2,033 theaters, \"Flyboys\" might climb to around $7M over the weekend.The real star of \"Flyboys\": the CGI.After taking a beating at the Toronto International Film Festival, Sony’s remake \"All the King’s Men\" enters the marketplace on Friday with more subdued expectations. The PG-13 reworking of the classic 1949 political thriller stars Sean Penn as a charismatic politician from the South who gains power and flirts with corruption in the process. The all-star cast also includes Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins, Mark Ruffalo, and James Gandolfini. Distributors often utilize the Toronto fest to generate buzz for their Oscar contenders right before their fall commercial openings, but in this case, it seemed to have backfired with so many reviewers panning the pic. \"Men\" should play exclusively to a mature adult audience as teens will yawn at the premise. The marketplace has been flooded with period dramas in recent weeks with \"The Black Dahlia,\" \"Hollywoodland,\" and \"The Illusionist\" all going after the same audience. Competition will be a major factor.Sony is not giving its usual saturation release to \"King’s Men,\" but instead campaigning in just 1,514 theaters this weekend hoping some positive buzz will spread. The lack of screens will keep the gross in check and the bad reviews should sting even more. Last weekend, \"Dahlia\" found out the hard way how far a serious film for adults can go when the critics give a thumbs down. The film’s starpower is about its only major asset right now, but will it be enough to make moviegoers risk their dollars? With negative press, an abundance of direct competition, and only a moderate amount of theaters, \"All the King’s Men\" could find itself with only $7M this weekend and a rocky road ahead.Sean Penn’s politician wins over his constituents, but not the critics.In limited release, The Weinstein Co. unleashes its horror flick \"Feast\" in 140 theaters with special midnight shows across the country on Friday and Saturday. The latest winner from the Project Greenlight series is directed by John Gulager and finds a group of people trapped inside a bar fighting off flesh-eating creatures. Filmmaker Michel Gondry (\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\") returns to the surreal with \"The Science of Sleep,\" a new fantasy drama starring Gael García Bernal (\"The Motorcycle Diaries\") as a man whose dreams collide with reality. Warner Independent is opening the film on Friday in eight major U.S. markets and will expand it across the country next weekend. Miramax platforms its futuristic sci-fi toon \"Renaissance\" in New York and Los Angeles. Set in Paris in the year2054, the R-rated tale is the latest film to bring the look of a graphic novel to the big screen.Last weekend’s top film \"Gridiron Gang\" is sure to lose its first place ranking. The Rock‘s films never have very good legs on the second weekend as evidenced by the sophomore declines of his recent films – 48% for 2003’s \"The Rundown,\" 46% for 2004’s \"Walking Tall,\" and a horrendous 73% for last fall’s \"Doom.\" While \"Gang\" was not a favorite with critics, it has been getting favorable responses from moviegoers so its drop this weekend may not be too bad. Competition for young males will be a factor with the dueling R pics \"Jackass\" and \"Fearless,\" but younger boys may still be up for an uplifting football tale. \"Gridiron Gang\" might see a decline of 45% to around $8M giving Sony a reasonable ten-day cume of $25M.Universal’s murder mystery \"The Black Dahlia\" was not too powerful in its opening last weekend and both critics and moviegoers are giving negative feedback. A 50% fall would leave the Brian De Palma flick with $5M for the frame and a weak $18M after ten days.LAST YEAR: One A-list Hollywood blonde replaced another at the top of the charts. Jodie Foster‘s kidnapping thriller \"Flightplan\" flew to number one opening with a strong $24.6M. The Buena Vista release went on to gross $89.7M making it the top-grossing film in the September-October corridor for 2005. In second place, Warner Bros. expanded its animated film \"Corpse Bride\" nationally taking in $19.1M. The Tim Burton–Johnny Depp collaboration found its way to $53.4M. Reese Witherspoon fell from first to third with her comedy \"Just Like Heaven\" which collected $9.6M. Opening in fourth place with moderate results was the skating drama \"Roll Bounce\" which bowed to $7.6M on its way to $17.4M from less than 1,700 theaters. Close behind in fifth was the hit thriller \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" with $7.5M in its third round.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Biopics, Awards, Hallmark, book, who, CW, on, renewals, Globe, Arts, Fox","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Jackass-Crashes-into-Theaters"},{"id":"47509160158330","title":"Box Office Wrapup: Open Season Shoots Up #1 Opening","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: Open Season Shoots Up #1 Openingby Gitesh Pandya | October 2, 2006 |  CommentsAshton Kutcher ambushed the top two spots at the North American box office this weekend playing an animated mule and a Coast Guard rookie in Open Season and The Guardian, respectively. Both films enjoyed strong openings pumping in a combined $40M and helped the marketplace beat last year’s levels for the first time in four weeks. The weekend’s other new wide release, the comedy School for Scoundrels, saw more modest results with a fourth place bow.Sony claimed its usual position atop the charts with the animated comedy Open Season which brought in an estimated $23M in ticket sales over the weekend. Hunting moviegoers in an ultrawide 3,833 theaters, the PG-rated film about funny forest animals fighting off hunters averaged a strong $6,001 per site. Open Season marked the first venture from the studio’s new in-house animation division which will compete in the years ahead with dominant players in CG toons like Pixar and DreamWorks. Martin Lawrence and Kutcher led the voice cast.Sony research showed that 77% of the crowd consisted of parents with children under the age of 12, while girls were a bigger force making up 56% of the audience. A high 89% marked the film \"excellent\" or \"very good\". With strong exit polls and the Columbus Day school holiday coming up next week, the $85M film hopes to last throughout the month of October. For the studio, it was Sony’s record eleventh number one opening of the year. Of the company’s twenty film releases in the first nine months of 2006, half have debuted north of $20M.Kutcher’s face and body showed up in the weekend’s number two film, the Coast Guard action drama The Guardian, which opened with an estimated $17.7M. Also starring Kevin Costner, the Buena Vista release averaged a solid $5,451 per theater from 3,241 sites. The starpower helped bring in moviegoers who in turn liked the film. The Guardian earned an impressive CinemaScore grade of A-. Studio research showed that 50% of the crowd was in the 26-49 age bracket while males outnumbered the ladies with 53% of the audience. For Costner, who has not been a major box office force in over a decade, it was actually his best opening since Waterworld‘s $21.2M debut in 1995. Kutcher has seen many films debut in the same ballpark like The Butterfly Effect with $17.1M, Just Married with $17.5M, and Guess Who with $20.7M.Falling an understandable 52% from its top spot debut, Jackass: Number Two finished the weekend in third place with an estimated $14M. With $51.5M in ten days, the $12M production should deliver $70-75M for Paramount plus healthy DVD revenue down the road. The first Jackass film grossed $42.1M in its first ten days on its way to a $64.3M cume in 2002.Earning passing grades in fourth place was the Billy Bob Thornton–Jon Heder comedy School for Scoundrels which opened to an estimated $9.1M. Playing in 3,004 theaters, the PG-13 film about a young loser who seeks advice from an older pro on how to get women averaged a mild $3,032 per site. Reviews were not too encouraging for the MGM release.Jet Li‘s Fearless dropped a steep 56% in its second weekend and placed fifth with an estimated $4.7M. The action star’s \"final\" martial arts epic has grossed $17.8M in ten days and looks headed for about $26M. Each of Li’s last five films also fell by more than half on its sophomore frame.Sony’s football drama Gridiron Gang fell 52% to an estimated $4.5M pushing its cume to $33.2M. Enjoying the smallest decline in the top ten for the fourth consecutive weekend was the sleeper hit The Illusionist with $2.8M, off only 15%, for a total of $31.5M for Yari Film Group. MGM’s fighter pilot adventure Flyboys tumbled 61% in its second weekend to an estimated $2.3M. With only $9.9M in ten days, a final take of around $14M seems likely.Yet another period drama The Black Dahlia followed with an estimated $2.1M, down 54%, giving Universal only $20.7M to date. Rounding out the top ten with the biggest cume on the list was indie sensation Little Miss Sunshine with an estimated $2M, off 28%, for a total of $53.2M for Fox Searchlight. The acclaimed comedy has now matched megablockbusters Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest, The Da Vinci Code, and Cars by spending seven consecutive weekends in the top ten.A pair of critically-acclaimed dramas about world leaders opened to fantastic results in limited release. Miramax launched its Helen Mirren starrer The Queen on Saturday and grossed an estimated $123,000 from just three New York theaters for a potent two-day average of $41,000. The story of Queen Elizabeth II after the death of Princess Diana was double-screened at a pair of the arthouse venues and opened a day later than usual since on Friday it screened as the opening night film of the New York Film Festival. Mirren won the Best Actress prize at the Venice International Film Festival and is considered a major contender for an Oscar nod.Also a likely Academy Award nominee, but for the Best Actor trophy, was Forest Whitaker whose new film The Last King of Scotland debuted powerfully with an estimated $143,000 over three days from only four venues in New York and Los Angeles. The Fox Searchlight release finds Whitaker playing Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the early 1970s. Since its Wednesday launch, Scotland has grossed $172,000 in five days and will expand into the top ten markets on Friday before spreading nationally on October 20.Posting a respectable debut in moderate national release was the football drama Facing the Giants which collected an estimated $1.4M from 441 theaters for a mild $3,150 average. The PG-rated pic about a coach who finds inspiration from God was released by Destination Films and Samuel Goldwyn Films.Warner Independent Pictures expanded its Michel Gondry pic The Science of Sleep from 14 to 221 theaters nationwide and grossed an estimated $1.2M. Averaging a solid $5,475 per location, the R-rated drama lifted its sum to $1.7M. Lionsgate widened its doc The U.S. vs. John Lennon grossing an estimated $210,000 from 57 sites for a moderate $3,684 average. Cume stands at $361,000.Three films dropped out of the top ten this weekend. Sony’s big fall flop All the King’s Men crumbled 56% in its second weekend to an estimated $1.6M giving the political drama a puny $6.3M in ten days. Rejected by audiences, the Sean Penn flick should finish its run quickly with a horrendous $9M. The studio’s supernatural teen thriller The Covenant fell 59% to an estimated $1.3M and upped its total to $22.2M. A $25M final should result for the $20M production. Fox’s baseball toon Everyone’s Hero got crushed by the arrival of Open Season and sank 79% to an estimated $1M. With a modest $13.2M thus far, the animated film could end up with only $15M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $82.2M which was up 15% from last year when Flightplan remained at number one with $14.8M; but down 17% from 2004 when Shark Tale opened in the top spot with a fierce $47.6M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"nbcuniversal","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Open-Season-Shoots-Up-1-Opening"},{"id":"47509160157305","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: \"Departed\" Arrives with a Bang","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: \"Departed\" Arrives with a Bangby Gitesh Pandya | October 5, 2006 |  CommentsMovie studios are offering something for every age group over the Columbus Day holiday weekend. Mature adults will go undercover with Martin Scorsese‘s cop thriller \"The Departed,\" twentysomethings looking for a scare get the horror prequel \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,\" while teenagers have a chance to laugh with the new comedy \"Employee of the Month.\"Meanwhile, last weekend’s number one film – the animated comedy \"Open Season\" – will continue to play to young children during a frame when a large percentage of students will have no class on Monday. The top ten will try to crack the $100M mark for the first time in nearly two months thanks to the variety of good product.Ranking dead last among Hollywood’s big six studios in year-to-date market share, Warner Bros. has a lot of catching up to do in the fourth quarter if it wants to prevent snapping its five-year streak of billion-dollar-plus box office years. So this weekend, it hands the ball off to Scorsese who delivers what critics are calling one of his best films ever with \"The Departed.\" The R-rated picture stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. Overflowing with starpower, the Boston-set film is an American remake of the award-winning Hong Kong blockbuster \"Infernal Affairs\" which finds an Irish cop going undercover into the underworld and a mob mole infiltrating the police department.After rejecting a seemingly endless line of period dramas including \"Hollywoodland,\" \"The Black Dahlia,\" \"Flyboys,\" and \"All the King’s Men,\" adult audiences should be ready to throw its support behind a modern-day action thriller juiced up with major stars worth paying top dollar for. If the cast isn’t enough to seal the deal, glowing reviews from critics across the board should have a big impact on driving in traffic. In fact, reviews are among the best of any wide release hitting theaters this year. DiCaprio and Damon appeal to a wide age group so expect strong numbers from young adults. And Jack is that rare star who can flirt with age 70 but still be relevant to the iPod generation. With $100M blockbusters in each of the last four decades, the Oscar-winner is a perennial favorite and his films areevents.Warner Bros. has backed \"The Departed\" with a solid marketing campaign which is effectively exciting ticket buyers. No R-rated film has hit the $30M mark on opening weekend in nearly a year so that could once again be the ceiling on this film’s short-term potential. Appeal to both men and women is substantial, although as is typical at this time of year, business from males may be affected by football and the baseball playoffs. But word-of-mouth is likely to be very positive so look for the pic to remain a contender for weeks to come. With a colossal amount of starpower, sensational reviews, and a Monday holiday helping Sunday night sales,the Leo vs. Matt flick should be able to generate plenty of excitement with audiences this weekend. \"The Departed\" opens in 3,017 theaters on Friday and could gross about $27M over the frame.Leo DiCaprio, ‘lending a hand’ in Martin Scorsese’s \"The Departed.\"Moviegoers that don’t get starstruck, but instead want some gore and violence in their weekend entertainment, can opt for \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.\" The prequel to the 2003 remake of the 1974 horror classic is an R-rated tale with Jordana Brewster (\"The Fast and the Furious\", \"Annapolis\") as its only star. Horror remakes usually do not rely on stars anyway, but on the brand name of a popular terrorfest. Budgets are relatively low with most of the money going towards production values rather than talent. Three years ago, the previous \"Massacre\" posted powerful numbers bowing to $28.1M in mid-October on its way to a brutal $80.1M. It opened the door to many other moneymaking remake hits like \"Dawn of the Dead,\" \"The Amityville Horror,\" and \"The Omen\" which each went on to gross over $50M.\"Beginning\" will play to hardcore genre fans that are older teens and young adults. But look for some older horror aficionados to take a curious peek too. The marketplace is primed and ready for its arrival as there has not been a major horror hit since June’s \"Omen\" pic hit cinemas. Add in the fact that Halloween is around the corner prompting audience demand for the genre to rise and a large turnout should be expected. Excitement does not seem to be reaching the same height that this installment’s predecessor had, so an opening in the high 20s may not result. Plus Leo, Matt, and even bad boy Jack will be drawing away many twentysomethings this weekend. Buzzing through victims in over 2,800 theaters, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massace: The Beginning\" could scare up around $19M this weekend.More teens in trouble in the latest \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" film.The classic love triangle storyline is set in a Walmart-like super store in the new Lionsgate comedy \"Employee of the Month.\" The PG-13 pic stars Dane Cook and Dax Shepard as co-workers competing for the attention of the hot new sales clerk, played by Jessica Simpson, who only dates those who win the coveted employee prize. The comedy should play to a teen and young adult audience and with the weekend’s other new films being R flicks, Month could score some points with the under-17 crowd. Teenage girls have especially been neglected this fall. Why would they care about 1940s murder mysteries, moronic stunt films, or Sean Penn as a flamboyant politician? Two hunky young dudes fighting over the former Daisy Duke could make for the most interesting film to grab their attention since \"Step Up.\"Still, \"Employee of the Month\" will have its work cut out for it. Many older teens and young adults will be drawn away by \"Departed\" and \"Chainsaw\" and Ashton Kutcher fans are still checking out \"The Guardian.\" Starpower is not too high, but teenagers in need of a laugh will not have many other options. Opening in 2,579 theaters, \"Employee of the Month\" could debut with around $10M.Dane Cook, in his first leading role in \"Employee of the Month.\"Sony’s animated comedy \"Open Season\" enjoyed a healthy start to its run last weekend and will face no new competition during the sophomore frame. Plus with the Columbus Day school holiday, the Martin Lawrence – Ashton Kutcher toon should remain a popular (and only) option for young children. A 30% drop would give \"Season\" about $16M over the weekend and a sturdy ten-day cume of $46M.Buena Vista’s Coast Guard adventure \"The Guardian\" did moderately well in its debut last weekend, but adult audiences will be pulled away by the starpower of \"The Departed\" this weekend. The studio has been reporting strong exit polls so word-of-mouth could prevent a large falloff. A 40% decline would give \"Guardian\" about $11M for the weekend and $34M in ten days.\"Jackass: Number Two\" will face some stiff competition from the weekend’s two new R-rated films so a 45% drop could be in order. That would leave the Paramount hit with $8M and an impressive 17-day total of $64M allowing the comedy sequel to surpass the gross of the 2002 original in under three weeks.LAST YEAR: New films invaded the box office over the Columbus Day frame taking four of the top five slots. Leading the way was the acclaimed claymation pic \"Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\" with a $16M debut. The DreamWorks film enjoyed good legs and ended up with $56.1M domestically plus the Oscar for Best Animated Film. Jodie Foster‘s two-time chart-topper \"Flightplan\" held up well in its third weekend grossing $10.8M for Buena Vista. Cameron Diaz opened her new comedy \"In Her Shoes\" in third place with $10M on its way to $32.9M for Fox. Universal followed with the sports betting film \"Two For the Money\" with a $8.7M bow and Sony opened its drama \"The Gospel\" in fifth with $7.5M. Final grosses reached $22.9M and $15.8M, respectively. Lions Gate saw its new comedy \"Waiting\" launch in seventh place with just $6M leading to a $16.1M final. Opening with strong results in limited release were the acclaimed dramas \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" and \"The Squid and the Whale\" which both earned rave reviews and kudos during awards season. Their domestic grosses reached $31.6M and $7.4M, respectively.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"children's, comic","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Departed-Arrives-with-a-Bang"},{"id":"47509160161404","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Jackass\" #1, \"Little Miss Sunshine\" Crosses $50M","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Jackass\" #1, \"Little Miss Sunshine\" Crosses $50Mby Gitesh Pandya | September 25, 2006 |  CommentsYoung men returned to theaters in droves and powered the crude new stunts sequel Jackass: Number Two to the number one spot with the biggest opening weekend of any film in the past seven weeks. The martial arts actioner Fearless debuted impressively in second place playing to young men as well, but the new older-skewing period dramas Flyboys and All the King’s Men were mostly ignored.Holdovers enjoyed small declines as the overall marketplace bounced back after two dismal weeks, even though ticket sales failed to reach last year’s levels for the third consecutive weekend.Paramount scored a major victory with the chart-topping performance of Jackass: Number Two which grossed an estimated $28.1M in its first weekend in theaters. Crashing into 3,059 locations, the R-rated comedy averaged a stellar $9,188 per theater. Its predecessor, Jackass: The Movie, was a surprise number one hit in October 2002 with a $22.8M bow from 2,509 theaters and a similar $9,073 average. It went on to gross a fantastic $64.3M from a slim $5M budget. Number Two was produced for just under $12M and looks to become another highly profitable title for the studio proving that the franchise is still alive and well. The films are based on the popular MTV prank series.With six historical films in the top ten, young movie fans were not in the mood to learn about yesterday and instead chose the immature and outrageous antics of present day jokester Johnny Knoxville and pals. Studio research showed that young men were the core audience, as expected. Those under the age of 25 made up a hefty 70% of the crowd and males accounted for 65%. Jackass also delivered the second biggest opening of the year for an R film trailing the $29M bow of March’s Inside Man. Critics were surprisingly upbeat with their reviews of Number Two.Jet Li‘s Fearless flew into the number two spot over the weekend opening to an estimated $10.6M from 1,808 theaters with a solid $5,843 average. The PG-13 film about China’s most famous fighter from a century ago was marketed as the action star’s final martial arts picture ever and helped to get his loyal fan base out into the theaters. The Focus release marks Li’s seventh consecutive film to debut with an opening weekend average of more than $5,000. Critics were quite pleased with the Mandarin-language picture. Fearless opened in Hong Kong and most of Asia early this year and has kicked its way into other major markets like Australia, New Zealand, and France in recent weeks.Dropping from first to third was The Rock‘s football drama Gridiron Gang which grossed an estimated $9.7M in its second play. The Sony sports flick held up exceptionally well considering the weekend’s formidable competition for male dollars and slipped only 33%. The Rock’s movies usually fall by at least 45% in their sophomore frames. After ten days, the $30M feel-good film has grossed $27.2M and should rush past the $50M mark domestically. Even though Gridiron began with the weakest opening ever for the actor, it looks to become his highest grossing film since 2002’s The Scorpion King ($90.5M) thanks to strong legs and positive word-of-mouth.MGM’s Flyboys took off in fourth place with an estimated $6M from 2,033 theaters. The PG-13 pic about American fighter pilots during World War I averaged a mild $2,957 per theater. Starring James Franco, the adventure film skewed older as a very high 73% of the audience was over the age of 30. Men made up 59% of the crowd and reviews were not too favorable. Flyboys is the third consecutive period drama in as many weeks that has failed to excite today’s moviegoing public following disappointing results from competing Los Angeles-based murder mysteries The Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland.A pair of not-so-strong sophomores followed. The animated baseball flick Everyone’s Hero grossed an estimated $4.8M, down just 22%, and raised its ten-day tally to $11.6M. Fox could finish with around $25M. Universal’s crime thriller The Black Dahlia crumbled 56% to an estimated $4.4M dropping from second place to sixth. The $60M Brian De Palma entry has taken in just $17.3M and might end up with a disappointing $25M as well.Sony saw low voter turnout for its political thriller All the King’s Men which was defeated in a landslide this weekend opening to a poor $3.8M, according to estimates. Averaging a weak $2,510 from 1,514 locations, the PG-13 film stars Sean Penn as an outspoken politician who runs for governor of Louisiana. Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Anthony Hopkins and James Gandolfini co-star. The studio had high hopes for this remake of a Best Picture Oscar winner, but instead met with awful reviews across the board from critics which helped to fuel negative buzz. Only older adults had interest as studio research showed that a whopping 75% of the audience was 35 or older and 53% were women. All the King’s Men is just the latest in a series of historical films that Hollywood has been rolling out this fall that have had moviegoers yawning.The supernatural chiller The Covenant dropped only 31% to an estimated $3.3M with a sum of $20.3M for Sony. For the fourth consecutive weekend, the long-lasting hits The Illusionist and Little Miss Sunshine ranked back-to-back on the charts. Yari Film Group’s Vienna-set mystery eased a scant 10% to an estimated $3.3M pushing its total to $27.5M. Fox Searchlight’s comedy smash slipped just 13% to an estimated $2.9M lifting the cume to $50.3M.In limited release action, Warner Independent saw stellar results from its surreal drama The Science of Sleep which bowed to an estimated $347,000 from only 14 theaters for a sparkling $24,786 average. Directed by Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), the R-rated film scored good reviews and will expand to over 200 theaters on Friday in most major markets. Miramax saw a so-so start for its animated noir Renaissance which debuted to an estimated $10,000 from a pair of solo engagements in New York and Los Angeles for a mild $5,200 average.Four more pictures were pushed out of the top ten this weekend. Two-time chart-topper Invincible grossed an estimated $2.6M in its fifth session. Off 36%, the Mark Wahlberg football pic has collected a solid $54.8M to date and might end up with around $60M for Buena Vista. The Zach Braff comedy The Last Kiss grossed an estimated $2.5M, down 45%, putting its ten-day total at a puny $8.5M. A final take of roughly $15M seems likely.The murder mystery Hollywoodland fell 46% in its third frame to an estimated $1.5M for Focus. With only $12.9M in the bank, look for a weak $16M conclusion to its case. Lionsgate’s action thriller Crank tumbled 56% to an estimated $1.2M for a $26.6M cume. The Jason Statham pic should reach about $29M.The top ten films grossed an estimated $76.8M which was down 9% from last year when Flightplan debuted at number one with $24.6M; but up a healthy 38% from 2004 when The Forgotten opened in the top spot with $21M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"President, casting, drama, Review","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Jackass-1-Little-Miss-Sunshine-Crosses-50M"},{"id":"47509160167551","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Rock’s \"Gang\" Aims to Score Big","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Rock's \"Gang\" Aims to Score Bigby Gitesh Pandya | September 14, 2006 |  CommentsFollowing the worst box office weekend in three years, Hollywood has nowhere to go but up. It hopes.Four new pictures enter wide release on Friday led by the sports drama \"Gridiron Gang\" from Sony which is gunning for its tenth trip to the number one spot this year. Universal goes after an older crowd with the crime thriller \"The Black Dahlia,\" Fox aims for kids with the animated film \"Everyone’s Hero,\" and Paramount tries to court the adult date crowd with \"The Last Kiss.\" Overall, the North American marketplace should bounce back from last weekend’s horrible showing, but only by a small margin.Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson hopes to score the fifth number one opening of his career this weekend with the football saga \"Gridiron Gang.\" The PG-13 film finds the wrestler-turned-actor playing a juvenile camp officer who assembles a pigskin squad in order to give lost kids some hope in life. Sony is targeting one of the most reliable moviegoing segments with \"Gang\" – urban youth. With a young and multicultural cast, plus a star in the lead role, this new film hopes to appeal to the same crowd that made hits out of other sports flicks like \"Remember the Titans\" and \"Coach Carter.\" Of course, the star this time is not an Oscar-caliber actor. \"Gang’s\" marketing push has been strong and an ultrawide release will make the product available everywhere.Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in \"Gridiron Gang.\"The Rock provides solid starpower, although his box office muscle in recent years has delivered openings in a very narrow range. Pics like \"The Rundown,\" \"Walking Tall,\" and \"Doom\" have all debuted within the $15-19M range. \"Gridiron Gang’s\" rating should open the doors to a wider audience and with the start of the NFL and college football seasons, the subject matter is very relevant at this time of year. Plus with a dead marketplace featuring choices that are exciting nobody, teens and young adults should find this one the only film worth rallying behind. Charging into 3,504 locations, \"Gridiron Gang\" will have no problem conquering the box office and could score around $17M this weekend.Moviegoers opting for a trip back to the 1940s instead of a football pic can choose Brian De Palma‘s \"The Black Dahlia\" which Universal opens on Friday. The R-rated thriller stars Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart as Los Angeles cops investigating the mysterious death of a young woman chopped in half and disemboweled. Scarlett Johansson and two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank take the token female roles. Just as with \"Hollywoodland\" which bowed last weekend, \"Dahlia\" will play to an older adult audience interested in LA-based crime noir pics from the mid twentieth century. Unlike with the younger-skewing \"Gridiron Gang,\" reviews will play a big part in the success or failure of \"Dahlia.\" This one needs more support from critics than it’s getting in order to become a commercial winner. Starpower is certainly there, but the subject matter may not pique the interest of adults across all 50 states. Add in competition for the target audience plus an overall slowdown in moviegoing activity and it may be hard for the studio to break even on this one. \"The Black Dahlia\" enters 2,224 theaters and might collect around $9M this weekend.Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart are on the case in \"The Black Dahlia.\"Following this summer’s \"Superman Returns\" and last week’s George Reeves mystery \"Hollywoodland,\" the Man of Steel spotlight now turns to the late Christopher Reeve whose final project, the animated sports tale \"Everyone’s Hero,\" makes its way into theaters on Friday. With voices provided by Rob Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg, and William H. Macy, the G-rated flick tells of a boy on a mission to retrieve Babe Ruth’s stolen bat. Reeve co-directed with Colin Brady and Dan St. Pierre. Fox will be looking to attract kids and Little League coach parents with \"Hero.\" The film is not registering too high on the priority lists of children. But the studio does have one thing working in its favor – the current marketplace has nothing major for children. And don’t expect the other new releases to appeal to the family crowd either. Opening surprisingly wide in 2,896 theaters, \"Everyone’s Hero\" could score around $7M this weekend.The animated Babe Ruth in Christopher Reeve’s \"Everyone’s Hero.\"TV stars Zach Braff of NBC’s \"Scrubs\" and Rachel Bilson of Fox’s \"The O.C.\" join forces on the big screen in \"The Last Kiss\" which Paramount inherited from its DreamWorks tie-up. The R-rated remake of an Italian film about a man in the early stages of a mid-life crisis also stars Casey Affleck, Blythe Danner, and Tom Wilkinson. The marketing push behind \"Kiss\" has been lacking so look for the romantic dramedy to become a small blip on the box office radar this weekend. Adult women will make up the primary audience making period pics \"Dahlia\" and \"Hollywoodland\" direct competitors. Consumer excitement is pretty low for \"The Last Kiss\" which heads into only 1,100 theaters. A weekend gross of roughly $4M could result.Zach Braff and that chick from \"The Real World\" in \"The Last Kiss.\"The new fall season brings a flood of activity in limited-release action. Balcony Releasing got the frame started on Wednesday with its New York opening of the political doc \"Al Franken: God Spoke\" which adds a second Manhattan venue on Friday. The raunchy softball comedy \"Artie Lange’s Beer League\" opens on Friday in about 175 theaters. With Ralph Macchio in the cast, the R-rated Echo Bridge release should find itself stuck in six-digit territory. Yari Film Group unleashes the Cayman Islands-set drama \"Haven,\" which stars Orlando Bloom and Bill Paxton, into 24 theaters across the country.The mockumentary wedding comedy \"Confetti\" bows in a dozen sites from Fox Searchlight. American troops in Iraq are the focus of the Focus Features documentary \"The Ground Truth\" which attacks eight theaters. Lionsgate offers up its own non-fiction flick \"The U.S. vs. John Lennon\" in six playdates examining the Beatles icon’s rage against the establishment.Sony’s ninth number one of the year \"The Covenant\" looks to get booted out of the top spot by the studio’s tenth chart-topper. A 50% drop would give the teen thriller about $4.5M for the frame and a modest ten-day cume of $15M. \"Hollywoodland\" lacked strength in its debut and will now face a direct hit from \"Dahlia\" so a 45% decline could be in order. That would give Focus around $3.5M over the weekend putting the total at a weak $11M after ten days.LAST YEAR: Reese Witherspoon captured the number one spot with her latest comedy \"Just Like Heaven\" which grossed $16.4M on its way to $48.3M for DreamWorks. Sony’s surprise suspense hit \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" lost half its business and dropped to second with $14.9M in its sophomore frame. Nicolas Cage bowed in third with his new actioner \"Lord of War\" with $9.4M. The Lions Gate release reached $24.1M. Steve Carell enjoyed his fifth week in the top five with \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" which laughed up $6M. The horror pic \"Cry Wolf\" bowed poorly in fifth with only $4.4M leading to a $10M finish.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"Super, Emmy, scorecard, Purge, 78th, The, Network, diversity, Worst, cancelled, werewolf, RT21, of","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Guru-Preview-Rocks-Gang-Aims-to-Score-Big"},{"id":"47509160160379","title":"Box Office Guru Preview: Ashton vs. Ashton – This Time It’s Personal","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Guru Preview: Ashton vs. Ashton - This Time It's Personalby Gitesh Pandya | September 28, 2006 |  CommentsAshton Kutcher fans get two chances to see (or hear) their favorite star this weekend as the Hollywood prankster takes on reigning box office champ \"Jackass: Number Two\" by voicing a mule deer in the animated comedy \"Open Season\" and going up against Kevin Costner in the action drama \"The Guardian.\"Also opening nationally is the Billy Bob Thornton–Jon Heder comedy \"School For Scoundrels\" while some potential Oscar contenders debut in the arthouses.Hollywood’s umpteenth computer-animated feature film of the year hits multiplexes on Friday in the form of \"Open Season.\" The PG-rated pic features the voices of Martin Lawrence and Kutcher and finds a domesticated grizzly bear being dropped into the wilderness right before the start of hunting season. Young kids usually eat up these fish-out-of-water comedy toons and this Sony release should play to the same family audience. The target demographic has had an endless line of movies this year featuring talking animals getting into wacky situations, but since the current marketplace is lacking any major offering for children, \"Open Season\" should score as the first animated hit of the new school year. The studio is saturating the market with screens giving the film the fourth widest bow ever for a non-DreamWorks toon, and the second widest in Sony history for any film after 2004’s webslinger sequel. With no competition and solid funnyman starpower behind the mics, a strong number one bow could result. \"Open Season\" makes its way into 3,833 theaters and may debut with around $24M this weekend.Ashton Kutcher, in his other film, \"Open Season.\"For those who would rather see the \"Punk’d\" star’s face, Buena Vista sets sail with its Coast Guard thriller \"The Guardian\" which finds Kutcher playing a young and cocky swimming champ who butts heads with his unorthodox teacher played by Kevin Costner. Directed by Andrew Davis (\"The Fugitive,\" \"Collateral Damage\"), the PG-13 film has broad appeal with each star pulling in his respective generation. Cross-gender appeal is also present with the military-like storyline doing the job for males and the hunky actors attracting the ladies. Disney offered successful sneak previews two weeks ago to get some word-of-mouth spreading before the official debut. The studio will try to lure in the same audience that spent a solid $22.1M on the John Travolta–Joaquin Phoenix firefighter drama \"Ladder 49\" two autumns ago. Launching in over 3,000 theaters, \"The Guardian\" might debut with about $18M.Kevin Costner to the rescue in \"The Guardian.\"Following his commercial success with the male-driven comedy hits \"Road Trip,\" \"Old School,\" and \"Starsky &amp; Hutch,\" Todd Phillips returns to theaters with \"School for Scoundrels\" which finds Billy Bob Thornton squaring off against \"Napoleon Dynamite\"’s Jon Heder for the affection of a young gal. MGM’s PG-13 film about an awkward young misfit who enlists the help of an expert on getting the ladies should aim for an audience of teens and young adults, plus fans of the \"Bad Santa\" star’s rogue ways. Starpower is not very high here. Films anchored by the former Mr. Jolie usually don’t explode on opening weekend as evidenced by the recent debuts of \"The Bad News Bears\" ($11.4M), \"The Ice Harvest\" ($3.7M), and \"The Alamo\" ($9.1M). Competition for young males will be tough, but if \"School\" can connect with teen girls as a funny romantic comedy, then it has a chance of doing some respectable numbers. Opening in over 3,000 theaters, \"School for Scoundrels\" might debut with about $12M.Thornton, Heder, and that Real World chick again in \"School For Scoundrels.\"Some high profile indies pop into limited release this weekend. Fox Searchlight launched its Idi Amin pic \"The Last King of Scotland\" in four theaters on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and has already been receiving early Oscar buzz for Forest Whitaker‘s portrayal of the Ugandan dictator. Coincidentally, a year ago this same weekend, \"Capote\" debuted and fueled its own Best Actor buzz which sustained itself throughout awards season leading to a trophy for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Reviews for \"Scotland\" have been good and for Whitaker, have been electric.Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin in \"The Last King of Scotland.\"Miramax gets its Oscar campaign going, but for the Best Actress prize, with its Helen Mirren film \"The Queen\" which opens in New York City on Saturday after it officially opens the New York Film Festival on Friday evening. Mirren has already taken home the top actress prize at the Venice Film Festival for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in the dark days after the death of Princess Diana. The PG-13 film is directed by Stephen Frears (\"Mrs. Henderson Presents,\" \"Dangerous Liaisons\") and has ranked number two at the U.K. box office for the last two weeks.First Look Studios takes audiences back to Queens in 1986 with its coming-of-age drama \"A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints\" which stars Robert Downey Jr., Chazz Palminteri, Shia LaBeouf, Dianne Wiest, Channing Tatum, and Rosario Dawson. The R-rated film won awards for Best Director and Best Ensemble at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and bows in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.Last weekend, \"Jackass: Number Two\" flexed its muscles at the box office with a better-than-expected $29M launch. The Paramount film’s predecessor dropped 44% in its second weekend in the fall of 2002, but the sequel may drop harder. A 50% decline would still give the Johnny Knoxville flick about $15M for the weekend and a strong ten-day cume of $51M.Jet Li‘s \"Fearless\" also drew upon a built-in audience of young men last weekend setting itself up for a sizable sophomore drop. The Focus title might also lose half of its business and take in roughly $5M. That would give the martial arts saga $18M after ten days. Sony’s \"Gridiron Gang\" held up well last weekend despite tough competition. Another 35% fall could be in order giving The Rock a $6M frame and a $34M total after 17 days.LAST YEAR: For the second straight weekend, Jodie Foster‘s airline thriller \"Flightplan\" topped the box office with $14.8M dropping only 40% from its bow. Opening in second place was the sci-fi actioner \"Serenity\" which grossed $10.1M on its way to $25.4M for Universal. Warner Bros. followed close behind with $10M for its animated comedy \"Corpse Bride.\" The revenge thriller \"A History of Violence\" expanded nationally and placed fourth with $8.1M and a solid $6,047 average which was the best in the whole Top 20. Opening in fifth was the Jessica-Alba-in-a-bikini pic \"Into the Blue\" with only $7.1M leading to a weak $18.5M final for Sony.

After its top spot debut, reigning champ \"Superman Returns\" will have a big task ahead of it as the super hero film tries to keep audiences from fleeing in its all-important second weekend. With \"Pirates\" and \"Superman\" leading the way, the North American box office looks to zoom higher than last year and even seems strong enough to soar past 2004’s lofty heights.For the first time in company history, Disney will break the 4,000 theater mark with the launch of its new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" sequel. The PG-13 film reunites the cast and crew of the 2003 megablockbuster with Gore Verbinski once again in the director’s chair and Johnny Depp, who earned an Oscar nomination the first time around, returning to play the central character. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and superproducer Jerry Bruckheimer are also back giving audiences another swashbuckling adventure on the high seas. In the latest saga, Sparrow owes a blood debt to the great pirate Davy Jones and must find a mysterious treasure chest, or else be doomed to eternal damnation.Three years ago, the studio hit theaters with a big-budget action film based on a Disneyland ride which seemed to be one of the riskiest pics of the summer. \"Pirates\" bowed on a Wednesday and was an instant hit with audiences grossing $46.6M over its first weekend and $70.6M over its five-day launch. But beyond that, \"Pirates\" had legs and spent eleven weeks in the top ten before ending its run with $305.4M making it the second biggest blockbuster of the summer. Depp provided a breath of fresh air during an endless summer of action sequels with recycled characters and plots. Worldwide, \"Pirates\" sailed away with $654M worth of loot giving the studio a craving for more gold. Two sequels were greenlit with the concluding chapter set to open over Memorial Day weekend 2007.Disney has staked out the same weekend after Independence Day for \"Dead Man’s Chest.\" This time around, with a bigger upfront audience and a Friday bow which will compress business into a standard Friday-to-Sunday period, the pirate adventure has a chance of scoring one of the largest opening weekends in box office history. Five films have generated three-day bows north of $100M. The first, 2002’s \"Spider-Man,\" still holds the record with $114.8M from 3,615 theaters. Since then, some of Hollywood’s biggest sequels have come within striking distance of the webslinger, but none has truly been able to match it. \"Shrek 2\" opened to $108M after a Wednesday bow, \"Star Wars Episode III\" debuted to $108.4M after a Thursday start, \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" launched to $102.3M, and \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" opened to $102.8M over the three-day portion of its Memorial Day weekend holiday opening.The second \"Pirates\" saga has an excellent chance of reaching nine digits in its first three days and even Spidey himself has to be a little nervous about losing his trophy. Disney’s marketing efforts have been very strong, but not over the top. As Paramount found out with its third Ethan Hunt film, moviegoers can get turned off by an overmarketed movie. \"Pirates\" actors have been doing the talk show and magazine cover rounds, but the studio has made sure that the hype doesn’t get so big that it backfires.Appeal for the new Captain Jack film is broad as moviegoers of all ages will be lining up. And more importantly, \"Pirates\" has some of the strongest appeal to women of any of the action franchises around. Men are an easy sell for the genre, but with Johnny and Orlando front and center, the female turnout will be key in getting those grosses up to levels rarely seen. The first film saw its audience grow significantly during its theatrical run and later on video so this time around, there could be twice as many people showing up on opening weekend.Cutting into \"Dead Man\"’s potential, however, could be the long running time — a common problem with so many of this summer’s films. At two-and-a-half hours long, the film will test the patience of some and have one less showing per auditorium when compared to the standard two-hour films. Of course, the last \"Harry Potter\" and \"Star Wars\" films had similar lengths and still soared past the $100M mark on opening weekend. And even though they should suffer large drops, \"Superman Returns\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\" will be in their sophomore frames and still absorb a solid amount of business.But with no other films opening, the entertainment media has been focusing solely on \"Pirates\" this week so at least there won’t be fellow freshman to deal with. Reviews have been mixed, and as with most sequels, they have not been as glowing as they were the first time around. That should mean little on the debut frame though. Excitement is sky high and Disney has a solid product on its hands. With clear sailing ahead of it, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest\" might capture around $104M worth of box office loot this weekend.Since no other studio dared to challenge Disney this weekend with any wide releases, Warner Independent Pictures picked Friday for its limited bow of the futuristic crime drama \"A Scanner Darkly.\" Directed by Richard Linklater (\"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Waking Life\"), the R-rated film stars Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Winona Ryder, and Woody Harrelson in a story about an undercover cop hooked on a popular narcotic who is out to bring down drug dealers. \"Scanner\" is based on the popular novel and features live-action material animated into a stylized new look. The film debuts in 17 theaters this weekend before expanding to more markets later this month.And what of the son of Krypton? Analysts will be watching the second weekend numbers closely for \"Superman Returns\" to find its true trajectory over the long run. Will it hold up like \"Batman Begins,\" crash and burn like \"The Hulk,\" or fall somewhere in between? Its opening weekend delivered sales that were lower than expectations, but Warner Bros. insists that those paying to see the pic are liking it. Sophomore drops for recent Independence Day weekend launches include 53% for \"War of the Worlds\" last year and 49% for 2004’s \"Spider-Man 2.\" The Man of Steel is coming off of a similar type of midweek debut, however it faces the mammoth \"Pirates\" sequel which will play to much of the same summer action audience. With a little luck, \"Superman Returns\" might keep its drop-off rate to 50% which would give the Bryan Singer-directed pic about $26M for the frame. That should boost the 12-day cume to $146M.Meryl Streep was rolling in cash last weekend with the opening of her new comedy \"The Devil Wears Prada\" which was a potent number two in the holiday race. A sizable decline is in order since Hurricane Johnny will hit but also because the film’s audience of readers of the popular book probably made it out already. A fall of 45% would give \"Prada\" around $15M for the session and a stellar ten-day tally of $62M.The usual erosion should hit \"Click\" which has been playing out like the usual Adam Sandler comedy. Look for another 50% fall to roughly $10M for a cume to date of $101M. The animated hit \"Cars\" has enjoyed some of the best legs of any summer film so far, but older kids will certainly start walking the plank for Disney’s other big summer blockbuster this weekend. Pixar’s latest flick could drop by 40% to around $9M which would boost the total to $202M making it the third film of the year to break the $200M mark. The May releases \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" and \"The Da Vinci Code\" were the first.LAST YEAR: Super hero power ruled the weekend as Fox’s \"Fantastic Four\" opened atop the charts with a potent $56.1M launching another successful Marvel film franchise. Reed Richards and pals went on to gross $154.7M domestically and $330M worldwide and will hit theaters again next summer in the sequel. Tom Cruise‘s alien invasion pic \"War of the Worlds\" dropped to second place with $30.5M in its sophomore session losing 53% of its business. Another comic book flick, \"Batman Begins,\" placed third in its fourth outing with $10M. Debuting close behind in fourth was the Jennifer Connelly horror entry \"Dark Water\" with $9.9M on its way to $25.5M for Buena Vista. \"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith\" rounded out the top five with $7.9M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"First, FirstLook, christmas, drama, e., south, Pride, Nickelodeon, Trivia, know","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Preview-Pirates-To-Loot-Box-Office-Treasure"},{"id":"47509161708685","title":"Box Office Wrapup: \"Pirates\" Passes $300M; \"Lady\" Stumbles","content":"Weekend Box Officevar mps=mps||{};mps._queue=mps._queue||{},mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[],mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function(){mps.rt.insertlogo(\"#article_sponsorship_ad\",\"ploc=articlesponsorship\")})Box Office Wrapup: \"Pirates\" Passes $300M; \"Lady\" Stumblesby Gitesh Pandya | July 24, 2006 |  CommentsJohnny Depp made this weekend’s four new releases walk the plank as his megablockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest became the first film of the year to spend three consecutive frames at number one and zoomed past the $300M mark in record time.Among the new offerings debuting in theaters, Sony’s animated film Monster House posted the best results opening in second place while M. Night Shyamalan‘s latest supernatural thriller Lady in the Water stumbled in its first weekend settling for third place. The comedies Clerks II from Kevin Smith and My Super Ex-Girlfriend from Ivan Reitman debuted with more modest single-digit results outside the top five. Overall ticket sales were a healthy amount ahead of last year’s.Sailing past more box office records with ease, Pirates grossed an estimated $35M in its third weekend to remain the top choice among summer moviegoers across North America. Off a moderate 44%, the Disney smash became the fastest film to break the $300M mark when it surpassed the milestone on Saturday, its 16th day of release. Star Wars Episode III previously held the record doing the deed in 17 days last summer. Pirates now stands at $321.7M after a mere 17 days and has soared up to number 16 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters ahead of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone which grossed $317.6M in 2001.Dead Man’s Chest also entered a very exclusive club of films that reached the triple-century mark while still at number one. It joins only 1982’s E.T., 1997’s Titanic, and 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The third weekend hold for Pirates was commendable showing that the high seas adventure is not falling apart like many action sequels and instead still pleasing audiences. It now looks to be on course to reach $400M in box office treasure.Sony generated a solid debut for the animated film Monster House which opened in second place with an estimated $23M from 3,553 locations. The PG-rated tale about three kids who discover an evil home averaged an impressive $6,473 per theater. Oscar-winning directors Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis served as executive producers and had their names used prominently in the marketing. As the first toon for kids in over a month, Monster scored with children and parents who made up the bulk of the audience. The studio released the $75M production in 163 3-D theaters which collected $2.6M of the overall gross for a sizzling $16,012 average. Reviews were mostly positive.Suffering his worst opening since becoming an A-list director, M. Night Shyamalan saw his latest thriller Lady in the Water struggle in its debut grossing an estimated $18.2M from 3,235 theaters. The PG-13 film about a mysterious creature from the water who must return to her world averaged $5,629 per site. The opening was less than half the size of the $50.7M bow of Shyamalan’s last film The Village and less than one-third of the $60.1M that his previous film Signs took in when it opened in 2002. Critics panned Lady which was promoted as being a \"bedtime story\" as the Oscar-nominated filmmaker earned the worst reviews of his career.Shyamalan’s last four thrillers were all released by Disney but after The Village, the studio passed on the opportunity to make Lady. The project found itself over at Warner Bros. Village opened impressively based on the brand name of Shyamalan, however negative word-of-mouth led to it crashing 68% on the second weekend and quickly disappearing soon after. In fact, its final domestic tally of $114.2M remains the lowest gross ever for any film opening north of $50M. Many former fans may have decided to pass on his follow-up which was Lady. It could be rough seas ahead for Water as well since its Saturday sales were flat compared to Friday’s. Plus, it has scored a weak B- average grade from over 3,000 users of Yahoo Movies which means ticket buyers have not been very thrilled.Universal’s hit comedy You, Me, and Dupree dropped a moderate 41% in its second weekend and placed fourth with an estimated $12.8M. With a solid $45.3M in ten days, the $54M picture should find its way to a sturdy $70-75M. Fellow sophomore comedy Little Man saw a larger drop and fell 49% to an estimated $11M for a total of $40.6M in ten days. Sony’s $64M Wayans brothers film looks to find its way to $60-65M.Fans showed support for Kevin Smith whose comedy sequel Clerks II debuted in sixth place with an estimated $9.6M from 2,150 theaters. Averaging a good $4,477 per site, the R-rated story of a pair of slackers still doing little with their lives in their thirties opened a bit weaker than Smith’s 2001 late-summer pic Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back which bowed to $11M on its way to $30.1M. Ticket sales for Clerks II fell a sharp 18% on Saturday from Friday indicating that Smith’s loyal fans rushed out on opening day and that there may not be much of an audience left for future weeks. The film earned favorable reviews and was released by MGM and The Weinstein Company.Fox saw a disappointing opening for its romantic comedy My Super Ex-Girlfriend which debuted to an estimated $8.7M from 2,702 theaters for a mild $3,220 average. The PG-13 film stars Uma Thurman as a woman who is secretly a super hero that exacts revenge on her ex-boyfriend (Luke Wilson) for dumping her. Reviews were mixed for the Ivan Reitman-directed pic. Studio research showed that the audience was split evenly between men and women with those age 25 and older making up 59% of the crowd. With so many other comedies in the marketplace from Owen Wilson, the Wayans brothers, Kevin Smith, Meryl Streep, and Adam Sandler, plus Pirates still raking it in, audiences found no special reason to spend money on Ex-Girlfriend.Superman Returns dipped 39% in its fourth flight to an estimated $7.5M and pushed its cume to $178.4M. The pricey Warner Bros. film is still ahead of the $171.9M that its last super hero film Batman Begins collected after the same amount of time. The Caped Crusader pic, however, held up better grossing $10M in its fourth frame. The $200M domestic mark still seems reachable for Superman. Overseas, the international cume climbed to $110M.Meryl Streep’s hit comedy The Devil Wears Prada enjoyed another solid hold suffering the smallest decline in the top ten. The Fox release took in an estimated $7.4M, off only 29%, to lift its sum to $97.6M. Devil opened on the same weekend as Superman Returns with a much smaller gross, but is now doing nearly identical weekend business.Disney bookended the top ten with its Pixar smash Cars which dropped 37% to an estimated $4.9M in its seventh lap. The animated hit has now grossed $229.4M putting it at number 49 on the list of all-time domestic blockbusters after X-Men: The Last Stand which opened two weeks earlier and has taken in $232.8M to date.The weekend’s four new releases tossed a quartet of summer pictures out of the top ten. Adam Sandler’s latest winner Click grossed an estimated $4M in its fifth frame, off 45%, for a total of $128.2M. The $83M Sony title should finish with $135-140M. Fellow comedy Nacho Libre with Jack Black tumbled 69% to an estimated $505,000 for a cume of $78.7M to date. Paramount looks to end its run with just under $80M.Keanu Reeves grossed an estimated $661,000 for his sci-fi toon A Scanner Darkly and an estimated $625,000 for his sci-fi romance The Lake House this weekend. Warner Independent Pictures has taken in $3.2M with Scanner and is shooting for the $5M mark. Parent company Warner Bros. has grossed $50.7M with its Sandra Bullock tale and is heading for $52M.The global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth remains a popular summer flick slipping just 14% to an estimated $1M in its ninth weekend. Paramount Vantage has collected $18.8M to date and is enjoying remarkable momentum.The top ten films grossed an estimated $138.2M which was up 12% from last year when Johnny Depp’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remained at number one for the second time with $28.3M; and up 2% from 2004 when Matt Damon‘s The Bourne Supremacy opened in the top spot with $52.5M.Author: Gitesh Pandya, www.BoxOfficeGuru.com","section":"Weekend Box Office","tags":"blockbusters, service, directors, hist, DC","poster":"https://static.rottentomatoes.com/static/images/icons/rt-blankeditorial-v1.png","slug":"Box-Office-Wrapup-Pirates-Passes-300M-Lady-Stumbles"}]
